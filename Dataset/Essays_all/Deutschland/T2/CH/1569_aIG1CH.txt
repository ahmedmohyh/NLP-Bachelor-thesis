The text is about Chevalier, who wrote a long memoir about his life and his adventures. Because this memoir is a historical source about European society, some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoir from Chevalier de Seingalt. 
One argument was that the people in Switzerland have well-living conditions. In Switzerland is huge of money, but not everybody earn a lot of this. Critics argue in the text that he would have no needed to borrow money, because he is very rich. Chevalier was very wealthy and spent a great deal of money on parties and glambing.
Anothere point is that critics complain that the memoir cannot possibly, because it was writtem many years after the conversation occured. Chevalier had make his memoir in the eighteen hundrets public. 
The last thing is that the critics have also questioned the memoirs account escape from the prison in Venice. Chevaloier had has well-connected friendas in Venice, so the account of him can escape from a notorious prison.
