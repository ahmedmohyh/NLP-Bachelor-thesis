In the following text I am going to show how different the way of views in the text and the teacher I listened to are. What is true about the facts of life of Chevalier de Seingalt? Because of having met a lot of famous people he  wrote down a memoir of his life. Not like the most memoirs that are partly not correct his memoir is accurate. But there are several people that say that it is untrue. Also right is the fact that spending money on gambling and parties was normal when he lived. As he borrowed money from a merchant it was claimed that he is a poor man. But this is false too thus he needeed it for getting so much money. Recording to the conversations to the writer Voltaire one could say that there are exact too because he wrote down what they said each night. Even the escape from Venice prison could be seen as true because of the fact that he destroyed the ceiling and the bribe was not offered by well-connected friends.
