First of all, the text claims that Chevalier was a liar because one says he only made up all those events with famous people, to become famous.  MOreover, while he lived in Switzerland he was ment to be very wealthy but also had to borrow a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. Because of that people tend to doubt of he really was that rich.  Another point is that it is said that the Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire never actually met each other since their conversations were wrote down qiute accuratley, which could not have been possible after a few years. Additionally, Chevalier said that he escaped from a prison in italy and escaped through the ceiling but one thinks that he ha well-connected friends in venice, who helped him escape. 
The audio however claims that he actually did escape that prison through the ceiling, why else would have the ceiling in his cell to be repared if he had not escaped through it? FGurthermore ot is said that Chavelier took notes and wrote journals during the time he met Voltaire and that is why he could retell the stories that well. In Switzerland Chavelier had to borrow money because he invested in a project, where it takes a bit of time for the money to get doubled or even tripled. And that is why peolple say that his memoir is a reliable source.
