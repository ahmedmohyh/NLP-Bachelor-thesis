The text about the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt describes why critics find the memoir of the Chevalier unrealistic and inaccurate, but in the speech are arguments given to prove, that the memoir of the Chevalier really is accurate and a reliable historical source.
The first argument in the text claims, that the Chevalier lied about being rich, because he borrowed money when he was in switzerland, but in the speech we're told, that the fact, that he borrowed money doesn't mean, that he couldn't have been rich, because changing money from euro to swiss money can take some time and during that time he would use borrowed money.
Another argument given in the text says that the conversation the Chevalier hold with Voltaire couldn't possibly be that accurate, because they held the conversation a long time before he wrote his memoir. In the speech on the other hand, they said, that the Chevalier kept notes from the conversation, that he used to write his memoir and that he was even seen having many notes from different conversations. 
The author of the text also told us about critics, who think, that the story of the Chevalier how he escaped prison isn't true, because it is more likely for him to have bribed the guards to free him, but in the speech we're told, that there were many prisoners that were way more powerful than the Chevailier and eventhey couldn't buy themselves free.
