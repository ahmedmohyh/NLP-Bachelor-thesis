The Chevalier de Seingalt is famous for his long, interesting and controverse memoir. He lived in the 18th Century and the Chevalier did a lot of adventures. 
Because of his memoir the Chevalier is a historical source of European society but the people who read that have the thought that these events were invented.
 
There are three controverses you can find. One has been found in Switzerland where the Chevalier should have been. In this country he has got a lot of money so he has to be very rich. But he can't borrow this so where was the money? This fact makes it unnormal that he was rich.
The second controverse is that he should converse with the famous writer Voltaire. The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote the conversations down many years later some people think. In opposite the Chevalier himself said that he writes them down every night.
The last intereting and controverse fact is that he escaped from the Venice prison in Italy. That can't be true because of the situaton that there were a lot of other powerful prisoners in it. So they would have been escaped sooner than the Chevalier but the Chevalier is not the person who has done it at first the peole ti. Also the thing which speaks against the Chevalier's memoir is that the people in the prison repaired the ceiling of his cell. 

Because of all these controverses all people who read the Chevalier de Seeingalt's Memoir don't know if you can believe in them.
