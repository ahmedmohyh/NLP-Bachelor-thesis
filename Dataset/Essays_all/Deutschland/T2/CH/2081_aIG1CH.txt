The audio I heard a second ago was about the live of the Chevalier de Seingalt who lived from 1725 to 1798. The audio speaks about the text I rad a minute before. 
The audio explain why the Chevalier had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. The Chevalier wasn't poor. He was very rich, but he spend much money for big parties and gambling and for that reason he hadn't enough money for the rest of the month. It was like a person who spend all their money for food and didn't think about how he should live the rest of the month. 
The Cevalier was very rich, so the parties he has done had to be very big and great. 
The next point the woman from the audio taled about was the friendship with Voltaire. Chevalier was a good friend of Voltaire and they met often and Chevalier wrote it down. But there are some points which aren't in his writings, but he just wrote down what he remembered. And this is a point which is different in the text. In the text they wrote, that no one doubt that Voltaire and Chevalier met and conserved.
The text also says, that Chevalier idn't escapes from the prision. They think that his jailers free him. But the woman in the audio says, that Chevalier escaped from the prision and the jailers had to repair his room, because he destroyed it in his great escape!
The two materials say some totally different things about the live of Chevalier.
