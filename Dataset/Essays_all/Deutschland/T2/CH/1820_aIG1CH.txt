Chevalier


The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life and his adventures. It became a valuable historical source on European society in the eighteenth century.
In it he writes about the time he lived in Switzerland and that he had lots of money. He was very wealthy. But in that time he also had to borrow some money from  a Swiss merchant. That is the reason why there are some critics saying did not have to borrow money. But because of the Swiss economical system he really had to.
Also he tells that about meeting and conversing with the famous writer Voltaire and about the escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. 
It seems like he really did escape because after a few weeks the sealing in his cell had to repaired and this is a reason for his memoir telling the truth.
But for everything he writes there are critics saying he is not right and he just writes something like this for enjoyable reading.
