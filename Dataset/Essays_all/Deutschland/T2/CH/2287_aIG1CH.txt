Chevalier

The Chevalier de Seingalt (1725−1798) wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. He was a controversial figure. 
Some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoir. They claim that the Chevalier distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was.
There was a accuracy of the conversations that the Chevalier records in the memoir between himself and the famous writer Voltaire.
He spenmt a lot money on partys and totally lived in wealth.
Critics have questioned the memoir’s account of the Chevalier’s escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. Although a lot of prisoners had friends who had much better contacts and who were much more meaningful than the friends of Chevalier de Seingalt, they didn´t get it to come out of prison. That was kind of wonder.
