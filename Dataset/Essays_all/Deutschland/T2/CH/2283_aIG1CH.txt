Both the text and the woman refere to the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt. They discuss about the reliability of this memoir. While the text says the memoir is not very reliable the woman thinks the memoir is pretty accurate. 
An argument for the unreliability of the memoir in the text is that the Chevalier borrowed money while living in Switzerland eventhough he writes that he was rich and spent much money on parties and gambling. On the opposite the women explains that the Chevalier was rich and invested a lot of money. But he had to wait for his money to arrive and needed to borrow money until he got this money.
On one hand he text criticised that the conversations between the Chevalier and Voltaire could not be correcte captured because the memoir was written so many years later. On the other hand the women claims that the Chevalier wrote a diary where he frequently wrote down what he could remember about the conversation and used this diary later to write his memoir.
At the end the text says the escape from the prison through the celling was unrealistic but the woman says that the ceeling needed to be replaced
