Both, the lecture and the text, deal with the Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir.The text represents the critics' opinion on the accuracy of the memoir, whereas the lecture calls it a very accurate historical source. In the text, three parts of the memoir are doubted and the lecture referres to them as well. First of all, the wealth of the Chevalier when living in Switzerland is doubted in the text due to the fact that he had to borrow money. However, the lecture explains that borrowing money doesn't mean being poor. The Chevalier spent lots of money on gambling and parties. Therefore, he had to borrow some while waiting for his new money to arrive. Furthermore, critics don't believe that the Chevalier was able to remember the exact conversation with Voltaire which took place many years before he started writing his memoir. As revealed by the lecture, the Chevalier took notes on his conversation with Voltaire and thus could use them in order to write his memoir. Another adventure of the Chevalier doubted in the text is his escape from a Venetian prison through the roof. Critics think it is more likely that some of his powerful friends simply bribed the jailers to allow his escape. When it comes to this theory the lecture doesn't agree with the text because there were other prisoners with even more powerful friends who couldn't escape through bribing. Moreover, the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired after his escape and thus his story seems accurate.
