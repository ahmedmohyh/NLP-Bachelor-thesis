In the lecture about Chevalier de Seingalt I was told that his memoir was a reliable source of history and his life. It was explained that Chevalier was in deed very wealthy when he lived in Switzerland but he still needed to borrow a lot of money, as it was mentioned in the text, because of the way he earned his money. According to the lecture Chevalier owned properties which he first had to sell in order to receive the money later and in the days he was waiting for his money he was forced to borrow some money elsewhere.

In the text it also says that critics doubt that Chevalier would've been able to remeber his conversations with Voltaire that well since it has been years since those convos and him wirting his memoir. 
But in the lecture they explain that Chevalier took notes of everything he could recall of his convos with Voltaire every night after he talked to him. Supposely there are even whitnesses that can confirm that Chevalier used those notes while wirting his memoir, which mikes it a lot more likely that his conversations with Voltaire in his memoir happended they way they are written down. 

Critics in the text also think that it's rather unlikely that Chevalier was able to break from prison by using a piece of metal. They are of the opinion that it's the most likely that Chevalier's friends, who had a lot of political influence, helped him to be released from prison.
Whereas the lecture tells that there were prisoners that had even more wealthy and powerful friends but who still weren't set free from prison which makes it unlikely that Chevalier was only because of his friends. Plus there is supposed to be evidence that the prison had to repair the ceiling of the cell in which Chevalier was imprisoned which implies that he escaped by a holw in the ceiling since it wouldn't have been necceray to reapeir the ceiling if it wasn't broken.
