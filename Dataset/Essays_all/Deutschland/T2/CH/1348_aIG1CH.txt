In the text some points of the life of the Chevalier does not fit to the points the narrator said.
In the text the author thinks that the Chevalier invented a lot of storys about parties to show his life more exciting. He wrote too, that the Chevalier was not rich as we thought today, because he borought a lot of money from merchants. The narrator of the audio said, that he have had a lot of money, even he borought some money from merchants. But to get new and more money you need some money to start new deals, thats what the narrator said. 
Another critics mean, that the story of the chevalier that took place in prison in Venice is a lie too. The source sais that the Chevalier made a hole in the ceiling of his cell to escape. The narrator sais it is true, because other sources said that the ceiling of the cell need a repair after his escape. But the text sais its another lie the Chevalier told, they think that the Chevalier bribed the watchmen in the jail to free him. 
Even the text and the audio have a different view on the chevalier, it still agreat persin in history of europe.
