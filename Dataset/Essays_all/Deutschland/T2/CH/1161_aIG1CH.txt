The talk and the text talk about a man called `the Chevalier´who wrote a memoir. This memoir is such as his person controversial discussed. Critics say for example that he borrowed a lot of money from an swiss merchant and they think as a consequence of that that he was poor even though he pretends to be wealthy. But in the talk it was mentionned that he spent a huge amount of money on parties etc. and had to wait for his salary. Because of that he needed to borrow some money, but he still was wealthy. The next critic was that his memoir is not precise, but the lady in the talk said that it may be not correct but pretty accurate and just as it is mentionned in the text a valuable source about European society. At last, critics say that the conversations and the relation to Voltaire is not possible or accurate put down in his memoir. The talks handles this theme by saying that the Chevalier took precise notes from what he remembered of the conversations to write it down as accurate as possible. All in all the talk tries to show the value of the memoir and that the things which are wrote down are right. The text however emphasizes the critics and the doubts of the value of this memoir.
