The presentation I just heard was referring to the text above. It was basicly countering every conspiracy argument from the text. The presentation was structured in three main parts. The first part was the question, why the chavalier needed to borrow money. The second part was about his relationship with the famous writer Voltaire. The last part was about the spectacular escape from prison in Venice. The opinion from the presentantion is, that the memoirs from the Chavalier are accurate and reliable. 
The first counter argument towards the text was, that the Chavalier could definetly have been very wealthy. Him beeing wealthy doesn´t mean he had a lot money in the bank, it could mean that he had his money spent in house or what so ever. That gives evidence that he was wealthy, but did notbhave a lot money in his bank account.
The second argument was about his conversations with Voltaire, and how accurate they have been described in his memoirs. Familiy members and friends from that time often talked about the Chavalier writing notes about everything and everyone. Relating that to the questionable conversations, it makes sense that they happened as described in the memoirs.
The last argument consistet out of two facts. The first one is that there were other inmates which had more powerful friends outside the prison then him, and they did not get out. The second one is that there is evidence that the roof of his cell had been repaired which could be showing that he escaped.
