The text given and the audio are about Chevalier de Seingalt who lived from 1725 until 1798 and wrote a memoir about his life. This memoir is a relatable historical source but critics are not sure if this memoir is as relatable as it is presented. In the audio is said that the source is still reliable and the arguments against it from the text are replaced with their direct arguments against them.
In the text is mentioned that in the memoir he wrote that while he was living in Switzerland he should have been wealthy but the critics  won't belive it because he had to borrow money. In the audio it is said that this fact wouldn't show that he wasn't rich and that he had to borrow money just because he had to wait for his own money to come.
 Another critic mentioned in the text is that the accuracy of the conversation betweeteten him and Voltaire is not that accurate because he wrote about it some years later. The woman in the audio says that this argument is not correct because he wrote down everything he remembered right after the conversation so he had a piece of paper with the correct conversation parts next to him while writing his memoir.
The critics from the text also don't believe that he escaped out of prison with a piece of metal to grab a whole. In the audio is said that the prison had to repair his ceiling and that's why the woman says that he has to be escaped because why should they repair the ceiling without a reason.
