Chevalier de Seingalt was a kind of adventurer in europe and lived from 1725 to 1798. In his memoirs he describes a lot of his adventures but many critics doubt that these really occured the way they are written down.These critics claim that Chevalier lied to make his life seem more exciting than it really was.
When Chevalier was in Switzerland he was very rich and spent a huge amount of money on parties and gambling. Critics say that he wasn't rich because reliable sources show us that he had to borrow a lot of money. Today we know that he only borrowed this money because he ran out of cash and it took some time until he got paid. So he borrowed money and paid it back later.
In his memoirs Chevbalier talks about his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire in every detail. People now doubt that he could remember every conversation that he once had but the truth is that he wrote down everything he could remember about the conversation as soon as he could. He kept these notes and journals for years.
Critics also think that it is a lie that Chevalier escaped from a prison in Venice through the ceiling and say that his friends with a high political status helped him escape. But there were prisoners in this prison that had friends with way more political influence and they still remained in prison. Also documents from the prison tell us that after Chevalier escaped the ceiling had to be repaired. And why should the ceiling be repaired  if Chevalier didn't destroy it to escape?
Whether the events described by Chevalier really happened or not he still is a reliable source about European society.
