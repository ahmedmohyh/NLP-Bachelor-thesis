The Cheevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) wrote a memoir about his life, where some people would disagree with the three sorys, which are in it. The first story teels, that the Chevalier was pretty poor and had no money. He spent a lot of money for example into party and gambling. He also borrowed some money of a Swiss merchant. The second story of the memoir of the Chevalier is about a conversation between him and a famous writer named Voltaire. The problem about it is, that no one realldy thinks, that this conversation ever happened, because exöerts think that it is immpossible, to remamber whole phrases out of a conversation. But actually it is also told, that he just did an wrong writing. The last story is about a prison escape. It is told in the memoir, that the Chandelier escapes withoout any help and just a piece of metal out of the Venetion prison. But some critics say, that he actually got some help from outside, how the other prisoners told. He would have some politically friends in Venice, who could have freed him out of it. But still there are some hints, which make the story more real. It is told, that there were more powerful prisoners in the prison, in point of that it would'nt make much sense, that only he got freed. Also a bit later his prison has been repaired.
