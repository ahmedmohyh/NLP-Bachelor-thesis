Chevalier was a men who met many famous people. About this meetings and his whole life his memoires are about. But there are some rumours, that say, that not all of his stories are real und really happend like he explaines. 

One thing, is that he said he was rich, but in Switzerland he borrowed some money and the text said, that wealthy people don´t borrow money. But the speaker said that Chevalier was really wealthy, but he spent lots of his money, and he hadn´t got all his money and his not cheap stuff with him. So when he spent all of the money, he had with him, he had to wait for his money, but he didn´t want to wait long, so he borrowed some money and that doesn´t mean, that he wasn´t rich.

Another critic is about the meetings with Voltaire. The critics say, that a conversaiton can´t be exactly written down after years, like it was in this case. He made notes after the talks, is the explanation. 

The other story, that is maybe a lie, is his story about his prison escape. He wrote, that he escaped prison on his own through a hole in the ceiling by using a piece of metal. Critcs say, that this can´t be true. They think, that the jailers let him free, because he had powerful friends. But other prisoners had also powerful friends and another point is, that they had to repare his ceiling after him.
