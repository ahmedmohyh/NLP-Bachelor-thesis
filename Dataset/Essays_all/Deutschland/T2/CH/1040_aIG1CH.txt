The lecture is about the Chevalier de Seingalt, who wrote a memoir, which was so detailed and exciting, that some people doubt its correctness using certain arguments. The lecture opposes this view and gives arguments for the critics being wrong. 
The first point that is criticised is that the Chevalier stated to be very wealthy, but still borrowed money. In the lecture, this argument is proved wrong by saying that his wealth mostly was in property. So, to get money, he had to sell something, but as that is not done in a day, he had to borrow money in the gap between the money being spend on parties and something to be sold to get more money.
Another critic is, that the conversations between him and Voltaire are very detailed, in a way he would never been able to remember them. But, according to the lecture, he actually made notes each day about their conversation and used them as well as journals he wrote during his life when writing his memoir.
Also, his prison break from a prison in Venice is said to be made more spectacular than it really was to make the memoir to be more exciting. They say someone was bribed to free him from the prison, but, as the lecture states, nobody else ever managed to break free by bribing someone, so that would be highly unlikely. Instead, as the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after he broke free, the lecture claims, that the story in the memoir, saying he escaped from a hole he made into the ceiling, would have to be true.
