The lecture and the text say both something of the Chevalier de Seingalt, who live between 1725 and 1798, but they have different presentations of his memoir.
On the one hand are the lecture, which found the memoir as a good thing. They says the same topics lice the text including the financiall situation, the conversations with other famous people and the escape from a prison in Italy,  but the lecture provite the memoir and say it can be happend like Chevalier has written.
On the other hand we have the text, which is very critical with the truth of the memoir. They critic the behaivior from Chevalier with the money and say that he couldn't remember the conversation as they really was, because it took place years ago. Also their ask behind the story of the prison, because it could also happend that he only gets free by an jailer and not as a result of escape.
Finally you could say that the lecture gets the story from Chevalier for truth and the text not.
