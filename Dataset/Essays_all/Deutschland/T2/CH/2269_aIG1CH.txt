Like the speaker said, no memoire can be totaly correct. So there are different opinions about how reliable the memoires of the Chevalier are.

 The speaker told us about the time, the Chevalier was in Switzerland. At this time of his life it was said, that he was very rich and spend a lot of money on parties and gambling. He had properties and other things there he selled. As a result he gained an extreme amount of money, which just took a bit of time to get delivered to him. That could be a reason for money he had to borrow from a Swiss merchant. 

 Another fact, the speaker talked about are the conversations he had with Voltaire. Critics complain about the reliability of those texts, because he wrote his memoires many years after the conversations took place. So critics believe, that they cannot be fully correct. But the speaker argued, that there are reliable sources, which show that the Chevalier documented every conversation he had with Voltaire directly after their meeting. Also he kept these notices until he wrote his memoires in the late 19 hundreds.

 The last point, that was talked about is the great escape from a notorious prison in Venice. Cristics think that there is a controversial in his memoires. In his memoires he said, that he escaped with the help of a small piece of metal, which granted him the escape from the selaing and gave him access to the roof, from which he flew. Critics have the opinion, that he has not started a try to escape, but was released, because of his politically well-connected friends in Venice. But the speaker said that there is a document, which shows that after his escape a sealing had to be repaired, which could be an evidence for the escape of the Chevalier. Also there were many other persons in the prison, who had a lo of powerful friends outside in Venice and they have not been released ether.
