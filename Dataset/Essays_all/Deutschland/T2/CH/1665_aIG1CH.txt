Has everything happened that the Chevalier wrote? 
During a lecture, they discusssed how accurate the words that he said. The woman told that there cannot be correction of every part of what he said or what has happened.
There were three imporant topics. The first one, if he was poor, the second one was the conversation with Voltaire and the last one was the escape from the prison in Venice, Italy.
The woman said, that he was not poor, actually he sold his valuable things to get some money. She also said, that the Chevalier wrote all the time everything really accurate, so the conversation with Voltaire really happened and it is possible to memorize everything also after some years, it could have happened that at first he worte down everything for himself and then some years later he wrote down his notes again for us and for the later generation .
The last argument was the ascape from the prison in Venice, Italy, his celiling was repaired after some years , if he really escaped he had to disturb some part of the celiling to get out, so it needed to be repaired.
The arguments of the critics are in contrast with the arguments of the woman, she protected the Chevalier und the happenings that he wrote down, on the other side the critics claim the opposite of it.
