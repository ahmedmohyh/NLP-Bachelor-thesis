In the lecture there are named arguments that show that every critic from the text is not true.
The memoir of the Chevalier is a very criticised on. The Chevalier seemed to be a wealthy man but it is a fact that the Chevalier had to borrow money to pay for all his big parties. The woman from the lecture explains that it was totally normal to borrow money. The Chandelier had to spend money first to earn some and he sometimes had to wait for his money to arrive so that he borrowed some in the meanwhile. 
Another criticised point is the fact that the Chandelier quoted from conversations with Voltaire although he wrote his memoirs many years after the conversations took place and critics say that it is impossible to remember the exact words from a conversation so many years later. In the lecture is said that it is possible that the quoted phrases were said exactly lika that because the Chandelier made notes during all his conversations with Voltaire so that he could look up the exact words even years later.
Once the Chandelier was in a prison in Venice. In his memoir he wrote that he escaped by making a hole in the ceiling. This is nonsense say the critics. He had many famous and rich friends that could help him to escape. The lecture gives us a hint that the curious story of the escape is true. There were many other people in this prison with even more famous and richer friends than the ones of the Chandelier and this people didn´t get out with their help either. Plus the ceiling of the cell of the Chandelier had to be fixed after his escape. So it is easy to think that he destroyed it for his escape.
