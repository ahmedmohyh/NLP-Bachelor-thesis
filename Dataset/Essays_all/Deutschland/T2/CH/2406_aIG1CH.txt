Both the text and the audio data talked about three facts abot the Chevalier. The text states three critics and the audio data tries to support the righteousness of these facts. Firstly, the critics say that the Chevalier did not tell the truth about his wealth and was even in need to borrow money. But the audio data claims that the Chevalier had to change this wealth in form of money which took some time and made him wait for his money to arrive. 
Secoundly, the critics believe that the Chevaliers memoir does not have the ability to capture his conversations with Voiltaire because it was written years after Chevaliers coversations with Voltaire. But the audio data explains this by saying that Cheavlier kept his notes about his coversations for years to himself which is the reason why they have been revealed this late.
Thirdly, the text criticise the fact that Chevalier escaped the Venetian prision without any help from others, they believe he was bribed free because of his connections. But the audio data fights back by claiming that others in prision had more powerful friends than him and an old government documents says his sealing had to be repaired, which proves the possibility of him freeing himself with a metal piece.
