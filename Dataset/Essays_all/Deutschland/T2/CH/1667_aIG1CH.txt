Even though there are people critizising Chevalier's memoirs, there is some evidence for the accuracy of them.
The first claim was, that the money he wrote he had, really was borrowed. But in reality he had money in property he had first to sell, to than have the money. But the process of selling takes time and in that time he borrowed the money from the Swiss merchant. So he really was rich.
The next point to be talked about are his conversations between him and Voltaire. He wrote them down years after they had them. But is is proved that he wrote down notes during and after the conversations keeping them for years after and using them to write his memoir. 
And than there is his escape from the prison in Italy. There are documents proving, that the seeling, he claimed he made a hole into, was repaired shortly after his escape. Also it is not quite likely he had friends that helped him to get out. Since there were other prisoners with even more powerfull friends, not being able to escape.
