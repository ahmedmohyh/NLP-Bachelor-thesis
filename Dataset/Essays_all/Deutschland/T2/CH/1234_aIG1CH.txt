In the presentation there were interesting points said. At first the woman told the audience that no memoire is very accurate but that the one of the Chevalier is one of the most accurate there is. 
Then she talked about his situation in Switzerland where he claimed to be rich even though other sources found out that he had to borrow money. But the presenter thinks that the borrowing-money times were his first in Switzerland. He borrowed money to invest and gain more back. Then after the succesful investments he was finally wealthy. The opinion about the conversation with Voltaire is that he never said it was the original conversation but everything he could remember. He also must have written down notes after the speaking. Also important is the prison escape. The text says that Chevalier must have bribed some of the guards or used his connections with his well-seen friends in Venice but the presenter says that there were many other prisoners with way better connected friends than Chavalier and they stayed in prison. Also after his escape the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired.
