The arguments in the text are, that the Chevalier was a really important character. He was poor and escaped from a prison. He also should be a controversial figure because he was not always friendly. He lived a glamour life. but he  often was also a rober and a bad man. He borrowed money although he wount needed.He was a loverboy. 
But all his memoires there written after his life. Nobody know if he was real or not.
 The text in the audio was not so intusiastic. They said, that all the information wount have to be correct because they were written so late. They also said, that the chevailier was not a poor man. He was an rich man who woun't want to live the life of a rich man. They also said, that the conversation with voltaire was wrong because they can't lived at the same lifetime. voltaire was much older than the chevalier. They also said, that the prisonescape couldn't be right because the chevailiere had no friends wich could helped himm. The other prisoners were much more strong and had more friends to help. So, he can't be escaped out of the Venetian prison. 

All in  all are the arguments in both texts really different. The second text said the compleedly opposite of the first text. I think the second text is more realistic because it had much more good arguments.
