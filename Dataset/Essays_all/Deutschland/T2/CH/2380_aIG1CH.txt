The first argument against the accuracy of the momoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt is that he had borrowed money although  he was a wealthy man. Otherwise the woman on the audio said that maybe he just waited for his big amount of money to arrive and had therefor to borrow some elsewhere.
The second argument was that the conversation between him and Voiltare have been written years after the conversation had taken place, so its accuracy can't be good. The woman's argument against it was that the Chevalier took al lot of notes while or after his conversations, so he had still the right informations for his memoir.
The third argument was that it is very unlikely that the Chevalier made a hole in the ceiling and escaped that way, more probably he had connections to people which may have offered a bribe. But in the audio was said that the ceiling had to be repaired after his escape, so probably he did it this way.
