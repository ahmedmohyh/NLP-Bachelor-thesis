In the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725−1798) are three points that critics complain about saying they are false and only happend in his imagination. In the presentation on the other hand the woman is saying that the incidents have happend and explains why. 

The first point made in the text is that the Chevalier had to borrow money while living in Switzerland even though he claimed to have a lot a of money. The woman holding the presentation argues that he had to wait for his money to be deliverd which does not mean that he did not have enough.

Another point doubted by critics are his conversations with Votaire. The text explains that in his memoir the conversations are written down in a very specific way even though his memoir was written several year after their conversations. The woman holding the presentation explains that Chevalier was known to make notes of conversatation and to have several journals which proves to her that the conversations are acuret. 

The last point is about his escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. In his memoirs he writes that he escaped by making a hole in the ceiling and climing through the roof. Critics argue that he had very well-connected friends that could have  bribed the jailers to free him. The woman in the presatation does not agree with that statement because there were a lot of prisoners that were way nbetter connected than him who were not freed. Also the ceiling had to be renewed after his escape.
