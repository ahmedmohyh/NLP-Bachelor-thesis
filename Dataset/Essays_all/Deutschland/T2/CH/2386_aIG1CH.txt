Text and audio both retell the story of the Cevalier in different ways. Nearly every statement made in the text is declared untrue by the speaker. It said the he had not to borrow money for poverty reasons but because he was waiting for the money he gained in his business. During this period of waiting he naturally had to borrow money to make himself a living.In the text it is said that he would not have needed to borrow money if he really had been very rich. They also said that he recorded his conversations with Voltaire beforehand and just wrote them down in a complete version later. This way it was possible for him to remeber everything in this exact manner.This is stated as a lie in the text, for they say he just made things up. As to the last narrative, the audio said he actually broke free from prison out of his own strength. This is doubted in the text, it said he used some influencial friends from outside to get free. This argumend is to be doubted also by the record, for it says that other prisoners had even more connections than the Chevalier and did not get free. Another argumend in the record is that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired immediately after his escape, a cirumstance that also counts for the version of his escape without any help.
