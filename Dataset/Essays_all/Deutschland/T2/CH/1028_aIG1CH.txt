The Chevalier de Seingalt's memoirs are not accurate. At least that is what critics say. Others however state that many inconveniences have a rather logical explanation, so which side is right?
During the time he lived in Switzerland the Chevalier(C.) stated, that he was very wealthy and spend lots of money on gambling and parties. But it happened once3,, that he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. Why would he do that, if he were wealthy, as he said?
The answer, to this is that he might not have had money, but rather expensive items in his possession. It took obviouly some time to sell one of these and get money out of it. So he might have just borrowed money, because he ran out of cash, not fortune.
The very detailed dialogues betwenn him and Voltaire are also seen as proof, that he is a cheater. How could he possibly remember complex dialogues, he had years ago?
Surprisingly there is an answer to that aswell. It is stated by many that met him, that he used to take notes or write in a journal to remember happenings. C. even stated himself, that he wrote every evening what he could remember of his discussions with Voiltaire. And he used these notes for the writing of his memoires, which makes  them more likely to be accurate.
And finally C. prison escape through the cealing, as he depicted it. MAny critics think, he just made it up for storytelling purposes and just got out by bribing the guards, as he had very powerful friends in the area where the prison was located (Venice). 
But even for that is an alternative explanation. Because other inhabitants of that prison had even more powerful firends, than he did and didn't get out. So bribery seems kind of not logical. And onlay short after his escape the cealing of the very cell he was imprisoned in had to be renewed. Why would this happen, if not because he broke it open for his escape?
