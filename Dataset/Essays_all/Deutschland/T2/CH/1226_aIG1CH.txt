While the essay descibe the opinion of the critics, the presentaion which I heard point out that some facts said in the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt can still be right although some wittnesses had other evidences.
First in the memoir it says that Chevalier was a very wealthy person while living in Switzerland. In the essay the opinon of critic is represented which claim that he wouldn't need to borrrow money if he is a wealthy person. The women respond to this that it is possible, because the celebrations were very big and you could lost much money, so if it is at the beginning of the month you can run out of money which includes consequentely that you have to borrow some.
Also the woman says that the fact that the ceiling had to be repaired after the breakout is the evidence that Chevalier done the work alone and not with the help of some friends as it sayed in the essay.
Third the essay described critics who say that the meeting of Voltaire and Chevalier can't be written down with the accurate because it was written down years later. The woman explain that Chevalier always took notes hours later.
