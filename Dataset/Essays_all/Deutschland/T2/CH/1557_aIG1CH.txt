The speech and the text are about the Chevalier de Seingalt. He was a citizen, who wrote a memoir about his life. He wrote, that he met many famous people. Because of the famous people his memoires becomes a valuable historical source. The Chaliver spens much money for parties and other things like that, so has to borrow money very often. But he was very wealth, while he lives in the Switzerland. So he wants to make his life glamorous than it was. So he gets much critics from other peoples.
These points are on the one hand in the speech an on the second hand in the text. So the sources say the same.
