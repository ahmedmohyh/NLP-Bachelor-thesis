the woman says that most of the critics that are mentioned in the text are wrong. She says that it's right that nobody can remembered everything which stands in this memoir but that doesn't mean that he lied. 
In the text stands that he has to borrow lots of money from a swiss merchant and critics think that's a sign for that he was poor. 
the woman says that this is wrong. It's right that he had to borrow that money but not because he was poor. He invented to lots of parties and lived with a really high niveau. He had that money but it took some time til the money arrived. 
Critics says also in this text that the conversations between Voltaire and him can't be real because it wouldn't be sure if they really met and if they met Chevalier wouldn't can remember the conversations.
The woman explains that Chevalier wrote down what they talked about each night and he took these notes to write the conversation down. 
She also says that it's true that Chevalier escaped from that prison. Other prisoners had more important friends than Chevalier and the jailers didn't want that everyone believed him so they restaurated the room.
