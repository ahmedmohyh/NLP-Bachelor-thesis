The text I jus heart was about a person called the Chevalier who is someone who claimed to have seen the whole world and this in the 18th centuty. The person who spoke seemed to be a women and she told about facts that make true what the chevalier said about his life. The first example was, that he had lived in swiss and lived a good life over there becasuse he was a gambler. Infact it is shown that he had to borrow money from the swiss bank to play. Crtics would say that he was liar but the women says, that he had to sell stuff and that the money would not be poor if he had to geet money paid out from the bank. The other arguemnt was, that he didnt brake out a prison in venice, because that is too difficult. He actually jsut lied. but the women now says that in old documents the cell of the chevalier had to be repaired after he escaped. so he probably did not lie.
