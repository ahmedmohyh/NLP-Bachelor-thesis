The following text compares the text about the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt with the listening part about the same theme.
The text and the listening part are fitting together very well because they are naming the same themes from the memoir and the listening part tries the critics to understand another view. The listening part had three parts that had the same themes as the parts of the text.
So the first part started with the fact that a memoir can not be totally right because there may be things that can be forgotten through the time but the memoir of the Chevalier is really good the listening part says. The fact that he borrowed some money in Switzerland does not make him poor as it says in the text. The listening part says because it is proofe that he spent a lot of money there and he may have borrowed the money because he had to wait for his money arriving in Siwtzerland. 
The second part was about the conversation between the Chevalier and the Voltaire. In the text it says that this must be a kind of fake because you are not able to remember the exact phrases of a conversation many years ago. But in the listening part it says that the Chevalier wrote down the conversation so he just had a look at his notes at the moment he wanted to write something about this conversation.
The last part wanted to show that his escape from the prison might have been in the way he wrote it down because after he escaped from the prison the Italians had to fix the ceiling of the prison. 
All in all the listening part wants the critics from the written part to know that you have to be well informed before you start criticing and that the memoir is not as bad as they try the world to know.
