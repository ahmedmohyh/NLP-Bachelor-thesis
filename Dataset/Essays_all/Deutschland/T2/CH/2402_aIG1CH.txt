The first argument is that Chevalier had to claim his own money, so it took a bit longer for him to get it. That´s the reason why he had to borrow money.But you can´t tell that he is poor just because he had to wait longer.      The second argument is that he wrote down everything he remembered after his conversations with Voltaire. So he could know even some years later what the other famous writer sayed. 
The third argument is that other prisoners had more powerfull friends than Chevalier, but they can´t got out of the prison. And the prison had to repair Chevaliers cell exactly as he told in his memoir.
