At the end of the life of Chevalier, he wrote a long memoir about his life and his adventures. About the meetings with powerful and historical figures. On the one hand for example he wrote about the conversation between him an a famous writer Voltair. On the other hand, he wrote about his wealthy life in Switzerland. Also he was invited by a prison break. He wrote that he used a piece of metal to came free. He made big party's and spent a lot of money for glamour. With this memoir he got a lot of criticers, who don't believe the storys about his life. They say that Chevalier invited the events to make his life excited.
The arguments by the teacher are not against Chevaliers storys, she want to show the kids, that the chevalier didn't lie. For example with the big partys. The criticers says that he wasn't a rich man. He has to borrow money. The argument by the theacher was that the man was a middlestanding man in Switzerland, who has to borrow money. And with this money he could make the partys. 
The other one was about the prison. She said that he was in the prison with other man, whoe were powerfully than himself. They planed the break and Chevailer was only one of the group. His cell was preperated so he only has to take the matal to came free so the story is true. 
All in all not every event was exactly like the events in the memoir of Chevailer but the ground of the storys are corrrect.
