In the just heared extract of the lecture the speaker diagrees with the critics from the text. For each questioned adventure of Chevaliers memoir a valid explanation is given.

The first story was about him being rich in Switzerland while there is evidence that he borrowed money from a merchant. The explanation given in the lecture is, that he just sold his huge property. Such a process needs time and while waiting for the money to arrive, he then had to borrow money. He was still rich, he just hab no access to his money at this point in time.

There were also critics about the fact, that he has written down sentences from a conversation with Voltaire that was years in the past and that he could not possibly remember the exact words. In the lecture it is being said that Chevalier regulary made notes and then consulted them for writing his memoir. Therefore it could be possible that he just wrote down parts of the conversation later that night or in the following days.

His dramatic escape from a prison in Venice through the ceiling could also be true. There is record in the townhall that after his escape, said ceiling had to be replaced. While critics claim that he had powerfull friends in Venice who could have helped him, there is also evidence about even more invluential people in the same prison that time who weren't able to get out.
