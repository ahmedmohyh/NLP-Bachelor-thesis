Chevalier de Seingalt lived between 1725 and 1798. He was a author and wrote down his adventures and storys of his life. He met many famous people like writers and kings. The auther of the text write about that Chevalier lied sometimes about his life to make his life more exciting. So he wrote that he lifed in Swizerland and had much of money. He celebrated many partys and was very rich. In the text also tell that he was in prison in Italy and he cant escape of it. But in the listenig it said that he came free of it. 
Another story is that he was the best friend of Voltaire in the eighteen century. They talked about girls and drink together a few glass of the best italian wine. Maybe it was the wine from the grandmother of Voltair. So on they played a little bit Poker and so the Chevalier de Seingalt drunk a little biot to much,but the natur and the beautiful italian view to the Mediteran sea was the best of the world and without a reason his best friend Voltaire was not longer his best friend and he called the police, so he go to the police beause he hadnt a phone, and said to the policemen that Chevalier was not fair in the pokergame and he played to money.
That is maybe the story how he come to prison.
If he was out of the prison, no one knwos how, he hated Voltaire so much that he killed his lovely cat. But he loved his cat and Chevalier knew that.
