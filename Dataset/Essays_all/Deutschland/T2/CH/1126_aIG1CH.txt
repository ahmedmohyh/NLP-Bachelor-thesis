The following text compares arguments which are said in the text with arguments spoken in an audio. 
The main theme or more likely said the person that both sources talk about is Chevalier de Seingalt. Toward the end of his life he published a memoir recointing his life and adventures. Since he met many famous people his memoir has become a ´´valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century``. Not everyone believed his stories, but there are also critics. They claim that invented some events, which he talks about in his memoir, simply to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous. The first example given is about Chevaliers time in Switzerland. In his memoir Chevalier claimed that he was very wealthy as well as it was known that he spent a lot of money there on parties and gambling. But as evidence shows Chavelier borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. On the other hand is said in the audio that he simply ran out of cash. Another exmaple is that he rembered quotes from conversations with Voltaire. As critics claim one can`t remember exactly what someone said years ago. But in the audio it is said that Chevalier actually took notes from these conversations. Third at last example is about his escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. In the text it is said that ``he claims to have escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof``. Critics are convinced that this is simply to make the reader enjoy the story about his escape more. They also claim that it is ``more likely that the Chevalier´s  jailers  were bribed to free him``. In the audio it is mentioned that there is evidence from the government and that the ceiling had to be repaired.
To conclude one can say that both sources seem to be part of a discussion. The text is more focused on the crtics while the audio is focused on evience proofing the critics wrong.
