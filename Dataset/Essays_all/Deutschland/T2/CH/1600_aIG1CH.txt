The text was about the Chevalier. It is said in the text he is poor but in the audio they said he just needed to wait for the money. He planned and did many parties during his time in Switzerland. Before the parties he needed to get cash because of paying all the food and everything else you need for parties.So there are big differences between the audio and the text.  The text says he can not be rich if he had to borrow money but the audio tells us that even rich people can not pay everything before they get their money.
Furthermore in the text is written he could not have remembered everything what happened years ago but in the audio they said he was able and there are evidences. Even for the escape from the prison in Venice there are documents on which you can find it is the thruth.These are real evidences. So there is a reliable source.
Making a memoir recounting a life more interesting than it has been is normal for beeing famous. The author of the text says it is not okay and you  can not really differnciate between what is true and not true. But this is just said about the parties and the audio tells us it is true that he organized many parties and went on a lot of parties.
