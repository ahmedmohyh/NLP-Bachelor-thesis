The audio tries to explain the doubts about the accuracy, and show that there is for everything a solution. the woman got three points, if he was wealthy or poor, how he escaped the prison and the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire. She explained, that maybe not everything seems to be true, but it could be. In Switzerland he was wealthy, he spend most of all of his money and need to borrow some but that doesn't mean that he was poor. Also his escape could be through the ceiling, after this the prison has to renew the ceiling. and there is no other reason why they should do this. Also the dialoge with voltaire could be like this, eyewithnesses could see him taking notes, so he could write it after some years even correct.
The Text shows us the critics against his memoir. It says that he couldnt be very wealthy, because he borrowed money, that Chevalier couldnt capture the conversation with Voltaire after so many years correctly and that the escape should us only enjoy reading his memoir.
