The Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) wrote a memoir recounting his life and adventures, but some critics have raised that the Chevalier distorted or invented many events to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous. Some people do not believe that he was really rich because he borrowed some money when he was in Switzerland. Critics also mention that the Chevalier records a conversation between himself and the famous writer Voltaire years after the meeting took place and that it is not possible to remember exact phrases from this conversation. Another point is that critics do not believe his escape from a prison in Venice. In their opinion his politically well-connected friends helped him to get free. But the ones who believe in the Chevalier argue that his memoir is correct because he just had to borrow money while he waited for his money and he took notes right after the conversation with Voltaire so that he could remember the exact conversation. They also believe that he really escaped from the prion because there were other people in prison who had much more politically well-connected friends, but they were still in prison when he became free.
