The presentation about "the Chevalier" is much more diefferent than the text. Both works have other arguments for the memoirs of the Chevalier and they describe him in a very different way. 
The text is very critical and it shows that the memoirs are full of lies and things which didn't happened in the past but the presentation claims the Chevalier as a important person who is a very needful source about the European dociety in the eighteenth century.
The text mentions that he had to borrow some money eventhough he had claimed in his memoirs that he is a rich man but the presentation explains that he did that because he was wealthy and wanted to help someine else to borrow money.
The second point which is shown in both works is the conversations with Voltaire. On the one hand the text says that they can't be real because they were so long ago so it was impossible to recognize everything they talked about. But on the other hand the presentation explains the situation that the Chevalier wrote down everything to remember each part of the conversations.
Another argument is the escape from the notorious prison in Venice, Italy, which the Chevalier told about in his memoirs and even about this point the presentation and the text say something different.
So to sum up it is very interesting to see how different works can tell a different story about the same person/issue. The both works show that you should always read more than one source to test what is told in different works. The check will make your presentations and also your text better because you'll be sure about what you write so you'll be able to write like an expert.
