So the Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798 and had a glamour lifestyle. So that is what the listining Part said. But in the the text there is another meaning about this. The writer wrote that the Chevalier only borrowed money for his big partys and not even had so much money. And there comes the listining one where the speaker said that he just waited for his money to arrive and for the time the money was on his way he had to borrow money and then he gave it back when is owne had arived.Also there is a big controvercial about the memoir about his life and adventures that he wrote down in it. So there also is an interview where he is talking to a very famous people and the text sais that it is a fake one but the women from the listening said that is a real one written down by notes from the day the interview had taken place. So the last disagreement from both sides is the thing with the prison. While the text sais that he just escaped because of his good connections to politically well-connected friends and they could offered a bribe, the listining part mean that he escaped by a whole in his prisoncell. But at the end we do not know exactly which story is true and which is false.
