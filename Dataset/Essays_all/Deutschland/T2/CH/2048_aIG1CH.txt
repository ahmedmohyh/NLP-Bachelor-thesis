In the following i will show how the relation between the essay and the lecture.

They both talk about Chevalier and wether or not his memoirs where historicly acurate.
The texts sais that Chevalier lied about his wealthy conditions in Switzerland because he borrowed considerable amounts of money from a Swiss merchant. In regard to this the lecture tells us that he hat to borrow this money, because he invested is wealth into houses, wich he could not sell that quickly and therefor had to borrow money from time to time.

The text also critics the accuracy of Chevaliers conversations with Voltaire because we published them a few years later. In the lecture we find out that he wrote these conversations right after they spoke.

His escape from prison is also a controversial point between the two text. While the text sais that his powerfull friend bailid him out, the lecture tells us that there were other prisoners with fare more powerfull friends that didn't got bailed out. The lecture defands Chevaliers story of braking out through the roof by talking about an old document in which the repairment of his cell ceeling is orderd.

In conclusion these two text talk about the same topic but one defends Chevalier and the other critics him.
