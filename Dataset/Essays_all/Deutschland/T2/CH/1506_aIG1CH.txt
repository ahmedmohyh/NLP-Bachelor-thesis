The speach was about the Chevalier. It was said that he was not poor. He wrote down many conversations with famous peolpe he can remember. In his middel age he achiefed it to escape out of a prision just with a small peace metall and without powerfull frieds which could helped him. Now his celling is reconstructed. 

The audio said some different points in the text menschend:
In tghe text is criticises that he don´t has to borrow monney if he was really rich. It was said in the audio that he wrote down many conversations and knowone criticised this these. In the written part ist critic about the accuracy of his conversations because it was years lather than the real conversation took place. 
It is also in the text questioned if the prison brake ist really made with a pece metall. The speech said sthat he had not powerful friends outside the could help hin but the text showed us that he had politically well-connected frieds in Venice. They could have offered a bribe.

All in all the text and the audio said in the whole the same but if you look detailed you can see some different points which criticises if he was trustful in his written conversations and stories.
