In the following text I will summarize the given arguments and explain the connection between them and the arguments which are stated in the text above.
Both say that the memoirs of Chevalier are "pretty accurate" and a "reliable source about European society in the eighteenth century". However there are some critics that raised doubts about that. The first arguments of the critics is that Chevalier stated to be rich. They point out that in Switzerland he needed to borrow some money. He was not poor, he only spent huge amounts of money and ran out of it. Finally Chevalier had to borrow more cash to live this lifestyle even longer.
Another argument the critics point is the "accuracy" of the conversatiosn between him and Voltaire. He simply could not remember the exact phrases they spoke to each other. These conversations are confirmed by many people of that time. Chevalier wrote the conversations down and kept those notes for a long time.
The last argument is that Chevalier did not escape the prison in Venice. He had some "politically well-connected friends" which helped him to get out of jail. But they had to repair the ceiling óf his cell and why would they have to do it when he did not escape by himself?
