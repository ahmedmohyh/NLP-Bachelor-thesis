In the audio file the reasons for the inaccuracy of the Chevaliers Memoirs are discussed. There are several facts that support the Chevalier's memoirs. For example did critics claim, he hasn't had any wealth in swiss, because the money was lent. But in fact there was a Property of some type that he had sold and just had to wait for his payment.
Another point critics mention is, that none of the Chevalier's conversations with Voltaire could be accurate due to the fact that they were written down a few years later. People on the other side claim, that the Chevalier already wrote them down shortly after having had the conversations.
Probably one of the most exciting events in his memoirs is also regarded as fake and this one is him busting out of prison in Venice. Critics think that he only offered a bribe to his guards in order to get out and later on changed it to breaking out for a more exciting story. This seems unlikely because there were other prisoners who were more powerful than he was and didn't bribe their guards. Even more, there are documents that proof his cell had to be repaired shortly after he had gotten out.
