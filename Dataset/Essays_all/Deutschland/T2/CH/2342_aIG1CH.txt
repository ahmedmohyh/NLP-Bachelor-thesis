The text and the speach are both about Chevalier de Seingalt and about his memoir. While the text talks about the accuracy of the memoir, the speach shows that his stories and expieriences can be real. The text tells us, that Cevalier was very rich, so he wouldn´t need to borrow money, but the speach tought us, that he had to borrow money while he was waiting for his own money to arrive. Another example for the differences between the text and the speach is, that the text says, that Chevalier has chanced the story about his conversations with Voltaire, because he wrote about it in his memoir many years later. The speach has a different opinion about this. It says that Chevalier had notes about the conversations and he kept them, so he could use them to write his memoir. The last example tells abput his escape from prison. The text thinks that the lied about it and was set free by the jailers, but the speach tells us, that there are sources, which show that the ceiling had to be repaired after Cevalier left, which shows that his storie could be right.
