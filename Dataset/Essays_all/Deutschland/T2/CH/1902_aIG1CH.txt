The text and the presentation both discuss Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir and the reliability of his adventures. There are three stories being discussed: The first one is about him writing about his wealth while living in Switzerland. While the author of the text claims that the protagonist borrowed loads of money the presentation gives the information that this does not automatically have to mean that the Chevalier was poor but that he just needed some money while waiting for his own money to arrive. Second point is his connection to the famous writer Voltaire. The text gives the argument that it is not possible to remember single phrases of conversation as well as the Chevalier de Seingalt could rewrite in his memoir. The second source explains that the author of the memoir simply took notes directly after talking with Voltaire. By that he could retell those conversation in such detail. Last but not least the text claims that the Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice also does not sound believable. They guess he did not escape by destroing the ceiling with a piece of metal but more that he got free due to his good connections in Venice. Other information speak against this hypothesis: Firstly there were prisoners with even better connections who could not get out of jail and furthermore the ceiling had to be repaired after the Chevalier's escape which means it had to be damaged before.
