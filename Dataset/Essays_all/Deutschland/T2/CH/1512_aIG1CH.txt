The memoir of a swiss man called Chevalier de Seingalt are often referred to as an important source of historical information about the European society in the eighteenth century. As a memoir is written from memories, it can never be 100% correct. So the memoir of Chevalier comes with many critics too. They found out that he, altough claiming to be very wealthy, had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. A reason for that could have been that he had all of his money invested so to be able to spend the imense amounts of money he did, he would have had to sell something first.
In his memoir he also records conversations with the writer Voltaire. Critics say that he could't have been able to remember these conversations so well, writing the book a few years later. In respond to that, people point out that he was said to make notes of every conversation directly after it happened.
At last some people don't believe that he escaped from the famous prison in Venice by digging a hole through the ceiling. They say it's more likely that he had some politically influencial friends that bribed the jailers, although many prisoners had even mightier connections and weren't able to escape. Historical documents even say that the ceiling in his cell had to be repaired soon after so it is possible that that was because of Chevalier's actions.
