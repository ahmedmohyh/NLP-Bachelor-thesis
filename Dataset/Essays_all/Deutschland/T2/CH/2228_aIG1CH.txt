Both sources are referring to the topic of Chevalier and his memoir. His memoir is controversial discussed if it is accurate. There are three cases stated in the text that his memoir is not accurate and the audio file with destroys these arguments. First in the text is said that when Chevalier was in Switzerland he borrowed money so he ca not be rich. Whereas this gets destroyed by the audio: He had to borrow money becouse his cash must get sendend him from outside Switzerland.
The second evidience of the inaccuration of the memoir is stated in the text: However, critics complain that the memoir cannot possibly capture these conversations with voltair accurately, because it was written many years after the conversations occurred. This argument is not right too as the audio said because it is known that Chevalier has taken notes after every conversation with voltair in the same night so it is possible that he could quote complete phrases.
The third evidience is like the both others so one can say that the purpose of the text is to show that the memoir written by chevalier is inaccurate and the audio has the exacly opposite purpose. But i do not know if they are qualified sources so i give a fuck: ALSO GG.
