Toward the end of his life, the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725 - 1798) wrote a memoir that has been questioned very often. The Chevalier said that he was very wealthy when he lived in Switzerland but many people don't believe this. They found out that he borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant and argue that if he was really as rich as he stated, he wouldn't have needed to borrow money.
Others say that his memoir is a reliable source and also give reasons why they think so. They argue that he may have borrowed money, but just, because he had to wait for his money.
They also say that the conversations that the Chevalier had are real because they had been so well documented. The critics on the other hand say that especially because these conversations were so well documented they are fake. Especially when considering the fact that those conversations were held many years before they were documented.
Besides that the Chevalier also claims to have escaped the notorious prison in Venice, Italy. They say that there is no way that he could have escaped with just a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling.
Supporters of the Chevalier say that there a documents of the government that state that his prison had to be repaired after his bribe.
