The person who gave the presentation about Chevalier de Seingart stated that the memoirs from Chevalier are correct and reliable, even though no memoir can be absolutly correct.
The referent stated for example that Chevalier was in Switzerland and he was correct to say he was wealthy even though he has to borrow money from others. The text say this is a contrast which proof the false of Chevalier`s memoir, but the referent said that Chevalier was wealthy but invested money and had to wait until he get the money back and therefore he had to borrow money during that time.
Another example is that the text says that Chevalier met Voltaire but that the details of the conversation which Chevalier wrote down cannot be correct because he could not have known every detail. The person who gave the presentation stated nevertheless that they can be correct and that Chevalier wrote his memories of the conversation down the next day. He wrote the memoirs much later but he had still his notes from the converstaion.
The last given example was that Chevalier has been in prison in Venice but he achieved to escape. In his memoirs he said he did it by making a hole in the cell and climbing the roof. The referent stated that this is possible because it is clear that he escaped but other person whith much more powerful friends not achieved to escape. Thus he had to find another way to get out. And other sources say that the prison had to repair Chevalier´s cell a few days later.
