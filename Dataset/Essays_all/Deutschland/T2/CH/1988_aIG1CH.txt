The topic of the speech I just heared about was the histrical person Chevalier de Seingalt a famous auther who lieved form 1725 up to 1798.
His writtings about three evidances in his live were critised in the speech. The first evidence was thst he told the audience that he was very rich but he was not always because he has to borrowed a lot of money but the women in the speech told that he eared it let buy saeling juwels. In contrast to it the text says that did not earn money and live only from the borrowed money.
The second evidence that have been criticed were Chevalier`s conversation with Voltaire the text says that he not even meet this person and so mot talkted to him, but in the speech they says that he knowes him but exergurate this conversations in his books.
The thierd critised point was his discription of his owen escape from the Venetian prison. In the speech they told that he did not escape because there were aouther poeple with more influence who not even were abled to escape.In contrast to it the textsays that says that it could be because he had enought politcal frinds to escape.
