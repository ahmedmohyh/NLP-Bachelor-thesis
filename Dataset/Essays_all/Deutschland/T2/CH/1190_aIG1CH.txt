In the text  everything is against the Chevalier and that he hasnt done anything of what he wrote in his memoir. they try to argue with terrible arguments against him and they think he is dumb of something because they dont believe what he wrote. on the other hand in the monolog they say it is possible and they have very good arguments for their statement. in the example with the prison they say he couldt get out alone he must have had helped from some of the surveillants but his room in the prison had to build new because it was cracked by the chevalier to escape from it so in the text they write false things. the text is written by critics so they must have arguments against  it but the arguments are false. the writers of the text argue very dumb. they think he isnt rich because he borrows some money thats a dumb argument everybody borrows some money. And the main thing is that 4 stands for LIFESTYLE!  over and out.
