The story about the Chevaliers.

Like they said in the presentation every memoir doesn´t include all details but they are mostly very acurate.
as mentioned in the presentation the Chealiers weren´t poor. They spent an amount of money during their time in Switzerland for partying. It is normal that you have to sell something before you can pay for your lifestyle so it was also normal that the Chevaliers borrowed some money. This process doesn´timply that the Chevaliers aren´t a rich family. Tis fact is shown in an other way in the letter about the cavaliers. He they say that the Chevaliers need to borrow money otherwise they would be very poor. The next point are the meetings with Voltaire.In the presentation they told us that the Chevalier wrote down every single detail about their meetings but he capt it for a lot of years. The text aims to present that the conversation was written many years after the conversation so it is not very acurate. THe both texts have also a different opinion about the Chevaliers escape in Venice. On the one hand the text says that the Chevalier had number of politically well-connected friends in venice so he escaped with the help of them. On the other hand the presentation shows that the Chevaliers story about his escape is truely right becauss he said that he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof. The presentation shares this description because the ceiling needed to be repaired after the Chevalier escaped. Both texts have in common that the Chevalier was an famous person with even more powerful friends
