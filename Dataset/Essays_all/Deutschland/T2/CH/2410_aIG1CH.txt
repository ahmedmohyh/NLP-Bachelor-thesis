The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures and because of that there are arguments against his memoir that all of that what he wrote cant be the truth but there are also arguments stating that the facts he wrote about his life are proven to be exactly right. 
First of all the Chavelier talked about living in Switzerland where he spent lots of money on parties and gambling. He was a very wealthy guy but sometimes he needed to borrow money because he had to wait for his money that he won to arrive. But in fact of the text he is rich so he should not need to borrow money.
Second the Chevalier claims he had a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire and that he has witnesses that can prove what exactly they talked about.But the memoir was written many years after the conversation so it is impossible that the Chevalier remembers the exact phrases even if witnesses have been there.
The third point is about his escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. For that he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling so he can climb through the roof. It was said that their is evidence because the ceiling had to be removed and a new one was replaced.In addition to that threre were prisoners that had numbers of well-connected friends in Venice and they said it is impossible to get out of it with that so there is no possibility that he had friends that got him out of it.
