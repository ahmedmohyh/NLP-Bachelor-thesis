In the following I am going to make a connection between the text and the lecture.

The lecture underlines the accuracy of the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. It says that no memoir can be exactly correct about the facts, but it gives us insight in the society of the eighteenth century. It criticises that although Chevalier borrowed money in Switzerland he needn´t to be poor. He just had to wait for his other money to arrive. Also the text mentions that the conversation with the writer Voltaire can´t be correct, because he wrote his memoir a long time after it. The lecture gives the argument that it is proven, that Chevalier wrote down the conversations every night right after he had them, so only a little of the actual phrases are lost. Furthermore it argues that the description of the prison escape is likely, because at the same time there had been other prisoners with higher friends and they didn´t escape prison. Also is there proof, that a short time after the escape the prison had to repair his celing, wich makes a lot of sense when Chevalier made a hole in it to escape.
