In the following text I will show the differences between the text and the presentation. 

Chevalier is a pretty akward and rich man who lives in the 18 Century. He wrote a long memoir of his life and his meetings with famouse people.
In the presentation the woman tells that the Chevalier a rich man is, who also borrow some money. The Critics in the text doesn´t understand why the chevalier borrows money. If he is rich, he doesn´t need borrow money. 
The Critics also critic the conversation between the Chevalier and Voltaire. They tells that they couldn´t have meet and he would capcht some conversation from other people, who talk to him. But the woman of the presentation explains that it is possible too because he was a rich man who could go whereever he want to. So it´s possible that both have meet and talk to each other.
But the critics also critic that he doesn´t have help from his connections. The text says that he escape with a piece of metal. The woman doesn´t belive that he escape from his prison with a piece of metal because the prison was reneveble.

All in all we couldn´t say what is write or wrong. Some people say that his adventures wasn´t real and other people say that he has a really good and cool life.
Nobody will now what is right or wrong. We have to decide in what we believe.
