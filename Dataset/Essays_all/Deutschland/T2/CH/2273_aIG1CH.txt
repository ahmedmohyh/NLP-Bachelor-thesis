Chevalier wrote a memoir about his adventures, which is called very important because he met a lot famous people in his life during the 18th century.
But some critics are not sure if everything he wrote down in it is true. 
For example is the question risen, how he got so much money. Furthermore is asked, how it was possible that Chevalier wrote everything about the conversation between himself and Voltaire, a famous writer. The audio and the text explain, that he wrote it down years after both have met. 
In Chevalier's memoir can be found a lot of notes from conversations etc.. The question is, how true they are.
Both, the text and the audio, criticise the memoir and its open questions, a reader will get when he is reading the memoir.
