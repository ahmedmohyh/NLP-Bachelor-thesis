In the lecture they prove the evidence of the story's that are written down in the text with other documents etc. from the 18th century. 
First of all they explain that no memoir could be a hundret percent true, but that there are many reliable sources whom prove certain points that are written down in the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt or at least could explain the background of his story. 
It is well known that Chevalier was a wealthy and spending man but that doesn't mean he didn't need money from time to time when his money was in delay. Which explains why he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant while he was waiting on his own money.
Another example the use to prove the critics wrong is that they talked about the notes and journals he ha his whole life that are proven to be the base of his memoir. So the controverse that he couldn't be able to remember all the aspects of his conversations for example with voltaire isn't true.
The critics claim about Chevalier not being able to escape that way can also be proven wrong with the document about the repair from a wall in his exact same prison cell 
All in all they explained his memoir with different documents etc from that time, whom together create piece for piece a clearer image and prove of his memoir and that time.
