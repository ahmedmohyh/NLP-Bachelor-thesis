Chvelier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life and his adventures which is a historical source about European society. His memoir is discussed because some people say it´s not true what he wrote. He wrote that he lived in swiss as a rich man but he spent a lot of his money on partying and that stuff. So he had to borrow money while waiting for his own money to arrive but that is not a fact for that he wasn´t rich. 
Chevalier wrote that he had conversations with Voltaire and he kept the notes of that many years to himself so it does´nt have to be lie like many people say.
The third legend of Voltaire that he escaped from the prison in Venice is able to be correct  because it´s written that they had to build a new ceiling .
