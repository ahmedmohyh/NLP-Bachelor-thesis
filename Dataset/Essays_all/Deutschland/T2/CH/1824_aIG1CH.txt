In the following text I will collect the arguments and write about how they are to fit together. 

The first argument is that Chevalier borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant, but he claimed that he was very wealthy. Well, this argument actually fits together, because Chevalier only borrowed this money because he waited for his own to arive. The invested maybe his money in something and had to borrow something for his parties and his glamorous lifestyle. 
Secondly, he met Voltaire, why shouldn`t he, but that he remembered complete phrases from this conversation years after they met is really suspishes. But why shouldn't he made notes. 
The last argument is that he escapeted from a prision in Venice by using a piece of metal to make a hole into the ceiling. Furthermore, he than escapted over the roof. This is a really interesting listing story and this is actually the criticism on him. It is to enjoyable, to fantastic, more like a fantasy story to belive in it. But there were many prision escapes through many ways. Some diged a hole under the wall or opened the door. Why shouldn't this escape be just one more of them. Also, the Venicen goverment declares that the cell, in which Chevalier was hold, had to be repaired after his escape. Maybe he had really help from political friends but way not with an escape.
