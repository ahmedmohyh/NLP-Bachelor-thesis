I listened to a speech by a woman, who talks about the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, in which she says that the critics, who say that the memoir is incorrect, are wrong. She sais that it´s not possible to write a memoir, which is absolutely correct. But the important things Chevalier de Seingalt tells in his memoir can be correct. In the text I read there is said, that some things that are mentioned in the memoir can´t be correct, but in the speech the woman shows why that´s wrong. In one part there is a conversation that was made by Chevalier and Voltaire and the text says that can´t be correcct, because nobody can keep a conversation in mind for many years. But the woman, who held the speech says that in the memoir there are just the things mentioned that Chevalier remembers so the main theme of the conversation could be possible. Another thig that is written in the memoir is an escape out of a prison. Critics say that this is not possible, but the speaker says that there was the ceiling that had to be repaired, which shows that there had to be something destroyed and that could lead to the thought that there was somebody who escaped from prison. The speaker had some more examples, that show the accuracy of the memoir.
