The Chevalier wrote a long memoir of his adventures he'd experienced in lifetime. But in some cases the stories are not pretty logical. For example, he spent many years in Switzerland, where he on one hand was a poor guy waiting for his money frequently, but on the other wasted his money for parties and gamblings in some evenings. Furthermore he supported the Switzerland's merchandise. To finance his whealthy lifestyle, there're rumours that the Chevalier had to borrow the money because he didn't had it on his own. An other hint, that the Chevalier lied in his memoir is, that he had escaped from prison in Venice. Of course he was not the only one who sat there and there were many other guys who had a lot more influence than he. But instead of freeing those influencing prisoners, friends decided to free him. Critics are also skeptical whether the Chevalier reaally had the conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. He met Voltaire in a night conversation, but he wrote his memoir many years later. So it is rather impossible to remember each part of the conversation this exactly the Chevalier wrote in his memoir. 
So it is maybe like in the bible. you don't know exactly if the stories are true but you know, that there was a person named Jesus who experienced those adventures
