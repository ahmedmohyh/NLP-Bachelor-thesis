There are three points about the memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt which are criticised because they seem to be somewhat unlikely. 
The first being his stories about his times in Switzerland where he claims to have been really wealthy.
Now historical records show that during his time in Switzerland the Chevalier had to borrow a lot of money which
critics describe as evidence against his claims. But those arguments can be disproven because of the line of trade
the Chevalier was active in. His work would cause him to sell property to customers and woulld leave him waiting for
the money. Due to this waiting time for payday it could happen that he ran out money and needed to borrow some to skip this gap.
Another point criticised about him is his conversation with the Voltaire. In his memoirs these conversations are described with utmost attention to detail although his memoirs were written years after his encounter with the famous writer. Brought up against these arguments is the fact that he supposedly had a journal in which he had written down these conversations which would allow him to recite them with such detail.
Lastly his imprisonment and escape from the Venetian prison is questioned, as he claims to have fled it by making a hole in the roof and climbing through the roof. Critics speculate that this story is untrue and that he probably had bribed the guards with help of his powerful friends in Venice. This argument is disproven by the fact that the prison contained individuals who were way more influential than the Chevalier as well as the fact, that soon after his supposed escape the prisons ceilings had to be repared.
