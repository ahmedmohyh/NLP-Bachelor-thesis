The speech is about a person who named Chevalier and lived in Switzerland. The woman from the speech said that Chevalier was very poor and spent much money for parties or something like this in Switzerland. In the second part she talked about the meeting with Voltaire. She said that Chavalier wrote down everything which he remembers from the meeting on a piece of paper.
But the text is also about the live of Chevalier but the text doesn´t says that he was poor. It says that he escaped from a prison in italy, Venezia and that he had politically well-connected friends. There are also differences between the meeting of Voltaire and Chevalier, because the text isn´t sure about that both met but in the speech this is clear. It says that chevalier wrote down everything he remembered when he met Voltaire.
