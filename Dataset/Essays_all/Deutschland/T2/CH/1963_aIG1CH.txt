One point that was mentioned was, that he escaped out of a prison in Venice. It is said in the text, that his escape likie he discribed it in his memoir was only for enjoyable reading. But an  argument against this critics is, that after Chevaliers escape the ceiling  had to be repaired. And why should it be repaired when nobody broke through it. 

The point about his conversation with the famous writer Voltaire is also mentioned in the text an skeptical by critics. In this case each night after this meeting Chevalier wrote everything down he could remember from this conversation. Critics say that this could not be real because this memoir was written many years later.  But Chevalier kept them for many years before he wrote them down in his memoir. 

The third point that is mentioned is if Chevalier was rich or not. Critics say that when he was so rich he would not have needed to borrow money. But even you are rich, someday the money is empty and then you have so look were you get your money from.
