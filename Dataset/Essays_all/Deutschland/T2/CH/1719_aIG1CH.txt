The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) is claimed to have invented events that he made up. Critics said it's because he wanted to have a more interesting and exciting life. 
The first false event is his life in Switzerland where he wrote in his memoir that he was very wealthy and celebrated with famous person. Evidence showed that he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant but the listening task explained that he had to convert things into money. This process took a few days so he had to borrow money within these days.

The second upcoming event was his meeting with Voltaire. The text said that Chevalier was wrong and that he made the conversation up because he wrote his memoir a long time after meeting Voltaire. The truth is that he took notes from the conversation and wrote what he remembered.

The third lie was about his time in Venice, Italy where he claimed that he escaped the prison. In the memoir he said that he escaped with a piece of metal. He made a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof. The critic is that he had well-connected friends in the politic who bribed to free him. The other text said that other prisoneres had more powerful friends, so they had better opportunities than Chevalier for getting out. Documents of the government showed that his ceiling had to get repaired shortly after his escape. That's another evidence that Chevalier didn't made the things up, it proofs that he wrote the truth, but honestly we'll never know what really happenend.
