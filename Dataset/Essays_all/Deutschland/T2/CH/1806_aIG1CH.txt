In the following text I will list the arguments from the presentation about the responsibility of the text and compare them.
They both deald with the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798. His memoir is very popular, because he claims to met many famous people of historical European Society and made many adventures, for example a prison escape, but many people think that he invented some of the events in his memoir. Some reasons for these theories from the text are for example that he borrowed money in Switzerland even though he claimed to be very rich. In the presentation the woman stated that this doesn't mean he is poor, because it was normal that it took time to convert his things into actual money. She also mentioned that it is possible that he wrote down his conversations with famous people like voltaire so he could keep the notes for his memoir, which he wrote years later. Furthermore there are documents from the Venice government, which say that after his prison escape the ceiling of the cell should be repaired, so this is a good evidence that his story is true.
