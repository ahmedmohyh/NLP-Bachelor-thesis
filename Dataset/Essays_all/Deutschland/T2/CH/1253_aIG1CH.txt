The Chevalier was a poor man but spent a lot of money in partys and gambling in Switzerland. He had converations with Voltaire but in the text they said it nobody can say if its right or not. Also the escape from the prison is different. In the text they say he make a hole in his ceiling and climbing through the roof, but in the presentation they say he got help instead of people who had more friends with force to help them. He lived very healthy and was a rich man who dont borrow money from others. In his life the Chevalier wrote a memoir about his life because he met very important people like kings and writers. He got a sums of money from a Swiss merchant but in the presentation they dont say anything about it. It seems like nobody really knows about it how the Chevalier get his money.
