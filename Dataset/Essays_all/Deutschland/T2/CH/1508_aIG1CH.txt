The presentation about the Chavalier discusses some of the critisised passages of his memoir. 

Chavalier claimes that he was rich during his time in Switzerland although it is proven that he had to borrow a lot of money. The presentation´s speaker does not have any doubts though, that both facts can be correct. It takes some time to chance assets into money and that´s why the Chavalier needed to borrow that money probably.
Another controverse statement is that the Chavalier was able to remember a lot of phrases and sentences he used in his conversations with Voltaire. This can be discussed with the argument that the Chavalier took notes after their conversations. Some friends of his could prove that statement. They claimed that the Chavalier took and stored a lot of notes until he wrote his memoir.
The last controverse statement is about the day of his prison break in Venice. People do not believe that he escaped through the ceiling of his cell, but that he had some powerful friends. But the Chavalier's story can be proven by documents of Venice, which state that the ceiling had to be repaired a few days after the Chavalier´s escape.

So to conclude you can say that the Chavalier´s memoir might not be correct in any detail, but seems to be very accurate.
