The Text claims that Chevalier´s memoir would not be chorrect and that he would have invented certain events. Such as Chevalier beeing rich when he lived in Switzerland. But the extract I just heard does not agree. The woman argues that  no memoir can be completely correct in every part. Even though is Chevalier´s memoir more correctly than others. For example did he only borrow money because he was wating for his own to arrive. He had a verry valuable posses and it took some time to sell some things. And durinmg that time, while he was wating for his money, he had to borrow some. Also is there a reason that he can decribe the conversations between him and Voltaire so detailed, years after the conversation took place. He wrote everything down directly after the conversation. He cept those notes for many years, this way he was able to give detailed information about the conversations.
The last point wich is criticised in the text, that it was unlikely for him to escape out of prison. Other prisoners had even more important friends, but none of them got out of prison. Also did they have to repair his sell right after he escaped, as he said. Why would they have to repair exactly this part of his cell, wich he claimed to have damaged during fleeing, if he didnt flee at all?
