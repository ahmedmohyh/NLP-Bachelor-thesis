The memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt is from the eighteenth century and has many critics nowadays. They say that the Chevalier invented a lot of events and changed some to make his own life for the readers more exciting. But there were some controversial points in his memoir which historics nowadays found out. 

The first controversial has to do with his life in switzerland. It is known that the Chevalier was very wealthy and it is also known that he invested high amounts of money in parties and gambling while living in switzerland. But historics found an evidence for him borrowing money frrom a Swiss merchant. But why would he have to borrow money if he was a rich person?

The next controversial has to do with the conversations mentioned in the memoir. There he wrote down full sentences of his conversations for example with Voltaire. For sure he was not able to remember every word which was said during the conversations because he wrote the memoir many years after the conversation. 

The last controversial has to do with his escape from a prison in Venice.
