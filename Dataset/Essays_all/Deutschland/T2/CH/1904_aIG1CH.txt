Firstly the speech says that one can  rely on the sources found about Chevalier de Seingalt, because they are well raised. Furthermore in the speech Chevalier's wealth is clearly stated, however the text claims the opposite due to him borrowing a lot of things. The speaker formulates the thesis ,that he just had to wait for receiving his money, but he never was poor or anything. On  the one hand critics say, he is a liar and just invented any meeting with important personalities, but on the other hand supporters answer this in him writing every little detail down. For that reason they say he could remember everything even after years. Another point in  his biography also leads to many controversies, however people are not of the same opinion after centuries. Chevalier was in prison in Venice and he reached an escape, but however a part of the population does not believe in the possibility of doing this. But the speaker states that the ceiling he escaped through had to be repaired after he had escaped. So it should not have been that difficult even by just using a piece of metal. Another argument of his supporters is his high influency in venetian society, which could have helped him along his way.
 To sum it up one can not find a universal way of talking about Chevalier.
