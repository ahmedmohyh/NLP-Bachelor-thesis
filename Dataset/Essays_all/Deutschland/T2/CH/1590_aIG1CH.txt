When you compare the given text to the speech you realize that they want to transmit completely different messages. In general both sources deal with the Chevalier de Seingalt and his memoir. The text describes his memoir from a critical point of view and on the other hand there is this speech, in which the Chevalier is presented as a person who would not tell lies in his memoir. The main topics in both sources are his meetings with famous people like kings, his "high life" in Switzerland, the letters he wrote to a famous writer named Voltaire and his escape from a prison in Venice. The text sees the meetings as lies; lies that were told by the Chevalier to make his life more interesting. The speech transmits the message that such a famous person like him had so many possibilities and he did not have a reason to tell lies like this. The same different opinions about the topic Voltaire. However his life in Switzerlend was full of fun and free time, he earned money before he made the trip and this makes him a person who is not poor. This is the point of view of the speech, but the text sees in his adventures in Switzerland just a senseless time for fun.  
At all the sources explain a life of a men and they critizes his memoir, but they will never get the right answer, because he,as the main character, is dead since long time.
