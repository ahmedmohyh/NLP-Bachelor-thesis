The text and the audio are related to each other. While the text has a more negative however still factual view on Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir, the woman from the audio is not concerned about the stories written by the Chevalier.
The first argument from the text states that he claimes to have been wealthy while living in Switzerland but somehow still seemed to have borrowed much money from a Swiss merchant. The woman from the audio however says that the fact of him borrowing money is not concerning at all. She says that he might have won huge amaounts of money from gambling but did not receive his prize for a longer period of time. When he did not have the cash yet he needed to get the money from somewhere else. 
The second argument mentiones that he could not have possibly capture conversations with Voltaire in his memoir that were written down many years after the actual conversation. The audio states that there was proof that the Chevalier had written down the conversations in his journal the day he spoke to Voltaire and that he used these notes while writing his memoir. 
The last statement the text talks about says that his escape from prison was most likely less spectacular then he wrote. The author of the text believes that he had politically well-connected friends that offered a bribe to the jailers. On the contrary side, the audio says that there where more prominent prisoners in that particular jail who had even better connections than the Chavelier. Additional to that was the prison reparing the ceiling of his cell after his escape.
