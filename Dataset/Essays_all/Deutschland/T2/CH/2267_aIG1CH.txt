The text and the presentation are both about he memoir of the Cahevalier de Seingalt, which is supposed to be a historical source about Euopean society in the eighteenth century.
The two text axtracts dealing with how serious the memoir as a historical source is.
So critics do not think that everything had happened like it is discribed in the the memoir. 
So even though de Chavelier used to spend much money on parties while living in Switzerland and he is supposen to be very rich, we konw today that he had to borrow money. But in the heared text it is said that it was normal to spend money for getting more money.
Another argument of the critics is in relation of all the convetsations which de Seingalt wrote down in detail years after they happened. So they think it is not possible to write down an old conversation such detailed. 
But other people say de Seingalt had wroitten down the conversations directly after speeking with the people and while writing the memoires he was using the notes.
Even the last argument of the critics that his escape from a pison in Venice was not as daring as he describes it, is very controversial, because there were other prisoners before him whoos escaping were much more powerfull.
