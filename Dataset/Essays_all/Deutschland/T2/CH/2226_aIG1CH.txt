Tha lady in the lecture states her ideas and theories on the topic the text mentioned. while she knows that no memoire is one hundretpercent correct, she is sure that the ones of chevalier are pretty accurate.
First she adresses the point of the text where its stated that the critics think chevalier could in fact not have been rich as he had to borrow money for his parties and gambling. She counters this argument with the fact that chevalier indeed had treassurey but in objects. She tells about the time it takes for object to be exchanged for currency and that that was the reason why he had to borrow money.
The second statement she debunks with her ideas and foundings is that, as stated by the text, the conversation between voltair and chevalier could not have been accurate becouse of the years in delay from conversation to paper.
We are told in the lecture that this is not a problem though becouse of notes that had been found and confirmed to be chevalier notes of said conversation, she mentions witnesses who valuate him using his notes when he wrote the memoir.
In the end she briefly talks about the case of chevaliers escape from prison. The text says that him escaping through a self made hole in the ceiling is bonkers and thus him getting out through bribery is more likely.
The woman of the lectures theory about this is that bribery is unlikely becouse of richer and more mighty persons in the same prison not getting bribed out. She focuses on a police report that mention the prisons need for a ceiling repairment of the cell of chevalier. Thus she concludes that he escaped as told in the memoir.
