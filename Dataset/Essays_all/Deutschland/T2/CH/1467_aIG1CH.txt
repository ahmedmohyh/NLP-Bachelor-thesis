The text and lissening compreantion, are both about the controversial figure the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798). 

In the text it was says that he wrote a long memorie recounting his live and adventures. But in the präsentation it was sad that wrote alol the thigs down what he could remember. Also he was not so rich but make partys and gambling. Becouse he spent a great deal with money. But he was not realy rich, would said in the präsentation, but the other informations are the same as in the text. 
He had not so powerfull friend than the other prisoners. So he need more time to get out of the prison, but at the end he escapte from the Prison. That stand not in the text. In the text stand taht he using a picce of metal to make a in the ceiling and climbing throughe roof. Also it could more likely that the Chevalier`s jailers were bribed to free him, but in the präsentation he had not so much friends they can help him.
