In the lecture it was told that no memoir can ever be 100% correct, but Chevaliers memoir seems to be very close to reality. As it is said in the text the memoir is a good historical source. The text says that Chevalier couldn't have been that rich because it was claimed that he was borrowing money. In the lecture it was said that this didn't mean that he was poor. His money needed to be converted and while waiting for that he had to borrow money for other purchases. Another aspect from the text is that the conversations with the writer Voltaire Cevalier recorded weren't accurate because he wrote them many years after the conversation happened. However in the lecture it was told that after each talk he wrote down what he remembered and kept those notes for years. When he wrote his memoir he refered to those notes. The text also talks about his escape from prison by using a piece of metal to break a hole through the ceiling. Critics think that this couldn't have happened the way the said it did and that he was probably rescued by some of his well-connected friends. The lecturist said that it was confirmed that the ceiling had to be repaired after Chevalier was gone so his story has to be true. To summarize, all the aspects against the accuracy of chevaliers memoir were prooved wrong by the lecturist.
