In the text goes ist about a man with the name Chevailer de Seingalt. People should say, that he invented events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting than it really was. In this point the spoken text agrees with the written text. The first argument is that he had needed to borrow money when he was in Switzerland. In the text stands the opposite of that.
The second argument is that he has written down everything he remembered from the conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. So that he could repet the conversation many years after. The text agrees with this argument. You can find in the text, that critics point out that it is impossible to rember phrases from the conversation.
The last argument is about the escape from the prison in Venice. Cevalier de Seingalt should make a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof. In this point the text spoken and the written text have the same opinion. It´s also not true. The text says that the jailers were bribed to free him, because he has some political frinds there 
In general both text says the same. That means that non of Chevailers events were true like he said they happend.
