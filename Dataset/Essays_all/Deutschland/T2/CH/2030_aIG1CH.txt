Chevalier de Seingalt who lived from 1725 to 1798 was actually very wealthy, he just had to borrow money sometimes because he hasn`t received his to that point. So the fact that he had to borrow money sometimes isn`t telling you that he was poor.

 During his life he had some conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. Years after the conversations he wrote a memoire about them. Although he made it years later it should be pretty acurate because he took his notes to help. 

In the text there is also some criticism about his escape from a notorious prison in Venice. But it really makes sense that he escaped throw the ceiling because after his escape the ceiling of his cell had to be repared.

Some people are saying that he ivented some events in his memoir that didn`t really happen just to make his life a bit more exciting. But this is just mentiond in the text and not in the audio.
