First of all it is to say, that no memoir can be completly accurate. But the memoir of Chevalier is rather accurate. In the text there are three main critics of the memoir. In the speach there are given explanations for these Critics. It is clear that the Chevalier needed to rent money, but that doesn't necessarily mean, that he was poor. He spent much money on gambling and while he waitet for the money, he had at home, to arrive he rented some from the merchant. The second is, that he can't repeat the conversations with Voltaire accurate, because he wrote them jears after, but he himself said, that after each conversation he took notes of them. The third critic is, that he diden't escaped the prison how he described. He rather bribed himself to freedom. But soon after the escape, the prison repaired the celing of his cell, and why should thei do that if it wasn't like chevalier described.
So the speach takes the arguments of the text and renders them useless.
