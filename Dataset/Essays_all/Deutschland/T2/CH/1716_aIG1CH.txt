The Chevalier de Seingalt was a very critizised man. He lived with passion and some events of his live are hard to believe. Like his prison escape from Venice. 
The Chevalier wrote a memoir, which has gain popular at the end of his life. He documented everything what had to be written down in his eyes (in his opinion). Easily people thought he was a liar, beacuse things seeemed to exciting and glamorous to be real. The best example is his time in Switzerland. The Chevalier claims he spent a lot money in partys and gambling. But recently some people say he always borrowed considerable money from a Swiz merchant. So he never spent his own money. But he claimed to be rich. <>

When Chevalier spoke to the writer Voltaire, he alsways wrote down theire conversations before going to bed. He only wrote down what he was able to recognise. He couldn´t have written anything down for sure. The people that argue in the text claimed he was a liar about all of the dialogues he documented. He invented many words and made the situation better for his own. Just to get the attention he wanted. 

When the Chevalier was in Italy he once escaped from a prison. The notorious pr0ison of Venice. He said he escpade with a piece of metal, which he used to make a hole in the wall. In the documentary of the prsion was written down, that the seeling has been repaired just after the incedent. So he must be right. The critics of the Chevalier have the opinion he had friends in the prison. Friends who can make things happen. People with influence he was able to bribe. That is how he escaped.
