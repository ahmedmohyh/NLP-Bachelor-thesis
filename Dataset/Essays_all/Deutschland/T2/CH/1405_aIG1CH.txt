The text I just read is a critic about the memoir of the Chevalier and the presentation I listened to were arguments against the critic.
First of all the text tells you about the chevalier, he was controversial figure who has many famous friends like kings and writers, he wrote a memoir.
In this memoir he summed up everything about his life. 
In the critic it says that the Chevalier was pretty poor because he borrowed money but in fact in Switzerland it takes some time to get your money so he was selling property and while he was waiting for the money of it he borrowed some to party and gambling.
The second point was about his friend Voltaire, a french writer, because the Chevalier could write down the exact words Voltaire said years after he really said them. But the Chevalier wasn't stupid so he wrote down every word right after he had the conversation.
The last point was his mistirious escape from the prison in Venice, he wrote in his memoir that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling, the critic says that this ain't possible and that he escaped because of his powerful friends. The problem here is that there were other prisonners who had friends who were way more powerful and who stayed in prison and in addiction to that the venitian gouvernement has a report which says that the ceiling of the cell of the Chevalier needed to be repaired after his escape.
