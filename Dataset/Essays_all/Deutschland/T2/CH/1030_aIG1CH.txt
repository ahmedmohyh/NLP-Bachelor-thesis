The memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt is discussed concerning the correctness because some facts seem to be strange. In the following two opinions, one from a speech and another from a text, are goining to be compared.

The audition mentioned that no memoir is fully correct but his memoir is pretty acurate. But the text claims that he inventend many parts of his memoir.
Furthermore he had to borrow money if he had to wait for his money to arrive because he had sold something. The text argues that he had been poor because he had to borrow money.
The next discussed point is that the text doubts that the Chevalier couldn't have remebered the detaild of the conversations with Voltaire because his memoir has been written years after. But in the speech it has been explained that he took notes right after the conversations and referred to them while writing his memoir.
Finally he critics in the text point out that he didn't escape through the ceiling of the Ventian prison but that some well-connected friends helped him. In the audition it is said that many prisoners had well-connected friends but just the Chevalier escsaped and in addition to that the ceiling had to be repared after his escape.

To draw a conclusion, there are some explanations for the strange parts in the memnoir of the Chavalier but no one will know which one is right and therefore the discussions will continue.
