The Chevalier wrote a memoir about his life and all his adventures. He lived from 1725 to 1798 and was a historical person. He met through his life a lot of famous and important people, one of them was the famous writer Voltaire. Some sources say that there aren`t any conversations of them both written down, but some others say that the Chevalier wrote down as much as he could remember of his night conversations in his memoir.
 Another point is the one of the money. While the text gives the pointment that the Chevalier was very rich and spent a lot of money on parties and gambling while he lived in Switzerland, the other source is sure that he had money and partied a lot, but he needed also time to get his money back to him, so he had to wait a time until it got brought to him.
There is the statement that the Chevalier should have been escaped from prison in Venice, Italy. Critics are not sure about that, some people think through his well-connected friends it was easy for him to get bribed and the aspect of escaping should have made his life more exciting.
