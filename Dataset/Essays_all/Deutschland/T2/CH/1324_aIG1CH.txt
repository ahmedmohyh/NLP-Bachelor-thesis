The Text is abaout, that he wrotes a memoir of his life and adventures. It says, that there are critics about the accurary of the memoir. But the speech told us the memoir of the Chevalier is pretty accurate and there are many details in it. 
In the text they said that the Cheavalier is poor, because of the many parties he has given or takes place in. But the truth is, that he is waiting for his money to arrive. The reason that he has to wait is He is living in switzerland and his money in not jet on a bank account in switzerland. so he is defenetely not poor just waiting for his money. Critics are skeptical if Chevailier and Voltaire have ever met each other. 
The text said, that no one doubt that this is the truth even this conversaition cannot be accurate. But the speech has got an other opinion. The speaker said, that he wrote everything he could remember at each end of the day. His memoir is so accurat, that they have been conversated even if the text say they haven`t met each other.
Chevalier was in a prison in Venice and escaped by using a piece of metal. But in the speech they are saining, that he escaped frome the prison in Venice by some people who are supposed tp help him. The speaker said, that they wondered why the friends of Chevalier could not escaped the prison even if they had friends with more influence.All in all you can say, that the text ans the speech are completely different in their opinion. The text is more about the critics about the truth and accurate of his memoir and the speech is just about the pretty accurate and the truth about chevaliers memoir.
