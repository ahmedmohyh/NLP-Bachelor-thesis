Chevalier Seingalt was a men who wrote a long memoir of is life and adventures but some people think that it is not right or possible what he tells about his adventures.
The first point is that the text says that he was very wealthy but the presentation says something different sure it says that he spent a lot of money in gambling and parties. Sure the presentation says that he was not a poor men but it says too the he was not wealthy.
Secondly in the presentaion it is shown that Chevalier do not have this powerful friends like other peolple who were in prison and who could not escape.
Another point is how he escaped. In the text it says that he made a hole with a piece of metal but the presentation says something different.
