According to the speaker, no memoirs are perfectly corretct. However, the memoir of the Chevalier is a reliable historic source. Though in the text it says that he was rich while living in Switzerland was explained by him borrowing money from a Swiss merchant and spending it on parties and gambling, the audio informed that the cash he won needed time to arrive so during that time he borrowed money which he later paid back. According to the text, he was not that rich, but the audio still expresses his wealth. 
On top of that, reffering to the text, the conversations with the famous writer Voltaire that are mentioned in Chevalier´s memoir are not accurate because they have been hold a ling time before he wrote his memoir. In the audio however, there were sources mentioned that proof that Chevalier wrote notes in his journal every night and kept those for a long time. He then apparently used these notes when writing his memoir. 
While the text gives the reader the impression that he did not escape the prison in Venice by making a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal but instead had friends that bribed the jailers to let him free, the audio gives information that he did not have enough friends and in fact there wer other prisoners who had not only more but also more important friends and did not get out of the jail, so bribery is pretty much unlikely in his case.
To sum up, the text and the audio give information that do not match. While the text questions his memoir and the information, the audio proofs nearly all of them.
