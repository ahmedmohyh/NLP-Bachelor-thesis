The first point, which is mentioned in the text, Chevalier was criticized that he was poor but still able to spend money on useless activities as parties and gambling in his life. The audio does not agree to this point and argues against it that he just needs to sell some products to get money again which normally takes some time. 
Moreover, in the next paragraph the text complains about his truth in his articles. Chevalier was possibly not able to write down the truth due to the delayed time when he wrote about his conversations.
On the other side the audio faces this issue with the arguement that Chavalier might have written down everything through taking very detailed notes about the conversation with someone else but just wrote the article later.
In addtion, the article delivers the last convincing arguement about the prisionescape. Chevalier should not escaped from his cell through the ceiling. It is not possible for the author of the article that he flew to his friends. The audio is not sure about this aspect aswell but the speaker talks about a document which is about a repair of a whole in the ceiling in the prision.
to come to an end the adio jsut argues against the article and tries to convince the listeners opinion.
