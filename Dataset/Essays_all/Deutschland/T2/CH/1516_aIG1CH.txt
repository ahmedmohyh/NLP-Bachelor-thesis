The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt is a topic, wich many scientist argue about. Is it a valuable historical source or not, did he wrote the trouth or not. 
The women who spoked try to explain why it is not wrong what he wrote. First she said that although he wrote his memoirs many years after his partys etc. they could be true, because he wrote everything down after every party what he could remembered. Then she said, that he could be wealthy, although he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant, because sometimes it takes days and days until he got his money for the perties or what ever he did. And sometimes he spend money first and later he got it back, but that isn't a poor person. The last point was that it is more probalbly that he excaped like he described, because to get free through his friends can't be true. She said that many other convects had more known friends in politics etc. and did't get free as well.
The text didn't say anything that is wrong, but the text didn't considered the whole situation. To borrow much money from a Swiss merchant is enough to say that Chevalier de Seingalt is poor. But what did he do with the money? did he payed it back or not. Many rich people borrow mooney, but the aren't poor. 
The same procedure the author of the text did at the second argument, he or she only said that it isn't possible to remember every detail, but he could did it like the women said in her speech.
