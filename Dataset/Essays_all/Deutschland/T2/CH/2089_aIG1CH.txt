In the text Chevalier (1725-1798) wrote his memorie not exactly, like it really was. He met kings and famous writers, but they said in the text that he change the story a little bit to make it more interesting. His memories are an important source for the history, so its not helpful, if its wrong or full of lies.
The critic is first, that he said, he didn't have money in Switzerland and needed to borrow some money, but on the other side, he gave much money an partys and events.
In the presentation, they axplained it: He had money, but in this time it was different then today. He must wait for his money to come to switzerland so he needed to borrow some for the time, his money need to come.
Next the made critic on his conversation with the writer Voltaire. They said, some of the points he wrote aren't true, because he wrote his memories some years after the conversation. 
In the presentation they said the same thing.
And third when he escaped from the prison in venice, the text said, the jailers let him free, he didn't escape by his own. They wrote, the Chevalier had many good friedns, which could helped him. But in the presentation they said, that other had more powerful friends, so the argument of the text can't be the truth.
