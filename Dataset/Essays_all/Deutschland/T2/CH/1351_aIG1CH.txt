The Chevalier de Seingalt was born 1725 and died 1798. Before he died he wrote a memoir recounting his life and adventures. The problem is that some people critices it. The Chavelier did know a lot of famous people e.g. Kings and writers. He was in lot of events to make his life more exciting and glamorous. When the Chavelier lived in Swwitzerland he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. He borrowed monexy from a Swiss merchant. Critics said that it can´t be true because why we borrowed money when he was rich. 
Some Critics are skeptical because the Chevalier said he was voltaire with a famous writer. The problem is that the conversation was written many years after that. The Chavelier wrote that he escaped the prison in Venice by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof.
