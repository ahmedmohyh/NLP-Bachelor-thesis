Chevalier de Seingalt wrote his memoirs based on his life adventures and though some critics doubt its accurate there are sources that are convinced about its accuracy.
While the text claims that his thesis about being rich and spending a lot of money on gambling and parties in Switzerland is unrealistic because he borrowed a lot of money from a merchant the audio lecture disagrees and states that while being in Switzerland Chevalier did not have swiss money because he used it for gambling or won money through gambling, needed to convert it into cash first and thus needed to borrow cash.
The second statement brought up in the text says the conversations between Voltaire and Chevalier are questionable as they were wrote down years after the real conversations so exact statements can´t be accurate as it is impossible to remember them exactly.
The audio lecture responds with the proven fact that Chevalier wrote down what he remembered as exactly as he could every night after the conversations and used his journals very often while writing the memoir.
The last questionable event given by the text is his escape from a prison in Venice.
It says that escaping through the ceiling of his cell by using a piece of metal to make a hole in it might be exaggerated as he knew many politically powerful people in Venice who could have bribed the jailers to get him out aswell.
But the audio lecture states that in the same prison in Venice many people with much more powerful friends could not escape with money so bribing is unrealistic and old prison documents say that after Chevaliers escape the ceiling had to be rebuilt, ceilings are not rebuilt if there is no damage.
