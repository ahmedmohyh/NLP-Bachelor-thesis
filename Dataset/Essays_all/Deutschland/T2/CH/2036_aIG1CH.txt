The two documents about the Chevalier come to different conclusions: The woman in the audio is convinced that the memoir of the Chevalier is reliable while the text deals with the arguments of critics who have another opinion.
The fact that the Chevalier was living in Switzerland, being really wealthy and spending a lot of money on parties is in the text described as impossible because there are many sources which show that the Chevalier borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. The woman in the audio explains that with the possibility that he just needed to wait for his money and while that he borrowed some.
Moreover critics in the text complain that the conversations between him and Voltaire connot be completely correct in his memoir because it was written many years after their conversation. The woman in the audio gives a reason why they could still be correct and that is the fact that he may have taken notes and already wrote everything down he remembered exactly the day after his coversation with Voltaire.
Last but not least critics complain that the Chevalier really broke out from prisom they are actually pretty sure that some politically well-connected friends helped him to escape. The woman in the audio is in the opinion that he escaped by making a hole in the ceiling in the roof and explains that with the fact that the ceiling was repaired after his break-out.
