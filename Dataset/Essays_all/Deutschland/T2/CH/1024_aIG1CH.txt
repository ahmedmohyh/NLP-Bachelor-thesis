For quite a long time the memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt seemed to be a reliable source to find out more about the European society during the eighteenth century but there are some critics that say those stories seem to be controversial and leave clues that those stories are just fiction.

The first point the critics make is that de Seingalt describes how wealthy he was and what a great time he had in Switzerland partying a lot. So they found documents that say de Seingalt actually had to borrow money for being able to live that kind of lifestyle. But borrowing money doesn´t have to mean to be poor constantly because others have the theory that he invested his money and just had to wait for it to work out and during that had to borrow money.
Another quentionable story is the one where he talks about his conversations with Voltair, but the it´s not the meetings the critics doubt it´s the details that make then doubt some one could actually remember that much espaacially when it´s written down years after the actual conversation. Again supporters of de Seingalt have a response because they have proof that after those conversations de Seingalt wrote everything down in one of his journals so it´s nothing controvers looking back into those and write it down properly in one his his stories.
 The last story that makes critics say the journals are just an invention is his escape from the prison in Venice because he claimed to escape with just a piece of metal through the ceiling even though he had some powerful friends that could have helped him but instead he chose that way. It´s seems quentionable for everyone but the government actually had to repair the ceiling in his cell after de Seingalt escaped why should they do that if it wasn´t because of the dramatic escape.
