The chevalier had a life with many adventures. One of them was his trip to Siwtzerland. In the text they say that he had a lot of money for parties and gambling but he had to borrow a lot from a friend to finance his lifestyle. But in the audio it is said that he didn´t need to borrow it.

In his second adventure he met with Voltaire and it is said in the text that he wrote all their conversations down  many years after their meetings but in the audio it is said that he wrote the conversations down every night immediately after talking to him.

His third adventure was when he was in prison in Venice. In the text they write that he destroyed the ceiling of the jail and escaped through the roof of the prison, but it more possible that he had important friends who helped him  to get out in a legal way, while in the audio it is said that this is more possible although the prison had to repair the ceiling after the leaving of the chevalier.
