in the speech the women said that the Chevalier de Seingalt had many conversations between him and other famous people and she didnt say that she or they criticize this conversations. They thing that this is true and important.The writers from these text critizise everything like the escape from a notorious prison but in the speech they told that this were a next important step in his life and that this is also important .Mainly the speech says that every step mr. Chevalier made was important and great and in comparison to this the text says that everything he had done was a myth and never real. for example the events he mantined in his memoir were critizised by the writer of these text and not even mantiuned by the women who told us her thoughts and facts about this memior. mainly these both sources are mainly different but had mainly the same points and arguments with other ways to see this.
