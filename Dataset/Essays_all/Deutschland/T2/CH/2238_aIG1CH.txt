The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life and worte about many meetings with impportant people of the eighteenth century. So his memoir is a very good source about how the european society lived in the eighteenth century. but many critics questinoed that Chevalier is able to remember alle the thing he wrote down, because he wrote it, on the end of his life and wrote that he remember exact phrases of  conversations. Also thne critics do not belive, that seingalt was that rich he wrote, because in other source it means that Seinaglt has to borror much money and this is one the one hand a sign that he is nit that rich as he seems to be, but maybe he borror money to pay his thing on point and pays the money back when he has get his money from others. In the eigtheenth century it was normal that you have to wait a few days to get your money.
