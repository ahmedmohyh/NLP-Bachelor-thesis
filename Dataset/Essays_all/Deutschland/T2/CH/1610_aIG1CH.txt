The Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798 and wrote an autobiography to reflect on the events of his life. His memoir is often referred to when it comes to European society, because it is said that it contains important information about it. However people started to question if his memoir really recounts the truth of what has happend in his life. 
In his memoir the Chevalier claims that he was rich while he lived in Switzerland, but people found out that he borrowed large sums of money from a Swiss merchant. However the presentation tries to deny that by saying that because he wasn't originally from Switzerland he had to get his money exchanged, so it took a while to arrive. And because he wanted to attend parties and gamble he borrowed money from a merchant and payed it back to him as soon as his own money arrived. 
Another event that raises question is wether his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire are accurate, because no human being is able to remember that many details about conversation they had years ago. The presentation is contradicting that explanation, saying that the Chevalier wrote down everything he remembered of a conversation each night and that in his memoir he just referred to his old notes. Acquaintences also claim that the Chevalier regularly kept journals and diaries.
Another question arises when talking about his escape from prison. The Chevalier claims that he escaped by destroying the ceiling of his cell to make his memeoir more enjoyable and exciting to read. Most critics believe that he just asked friends of his who had something to say politacally who were able to offer a bribe. However soon after he escaped the prison the ceiling of his cell needed to be repared. Another argument that the Chevalier is telling the truth about him fleeing is the fact that other inmates probably had good connections to politics too and they weren't able to escape by asking them.
