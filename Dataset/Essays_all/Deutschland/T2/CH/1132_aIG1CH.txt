First of all, the text is about the long memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798. He was a controversial figur and met many famous people, but the text says that Chevalier distorted many events in his memoir, so that it is not really a historical source. And in the presentation the woman said that memoirs could not be 100% correct, but it could be historical important. The text said, that Chevalier could not be wealthy, because he borrowed money, but in the presantation was said that he was wealthy and just had to wait until the money arrived. Another point in the text was that, the conversation between himself and the famous writer Voltaire can not be real, because they did not met or even talk to each other, but the presantation said that, they have met and Chevalier wrote down some phrases after ther conversation, so he had not to remember the conversation many years later he just could look at it again. The last point was that Chevalier said he escaped from the prison in Venice, but the text said that his jailers were bribed to free him, but the woman in the presantation said that his cell needs a repair after he was no more in ther, so it has to be that he took a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and then climed trough the roof. Why should the cell getting rapaird, if he bribed himself out of prison, also if he had politically connections in Venice how could have offered a bribe.
