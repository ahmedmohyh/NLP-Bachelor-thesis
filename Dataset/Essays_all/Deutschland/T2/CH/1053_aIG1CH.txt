First they say that no memoir is correct.
In the text tey say that the Chevalier can't be rich if he borrowed money. In the prensantation they said that thge Chevalier had to sell things to get mor money. But this takes some time so the Chevalier borrowed so money and gave it back if he got the money for the things he selled.
In the text they don't believe that the Cevalier met the famous writer Voltaire. In the presentation they said that the Chevalier wrote everything down what he remembered. So it is possible that he can remember some exat phrases of the conversation.
At the end they criticised that the Chevalier couldn't escape form prison like he said. In the presentation they said that the Chevalier hasn't so much power that his friends help to bribed him.
