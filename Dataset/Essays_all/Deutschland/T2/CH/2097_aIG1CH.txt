The written text and the presentation I heard tell both about the Chevalier de Seingalt. 
In the written text it is said that the Chevalier wrote a long memoir recounting his life and the adventures. In the presentation I heard it says that the Chevalier only wrote down what he remember, so it means that he didn't write a memoir with all things he has done. 
In the written text it also says that the Chevaliers memoir has become a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century since he met famous people including kings and writers. So you think that he has so many famous friends like no one else. But in the presentation I heard it says that there are also other people who has more poerful friends.
