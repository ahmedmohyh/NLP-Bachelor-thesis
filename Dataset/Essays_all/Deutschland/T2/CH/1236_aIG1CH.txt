In the text it says that Chevalier isn´t really rich because he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. But in the ("Vortrag") the woman say that in Switzerland a person must wait for his money. Thus Chevalier was rich but hadn´t got his money when he was need it. So he borrowed money.
The second example in the text says that Chevalier hadn´t talk with Voltair and that Chevalier lie in this case. The writer give the reason, that Chevalier couldn´t learn all the phrases of the conversation and put them few years later in his memoir. But the woman in the presentation says that Chevalier took notes thus he can´t forget the phrases of the conversation. Chevalier is a person who takes lots of notes of his life and put them later in his memoir.
The third critic in the text means that Chevalier has contacts to important politicans which bribed the jailers to let out Chevalier. Again the woman is against the arguments of the text. She says that in the jail were people who are more famous than Chevalier and they have more contacts to important politicans but they never came out of jail. So he must escape the prison by desrtoying the  ceiling with a peace of metall and climbing the roof. It says, that the jail must repair ceilings and all other things which Chevalier did.
