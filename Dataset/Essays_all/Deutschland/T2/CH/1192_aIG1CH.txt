It is questionable if the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingnalt is an accurate historical source. 
The Chevalier claimed to be very rich but lent a lot of maney from a Swiss merchant. In the presantation it is said that he just needed to wait for his money to arrive os he took a lone. Critics say that he wasn´t wealthy and just acted like he was.
The Chevalier´s recorded conversations with Voltaire are also sceptizised because he wrote them down years after the actual conversation. According to the presentation the Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember the same evening he talked with Voltaire and refered to these notes while writing his memoir.
The Chevalier ones escaped from a prison. In his memoires he wrote that he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling but critics think it´s more likely that friends of the Chevalier gave the jailers money to free him. But, according to the presentation, there were aother prisoners with more powerful friends than the Chevalier. Also his cell had to be repaired after his escape. 
The presentation gives some points that could make the not so accurate facts more beliveable.
