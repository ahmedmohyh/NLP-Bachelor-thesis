Chevalier, what was right and what was wrong?

Chevalier de Seingalt, who wrote long memoirs about his life, is someone you could trust or not, because some of his storys aren't as correct as it seems. 
The text says basically, he isn't a reliable source and the audio refence says it is. 
Just look at the first example. The text says Chevalier wasn't rich at all, because he had to borrow money. On the other hand the audio sequence says that in Switzerland it is normal to borrow money, because first of all he had to wait for his money from home. So the story can really be true.
Furthermore some people complain that his memoirs can't be captured with so much detail, but the audio scene says of cause it can. Chevalier is famous for his notes he is taking all the time.
The last example for the differnece between the text and the audio sequence is his escape from the prison.
Critics claims that it is impossible and he wrote it only fore the amusement. 
The audio sequence instead says it is real, beacause after his escape the sceling had to be repaired, what would be a hint for his escape.
Thus there are some points, which can be seen from different angels of view.
