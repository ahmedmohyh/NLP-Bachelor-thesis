In the election the narrator relates to the story of the Chevalier de Seingalt. She tells more about the points mentioned in the text. Chevalier is a controversial figure, and many people think that his life wasnt that exciting like it was told. The women tells points that his life was like this in real. She tells, that he have to borrow money because he have to wait until his money has come. So he was very wealthy. In the text they thought that he could not be wealthy when he has to borrow money. In the speech the women tells the truth about this story. 
The second story, were Chevalier remembers the conversations with Voltaire is also right. The women in the speech said that Chevalier wrote down theconversations and kept them. Like this he can remember the conversations a long time. 
The third point, that Chevalier escaped out of the prison in Venice is in the text impossible. But in the speech she told that the seeling in the prison cell of Chevalier has to be fixed. So if he hass not escaped like this, there would not be a seeling, that has to be fixed. 
As a result we can see, that the author of the text thinks that Chevalier´s life can not happened like this. But in the speech we learn more about the three events that took place in Chevaliers life, and that they can be correct.
