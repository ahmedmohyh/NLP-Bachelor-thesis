The lecture argued that the Chevalier's memoir is mostly correct, as there are a few arguments that prove the historical accuarcy of the events. The Chevalier mentioned in his memoir that he was wealthy which some critics argue against because he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But that does not neccesarily indicate him being poor as this was typical at the time. 
Another argument for the historical accuracy is the conversation with Voltaire. Critics say that it is impossible to remember smallest details of conversations held many years before writing the memoir but in the lecture it is mentioned that the Chevalier made notes every evening after he had the conversation with Voltaire and thus still knew all the detailes when writing the memoir. 
The prison escape is unlikely false because bribery, which critics claim to be the way of escaping, could not help other prisoners with better connections than the Chevalier so it wouldn't have helped him either. Additionally the prison had to repair the Chevalier's cell ceiling shortly after the escape, meaning his story must be correct.
