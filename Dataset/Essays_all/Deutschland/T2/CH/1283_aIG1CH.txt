The facts I just heard doesnt fit to those in the text. Both sources are dealing with the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. In the presentation a woman talked about some parts of the memoirs which the text declares as invented. She says that the memoir really is an accurate source about European society back in the 18th century. The author of the text says that some events of Chevalier didnt happen like he wrote and that he wantet to make his life seem more interesting. The first event the woman talkes about is his rich life in Switzerland. The text says he wasnt really wealthy as he wrote because he got money from another man. But the woman in the presentation says that his life in Switzerland was that kind of rich and wealthy life which began with borrowing money. The woman also says that it was written to that time he said. The third thing she metioned is that he really must have escaped from the prison in Venice because the of the fact that the jail had to repair his ceiling about the time. All in all the connection between the presentation I heard and the text I read is that the presentation tried to keep all the voices of the critics towards this memoir down by giving arguments that support his stories.
