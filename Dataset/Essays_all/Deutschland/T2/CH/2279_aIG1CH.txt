Chavalier de Seingalt was born in 1725 and died in 1798.He was a rich man who lived in Switzerland an did a lot of parties with his huge among of money. For these parties he often  borrows his money from other person although he was rich. In same nights he spoke with Voltaire and tried on day later to remembder all the information to write them down.Chavalier escaped from  the prsion of Venice and after that the prison owners needed to repair the ceilling.
In the audio story it doesnt get clear how chavalier escaped out of prison. It was just said that maybe his friend helped him, but in the text they sai that he made a hole in his ceiling and climbed out of the roof. On other point is that Chavalier wrote the conversation as fast as is was possible down because he wanted to save the information of the conversation. In the text they say that Chavalier never spoke with Voltaire because some notes were found many years after the conversation. Nobody could remember exact phrases after many years.Furthermore he borrowed his money in the text from Swiss merchant and in the audio text from some friends.
