The Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798. He wrote a long memoir about his life and the adventures he had been lived trough. His memoir has become a hostorical source about european society in the eighteenth century. Many critics said that the chevalier has written many facts which are wrong just to make his life sounds more exciting than it really was. For example he wrote that he has been very rich and that he didnt had to need to borrow money anyway.He also wrote that he spent a lot of money for partys and events even if that are wrong facts about himself.

In reality the chevalier wasnt rich. 
He wasnt poor but also he wasnt rich as he claimed in his memoir. Even if no memoir could be hundred percent correct the chevalier wrote too many wrong facts down in his memoirs. The chevalier had written down all from the night of the big conversation with voltaire even if there are wrong facts.
In his memoirs he had written that he lived in Switzerland an he lived very wealthy.In reality he escaped ther from prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling an he climbed out of the roof top.
