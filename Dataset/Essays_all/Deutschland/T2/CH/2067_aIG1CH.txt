The text and the spelling part are about the question, if the stories in the memoir of Chevalier really happened. They offered three aspects, which should show that Chevalier lied in his memoir.

The first aspect is about his money. He told, that he was really rich and spended a lot of money on parties in Switzerland. However it is known that he borrowed his money and people, who are really rich, don't need to borrow money.

In the second one Chevalier writes about his conversation with Voltair. Critics think that no person can remember a conversation so exactly, that he can write it down many years after.

The last part is about Chevaliers time in prison and about his controversal escape. This was possible, because Chevalier was well connected. However critics found out that many people, who were in prison were better connected than Chevalier. So they should also escaped, but they don't.
