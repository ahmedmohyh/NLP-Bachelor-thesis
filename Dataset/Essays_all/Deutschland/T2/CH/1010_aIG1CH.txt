The just heard audio and the text above treat the same theme, the Chevalier de Seingalt, but they disagree. So the following text sums up the arguments of the audio and explains the differences to the text.

In the audio it was said that the memoirs of the Chevalier are accurate. So as he was in Switzerland he wasn't poor at all, he just had to wait for his money to arrive. So at first he had to borrow some money, but he had the possibilty to give it back a few days later. In the text the theme is treated differntly. There it's said that if he was that wealthy it wouldn't have been necessary for him to borrow money. 
Furthermore, it is explained in the audio, that as he was in prison there were people who had more politically well-connected friends then he had. After he escaped the ceiling had to be repared so they believe that the Chevalier escaped by making a hole in the ceiling. But the writer of the text has got a differnt opinion about this. He is in the believe that he could escape because of his politically well-connected friends. 

So all in all one can see that there are different viwes on the Chevalier.
