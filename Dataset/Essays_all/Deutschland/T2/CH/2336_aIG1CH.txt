In this following text I'm going to explain the arguments to the memoir of Chelvalier de Seingalt. 
At the beginning the womann sad that most memoir aren't correct but the one from Chevalier de Seingalt was very correct with the information and stuff like that. The woman talked about his life in Switzerland. She explained that Chevalier wasen't poor. In Switzerland it's normal to spend much money on parties and gambling. Sometimes he had to borrow money when he has to wait untill his money arrived, but she also sad that this wasen't because he was poor, that's just life in Switzerland. This explaination is a bit different to the inforation in the text. 
She also talked about his escape form the Venetian prison. She sad most of the prisoners was stronger than him but they weren't good enought to escape from the prison but Chervalier de Seingalt was.
