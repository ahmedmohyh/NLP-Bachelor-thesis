In the recording many things are said who are in total contrast to the text. At first it is explained that borrowing money in the ancient Switzerland dodn't mean that the person was poor. The woman says that Chevalier could have been rich because he sold things, but selling things takes its time and if he had to wait to sell the things, Chevalier could have been in need to borrow some money.
The second argument, that Chevalier couldn't have remembered every single part of a conversation he had years ago, is explained with notes. They are sources who prove that Chevalier often took notes and that could be the reason why he could have been able to write so detailled about this conversation in his memoir.
The story of his escape from the prison in Venice could also be real because it is known that many other prisoners in that prison also had powerful friends but not one of them escaped. So Chevalier must have found another way to escape and that could have been the ceiling. Another proof for the last story is the fact that days after Chevalier escaped the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired an what else could be the reason for that if it hadn't been broken during an escape?
Like this it is explained in the recording. in many ways it is the total contrast to the text.
First of all the text doesnt't give any possible reasons for the borrowed money while the recording explains the background of it. 
Second the text doesn't mention the notes Chevalier could have possibly taken, it seems that the writer of the text rates the memories of Chevalier and doesn't think of another reason.
And last the writer doesn't believe that a such story of an escape could habe been so adventorous like Chevalier describes it while in the recording there are mentioned reasons for that.
