Thank you for your study! It´s a good method to me to avoid math lessons and makes me feel like I already have holidays. I had some problems regarding my notes; The piece of paper isn´t big enough for my method of note-taking. It´s a pitty that this program does not enable to copy&paste parts of my own text, to me it seems difficult to write a good text with a structure by the first run.In consequence,  I don´t feel comfortable to bes serious although I like your work. Nevertheless, measuring English Skills on a professional level seems to be rediculous if we take into account that our English lessons can´t be taken serious. It isn´t human  to measure English skills if this kind of data is used to create a plan for evaluating someone´s grates. Eenglish lessons are horrible and noone likes them. The didactical conceps don´t match the student´s life realities. I don´t expect much people having probelms with English to take part in this study, the paticipants in the rooming where I´m sitting prove this. In consequenze, the results will probably have an empiric base, but won´t represent the reality. 
Reading the same text,s for the second time isn´t motivating.
