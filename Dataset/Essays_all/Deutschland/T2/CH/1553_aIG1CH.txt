The Chevalier of Seingalt is meant to be an accurate and reliable historical source. However, there is a lot of controversy about the memoir he wrote during his last years.
In his memoir, the Chevalier wrote that he was rich during his time in Switzerland. Critics doubt that because it is known that the Chevalier borrowed money from a merchant to pay for parties and gambling. Defeaters of the Chevalier argue that a loan does not necessarily mean he was poor but that he needed the money during the times before he was paid.
The second doubt is about the Chevalier's conversation with Voltaire in his memoir. Critics know that they both had a conversation but say that it can not be as he wrote in his memoir because the conversation was much earlier. Again, there are arguments against this statement. Some say that the Chevalier took notes while talking to Voltaire and kept these for a long time, so that he could use them for his memoir.
Another episode from the Chevalier's memoir is about his refuge from a Venetian prison. The Chevalier states that he managed to escape through a hole he had made into the ceiling. Doubts are raised saying the Chevalier had many influencing friends in Venice, who could have helped him easily. Believers cite witnesses who saw a hole in the ceiling of the Chevalier's cell. Besides that, many prisoners had influencing friends and never came free.
