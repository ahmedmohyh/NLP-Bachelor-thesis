The speach I have heard is about the Chevalier de Seingalt and his stories of life. And now i am going to summerize this up and say what this speach has to do with the given text. First the Chevalier went to Switzerland and spendet some time there with parties and mnany other cheap adventures. So that everyone thought he would be rich but in real he is poor and had to borrow some moeny from other people. The second point was the conversation between himselfe and some famous persons or writers. These coversations are been critizised very hard. The last mentioned story was that he could escape from the Venetian prison. This is also been critisized very hard because it is said that it is not as an big deals as it seams to be when you say you escaped from a prison. He did it for his freedom but everyone has the right of freedom.
So in the end the Chevalier told "fake" stories of his life, like that he is rich or that he could escape out of an prison, to impress the people so that he comes more famous but behinde these stories he is poor and all these thigs that he did are not really big deals. 
Well the speach could not really poiont this ,as good as the text did it, out.
