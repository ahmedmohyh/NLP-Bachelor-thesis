In the text, the Chevalier is criticised for inventing the fact he was very wealthy while living in Swirtzerland. But this is true. The reason why critics think he was not wealthy is that it took a few days until he got his money and that's why he had to borrow some from the merchant.
Another point that he is criticised for is that he couldn't remember his conversations with Voltaire after so many years. But, according to the speech, the Chevalier wrote everything down that he could remember directly after the conversation took place. He used these notes for his memoir several years later.
In addition to that, the critics have questioned his escape from the prison in Venice as depicted in the text. They think that he got help of his jailers who had got money of his mightful friends to free him instead of having escaped by making a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal. But it is impossible that he has not escaped on his own because the room he escaped from was damaged. Furthermore, many other people, who had been in jail with him, had more mightful friends who didn't help them to escape.
