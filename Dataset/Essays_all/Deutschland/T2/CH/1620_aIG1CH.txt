The first point is, that the Chevalier de Seingalt spent alot of money for gambling and on parties. However the text says that he couldn´t be as rich as he mentioned in his own memoir, because he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But  actually the problem was that it took a lot of time to convert his money in Switzerland, so he had to wait a long period of time, but he spent a lot of many into gambling ánd just needed quickly new one, so he just had to borrow some money from a merchant. Also the merchant would never borrowed him the money if he would be poor and couldnt pay the money back.
Another point of his memoir was the escape out of the Vetetian prison. In his memoir it says, that he escaped with a piece of metal through the ceiling. The crtics to this point say, that the Chevalier had a lot of supporter in Venice which offered a bribe for him, but at this time there were a lot of people in this prison, who had a lot of supporter and friends with high ranks in the society, which never offered a bribe to them. Another argument against the crit is, that the prison itself had to repair the ceiling of his chamber after the Chevalier escaped, so his story is probaly the truth.
