In the following i shall state how the arguments mentioned in the lecture and the ones mentioned in the text stand in converse to each other.
First of all the text goes in a direction in which the Chevalier de Seingalt appears to be a somewhat shady person in most aspects. In contrast to that the lecture basically states the exact opposite.
While most memoires are considered to be incorrect the ones from Chevalier are said to be mostly realiable. One reason is the taking of notes on his side. While the text states that his memoires are unreliable because the author thinks that the memoires of his conversations with Voltaire were written down a lot later than the actual converation took place, the lecturer mentions Chevaliers notes. Those notes are said to be written right after the actual conversations. In his memoires he refers to this knowledge and due to this his memoires are considered to be accurate. Another point supposedly proving his sincereness is his escape out of a prison in Venice. The lecturer mentions that his escpape through the ceiling is likely because of the matter of fact that there were also people a lot more powerful than him, who could never escape the prison as well as governmental documents stating that the ceiling in his cell had to be repared shortly after his outbreak. In contarst to that the text states that this way of escaping the prison is unlikely. Referring to the text there had to be some kind of help from the outside. 
Both of the sources are basically contrasting each other.
