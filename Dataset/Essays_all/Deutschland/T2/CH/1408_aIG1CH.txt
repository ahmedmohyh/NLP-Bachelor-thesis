The memoirs of the chevalier are accurate as well as they are a reliable historical source and there are many points which can proof that. 

The theory that he was a poor person, which is stated in the text, is not true at all, because he earned money by selling properties. But untill he received that money, he obviously needed money, especially because he made many partys. This shows that the fact, that he borrowed many, doesn't mean that he was poor. 

A second point are his conversations with Voltaire. After the conversations with Voltaire, he wrote everything down he remembered about those conversations and used those notes to write his memoir. The text is contradictory towards the informations mentioned above, because critics belive that it is not possible to remember exact phrases from the conversation with voltaire, especially because he wrote his memoir a long time after those conversations.

Regarding his escape from the prision in Venice it is very likely that it actually happened, because other prisioners had more and better connections to other politics or wealthy people and they couldn't get out of the prision. Besides they had to repare the place where the Chevalier stayed, after he escaped, which is another proof that he did escape in this way from the prision. This side of the story is once again in contrast to the text, because in the text critics claim that the Chevalier invented the story with the escape from the prision, because it is more interesting for the reader. Moreover critics state, that he used his connections to get out of thew prison, which is also in contrast to the information mentioned before. 

Concluding the text and the other presentation about the Chevalier show to different sides of his story. The text criticzes the Chevalier, the presentation explains why his memoirs are accurate and arguments against the text.
