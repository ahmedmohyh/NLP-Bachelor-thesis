Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir about his life aand his adventures, which become a valuable historical source of the European society. The memoir has many critics,who say that he lied about the storys in his memoire to make his life more exciting. They also say that he wans't rich because he has to borror money from a Swiss mechant.That isn't true because he was wealthy but had more powerful friends that offert him this chance. 
The criics are also sceptical about the accuracy of the conversations that the chevalier records because the memoir was written years affter that.It could be that he just kept his notes for many years.
Critics questioned if he really escaped frome the prison in Venice. But it is writtenm in old reports of the prison that they had to repair his cell after he got out.
