The texts says that the Chevalier had to burry money while living in Switzerland although he said that he was very wealthy. The woman in the audition part disagreed with this argument. She said that it is a fact that the Chevalier gave many parties and spent a lot of many while living in Switzerland. because of spending so much money he had to get to wait till he gets money from home. In this time he had borrowed money from others.
The next argument in the text was that the Chevalier was not able to  remeber his conversation with Voltaire, because it happend many years before the Chevalier wrote his memoir. In the audition part they said that this is not a fact and it is known from ladies who had lived with the Chevalier that he wrote notes after coversations like the one with Voltair and that he used those when writing the memoir.
The last disagreeing argument from the audition part is that in the prison in Venice also other persons were who had more friends with influence and good connections, but did not bribe. So it is not possible that the Chevalier brided and it is also know that they had to repair the ceiling after the Chevalier escaped. Instead the text says that he was bribed and it is not possible to escape from the prison with a pice of metal
