The Women in the adio spoke about three different events that are also mentioned in the given text about the Chevalier, she is giving arguments supoorting the position that the memoir of the Chavelier is a belivable historicle source. While the women thinks that the memoir is belivable, the text is more critical towards the Caveliers memoir.

Event one: Chevalier borrows money from a swiss merchant.

The women in the audio claims that the Cavelier wasn´t poor, because he owned a lot of property. While he stayed in Swisserland he had to wait for his money to arrive, because his property had to be sold first, before he could recive his money, which doesn´t make him poor.

Event two: The conversation with Voltair.

The text doubts the accurasy of the conversation, which is writen down in the caverliers memoir, because it has been written down years after the conversation took place. In the adio they claim that the Cavelier noted down evrything that he could remember from the conversation and that he used these notes and referred to him while he wrote his memoir. Poeple that knew the Cavelier proved that he used notes to write his memoir.

Event three: The Caveliers escape from a Venive Prison:

In the memoir of the cavelier the Cacelier claims that he broke out of the Venive prison by using a peace of metal to bot a whole in the roof of his cell,which he used to escape. That texts doubts this statement, because the Cavelier had a lot of powerfull friends in Venice and that those bribed him. In the audio the women sys that there were people in the Venice prison with even mire powerfull friends that did not manage to escpe making the birbe unreaalistic. In the audio they think That the Cavelier is telling the truth because there is evidens that the roof of his cell had to be repaired, after he escpaed from the prison.


After all we can say the text doubts the moirs acurracy but the audio belives in it
