The lecutre argued that the memoir was pretty accurate. It used the three main parts of the memoir also used in the text. The first was Chevalier´s life in Switzerland. The lecture argued that his borrowed sums of money have not to be a sign of poverty. He was wealthy but had to sell his assests before he could get his money and when he had to wait for his money he had to borrow it to go on with gambling. In the text was the borrowing a clear sign for  poverty.
The second part was on his conversations with Voltaire. Critics e.g. the one in the text said that his record cannot be accurte because it was written years after the actual conversations occured. On the contrary the lecture argued that Chevalier himself claimed taking notes after every conversation and using them for the memoir. Aquaintances of his confirmed his usage of notes and journals for his memoir.
The third and last part was on his escape from a prison in Venice. Chevalier claimed he had used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and escaped that way. Critics argue that it was more likely a friend of his offered the jailers  a bribe. But the lecture saud that others prisoners had way more powerful friends and were not freed that way. Further more one can read in old documents that after Chevalier´s escape the ceiling in his cell had to be repaired and his hole was a very likely reason.
In conclusion the lecture argued that the memoir was accurate and text argued against it.
