In the text about the Chevalier de Seingalt the critics doubt the accuracy of his memoir while in the lecture they say that the memoir is rather correct. 
The first thing the writers of the text question is his living standart while he stayed in Switzerland. Chevalier wrote in his memoir that he was very wealthy and that he spent a great amount of money on gambling. The writers question this because back then he had to borrow money as well. The lecturer on the other side claims that he only ran out of cash after spending too much money on parties and gambling and that this can not be considered as poor.
Then the writers doubt the accuracy of his conversations between himself and Voltaire. While they say that he had written the memoir many years after the conversations took place the lecturer explains that Chevalier wrote everything down  in form of notes or journals right after the conversations had happened.
The last thing the writers claim differently than the lecturer is Chevalier's escape from a prison in Venice, Italy.
They say that it did not happen the way the Chevalier wrote down which would be that he used a metal to make a hole into the ceiling and then escaped trough the roof but that he had many friends in Venice who offered him a bribe.
The lecturer claims that no one, not even the prisoners with the most friends, was able to bribe so that would be impossible. Also the prison had to repaire the ceiling of Chevalier's prisoner cell after his escape which would be explained by the way Chevalier described his escape.
