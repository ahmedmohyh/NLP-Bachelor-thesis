The text about Chevalier de Seingalt who lived from 1725 till 1798, is about the critics about his memoir which is a important source about the historic life in Europe in the eighteenth century.
The critics are about the accuracy of the source. A big critic says that his life was not so exiting like he imagened. He only made them more exiting for getting a important person for the history. An example is that he wrote abouut his life in Switzerland. He was very wealthy and spend much money for partys and gamblings. The critics are saying that he had to borrow money wich not stand for a wealthy life. His friends should be kings or famous writers but they were not so powerful like he wrote. A conversation with the famous writer Voltaire caannot be like he wrote  it because it was written years after that. What is questioned by the critics too is the memoir of his escape of the prison in Venice. He wrote that he only had a piece of metal he used to make a hole in the roof to escape. The critics are saying that the other jailers were bribed to free him. His version is only for enjoyable reading.
