The text and the audio, both are about the Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798. In the end of his life, he wrote a long memoir about his life. Today, this memoir is an interesting historical source about European society, but there are also some critics about it.

Like told in the text, Chevalier had a lot of money and as he spent his time in Switzerland, he spent a lot of it into partys. But he had also borrow sums of money from a merchant there. If he was rich, he would not have to borrow money from a merchant. In the audio, they are defending Chevalier, he had to borrow money, yes, but he was also rich. The reason why he had to borrow money was the problem of different types of money between the countries.
The second point was his conversation with Voltaire. The text critizes, he could not remember all words of his conversation exactly.
The third point, which is critizised, is his escape from a prison in Venice. The text argues, Chevalier could had escaped with military help and he did not escape through the roof. Also he had a lot of political well-connected friends in Venice. The audio disagrees, that he had not enough power to free himself with his military help.

In the end, Chevalier will always have some mysteries around his person and around his memoir. But until we know more about him, it will take more time.
