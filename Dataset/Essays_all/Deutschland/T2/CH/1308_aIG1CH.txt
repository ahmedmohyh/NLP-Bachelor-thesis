In the explanation I just witnessed a woman addressed the validity and accuracy of Chevalier de Seingalt's long and controversial memoires, stating that although his memoires can't be fully accurate, they are still a relatively accurate and also very valuable resource that gives us more insight into European society in the 18th century.
She specifically talks about 3 "episodes" that were doubted in the text: Firstly, Chevalier states that he lived a very wealthy life in Switzerland and spent a lot of money on parties and gambling, however it is proven that he also borrowed a lot of that money from a merchant. The woman explains that his wealth lied in his property; it took days to convert that into money so whilst Chevalier was waiting for the sums to arrive, he had to borrow the money from someone else. Secondly, it is stated that conversations between Chevalier and the famous author Voltair were written down by Chevalier many years later, however that ought to be impossible considering the fact that no one can remember any conversation in full detail after that much time has passed. Here the lady says that Chavelier wrote down every conversation he had had as accurately as possible right after it finished, allowing him to later consult those notes in order to fully convey the conversations in the way they were carried out.
Thirdly, in his memoires Chevalier wrote that he broken out of a notorious prison in Venice, Italy by drilling a hole in the ceiling - using a piece of metal - and climbing through the roof. That is doubted by critics who assume that the jailers were bribed by Chevalier's friends to free him. The female person argues that many other prisoners had even more powerful friends than Chevalier did yet none of them managed to escape from prison, so there was most likely no bribery involved. Also, it was later written in Venician prison documents that Chevalier's prison ceiling had to be repaired, strongly indicating that Chevalier did indeed flee by escaping through the ceiling.
