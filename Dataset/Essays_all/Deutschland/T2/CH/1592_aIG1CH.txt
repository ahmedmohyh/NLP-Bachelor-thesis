The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt shall be a reliable and pretty accurate historical source - though of course not everything is completely realistic. There are different things and events mentioned in the memoir some critics are skeptical about: Chevalier wrote about being very wealthy when he lived in Switzerland though he had to borrow money, as it is said and criticised in the text. But in that time it was typical that you waited some time to get the money you have earned, so in the meantime Chevalier had to borrow something - but he shall have been wealthy.
Another fact critics are skeptical about is the accuracy the conversations he has had with Voltaire and has written down many years afterwards when writing his memoir. The critics think that it is imopossible to write down conversations years after having them. But it is known that Chevalier wrote down parts of his conversations with Voltaire in the night after having them and used these notes to write his memoir.
A last fact the critics are unsure about is Chevalier´s escape from a prison in Italy. As it is said in the text, he writes that he escaped by using a piece of metal which is doubted by critics who are of the opinion that his jailers were bribed by Chevalier´s wealthy friends to free him. But actually the ceiling in Chevalier´s cell was repaired after he escaped and other people in the jail had even more well-connected friends, so it is likely that Chevalier did rally escape like he has written it down.
In the text there are many points criticised, as in the listening text. But in the listening text these criticised facts are seen from many different points of views, which is not the case in the other text.
