In the following text I am going to sumarise the arguments from the speech I have listened to and compare them to the arguments in the written text.

In the speech the woman talks about the life of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) and points ot arguments against the doubts of some critics.
She says that Chevalier was very rich when he lived in Switzerland but he needed to borrow money because the money he gets from selling thing arrives a few days later. For those few days he needed money from other people. In the text the critics just say that he neededd to borrow money and because of that he couldn't be rich.
The woman also says that every evening Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember from his conversation  with Voltaire. He kept those notes and wrote all down years later but still remembers everything because of the notes. The critics say that his text about the conversations with Voltair can't be completely true because you cannot remember phrases from a conversation which happend many years ago. They do not talk about those notes.
The last argument the women pointed out was that the ceiling of his cell in the notorious prison in Venice needed to be repaired after he escaped. It shows that there was some damage and it is likely that it is because of Chevalier. And that there were other prisoners who have more powerful and rich friends and even those friends could bribe them free. The critics do not talk about repairing of the ceiling. They just talk about his rich friends bribing him free.
