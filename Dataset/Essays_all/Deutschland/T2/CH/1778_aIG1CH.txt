According to the presenatation the memoir of Chevalier de Steingald is a relieable historic source. Thats because he writes down his daily experience down every night, so his notes are correct altrough he has written the memoir years after his adventueres. The text says that the Chevalier coulnt be rich because he had to  borrow money in Switzerland. The presentation defends the Chevalier because its said that the Chevalier only had to borrow money, because he had spend all the money he had with him and because it takes some time during that period of time to bring him more of his money, he he had to borrow some to continue to live in wealthy. The presentation is stating that the Chevalier didnt came out of the prison, like it is said in the text, because of his powerfull friends. At the same time like the Chevalier there where persons in the prison wich had even more powerfull friends and they didnt came free. In his memoir the Chevalier says that he escaped out of the prison by digging a hole in the roof. According to the presentation there is a police report which says that the roof of the prison had to be repaired after the Chevalier escaped. So the text mentiones things why the memoir of the Chevalier is full of lies and the presentation says why the things that are mentioned in the text are false and says that its realistic that everything  which is stated in the memoir is correct.
