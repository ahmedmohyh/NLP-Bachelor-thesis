In the following I will point out the arguments from the listening part and the text. 
In the text is told, that memoirs from Chevalier de Seingalt are not really accurate, because he makes his life more exiting then it was. For example is talking about that he is rich, but have to borrow his money. And he is writing a memoir about an event which is many years in the past, but know exectlly phrases from the conversation. So in the text is written, that the memoirs can not be used as a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. 
In the listining part were told that the memoirs are an accurate historical source, because for example it does not mean that he was not rich, just because he borrows money. It was told, that it was usuall in the past, that it taken 3-4 days to become his money, so just because someone borrows monex, does not mean, that he is not rich.
And the reason why he is able to know phrases word for word from a concersation which is a few years in the past is, that he maked his some notes while the conversation and was so able to write so accurate abot the event.
