The given presentacion answered to several points which the given text contained. 
First of all the text doubts the truthfulness and accuracy of the memoir in general, yet it's well known that no memoir can be exact accurate. 
Chavelier de Seingalt's memoir though is pretty accurate, as it's said in the presentacion.
Critics doubt that Chavelier was rich since itÄs proven that he borrowed money back then in Switzerland.
But borrowing money does not prove that he was poor. 
He was wealthy, but back then it took some time to recieve money from the bank. So once he ran out of money he borrowed some while waiting for bank to transfer his money and that has nothing to do with being poor.
The accuracy of  the conversations is also doubted, yet it is proven by people who knew him that he kept notes from conversations he had and later on refered to those.
And bribing wasn't involved with his escape from the prison in Venice. People who also were in that prison had much more influencial connections yet weren't able to escape. 
The celiling in the room he stayed at had to be prepared which emphasizes the accuracy of him having escaped the prison by using a piece of metal that he used for digging a hole in the ceiling.
