In the text three arguments are given to proove, that the Chevalier's memoirs are inaccurate.

The first one is, that he claimed to be rich, whilst living in swiss. He had in fact spent lots of money there, but there is evidence, he borrowed money from a swiss merchant. The lecturer stated, that that does not mean, the Chevalier was poor. In fact, he had to wait for his money, since he was rich in property, not in cash. So to be able to spend money, he was about to get later, he borrowed some actual cash.

The second piece of evidence is, that he wrote down his conversations with Voltaire, which actually happened, many years after they happened. No one could remember each word from a converation several years before. But there is an argument against this. The Chevalier has made notes after each converation, to remember them later, which was confirmed by other people knowing him.

The third and last argument, he only wrote that he escaped from a Venitian prison to make his story more interesting, but actually was bribed by friends with much influence, has also a counterpart. Other prisoners of the time had even more influencial friends and were still not bribed. Furthermore, documents were found, that the prison had to repair the ceiling of the Chevalier's cell. That may be, because he fled like he described it, making a hole in the ceiling and climb through the roof. 243
