There are many mysterious events in the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, which are often discussed in regard of their accurancy.
While critics say he lied about his richness because of the borrowing of money from a Swiss merchant, others explain that with a run out of cash. And as he was waiting for money which he obviously has always had, he borrowed something to that point.
The Chevalier always immediatly noted down every conversation with Voltaire and refered to them several times in his memoir. However critics doubt the accurancy of these conversations because they appear much more lately in the memoir than when they actually took place.
The Chevalier is said to have escaped from a prison in Venice with a little piece of metal which he used to destroy the ceiling. Critics mostly agree on the theory he escaped with the help of some friends in Venice what others argument with a venice document that says there was a repairing of the ceiling after his escape. In addition it is said to be unrealstic that other prisoners with even more powerful friends weren't able to escape.
