Critics doubt certain aspects of the Chevaliers memoir, because they seem to have found contradictory information.

As for his life in Switzerland, where he claimed to be very rich and wealthy spending a lot of money on parties and gambling, but evidence showed he borrowed also a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. Now the point is, there is no evidence that Chevalier did not give him the money back, so he might had a time in a month, where he had to wait for his income and so borrowed it somewhere else repaying it immediately when his money arrived.
Another contradiction seems to be that the dialogues he had with Voltaire are to be found in his memoir word for word, written down several years later. Some people claim he wrote their dialogues down later the day they held them and tried to reconstruct it word for word, as good as he could and kept them for many years. So with these notes, it would have been very easy to write that part of the memoir, because he would just have had to copy it.
The third point is the Chevaliers escape from the prison in Venice: According to his memoir, he made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal and climbed through it, but he had several powerful friend in Venice who could have bribed him out. The critics did not think about the following: There were other prisoners with more powerful friends who were not bribed, either, so why him? Also, sources say the prison guards had to exchange the ceiling some time after his escape. Why would they have to do that, if he had not made a hole in it?
