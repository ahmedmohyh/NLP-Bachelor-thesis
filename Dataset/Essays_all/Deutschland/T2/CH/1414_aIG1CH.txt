According to the presentation, Chevalier's memoir is a reliable source, which stands in contrast to the text, stating that he was actually not that accurate and reliable.
It claims that Chevalier was actually wealthy, although he sometimes had to wait until he would receive his money, which was why he had to borrow money while waiting. This contradicts the text, which states that borrowing money is equivalent to not being wealthy.

Chevalier, as said in the presentation, made notes about his conversations with Voltaire every evening after talking to him. This stands in contrast to the text, which states that Chevalier only wrote about the conversations years after having those talks.

The text also claims that Chevalier escaped a prison in Venice just because of his connections to politicians instead of escaping through a hole in the ceiling of his cell. The presentation gives proof to the theory that he escaped through the ceiling as it had to be repaired after Chevalier was gone, which they consider to prove the theory. Also according to the presentation, many other prisoners had even better political connections and were not able to escape out of the prison anyways.
