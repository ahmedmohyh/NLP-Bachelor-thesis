Both the text and the listining were about the memoir from Chevalier. But they point out a different point of view. The text is more critical about his storys and is the point of view of the criticers from Chevalier. The listining explains why this storys might be or are correct. 
In the text they talked about his time in Switzerland, where he liveda very luxerious live. But the criticers said that it was not his money that he spended on partys and gambling. They said that it was from a Swiss merchant who lend him money. The woman from the listinig explained it with the fact that he must wait at the end of the month for his money and that he lend then the money from the merchant. But he was not poor, there were only times when he waited for his money.
About the second story in his memoirs the criticers said that his meeting with Voltaire is generally not fake but that the conversations can not be exact because Chevalier wrote many years after their meeting his memoirs but uses exact phrases from the extended conversation. And it is impossible to remember such phrases for a long time. But the woman said that he wrtote at night, after their meeting down what he said and that is because he knews the phrases so well. 
The escape from the Venetian prison is also a very critizided memoir. He could never flew without the help of others, so his escape with the help of a piece of metal can not be real. But in the listining was said that after his escape they must repair the ceilings of his room.
So both texts are about Chevalier, but they represent him in a different light. The critics say that many storys from his memoirs are lies. But the woman in the listining explains how this could be true or why this storys are not lies.
