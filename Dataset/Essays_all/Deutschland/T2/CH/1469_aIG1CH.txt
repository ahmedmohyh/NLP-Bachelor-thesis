The topic is "the Chevalier" as a accurate historical soure about the European society.

In the lecture Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) the memoir of him is criticised as a accurate historical source about the European society, because he was supposed to have a lot of money, but needed to borrow money. The speaker defended the Chevalier by saying, that he just had to wait that long to get his money, so he borrow some.

Lateron in the text the accuracy of the conversation betwenn the Chevalier and Voltair is questiond but the speaker corrects that the Chevalier mostly had his notes of all conversations nearby as he wrote the memoir.

At last the lecture claims that the Chevalier couldn't escape from the notorious prison in Venice (Italy) in the way he discribed it. the speaker again defended him by giving the fact that his cell needed to get repaired afterwards.
