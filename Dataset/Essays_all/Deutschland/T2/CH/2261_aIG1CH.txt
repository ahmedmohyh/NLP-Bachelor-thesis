The Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798 and wrote a memoir recounting what he had adventured in his live. The accuracy of his memoir and other sources verifying a lot of the events he describes made his memoir an important historical source.

But critics doubt some of his descriptions to be right. Therfore they ask how the Chevalier could possibly remember even single phrases of his conversaton with the writer Voltaire when that conversation became years later part of the memoirs. But in the speech it was explained that Voltaire wrote down the whole conversations only nights after it took place and the Chevalier used, not only Voltaires, thaat notes to write his memoirs.

For his escape from the venician prison the Chevalier explained that he used a piece of metal to break through the ceiling of his cell. The critics doubt this as well, they claim that the Chevalier had powerful friends in Venice that bribed to free him but there were other prisoners with even more powerful friends and did not escape. It was also said in the speech that in an old document of the venician government the reparation of the ceiling of an prison cell was ordered. It was the cell the Chevalier was arrested in.
