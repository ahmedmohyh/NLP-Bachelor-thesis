The woman is talking about that no memoir can be entirely correct, but the memoir of Chevalier still is very accurate. There are some reliable sources who can confirm that the events Chevalier writes about are true and really did happen.
One argument in the text is, that Chevalier had to borrow money so he couldn't have been rich. But the truth might be that he borrowed money while he was waiting for his money to arrive.
Another point is that Chevalier couldn't remember all his conversations with for example Voltaire. He wrote his memoir years after he spoke to him. Friends of Chevalier can confirm that he regularly wrote down notes. He wrote down everything he could remember and in that way he could write about those conversations in his memoir years later.
And about Chevalier escaping prison - critics say that Chevalier bribed his jailers so he could escape, even though Chevalier stated otherwise. A problem with the critics' theory is that nobody was able to bribe back then to escape. Not even people who were more powerful or had more money. Another important aspect is that it's a historical fact that the ceiling had to be repaired. Chevalier stated that he made a hole into the ceiling so he could climb through it. So of course the ceiling had to be repaired afterwards and that's what actually happened.
Nobody can be really sure that what Chevalier wrote is entirely true, but after all it's a memoir that is enjoyable to read.
