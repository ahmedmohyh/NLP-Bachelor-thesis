The presentation contradicts to the text. 

The first point is that the Chevalier can`t be very rich if he borrows money.In the presentation it is said that the tranfer of money took a lot of time. Consequently the Chevalier had to borrow money. The next part of the presentation was about the accuracy of the conversation the Chevalier recorded in his mind. Critics are sceptical about the accuracy because some conversations were a long time ago. In the presentation it was said that the Chevalier wrote down every conversation he had. Consequently they have to be very accurate. Another contradictive fact is the escape of a prison in Venice. Crictics don`t believe that the escape was as easy as the Chevalier said. In the presentation there are some facts that proode the version of the Chevalier. His prisoners room had to be repared after his escape. Why should it have been repared after the escpae if it was safe and he only has been able to escape through the help of others? 

In general you can say that the presentation prooved all facts which sounded contradictive in the text.
