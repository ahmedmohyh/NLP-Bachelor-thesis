The arguments I have heard are the following of life when you pretend a rich, perfect fake life.
Many people want to show their life but many of them show their life in a way of "golden world" so they pretend that they have money and that their life is exiting and glamourous. What we can see of people is not the reality.
Most of the time the life seem more exiting and glamorous than it really is. The people talk about their things they have in life and in the reality they have not everything. This system has a big effect to our community they become jealous and the person on the other side who plays that life is happy, we think... In the first period of time they can live that life and they are happy but after they spend their money and they are poor the life gets bader. They have to borrow money from banks or maybe friends. In worst situation they have to go in the prison. After this happend, everyone knows that your life was not perfect and you also had problems. People play rolls and they are controversial people like the Chevalier.
