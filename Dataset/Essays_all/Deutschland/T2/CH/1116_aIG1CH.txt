Critics state that the Chevalier's documents are not reliable, due to the lacking accuracy.
One argument against the documents being a reliable historical source is that Chevalier, who was considered to be a wealthy person, borrowed huge amounts of money from a merchant in Switzerland. 
On the other hand, some say that Chevalier was given a credit that he would re-pay as soon as he had got money from selling his various premises.
Also, there are scriptures existing that conserve conversations between Voltaire and Chevalier. Critics claim that the reliability of those is to be doubted, since the conversations were written down long after the two of them had conversed and not every phrase could have been remembered accurately.
But there are opinions that consider the documents to originate from notes Chevalier had taken instantly after every conversation with Voltaire.
Another statement mentioned is about Chevalier's escape from prison. It implies that the event of Chevalier digging himself through the vault's ceiling with just a piece of metal is quite unrealistic -
while others refer to the repairing of the ceiling that had happened after it as a proof for Chevalier's escape.
