In the text about the Chevalier's memoirs the author questions the reality of some of Chevalier's stories, but there is proof that these stories are real.
For example his amond of money. It was proofed that he had lended some money from a swiss merchant, but this doesn't have to mean that his was not wealthy. It is possible that he needed some time to convert his acces to make money and it this time he needed to lend some. 
Another example is his dialog with the writer Voltaire. The author of the text is convinced that it is impossible that Chevalier could remember every single word of this conversation after so many years have passed, but there is proof from the witnesses, who lived with Chevalier, who said that he kept his notes over many years. That means he probably wrote the conversation down right after the meeting with Voltaire and kept it. 
In his memoir he tells about the way he escaped from the prison with the help of a piece of metal. The author has doubts about it, he says that Chevalier had some rich friends who helped him out. But right after his escape the cealing had to be repaired, which is a proof that he was telling the truth.
