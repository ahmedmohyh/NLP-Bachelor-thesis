The both sources were about Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798). He wrote a long memoir about his life and adventures.
Now many people discuss about the accuracy of him.
 
The Text says that some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoir and the other source says arguments that he was real and his adventures was real too.
One of the arguments was that Chevalier escaped of a prison in Venice and the prison has documents that they had to repair his room after the escape. So this argument shows that he was there and it`s a argument for the accuracy of his life. The critics of the text say that the CHevalier was very rich and he was invite many people to celebrate but they can´t understand why he has to borrow money. This doesn´t fit and is a reason for them to ask if Chevalier was real.

So this two source have both a different opinion if Chevalier de Seingalt was real. I can´t say anything to the topic becouse I don´t know something about him but I thing it´s a interesting topic and maybe i will read something about him.
