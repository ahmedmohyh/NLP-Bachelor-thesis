This essay is about Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) and his live. For the informations i used a text and an audio.
Chevalier de Seingalt was a man with a glamourous and exciting live. In his memoir he write about his andventures and the poeple he met. But is it all true? Have he really done all this things? Or did he made his Story more exciting as it acctually was?
The sources have an opposite point of view the text is against the memoir of Chevalier and the audio supports the memoir. 
The text and the audoi both tell us that Chevalier has been in Switzerland and that he spend a lot of money for partys. But was he really wealthy the text tells us tha he boworred money fromm a switzer man and not only one time so he cannot be wealthy and he tried to sneak some money. The Audio has another version: They thing he boworred money because he was waiting for his money. He had a job and he was waiting for his wages and for the time where he was waiting he boworred money to continue his partylife.
Another criticalstory is his meeting with the famous writer Voultaire. In his memoire he writes of their meeting and he names exact phrases and words Voltaire used during the conversation. The Text criticised that he wrote his memoire several years later and it is impossible to rember every word corectly. The audio says that he had some notes of their conversation and he used them to write his memoir.
The last critical story is the one about his prison break of a prison in venice. The text didnt want to believe that he was using a piece of metal to make a whole in the celing and than break out. They thing he had some powerful friends who get him out there. The Audio names a proof for the story of Chevalier because after his time beiing inprisoned they have to do some repairs in his cell and could that be conected?
