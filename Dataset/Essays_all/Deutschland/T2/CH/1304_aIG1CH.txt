The listening text was about the Chevaliers memoir. The speaker says, that the memoir is really realiable, because there are many proofs like selfwroted journals. She explains, that the Chevalier lived in Switzerland and had lots of money, that he spent on parties and gambling. But it was important, that he was first selling stuff to the people, otherwise he was borrowing this money from others. Nevertheless this didn't mean, he was poor.
Somehow he was in prison, but he was the one and only, who could escape from it. The written text above supports this argument, in saying, that he had politically well-connected frieds, who helped him out. 
The difference to the written text is, that this one has many critcal opinions about the Chevalier, while the listening text is convinced about the Chevalier's existence and also put him in a better light in telling the positive aspects about his life. Critics of the written have doubts about the accurancy of the Chevalier, but the listening text again says, that they have a lot of proofs.
