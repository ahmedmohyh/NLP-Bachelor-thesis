The text and the lecture are both about the question wether the Chavalier's memoir is a reliable historical source or not. The Chavalier de Seingalt has written a long memoir about his life. He claimed to have met many important people.
Critics say that the Chavelier invented many events or changed important destails of the events to make his story more interesting and that therefore the Chavelier's memoir isn't a reliable source. In the lecture is argued that even if some details in the memoir are false generally speaking the source is still reliable because minor errors are normal.
The texts gives different examples which could prove that the chevalier invented certain facts. One of them is that the chavelier claims that he was really rich when he lived in Switzerland even though it is known that the chavelier borrowed huge sums of money during the time he lived in Switzerlands. In the lecture it is explained that it took earlier a longer time to get your money, so it makes sense if the chavelier borrows money until he can get his own money.
In adddition to that the text says that it is not likely that the Chavelier could write down the exact words of conversations after several years. The lecture argues that it is known that the Chavelier took notes after the conversations and could have used these notes to write the memoir.
The third argument is that the Chavelier claims to have escaped from a prison by breaking the ceiling with the help of a metal stick and that it would be a lot more likly that the cChavelier escaped with the help of powerful friends. On the other hand it is known that the ceiling of the cell had to be reppaired shortly after his escapee
