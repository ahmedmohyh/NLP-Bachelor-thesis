The text is abaut Chevalier de Seingolt who lives from 1725- 1798 and wrote jid very famous memoirs abot his life and life avetures.
Some people think that his memoires are one of the most important lyrics in Germany. In the text are a few thesis wich i would like to talk about. Criticers say, that he was poor and not so richt, bescsuse he hsd to borroe money from a friend.But there is also another point pf view, because when he had this the most people payed withmoney and they had to wait for it. So when hee needed money he went to a good and rich firend who gave him hier money.
So there are many points that are kontreverse and diskudated.Also many people dont beliefe taht he managed to askaped the prison and the cell. Bcause he used a devise to get out so the chefs there had to renovate that cell.
So all of his storys could be true.
