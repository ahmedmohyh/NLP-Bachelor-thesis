Chevalier de seingalt memoir about his life are often critizied by many people. They don't believe that he really took part by the adventures and think that he lied to make his life and hisself more interesting.
But which opinion you can believe?
Chevalier wrote about many of his meetings with famous people, even kings f.e..Many people aren't sure if the conversations he had with them are really happend the same way he wrote it in his memoir because the memoir was wroten loads of years after it all happend. So how could he remember evrey deatail and sentence in the conversations. Others say that he made notes and that is the reason why he could repeat all the things. 
But that is not the only point where people have other opinions about chevalier. Some people say that he wasn't rich because he had to borrow money from others what is not a thing rich people do. But there is also an answer from the chevalier-defenders, they say that sometimes he had to wait for his money a long time,so he had to borrow money which he could give back easily when his own arrived.
He also was in the prison in Venice where he escaped. He wrote that he used a piece of metal to make a whole and escape through the roof. Some people do not believe that. They are sure that he only could escape because of the jailers and rich friends who helped him out. But the defenders of chevalier answer that there were many people in jail who were much more rich in powerful than chevalier and these people couldn't escape. So why especially chevalier should make them help him. There are many questions about his memoirs but no one will ever really no whta happened.
