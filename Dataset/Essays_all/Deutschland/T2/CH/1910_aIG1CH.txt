In comparison to the text the woman in the speach told that the Chevaliers memoir is reliable. In fact that no memoir can be 100% correct, it is reliable though. The text points out that the Chevalier wrote that he was really  wealth while living in Switzerland eventhough it is knwon that he went to parties and spent a lot of money so he could not be wealth. Compared to that the women said that it might be the case that he spent a lot of money and when he ran out of money he had to borrow money. In conclusion she said that it does not mean that he was poor and that he just spent the mon ey and borrowed some when there was nothing left.
Another point was his outbreak from prison. The text says that he did not escaped on his own because he had a lot of friends in Venice where he was prisoned. In the memoir it says that he escaped through the roof by using just a piece of metal and making a hole with it in the ceiling. There are a lot of critics about that part in the memoir. Otherwise the woman in the speach said that there were other prisoners in the same prison who had more powerful friends and they could not get free so there must have been a way he escaped without help of his friends.
