The text is saying that if the chevalier would have been really rich he would not needed to borrow money. The woman said that he wasnt a poor man, but he needed to borrow money sometimes, because he would get his money from things he need to sell first and need to wait for that money. Thats why he needed to borrow it sometimes. The second argument of the text is that he could have never remembered the exact phrases of Voltaire, but the woman said that he wrote as much phrases on notes as he could remember so he were able to refer to them later. His "women" said that they often saw the chevalier writing down some notes. The third aspect of the text is that he escaped the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make hole in the roof. The woman said that in some old Venetian paper were written that they needed to repair the cell after the chevalier were inside.
