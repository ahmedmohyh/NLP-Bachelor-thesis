The Chevalier's memoir

The lecture about the accuracy of the Chevalier's memoir had three main points.
First the lady talked about how no memoir can be completely accurate as it shows a subjective point of view. But this one is an important and reliable source to learn more about european history.

The text argues that the Chevalier could not have been wealthy because he borrowed significant amounts of moey from a Swiss merchant. On the other hand the lecture explained that cash could take a few days to arrive at the Chevalier's house so he had to borrow the money to pay for his extraordinary wishes, paying it back almost immediatly.

The second point is the possibility of inaccuracy regarding conversations the Chevalier has had. Since the conversation he had with the famous writer Voltaire was held years ago as it was written down, the accuracy is debateable. But reliable sources seem to say that the Chevalier took a lot of notes which he then used for his memoir. Those notes would have been taken shortly after the conversation with Voltaire and would have a higher possibility of beeing very accurate.

The last thing the text and the lecture are addressing is the prison escape of the Chevalier. His memoir says that he escaped by making a hole into the ceiling of his cell and climbing out. It was not considered very accurate since the Chevalier could have been offered a bribe from his powerful friends in Venice. But recently surfaced material of the prison he was in shows that the ceiling had to be repared shortly after the Chevalier's escape. 

So the lecture defends the accuracy of the Chevalier's memoir while the text is not for him.
