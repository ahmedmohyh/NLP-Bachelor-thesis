Chevalier de Seingalt was not that poor, he had a lot of money but he have needed to borrow some money because he made many parties and lost much money because of gambling so it's necessary for him to borrow money to represent his good lifestyle and his fame he got because of knowing many famous people like kings and writers. 

It is not that true that Chevalier never met Voltaire. In his memoir, he wrote everything down he remembered about the conversation with him in the night. It would such being a great liar if nothing he wrote down is true and truely he never met him. He did not invented some things in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamourous than it really was. 

In general, the memoir which recounting his life and adventures is a review into the society in the 18th century and even a valuable historical source. It seems like it is just a fake because there are many people who critizized the memoir but the book tells about the adventures which happened to him.
