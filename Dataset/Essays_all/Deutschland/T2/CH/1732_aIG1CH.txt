The text and the lecture are both abouth the Chevalier, a famous man whos has lived from 1725 to 1798. Many think of him as a historical source about European society. 
Both of the sources talk about his stories, the lecturer thinks of him as a reliable resource while the text doubts the correctness of his stories.
First example is his time in Switzerland: He claimed to be rich while living there. The text doubts this because we know that he had to borrow some money from his rich friends, but the lecture thinks that he had properties which he had to sell first to get money. This took time and therefore, he had to borrow the money for partying,gambling etc. so he would not miss something.
There are two more examples which show how controversial his stories are discussed. The second one are his talks with Voltaire. While the text says that nobody could remember phrases from one talk that correctly, especially years after the meeting took place, the lecturer says that there were notes from the talk, written down exactly after they had their conversation.
The third example is controversial as well: Chevalier said that he has escaped from a prison in Venice by using a piece of metal and digging a hole into the ceiling. The author of the text thinks that Chevalier probably has had help from powerful friends to escape the prison. On the opposite, the lecturer does not think so, because the ceiling had to be repaired. Moreover, there were prisoners with more powerful friends and they could not escape.
To conclude, the text and the lecture show how controversial Chevaliers stories are discussed. They are direct opposites.
