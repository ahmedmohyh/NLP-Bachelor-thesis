On the CD extract the women said that the Chevalier was a wealthy people who spend a lot of money in parties. She answered to the kritik that he only had to borrow money sice his one money does not arrived so far. Furthermore she talkt about the relation between Chevalier and Voltaire and informed us that Chevelier said he met Voltaire every night and had good conversations with him. In addition he should have rote down the communicationstuff every night after the meetig with Voltaire down. At last she talked abeout Chevaliers ecape from the prision which is in contrast to the fact that his cell had to be repaired after his non violent escape. 
When we compare this facts with the facts from the text one could say that their are some differences. First when it comes to the wealthyness of Chevalier the text says that because of the high amount of borrowed money this was a lie to appear more glamorous than he really was. Secondly the text steátes that Chevalier and Voltaire never met and consequently all the commonications, which Chevalier wrote down, are not real. At last the extract of the text mentioned that Chevaliers escape, which he self claims to escape by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof, does not happen in the reality on this way, but rather by using his contact to his pollitycally friends. 
In conclusions there are some dirfferences when it comes to the live Chevaliers in different sources.
