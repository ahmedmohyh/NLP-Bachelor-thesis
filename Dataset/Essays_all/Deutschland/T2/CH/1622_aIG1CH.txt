The audio presentation shows the Chevalier de Seingalt from a different, more positive perspective.
It is said that the Chevalier's memory was very accurate and in the audio presentation he was not shown as a liar.
Although in the text it is stated that Chevalier was not wealthy at all during his time in Switzerland because he needed to borrow money from a merchant the audio presentation claims that the Chevalier was at that time still wealthy but needed money during the process of selling his properties. The sellings toke time so it was inevitable to take a loan.
Each night after meeting Voltaire the audio presentation states that Chevalier made notes about his conversation with the famous philosopher. So although the memoir was written many years after the conversation Chevalier was still able to capture these conversations accurately. In the text, the notes where not mentioned.
While the audio presentation sees Chevalier's prison escape through the ceiling as more realisitc than the bribing of the jailers because the ceiling needed to be repaired afterwards and other, even better connected prisoners where not able to bribe the jailors, the text let out the detail about the repaired ceiling and says that bribing is more realisitc than an artistic escape trough hte roof.
