The memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt has been an important historical source about the european life in the 18. century. However the accuracy of this document is very controversialy discussed. 

The extract of the given text points out, that the memoir of the Chevalier describes him as a rich  person, what in the critics view seems inaccurate because he lend a lot of money during his time in Switzerland. Whereas the given speech says him borrowing money doesn't mean he is poor because it took a while until he got proceeds from his works and consideration of the amounts of money he spent on events, other wealthy people would have been in need of borrowing money to.

Besides the text criticises the accuracy of the conversations between the Chevalier and Voltaire written down in the memoir, because it is impossible to remember exact phrases of conversations years ago. The speechs rejects this statement in saying that the Chevalier had only written what he was able to remember of tht conversations with Voltaire.

Futhermore critics also question the escape from an italien prison by Chevalier. The say that he might have been involved in bribery to free him. The speech however says that his room needed to be repaired afterwards what wouldn't have been necessery if he did not escape the prison on his own. It also pointed out, that there where people who had way more powerful friends in that prison, who weren't able to escape.
