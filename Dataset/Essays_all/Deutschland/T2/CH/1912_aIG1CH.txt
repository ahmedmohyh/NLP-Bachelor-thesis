In the lecture the woman listed three main points also made in the text showing why the memoir is correct and a reliable source. Firstly the loan. In the text it is said that had the Chevalier really been rich he would not have needed to borrow money but the lecturer explained it followingly: he had wealth in other forms than money like properties which would take time to convert to money he could spend. Secondly the conversations which according to the text were written down years after they had accured. However the lecturer states that there were witnesses who have claimed that they saw the Chevalier writing the notes every evening after the conversations and then consulting those notes for the memoir. Finally the third and last point. In the memoir the chandelier writes he escape a prison in Venice by breaking through the ceiling. In the text it says that he wrote this to make his life seem exiting while actually he was bought out by politically well-connected friends in Venice. However the lecturer explains that other wealthier imprisoners were not bribed and it is highly unlikely the Chevalier was however prison records show that his cell ceiling was repaired shortly after he excapes which proves the memoir right otherwise why would they repair only that one ceiling.
