The topic we are talking about is thr memmoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) in witch he is talking about his life and all things he had done. 
He was really controversial becauce many of his storys seem more exiting and big then they ectually where. <he was an ecurate man and because of his meetings with famous peoble like Voltaire his memoire gives important facts about the European society in the eighteenth century. 
The first fact about Chevalier de Seingalt is that he was verry wealthy. But an important thing that he does not mention is that ha had not had much money ore gold. He was wealthy with things he had to sell fist to gget the gold. So often he had to borrow money when his money from his goods where not arrived. 
The second Fact is his connection to Volaire from whom he also kept many notes witch ended in his memorial. There is no doubt that they knew eatch other but its been questioned if the recorded conversations where real.
Thelast fact is that he escaped out of the Venetian prison witch where questioned the most by critics. Its been said that he used a peace of metal to escape out of a hole in the wal. Critic can not truely belive this story because many people in this prison had better contacts and more important people on their side and could not escape.
