The Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) wrote a memoir about his life. I will point out three happenings of his life and their accuracy.

Firstly, he lived in Switzerland for some time. He liked to play games as poker and liked to go to parties as well. It is said that he was a rich man, but needed to borrow money from a bank because all of his paper money was paid for gambling and it would take to long to sell his big house, in which the rest of his money was sticked into. The critics say nothing about the house, they're just talking about the sums of money he borrowed from a Swiss merchant.

Secondly, he is telling us about a conversation with the famous writer Voltair. The presentation sais that most of the parts of the conversation are very accurate eventhough he wrote his memoir many years later. They belief that, because Chevalier was writing down most of his conversations in his gernals. He kept them and that's why he could remember most of the details he is mentioning in his memoir.

The final happening was breaking out of a prison in Venice, Italy. Critics point out, that he didn't break out by his own. They say he got help from political powerful friends, he had in Venice. But actually there are some documents from the prison, which shows, that the sealing of Chevaliers prison cell needed to be repaired,  so it might be possible, that he got out. Even more if you think about the fact, that there were other prisinors, who had more powerful friends than he had. But they didn't get out for this reason eighter.
