There are many critcs about the memoirs of the Chevalier. 
The first point is that he said he lives a wealth and healthy live in Switzerland, but there is the fact that he borrow money from a friend. The critc said that he wasn't poor, but that he has to borrow money because he spent all his money for partys, drinks and females.
The second point of the critic was about the accuracy of the conversations between him and Voltaire. Somebody said he never met Voltaire. Others thinks that he probably met Voltaire, but because of the time who is running from the conversation untill he wrote it all down, he can't mention everything about the conversation so he wasn't able to memoires the whole speaking text.
The third and last point of the critic is the escape from the prison in Venice. The critic sais that there isn't any man who can escape from this prison although they have friends who are really important in the 18th century. Chevalier de Seingalt hasn't got friends who are politically well-connected.

The text on the top has the same critics as the woman from before, but she explains the critics with another meaning and sometimes she said that it could happen like Chevalier said, but there are some points she can't understand because Chevalier says something else.
