The text "Chevalier" and the satement about the text, both by an unknown author and speaker, written/held at an unknown date, deals with the memoirs of the Chevalier, a important person of the past and the question, if his memoir are realy what he did or if they were all imagined.

The text says, that most of his writtings in his memoir have to be imagenid, because there are evidences for the real truth. There are three different examples of his memoirs, all refused to be right by clear arguments and proves.
The statement, on the other side, tells us that the evidences and proves aren't accurate and thought to the end. The speaker denies every argument of the text and strenghts her facts with examples and reassons, which make the audience think that she knows what she is talking about.
