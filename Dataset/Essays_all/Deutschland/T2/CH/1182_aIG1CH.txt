You don´t have to read my text because I just wrote down the half of the text given above.
I´m sorry.

Toward the end of his life, the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. The Chevalier was a somewhat controversial figure, but since he met many famous people, including kings and writers, his memoir has become a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. 
However, some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of the memoir. They claim that the Chevalier distorted or invented many events in the memoir to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was.
For example, in his memoir the Chevalier claims that while living in Switzerland, he was very wealthy, and it is known that he spent a great deal of money there on parties and gambling.
However, evidence has recently surfaced that the Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. 
Critics thus argue that if the Chevalier had really been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money.
