In the following text i will summarize the text about Chevalier and compare it to the audio i heard.
Chevalier is a controversial figure who wrote a long memoir about his life and adventures at the end of his life. When he met famous people his memoir became valualble historical source about the European society in the 18. century. 
To make his life more exciting and glamourus he distorted and invented many events. But he has to borroe money frpm a Swiss merchant, so that´s why the people think that he is not rich, because he has to borrow money for his events. In the audio it means that htis is not the specific reason why he is poor, in Switzerland it needs the time to deserve their money.
In the text they are also skeptical about the conversations, he wrote down in his memoir,because after so many years after the conversations you normally cannot recognize the conversations excat in every detail. In the audio they said that the Chevalier wrote everything down about the conversations in the eving after his events, so it cannot be wrong.
He also was in a prison in Venice, Italy. Some people are skeptical about the fact that he came free by himself and nobody helped him, because he also had a lot of poltically well-connected friends in Venice, who could help him
