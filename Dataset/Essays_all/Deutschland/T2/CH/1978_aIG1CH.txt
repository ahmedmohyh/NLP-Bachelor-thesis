The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir where he tells the story of his life including conversations and adventures. Many people are seeing this as a reliable source of the history of the 18th century but many critics also say the story are controversial and not real.
The first story many critics say is not real is about his life in Switzerland. He claims that he was rich, wealthy and with all this money did party and gambled. The women in the audio file says that it was normal in Switzerland to borrow money even you are wealthy but the text says it was a sign that you are not rich. 
The second topic is the conversation with Voltaire. There the women has the opinion that he made many notices and then in the years after he wrote the conversation down, but in the text stands that he wrote it many years after and was not able to wrote the real conversation with real sentences down.
The third topic is his escape out of a prison in Venice, Italy. He said that he made his way alone out of the prison with a piece of metal but critics say that he just was let out of the prison because he had powerful friends, as it stands in the text. The women in the audio file says that this can not be because other prisoners were not free although they had much more powerful friends.
So as you can see there are many controversials about the Chevalier de Seingalt and the question is, are his storys real or not. Of course there are many arguments for and against both opinions given in the audio file and the text.
