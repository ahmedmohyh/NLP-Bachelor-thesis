In the text the autor has writen something differnet as in the audio. Both people had written about Chevalier.Chevalier has lived from 1725 to 1798. He has lived in the Switzerland. He was very rich. Almost he spend the money on partys or gambling. This is a fact from both sources. In the text is written, Chevalier had distorted more events in his memoirto make his life more important and glamorous. Many persons criticed the memoir of Chevalier, because the history of his living is very perfectly and glamorous. Critics are skeptical about the meeting between Chevalier and Voltaire, because Voltiare is a very famous writter. I think in the audio was said, that the history is the right and they have meet them.
