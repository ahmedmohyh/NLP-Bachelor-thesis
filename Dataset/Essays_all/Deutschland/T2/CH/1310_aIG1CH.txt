Both texts deal with the live form the Chevalier. But there are different aspects which make another picture about him. first you can say he wirte a memoir. In the audio they tell us that he wrote this memoir a long time after his adventures or meetings. In the text it says he was a very important person to understand the europeans society becaus he met some important persons like kings and writers. But hie wirting wasn not always true. for example he wrotr about his wealthy in Switzerland. But he wan not wealthy it says in the text, he lost his money in a great deal, parties and gamblings. The audio says he make a deal and first he had to give money but he was waiting to get much more money. But thats does not say he waas poor like the memoir says. Second the memoir tells about his conversations with very important persons like the famous writer Voltair. the text says nobody can/could remember that the Chevalier has a conversation with him. the audio critics that he just write things he could remember when he wright. that was a couple of years after they met. Both informations critics his memoir in different ways. the Chevaliers memoir are not a source anybody can trust. there are some aspects whit his own interpretation and things never happend. But it is still an important writing.
