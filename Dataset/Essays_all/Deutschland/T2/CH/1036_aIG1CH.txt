The Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived between 1725 and 1798 was a wealthy knight who liked gambling and partying. He has written down his adventures and experiences in his memoir, which has become a valuable historical source about European society in the 18th century. 

However critics think that de Seingalt was not always a hundred percent accurate in his memoirs. So they say that he was not as wealthy as he claimed to be because he needed to borrow money from a merchant after he lost his by gambling in Switzerland. His defenders say that he needed to borrow money because it takes a few days to sell goods and receive the money for it and he had to stay liquid and that is why he borrowed it. 

Critics are also complaining his records of the conversation between him and Voltaire, a famous writer, because he has written it many years later. The ones who defend de Seingalt say that he has only written down what he remembered so he did not need to lie. 

Another thing critics find suspicious is his escape from a prison in Venice. They are saying that de Seingalt escaped there because he had some politically well-connected friends there and not as he claimed by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling of his cell to escape. This critic was smashed very easily because the Venetian government said they needed to repair the ceiling of the Chevalier's cell a few days after he escaped.
