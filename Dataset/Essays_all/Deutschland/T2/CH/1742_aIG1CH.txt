The first point that critics mention to refute the reliability of the Chevaliers memoir is that he used to be rich but still borrowed money. The argument of this presenter is that the rich people in those days had to buy things with a huge amout of money. So it was clear that they had no cash left. That is the reason why he borrowed money sometimes. 
The next doubt on his memoir is that critics doubt that the Chevalier and a famous writer called Voltair ever met. Against this speaks that Chevalier was known for writing his memoir and remembering what he experienced. Also whitnesses can confirm the Chevaliers notes.
The last point is that the Chevalier escaped prison. The critics say that other prisoners also had connections which could help them to get out. But they couldn´t. So they try to refute that the Chavaliers escape out of prison with less help. But with research people were able to find out that the ceiling had to be repaired after his breakout, just like he told us in his memoir.
