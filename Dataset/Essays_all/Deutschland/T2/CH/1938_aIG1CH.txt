In the interview the speaker talks about Chevalier´s momoirs, especially focussing on the reliability and accuracy of them. In contrast to the lecture the speaker is convinced of Chevalier´s reliability and states several arguments to strenghten this statement.
First of all she explains that no memoirs can be correct in detail. Anyway she points out that Chevalier´s memoirs are of such accuracy as possible. For instance, if we take a look at the conversations with Voltaire. Indeed, he wrote less and not very accurate about his discussions with Voltaire. But anyway he could just write what he remembers, the speaker argues.
Secondly the speaker starts to diskuss the argument that Chevalier had lied about his property. She jumps in here to clarify that he didn´t say he would be poor. He just said that he borrowed some money which was typical for that time in Swizzerland and so it does not indicate his considerable sums of money.
One last point the speaker mentions is the aspect of his escape. Instead of the opinion Chevalier could have just escaped because of political well-connected friend in Venice the speaker makes clear that a lot of prisoners had powerful friends. Anyway the other prisoners were not able to escape. So his escape cannot mainly be based on his friends. The speaker supports the thesis that the escaped by using a piece of metal because they had found a broken ceiling which implies and strenghtens this theory.
To sum it up the interview shows a contrast and different perspective respectively opinion towards the accuracy and reliability of Chevalier´s memoirs. From her deepest conviction the speaker believes in the accurracy of Chevalier.
