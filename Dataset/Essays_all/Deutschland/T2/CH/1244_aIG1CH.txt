At the end of the 18th century the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir recounting his life. Now, it is controversely discussed whether all the things he wrote down are true.
In the memoir Chevalier tells that he had a wealthy time in Switzerland. But sources tell that he borrowed money which would say the opposite. While critics have the opinion that this would tell the lie the other side claims that it is not impossible. Though Chevalier visited many parties the money could have got lost and he had to borrow something before the next money arrives. 
Another discussion point is the conversation with Voltaire. Critics say that the dialogue can't be given perfectly because it was written down in the memoir many years later. But the opponents say having taken notes after talking with Voltaire is pretty likely because the Chevalier often did it at other times.
A third point is the escape from a prison. While critics say that it is possible but very unlikely the opponents tell that there are sources where it is said that the ceiling had to be renewed shortly after the escape.
