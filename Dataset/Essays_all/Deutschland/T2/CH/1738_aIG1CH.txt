In the given text as well as in the presentation about Chevalier we learn about his historical memoir and in which way it might be possible to have such an amound of memoir and in which way all the given information about himself are correct or not.
In the presentation it is said that it is nearly unpossible to have the correct memoir about each and everything, in the text it says that we will find some uncorrect aspects in the chevalien memoir he just added or inevented in.
The woman tells us that he was a man living in wealth but probably making borrows because of several incedences but this is not saying that he might be poor. Also the point that he got out of the prison in Venice,Italy has to be uncorrect or has to be questioned because he does not have the opporunity to get out of the prison in that time.
Also the fact that he used to be in contact with the famous writer Voltaire is skeptical which is mentioned in the given text , but the presenter told us that Chevalier had written down everything from its meeting with Voltaire.
The fact that he was able to remember everything seems unreal und skepitcal as the both sources mention.
