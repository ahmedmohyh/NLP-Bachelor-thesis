First of all the text claims that the memoir about Chevalier de Seingalt is not very relieable, because of some events which seem to be invented, but in contrast the presentation mentioned the opposite. Firstly the text says the Chevalier was poor as he lived in switzerland, because he had to lend some money from a merchant. But the presentation contered that he lend the money, because he send so much money on partys and he needed the money before he had the goods to sell. Second many critics say that the conversation between him and voltaire is not accurate, because he wrote his memoir years later, but they did not mention that he wrote down all details from the conversation right after it, claimed the presentation. Finally his escape from a prison in Italy. The story of Chevalier who escaped through the ceiling by using a piece of metal seems for many critics unrealistic. Furthermore they belive powerful friends of him helped him and used this connections. Although the presentation has some good arguments too, for example the ceiling had to be repaired soon after Chevalier escaped. 
Long story short there are good arguments for and against the reliebelness of the memoir of Chevalier in the presentation and the text.
