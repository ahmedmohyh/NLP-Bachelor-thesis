The first argument which should show, that the memoirs of the Chevalier de Seingalt aren't correct says, that he couldn't be very rich in Switzerland, if he had to borrow money from a merchant. In the presentation the woman said, that he could be very wealthy of course, because as you can see in the text the Chevalier spent a lot of money for parties and gambling so maybe he spent to much money and needed a little bit to make more money out of it. Another theory is, that he needed the borrowed money for his start in Switzerland and with the help of gambling or other methods he made out more of the borrowed money, so he got wealthy.

The second argument shows, that his conversation with Voltaire can't be that correct, because he wrote it down many years after he held the conversation, so it's nearly impossible to remember exact quotes. But the presentation shows, that is possible to remember and that happened often in the history.

Nevertheless says the last argument, that he hadn't to escape out of the prsion, because he had many powerful friends who could offer him a bribe. But in the presentation the woman said, that many other prisoners had even more powerful contacts too, but that was not possible to give them a bribe. Also they had to fix a hole in his ceiling. So if there wasn't a hole, he could get out with a bribe, but the hole was there, so his memoirs could be correct in this point.
