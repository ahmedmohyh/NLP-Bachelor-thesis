The eighteenth century as an interesting time of arts and culture was explained by many people interested in historics. Their sources may also be the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt who recounts his life and adventures in this book. Nevertheless the truth of Chevalier's memoir is criticised several times because of different reasons that will be explained in the following text.
The first example is a discrepancy described in wealth of Chavalier. It is discussed wheather Chevalier was really that wealthy person he wrote about in his memoir. On the one hand he had to borrow money while living in Switzerland  but he also partied a lot and spent big sums on a glamorous life he would not be able to life if he was that poor.
Chevalier in addition was a controversial figure in relationships too. Conversations with Voltaire he wrote about in his memoir may not be accuracy. One reason is that Chevalier wrote about these conversations many years after they were held so it seems to be impossible to remember every phrase. Nevertheless he might have kept the converataions for many years and wrote about every night's conversation directly after he talked to Voltaire.
Finally there is a discussion about his escape from a prison in Venice. Some people suppose his use of metal to escape was a fake that may lead to enjoyable reading. Others think he had powerful friends in the venecian society who helped him to escape. The fact that his ceiling had to be repared after the escape may show that the story in his memoire really happened and also the fact that other prisoners had had friends who were even more powerful supports the accuracy of his book
All in all Chevalier is a controversial figure and everyone must reflect hisown.
