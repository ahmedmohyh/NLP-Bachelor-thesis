In the text is said that the Chevalier memoir is one of the best historical devices to see how the the european community worked in the 18th century, but it has many critical facts against it.
So for example Chevalier talked to Voltair, but after years he wrote down the conversation in the memoir, or he were in a prison in Venice, Italy, and some people say that he never was in a prison.
But there are facts against the facts which are against the Chevalier memoir. For example when he talked to Voltair, he wrote down the converstation, and on some papers of the prison there is noted that the prison in Venice needed a new ceiling, it had to be repaired because there was a hole in it, and in the memoir is written that Chevalier digged a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal he escaped through. So what is written in the memoir could be true.
