The arguments mentionend in the audio refer to the arguments in the text and they are trying to eliminate the points, made in the critisizing text about the memoires of Chevalier.
 It starts of with taking a closer look to story of Chevalier in the Switzerland, the text claims that although he said he was wealthy he had to borrow a lot of money to spend it on parties and gambling, while the audio made the point that Chevalier just was waiting for his money and thefore he had to borrow money from the Swiss merchant. The next argument is about the memoir of the conversation between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire, he wrote the memoir years after the meeting down and so they can't be accurate. In the audio the counter argument is that he took a lot of notes while the conversation and used them years later to create the memoirs. The last argument is about the prision escape, the test mentionens that it's more likely that Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him, the audio instead points out that there are facts that Chevalier escaped like he said in his memoires.
All in all the audio eliminates the points made in the text with counter arguments.
