Between the audio and the text are some big differences I'd like to referr to in this text.
The main message the text wants to tell us is that Voltaire's memoir isn't entirely accurate and some of it even made up and therefore it's not a valuable historical source for the European society in the 18th century.
But the audio is stating Voltaire's memoir is pretty accurate. 

For example, the fact about Voltaire wealthiness and his debts to a Swiss merchant, doesn't mean that he wasn't wealthy. He just had a lot of assets that were not particular liquid, so he wasn't able to pay for his gambles and parties right away with them. He had to borrow money and would pay them back as soon as this money would arrive from his properties he sold.

In addition, the conversations between him and Voltaire are supposed to be fake because you are not able to remember the exact 1conversation you had after years, but this ignores completly the fact or possibility of him writing the conversation down so he could rember them years down the road and just kept them for quite a time.

Last but not least, a document from the prison in Venice was found stating that the ceiling above Chevalier's cell had to be repaired shortly after he escaped, so that could corelated to story in his memoir. 
Besides, in this prison were even more powerful imprisoners that tried to bride the jailers didn't make it out of the prison.

All in all, the text has a few good points against the accuracy of his memoir but the moment you look more into this matter you'll find out that they still were pretty accurate and still valuable as historical source.
