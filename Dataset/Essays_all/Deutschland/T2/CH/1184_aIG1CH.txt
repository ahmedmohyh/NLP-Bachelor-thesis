In the second source it is said that the memoirs of the Chevalier de Seingalt aren't as wrong as it is told by the first one. While in the text his memoirs are described as not accurate and relateable the second does say the opposite. The first example which deals with his life in Switzerland is regarding to the first source not correct because he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling while there are some evidences that he borrowed money. In contrast to that the other source explains these evidences with the fact that you have to first spent the money with the property to get rich of it later. So the fact that he borrowed the money isn't an evidence which makes his memoirs a lie because he had to spent money fist, what he just could do if he borrows some. The second example is about the meeting and the conversations with Voltaire. He wrote this event many years after it happend in his memoirs so that there are doubts about weather he remembered everything right. The second source explains that this is just half ot the truth because he wrote his experience down right after they met. In the memoirs which he wrote later he took this so that his memoir can be seen as correct. The last example is about his escape out of the prison in Venice inn Italy. He wrote down that he cutted a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal. This seems to be correct because the gouvernment documents say that the roof needed to be repared. The doubt of the first source that he had politically friends who could have helped him to escape is seen as not logical by the second one because other prisoners had this kind , or even better, contacts which dind't helped them to escape.
