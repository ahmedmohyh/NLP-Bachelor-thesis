In the text about the "Chevalier" you can find some critics about points the Chevalier made in his memoirs he wrote. 
He mentioned that he was whealthy while cricts say he had to borrow money. Critics also claim that conversations between Chevalier and Voltiar could not be very accurately since he wrote his memoirs long after Chevalier had those conversations. Besides that Chevalier states in his memoirs that he escaped from a Venetian prison by making a hole into the ceiling and escaping through the roof. People criticise that because he was politically well connected and probably didn´t have to escape.
The lecturer sayd that he surely had some inaccurate points in his memoirs because they are never correct in every detail. But there are some aspects that contradict to the critics. The fact that Chevalier had to borrow money could have resulted from whealth that first had to be sold so he would have to wait for his money.
Also people who lived with the Chevalier mentioned that he made notes after every conversation he had with Voltair so he could be more accurate when writing his memoirs later on.
And finally some points also show that his description of the prison escape were true because there were prisoners with way more powerful political friends and they couldn´t escape prison with their help. Another aspect is that his cell had to be repaired at the ceiling after he disappeared which could only be because of damage at the ceiling where he broke through.
