The text talks about the Chevalier and that his memoires are not that true as they say. The speech says something different than the text. For example, there is the prison in Venice, Italy, in which the Chevalier was prisoned. The text claimed, that the Chevalier used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling so he can climb on the roof. 
But the speech claims that there was a renovation in the prison and that some stones had to be removed. That is why he could escaped. Both the text and the speech agree that the Chevalier was a controversal figure who invented many of the stories in his memoires. The text also mentions some points that the speech does not mention, for example that the Chevalier's memoir has become a historical source about the European society. 
They have also different views about the point that the Chevalier borrowed money, which he normally should not do because he should be rich. In the text, hew borrows money from a Swiss merchant and in the speech, he borrows it from many different rich people on parties and gambling.
The text and the speech describe the same three episodes of the life of the Chevalier, but there a some details in which they contradict each other.
