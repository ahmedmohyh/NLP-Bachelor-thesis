Second of all critics say that de Seigalt can not remember a conversation that exact, as he wrote it in his memoir. The memoir was written years after the actual conversation.

The last doubt in the text is about de Seingalt`s escape from the venician prison. The critics argue, de Seingalt was a well know person and had people he knew to help him escape.
