Text and Presentation are both about critcism about the momoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. He worte down many stories and conversations he experienced in his life and critics claim that they are very suspisious because of different reasons. In the presentation there is critic about the critic.
In the  text critics said that Chevalier could not be as rich as he claimed to be in the Switzerland because he had to borrow money. But maybe he could not get this ammount of money he needed in this short time even if he had it so he had to borrow it. That does not mean he was poor.
Alos critics said that nobody can remember conversations as detailed as Chevalier claimed to do so his conversations can not be fully true. Critics of the critics said that it is proved that he took notes about many conversations and used them when writing his memoir.
About the escape from a prison in Vernice in Italy critics said that he just asked some politically well-connected friends to get him out of the prison and did not broke out by himself by making a hole into his ceiling and escaping through the roof. But critics of the critic say that there are documents which prove that his ceiling had to be repaired after his escape and also many other prisoners had good politically friends and did not escaped.

You can argue about his stories but keep in mind you will never know the truth because you can not ask him.
