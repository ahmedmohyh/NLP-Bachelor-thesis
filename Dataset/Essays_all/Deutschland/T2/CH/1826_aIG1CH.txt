The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir of his live and adventures. But no memoire is always in every point right. 

So the first controverse between the text and the laction is, that the text claims the Chevalier was so rich while living in Switzerland, he doesn't even have been needed to borrow money, while the laction says that he got rich by these parties and gambling, but for this he had to borrow some money. 

The second controverse is about his conservation with Voltaire. The text says that he couldn't remember every detail he's been talking about with Voltaire, because he wrote his memoire years after this conservation. But the laction argues, that he have been making notes in the night after his meeting with Voltaire, so he just had to keep his notes with him to write his memoire. Difficult is, that nobody ever see these notes.

The last controverse is his escape from the prison in Venice. The chevalier discribes his escape, that he used a piece of metal to make a whole in the ceiling, so he could run away on the roof. 
The text says that critcs claim, that he got powerful allies in politics that easily could have freeed him.
The laction shows of, that in this prison other people where, which had even more powerful friends than the chevalier had and they were not been freed or could escape.
