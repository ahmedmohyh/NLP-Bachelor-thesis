Chevalier de Seingalt wrote down a lot about his passed life, his experiences and also a bit about the the historical european society in the eighteenth cetury. First, he wrote down that his life was one of those with the most of glamour and very exciting since he met not named famous people. He spent his glamorous, wealthy and rich life in Switzerland . It is said that he borrowed some money even in the case that he had not to do for any reason and critics also say, that there lived way more people in Switzerland who were not poor. So he was not the only one with a glamorous lifestyle like it is said in the speech which does not fit with the given information in the text. 
Second, a conversation between him and the writer Voltaire is nearly impossible and critics underline this statement with the fact that the notes wirtten by Chevalier are some notes from many years and not complete and in any order to proof his thesis that he once had a discussion with the writer.
The last point to add is that Chevalier wrote down that he escaped a prison just with the help of a piece of metal which also seems very unrealistic to critics. They say that there were lots of other people sitting in the prison with way more power than Chevalier actually had. He maybe wrote this way of escaping the prison down somewhere because it would be way more interesting for the readers of his stories. 
So all in all, you can sum up that Chevalier wrote down lots of different stories during his lifetime, but most of them seem to be very unrealistic and wrong.
