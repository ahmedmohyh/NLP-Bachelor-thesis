In the election was stated that of course no memoire can be totally accurate but still the memoir of the Chevalier was pretty accurate. So the statements concerning his wealth were right, because in order to throw big partys as the Chevalier did, he had to have a lot of money and his lifestyle was pretty expensive, but the text diagrees to this because it says that the Chevalier had to borrow a lot of money from a Swiss merchant.
Another part of the memoire was the conversation the Chevalier had with Voltaire. The text says that the accuracy of the memoire is doubtful because the conversation was written down many years afterwards. In a response to this, the election said that the Chevalier wrote down what he and Voltaire talked about each evening and when he wrote his memoire he used his notes from these evenings. 
The mysterious getting out of the prison in Venice was for 'enjoyable reading' is written in the text and that the Chevalier had friends in Venice that could help him to get out but in the audio was said that these friends also were in prison for some time and if they couldn't get themselves out of there, it wouldn't make sense that this would work for the Chevalier. Another proof for his escape through the ceiling is that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after he got out of the prison.
