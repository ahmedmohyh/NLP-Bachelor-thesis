The presentation is about the Chevalier de Seingalt who is an important source about European society in the eighteenth century and about some critics about him and his memoir.
In the Chevalier's memoir you can read, that he was at lots of different events, but some critics say that he was lying about that for making his life more exciting and glamorous. Also they aren't sure about the records between the Chevalier and the writer Voltaire. It's because nobody can except that the conversation really happpened and also because of the fact that it's not possible to remember exact phrases from the conversation when the memoir was written many years after. Critics also think that the escape from a prison in Italy could be a lie, because of unrealistic details like that the Chevalier used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. They mean that is more possible that he had a friend who had politically friends who made a deal for taking the Chevalier out of the prison.
