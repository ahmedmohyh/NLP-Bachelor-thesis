In this summary I conclude the differences, but also what is the same in the text above and the listening concerning Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir.
Both are about the memoir of de Seingalt and point out three aspects. First, if/that he was waelthy. Second the trustworthyness of his conversation with Voltaire, third, how exactly he escaped from jail.
In general, the listening can be named as "doubt" concerning to the text above. While the text is not sure if Chevalier was wealthy, because he spend a lot of money on parties and gambeling, the listening said that he was absolutly not poor, he just needed to wait for his money many times, because of the parties and the gambeling.
Moreover, the next point in the text is the trustworthyness of the spoken words while the conversation with voltaire. But the listening tells, that if you write down something you remember from many years ago, you may not think of every word you said. So they mean, that you need to understand, that he only wrote down what he remembered from that conversation.
The last point about his escape from jail is the most controversial one. The author of the text thinks that he was bribed free. But at last, his friends weren't that influential, so its not far away, that he really escaped through the ceiling. A proof for that is the destroyed and repaired ceiling in his earlier cell.
