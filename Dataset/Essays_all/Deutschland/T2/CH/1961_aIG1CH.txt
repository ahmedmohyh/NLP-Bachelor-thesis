The Chevalier is a reliable historical source. They put a huge amouth of money to parties from switzerland. But they did not borrow money as the text said. They were really rich so that they didn´t have to borrow money. Another diffrence between the text and the audio is about the conversation between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire. The audio said that during the conversations Chevalier took notes. So the Chevalier wrote about the conversation and wrote a memoriar about the conversation. So he copied from Voltaire. The text said that that they not even came together. 
 
Another diffrence is that the audio said Chevalier´s jailers were bribed to free him in prison. The Chevalier escaped likely not incase of the money out of the prison in venice. As a opposite the text said he claims to escape by using a pice of metal, without help, to make a hole in the roof to escape from the prison.
