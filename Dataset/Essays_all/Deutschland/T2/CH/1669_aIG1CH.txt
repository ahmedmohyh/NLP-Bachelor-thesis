The text regarding Chevalier is questtioning the adventures of him, while the woman speaking had reasons that justify his experiences.
One point that the text is dealing with is that de Seingalt had borrowed fairly big amounts og money from merchants, which would not fit in his depiction of a rich man. However the woman states that de Seingalt simply had to wait for his money to arrive so beacause of that, he had to temporarily borrow money from these people.

Anther point that the text is dealing with is the questioned fact that he escaped from a prison in Venecia by just using a metal piece which he specifically used to make a hole in the ceiling of his cell. In the text it is said that it is more likely that he bribed the jailers in order to let him free. The woman justifies this by saying that de Steingalt did not have powerful friends that could free him and that the ceiling from which he supposedely escaped had to be repaired shortly after he left the prison.

Furthermore, the conversations between him and Volaire are also questioned bacause the conversations were found years after they happened. The woman however says that de Steingalt wrote down all the things that he could remember from these conversations and kept them for years before mentioning them in his memoirs.
