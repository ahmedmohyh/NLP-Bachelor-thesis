The teacher explains that the memoirs of the Chevalier can`t be absolutely correct, here she agrees with the text. Furthermore, she has got the same opinion that the memoirs are an important historical source. She agrees with the text that the Chevalier wasn´t poor, though he had to borrow money. But she says, too, that he spent much money for parties in Switzerland, he had just to wait until his money arrived, but that was normal at this point of time, so he wasn`t that rich but also not poor. She explains that the Chevalier had conversations with the famous writer Voltaire and the he claimed to have written down and kept notes directly after the conversation.  Whether it is true or not, is not clear, here she disagrees with the text. And about the escape, she tells the students that before the escape of the Chevalier from the prison, whether it`s true or not, no one has ever escaped from that prison. It´s not known if he really escaped or bribed to quit the prison, but after his escape the ceiling had to get repaired, that could be a proof that he escaped by using a piece of metal to dig a hole in the ceiling to climb through the roof to escape from the prison, as the text says. But she means that he had politically well-connected friends, who could have offered the bribe, so it`s unknown if he really escaped.
