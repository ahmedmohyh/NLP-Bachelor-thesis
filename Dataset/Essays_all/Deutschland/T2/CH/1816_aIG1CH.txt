In the following I am going to explaon and discuss the things I just heard with the text above  and see if they share an opinoin or not.

First of all the woman stated that a memoir can never be 100 % correct, but the one written by Chevalier de Seingalt is as relaible as it can get. 
The text states that Chavaliers text is nowadays used for gathering information about european society in that time, but it is also discussed wether the information said in the memoir is ture or just imagined or dramatisised.
The Woman goes on to give statments about things that the text critizised. The text states that Chavalier could not have been rich because he took a loan in Switzerland. The audio states that that is not a indicator towards him being poor because you needed to get money to make  money back then and a loan could be seen as an investment to become even richer. Furthermore the conversations between Voltair and Chavalier could be true as well, because Chavalier wrote down every conversation after it happenend, so the statemant that the recordings can't be true, as to be read in the text, is wrong. The last aspect named by the woman is Chavaliers escape from prison. He might have had a lot of famous friends that could have bailed him out, as said in the text as well, but other prisoners had friend that werde even more famous and they could not get out. In addition there are also papers that say that there were repairings needed on the roof of Chavaliers cell after Chavaliers escaped which makes Chavaliers story seem even more true.
