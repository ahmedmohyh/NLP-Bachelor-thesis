Because he thought so himself, he decided to write it down in form of a memoir. But eventhough there is no doubt of his stories having a true source, the author if the text think that he made up some aspects. He agrees that the Checalier might have been in Switzerland and partied at some point, but he doubts that he was a wealthy man because there is proof that he had to borough money. He also described his conversations with Voltaire very detailed and even quoted himself and Voltaire years after those conversations had happened. The author explains that you can not remember exact quotes from extendet conversaitons over years. And at last he also sais that the Chevaliers escape from the prison in Venice could not have happened that way and instead mentiones that he had powerfull friends that might have bribed him free.
