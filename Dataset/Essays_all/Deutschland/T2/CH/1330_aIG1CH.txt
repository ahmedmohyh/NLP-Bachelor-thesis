The Chevalier de Seingalt

The Chevalier de Seingalt was a historic figure, living in the 18th century. Nowadays a lot of expertes discuss about his role in time and his trustfullnes.
In the Presentation about the man who wrotes a long memoir about his adventures the presenter talks about the accomishments of the Chevalier, trying to convince the critics of the accuracy of his memoir. 
Therefore she argues that it is possible to remember parts of a conversation years later, aspeccially when you take notes. She says that it is common that the Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember directly after his conversations. By saying this she critics the critics who are skeptical about the truth of the memoir because of the long time passed by between the conversation and the writing of the memoir years later, what is said in the text.
Moreover the presentater explaines that sometimes the Chevalier had to wait a few days for his money arriving. In this time he had to borrow money, but he wasn't at all poor like it is said in the text.
Her last and third argument is, that there where more inhabitants in the jail, having more powerful friends than the Chevalier. In her opinion they would have been freen before the Chevalier if there was the oppitunity, but they didn't. So it must be true that he made a hole in the ceiling of his cell to get free, also if the critics in the text have an other opinion. Futhermore she discusses that there are old venician documments existing, which prove that the ceilimg had to be repaired after the escape of the Chevalier. And why should they do so, if the Chevalier hadn't escaped through the roof?
All in all the text stands in contrair to the presentation, arguing about the Chevalier.
