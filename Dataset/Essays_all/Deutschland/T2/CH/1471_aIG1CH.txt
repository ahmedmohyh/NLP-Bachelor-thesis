The arguments out of the presentation shows the oppionions of the non-critics, who seen the memoir of Chevalier in three episods.
At first they see the time of Chevalier in Switzerland and his money problems while these time.
After that they see the Conversations with Volltaire and al least they see Chevaliers escape from the prison in Venice, Italy.
All in all the text about the Chevalier shows a more criticaly way of interprating his memoirs.
So the presentation and the text are like pro chevalier and con chevalier an his memoirs.
Both sides are about the same key-arguments. But the way oft thinking and argumentary of these arguments and points  is really different.
