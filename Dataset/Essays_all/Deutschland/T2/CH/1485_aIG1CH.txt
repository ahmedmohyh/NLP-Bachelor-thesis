The audio and written text are about the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798. In this memoir he wrote about his life and the adventures he experienced. The memoir is an important historical source because Chevalier met during his life many famous people, for example Voltaire, but there are some critics who doubt the accuracy of the memoir. In the audio file the accuracy of the memoir is defended. 
First the speaker admits that not everything in a memoir can be fully accurate but still she tries to explain the critical parts which are mentioned in the written text. 
The first argument of the critics is that Chevalier wrote that he was very whealthy while he lived in Switzerland but than he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant, which seems unrealistic for the critics. The speaker finds an explaination for it.
Secondary the critics argue that the conversation Chevalier had with Voltaire can not be accurate because it occured many years before Chevalier wrote it down. The speaker of the audio file believes in the accuracy of that conversation because although Chevalier wrote the memoir years later he took notes on the same evening he had the converstaion with Voltaire, which he used to write his memoir. 
The last aspect is about the prison escape of Chevalier. The critcs say that Chevalier wrote it more adventurous than it really was and they think that Chevalier had a politically well-connected friend help him to escape. The speaker defends that there were also other prisoners with even more powerful friends did not escape so it seems unrealistic for her that Chevalier could use his connections. In addition she says that the sealing of the door had to be repaired, which is a sign of accurancy of the spectaculate prison break.
