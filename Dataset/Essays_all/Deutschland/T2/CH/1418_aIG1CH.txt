The text and the presentation are both talking about the Chevalier de seingalt, while the text tries to proove his memory wrong and doubts the accuracy, his supporters still think his memoires are a reliable source.
Its starts with Chevalier claiming he was a rich man, although it´s prooved he had to borrow many from a Swiss Merchant. The spoken presentatuion argues that borrowing money doesn´t mean being poor, to make lots of money you have to borrow some first. However, his critics aren´t convinced he was that rich after all.
Secondly it´s the matter with his conversation with voltaire, that he wrote down many years after conversating with him, but with such an accurany that is impossible for a human being to remember exact phrases, to which his supporters answer that he wrote the phrases down directly after having the conversation and used his notes later to wrrte his memoires.
Lastly it´s known Chevalier was arrested in a prison in Italy, later he left it and it´s not certain if he was able to ecape how it is described in his memoir or if his powerful friends helped him. However having powerful friends doesn´t always help you, prisoners with way more powerful friends weren´t able to escape and the ceiling who had to be repaired after Chevalier used a piece of metal to make a hole in it, also doesn´t fit into the version of the critics.
