The woman had three points about the Chevalier, who are sometimes stated as false.
To show, that the source of the Chevalier is true and reliable she stated facts that happened in his time.
First she talks about the argument, that the Chevalier wasn't as rich and whealthy, as he himself wrote down. 
He borrowed money from merchants, which would mean that he didn't had much money. The woman says, to neutralize this point, that he waited for his money to arrive in Switzerland. He was known to spend alot of his money, so in the time where he had no money, because the money hasn't arrived yet, he loaned some money from merchants until he had some money again.
The second critic point is, that he couldn't know exact words that were used in conversations he had years ago. This is mostly true for all human beings, but the Chevalier was known to wrote down conversations in notes. The woman says, that he can know exact phrases used in conversations, because he did these notes after a conversation ended.
The last argue point is the prison escape. The Chevalier de Seingelt stated in his memoir that he escaped a prison by making a hole in the roof with a piece of metal. Critics say that he just had some powerful friends, which helped him to escape the prsion, but a prison escape is more enjoyable to read. On the other hand, the woman says, that there were also prisoners who had way powerful friends than the Chevalier and they didn't get out of the prison. 
And after the escape of the Chevalier, the prsions roof needed to be repaired. So the question is why did the roof needed to be repaired, other than the stated truth, that he escaped out of the prison by himself.
If the womans facts are true, than its clear that the memoir of de Seingelt is accurate and a reliable source from the past and that the points from the critics are false.
