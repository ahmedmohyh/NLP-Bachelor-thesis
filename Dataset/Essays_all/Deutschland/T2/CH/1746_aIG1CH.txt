The Chevalier: True or false?
The presenter in the presentation was arguing for the Chevalier and was defending the points he made in his memoires.
At first the presenter explained why the Chevalier had to borrow the vendor's money. The Presenter said that the Chevalier had to sell a lot of his property to get all the money for the parties and the gambling, but it took a lot of time to get the actual money after selling all of his stuff, so he borrowed money so he could already enjoy the parties. When he got the money from the purchase he was able to pay the money back to the vendor.
The second point the presenter defends is the story with Voltaire. The text said that it was impossible to remember exact lines of a conversation years after it had happened. But the presenter said that the Chevalier just wrote down what he actually could remember of the conversation, so there could have been much more content he would have remembered.
The last point the presenter defends is that the Chevalier did escape from the prison in Venice. At that time many prisoners with well connected friends were in the prison but not a single on did actually get out of the prison by a bribe. The other aspect is that old papers from venice were found that actually had the bill of ceiling repair in it, ceiling repair in the prison cell of the Chevalier. So the Chevalier actually escaper through the ceiling in his cell.
