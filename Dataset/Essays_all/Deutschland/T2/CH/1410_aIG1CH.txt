In the following text I am going to write a text about the Chevalier and two opoinions, whether his stories are invented or not.

In the text it is said, that all the storys and adventures are almost invented. To beginn with his live in switzerland, it is said that he was rich and he spent tons of money for gambling and parties, however it is known that he borrowed the money for that stuff from a swiss merchant. But the teacher said that he only did this, because he needed to wait for his money to arrive, so in that time when he was waiting, he borrowed the money to do even more parties or gambling. Also she said, that his memoires are pretty accurate and reliable, not like in the text. Furthermore the teacher said, that he has escaped from prison, because there are proofs for that. He escaped by his own, because why would the other jailers help him or even help him escape. There were people with far more powerful friends. And why did the prison say that they have to repair the seal if he had not made a hole in the ceiling?

To sum it all up we can not know whether his stories are true or not, but with these proofs there is a possibilty of reality in his stories. Nevertheless it can not be proven.
