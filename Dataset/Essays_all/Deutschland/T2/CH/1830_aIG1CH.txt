The Chevalier is mentioned as a controversial figure in the text and some critics have raised doubts about the accuracy of his memoir.

The first example of the text describes the Chevalier as a wealthy person living in Switzerland for a while. The critics have got the opinion that he hasn't been that rich he claimed because he wouldn't had to borrow money from a swiss merchant then. But the audio replies that he was not poor. He didn't borrow money because he didn't spent too much money for parties, one could only become rich when he sells something. Selling before spending. So he did not need money, he sold something.

The second example explains the conversations between the Chevalier and a famous writer named Voltaire. The text says that the conversations weren't captured correctly because it was written down many years later. The audio says, that the story of the conversations is true because the Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember after the nights he talked to Voltaire.

To summarize the arguments, the person in the audio is finding answers to explain the things the Chevalier has written down, no matter if it seems true while the critics in the text are thinking, if the statements of the Chevalier can be true.
