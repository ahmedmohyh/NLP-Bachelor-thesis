The text is about the Chevalier de Seingalt who lived from 1725 to 1798.
in the text critics are speakking about his memoir. THis is also the topic of the spoken information which were given before.
The first point of the text is that he made his life more exciting and glamorous with parties and that he lived in Switzerland he lend money from a Swiss merchant. That has to mean that he istn't rich. But the adio says that this doesn't has to mean he is pure because one first had to buy something and afterwards you earn money for that.
Second the text critics that he hasn't got that many conversations with Voltaire, a famous writer, because this was published way later and they say that it is not possible to recognize a convesation that well he wrote them down.
For tihs the audio also has a solution. It says that after this night conversations between the Chevalier and Voltaire that he made notes and didn't published them and until he did he just had them somewhere safe.
The last point of both surces are that he escaped from prison in Venice, Italy. Both critics agree that he should have had help because in prison where some guys who had more inluentiel friends and he had help of his jailers. They think that beacuse the ceiling they had for escaping was found by an other jailer.

The adio told that it isn't possible to have a memoir which is correct in every detail so one has to be carefull with information if it's are true or not.
