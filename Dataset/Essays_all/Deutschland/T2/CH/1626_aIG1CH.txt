Chevalier was a wealthy person, who spent a lot of money for parties and gambling. In writing part it is only said that he borrowed money for this, but in the listening part it becomes clear that borrowing money was normal even for rich people because to get it you first have to sell it. 
The second part of the writing and the listening part deals with Chevalier and Voltaire. They met each other for many times and spent time together talking. in writing part it is said that Chjevalier wrote down the conversations years later while in the listening part it is said that every evening after the meetings and conversations he took his time to write down everything they talked about only a few hours ago.
The thirt part of the text and the audio deals with Chevalier de Seingalt escaping from an notorious prison in Venice. Some people say that the story isn`t true but only for an enjoyable reading. 
All in all the three parts show that memoirs are often a controverse topic, because different people have different opinions about some aspects. The problem is that the truth about this can`t be proofed because the people like Chevalier aren`t alive anymore. Furthermore, it is important to think about the fact that no memoir is completly true because every writer wants to make a little more dramatic to become something like a hero. So you need to be able to seperate the true, historis parts of the untrue parts added by the writer by using diffent sources to get the best information.
