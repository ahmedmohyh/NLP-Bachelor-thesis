In contrast to the text, the lecture claims the Chevalier's memoirs to be a reliable historical source, referring to the arguments made in the text, proving them not to be an absolute proof for the inaccuracy of the memoir.

In the text, the author claims that the Chevalier's statement to have been rich during his stay in Switzerland must be wrong due to him borrowing money from a merchant.
The lecture however emphasizes that the Chevalier spent a lot of money on gambling and parties, so he would have had to wait some time until he got his money and profit back.
To fill the gap in between spending and earning miney, he could have had to borrow money from said merchant.

Additionally, the lecture neglects the text's point that the Chevalier could hardly remember his conversations with Voltaire years after these conversations by stating that the Chevalier made notes after every conversation with Voltaire and referred to thesse quotes while writing his memoir.

As third point to prove the memoir to be inaccurate, the text says the Chevalier to have bribed his way out of a prison in Venice, rather than cutting a hole in the roof.
The lecture however states him to not have been the most influential individual in the prison, though these had not escaped at that time, and the roof ahving to be replaced shorty afterwards.
