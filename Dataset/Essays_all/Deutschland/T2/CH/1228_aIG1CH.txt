Some critics don't believe everything the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote in his memoir, which are a great historical source of the eighteenth century.
In the text they have raised doubts, that the Chevalier invented some events or distored them to make his life more spectacular and glamourous. As an example they said, that it is not believable, that the Chevalier is rich, when he needed to borrow money. But on the other hand this is explanable, because he spend a huge amount of money for parties. He needed to wait some days for his new money to arrive and for this time he borrowed the money but paid it back later. 
The other critical point mentioned in the text is, that it is not possible to keep a completely conversation with the writer Voltaire in the mind to write it down later  and even remember some phrases word for word. 
The last point that critics questioned is, if he really escaped from the prison or if Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. But a argument for his escaping from prison is, that they were a lot more powerful persons in the prison than he was, who had better connections to other powerful people than he and even they were not able to get out of prison, but he was by escaping and it was mentioned later on that they needed to repair the seeling from his prison box, what is a point that his escape really happened.
