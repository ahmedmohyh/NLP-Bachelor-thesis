The text as the audio both deal with the famous memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. 
While the author of the text is convinced of its inaccuracy the audio does not doubt its reliability at all.
Critics doubt the accuracy of Chevaliers memoirs, they believe he made parts of it up just to make his life seem more interesting.
They for example doubt that the Chevalier could remember everything of his conversations with Voltaire.
They also dont believe he could possibly have escaped of the venetian prison as he tells in his memoir.

Others say the memoir of Chevalier is pretty reliable and accurate. THey disagree with the doubts of critics.
As an example they believe that the lone he needed in switzerland was just a way to pay all his parties but not proof for poverty. Some also say that the ceiling of the venetian prison witch needed to be repaired only days after his absence is a piece of evidence for his escape. 
Furthermore they explain his very detailed notes of his conversations with Voltaire. 
They say it is known that Chevalier took notes of their converstaions each night and was therefore able to write everything down in such accurate way.

So all in all the text
