The text "Chevalier" is about the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt and the truth of it. 

The memoir is about his life and the things he did in it. It is one of the most important historical sources in the eighteenth century. But anyhow, there are three experiences in it, that are doubted. Critics say that Chevalier invented them to make the life more interesting than it was.
One adventure, that is discussed, is the wealth of Chevalier. While living in Switzerland, Chevalier was rich. He spent a great deal of money on parties which made him more poor. But he just ran out of cash. He was not poor, he had still enough money.
 
Another discussed thing are the conversations with Voltaire. It is said that he inventend them because Chevalier wrote the memoir many years after his meetings with Voltaire and for that reason he could not remember so well. The truth is that Chevalier wrote all things he could rememeber down, as soon as he was at home after his meeting with Voltaire. That is the reasons why he could write years after the meetings so exact about it.

The last doubted thing is Chevaliers escape of the prison in Venice. People say that Chevaliers powerful friends freed him. But that is not true either. After the escape of Chevalier there was a hole in the ceiling. This says that he really escaped. Another reason for that is that other prisoners had more powerful friends and they weren´t freed.
