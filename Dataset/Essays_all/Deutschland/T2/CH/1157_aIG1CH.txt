The presentation about the Chevalier de Seinpalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798, was parted into three points. the first point says that the Chevalier wasn't a poor person, but it took him some time to get money. The text says in contrast to that, that the Chevalier was a rich man who spent much money, while he lived in Switzerland, on parties and gambling.
The second point of the presentation talks about his mimoir. He wrotes about his life and some advengers in his life. But in contrast to that the text says that he sometimes didn't tell the truth about his life, to make his life looks more exiting that it actually was.
The third and last point talks about his time in the prison in Venice. It says that he escaped from the prison. But in contrast to that the text says that it is not clear, if he really escaped. It is more possible that his jailers were bribed to free him.
