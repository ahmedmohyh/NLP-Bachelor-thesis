In the recording, the speaker offers counter arguments towards those given in the written text about the Chevalier's memoir claiming it as inaccurate.
To the claim that the Chevalier could not have been wealthy while in Switzerland because he borrowed a lot of money the speaker explains that the Chevalier did indeed have wealth, but most of it was in the form of real estate and not money. He then simply borrowed money while he was in the process of converting his wealth into currency.
Secondly, the speaker notes that there is evidence of the Chevalier keeping a journal of his conversations with important figures, thus negating the claim that he could not possibly remember his exact conversation with Voltaire.
Lastly, in response to the argument made about the Chevalier's prison escape being made possible through bribery instead of carving a hole in the roof, the speaker points out that at the time attempts to bribe the guards made by much wealthier prisoners than the Chevalier's friends had failed and the roof of the Chevalier's cell had to be repaired after his escape, evidenting his description of the event to be more accurate than given credit to by the text.
