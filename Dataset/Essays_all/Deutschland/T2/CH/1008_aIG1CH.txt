Chevalier, who lived from 1725 to 1798, wrote his memoir, that still cause disscussions nowadays.

Three parts of his life seem unreal to some critics, at least the way Chevalier presented them. While he was living in Switzerland, Chevalier said he da a lot of money which he spent. The critics say that he couldn't be rich, there is evidence that Chevalier borrwed money from a merchant. Why would he have to borrow money if he was so rich? Chevalier's supporters have a reason for that: he spent a lot of money on gambling and by doing that, he ran out of cash. Sometimes it took some time to turn his earnings into cash again, so for the time in between he borrowed some from the merchant.
Another thing that makes his memoir not seem reliable are the conversations to Voltaire. Critics say that no one could remember exact phrases from a conversation held a few years earlier. But again, the supporters have a reason for that: every night after talking to each other, notes were taken. Those notes were used by Chevalier when he wrote his memoires.
And the third controversial thing they argue about is his escape from the prison in Venice. Chevalier claims that he used a piece of metal to cut a hole in the rooftop to escape. Critics believe it wasn't the piece of metal that brought him out, but his friends in Venice who had connections to politicians. The supporters don't think it's true, they believe Chevalier. There's actually a record that says that the roof in Chevalier's prison cell had to be repaired shortly after he was out of jail. And other people, who had friends with even more influence in Venice didn't get out either, so his friends can't be the reason why he was released.

The reading and listening are like a disscussion. The both offer reasons why Chevalier's memoir is true or not. To decide this, there has to be more proof for either side.
