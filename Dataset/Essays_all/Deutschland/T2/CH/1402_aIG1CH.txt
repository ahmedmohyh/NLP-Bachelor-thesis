Chevalier de Seingalt, a man who wrote a long memoir which it´s used as a important historical source nowadays. But can we be sure that it can be used for it without giving us wrong or at least subjective influented information?

Many experts claim that yes. they can be used as a source but you have to proove wheater facts and events mentioned in there are true or not. They dough that every little detail is completely correct concerning his life and say that he just invented some parts to make his life look as interesting as possible. Mentioning the aspect that the Chevalier went out of money with the consequence, that he had to borrow some and therefore he couldn´t have been rich, some aspect contradicts this position by saying that chevaliers threw a lot of parties which cost a amount of money and therefore he just borrowed some money until his money arrived. Another aspect is that the imprisionment. The chevalier escape prison by his own without the help of his friends, say some experts. Others claim that he just got free by his politically well-connected friends. 

To conclude one can say, that even the experts can not agree in many aspects. A reason for that it cleraly that they are memoirs and naturally are the opinion and view of one specific person. Therefore it can not be used as a source to explain every other things that happened but yes as a help to understand why people reacted like that in the past.
