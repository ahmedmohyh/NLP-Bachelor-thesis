In the one hand, the text says Chevalier wrote a memoir recounting his life and adventures.In the eighteenth century, the memoir become an historical source about European society. In his memoir he wrote that he was very wealthy while he lived in Switzerland. He spent a great deal of money there on parties and gambling. Than theres also the point in his memory where he wrote that he had a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. But no one doubts that they met together and this is the rason why the critics are skeptical about the accuracy of the recording Chaveliers memories.Then he had to go to the Venetian prison because he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. 
On the other hand, the recorded voice explains such the same thing. The momory of Chavelier is a historical source but she doesn´t say for the European society. She also said that he had wealth while he lived in Switzerland because he eraned a lot of money.But the big diffrence between the text and the recorded womans voice shows that Chavelier met the famous writer voltaire and that there are no critics which were skeptical because of this kind of conversation. Also the voice didn´t tell that Chavelier was in prison and the reason of it.
