In the following essay  I would like to comepare the written article and the speak about the Chevalier de Seingalt.
Both sources mentioned, that the Chevalier wrote a memoir about his life and adventures. But there are a important differents between these two sources.

First of all the text above says that the Chavelier wasn´t rich, because he borrowed much money. In the listing part the explanation for this behaviour was that he used credits to make parties, but he always gave the money that he borrowed back in the following days. So the speaker has the opinion that the Chavelier was atually rich.

The next thing that the text critizises is that it isn´t possible to have so detailed thoughts about communications
that are a few years in the past. The speaker has on the other side the opinion that he wrote detailed sentences in a book after his communications in the evening. 

The third point is the escape of the prison in Venice. The text mentions that the Chavelier´s jailers came to give him the freedom back. the speaker of the listing part thinks on the others side that he escapes by using a piece of metale to make a hole in the ceilling. A  proof for this theory is that sources are found, which mentions that the cell of Chevalier got repaired short after the time, when the Chevalier was in prison.
