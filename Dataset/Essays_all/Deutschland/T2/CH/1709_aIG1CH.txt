Refering to the memoires of the so called Chevalier there are a lot of people who critizise his memoires and say the adventueres he experiencend were most invented. The text is about the doubts this people have explained with three exaamples. the audio contains facts that support the fact the reliability of the memoires and weaken the arguments of the text.
While living in Switzerland the Chavalier writes about beeing wealthy and having a lot of money at that particular time, however other sources say he had to borrow money what doesn´t make sense. In the audio they have the argument that it was normal that it took time until you get your money in another land due to the fact of the different types of money.
In his memoires Chevalier writes about a conversation he supposed to have with the well known Voltaire, critics complain that he wouöndßt have been able to caputre the exat words of this conversation. The argument which supports the memoires reliability is that Chavalier used to take notes while experiencing his adventures or in thgis case talking to a person.
Another story which appears in his memoires is his escape from a prison in Italy. Chavalier writes about using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and than escaping through the roof. Critics claim that he had many powerful friends in Italy who could have managed to free him on a legal way. However the person in the audio refers to other prisoners who have even more powerful friends and contacts andthey weren´t able to get out of the prison that way. In addition to that there are sources which proof that the ceiling which he seemed to be escaping through had to be repaired some time after his escape.
