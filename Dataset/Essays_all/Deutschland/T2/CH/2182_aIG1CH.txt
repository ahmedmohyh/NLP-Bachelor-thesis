The woman in the listening part had a positiv opinion according to the Chevalier and said that the memoir are accurat and reliable. Her first argument is that borrowing money isn't a sign of beeing poor. Chevalier had many parties in Switzerland so it was logical that he sometimes ran out of money and then had to borrow a little bit cash. 
Secondly she claims that the conversations with Voltaire could be seen as an accurat memoir too bacause he took notes during all of his meetings and talks which he kept until he wrote his stories down. 
The last argument is about his escape from the Venetian prison. Other prisinors had much more politically well-connected friends than Chevalier. So the argument that he could escape with help of them seems to be weak. Instead there are governmental documents which said that Chevalier's ceiling had to be reconstructed after his escape. According to these documents it seems to be correct that he escaped by destroying the walls of his room.
All in all the woman's opinon is completely different to the one the text claims out. She is convinced that all of Chevalier's memoir have a huge part of true information and could be used as informative and reliable historical sources.
