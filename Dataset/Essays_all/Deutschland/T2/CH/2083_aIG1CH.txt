In the recording, the woman speaking admitted to not all memoirs being entirely true, however she also said that the chevalier memoirs are at the very least accurate and thus she began to explain why she believes them to be accurate.

It is known and undeniale that chevalier was a wealthy person who had many famous and powerful friends. But also his journals indicate that he was very much interrested in going to parties aswell as gambleling at saidparties.
Therefore he at some points of his life ran out of money ,but only until he had earned new money through his career and so he sometimes resorted to borrowing money since he had already spent so much before he had earned more. This means that chevalier was not poor but rather poor at handling money. Although he wouild not have admitted to borrowing vast sums of money and only wanted to his life seem very glamorous, even his own notes and written down conversations have pointed out that he in fact was not the most organized person who could spend his money wisely or save some of his money for later times.

Lastly, the recording pointed out that chevaliers notorious prison escape was not made up but instead actually happened. This was explained through "police" reports which said the ceilong of his cell had to be repaired and that is why his alleged escaped is valid.Another reasoning for his own escape without bribing jailers is the fact that chevalier might have had powerful friends that could have busted him out, however in venice many of his enemies had even more powerful friends which is why he did not have enough powerful well-connected friends to help him out of jail.
