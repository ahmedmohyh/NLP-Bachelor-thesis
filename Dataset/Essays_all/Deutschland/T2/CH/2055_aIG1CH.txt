The Cheavalier was a writer and controversial figure. The text I heard was not very critc about the Chevalier's life like the text I read. 

The women who did the podcast claimed the memories and written texts by the Chevalier as real and accurate. She said that he had a good life, did many parties and gambled very often. Another point is that he had much money but his type of money earning took some time so he invested some money, had to wait a few days and then got big profit. So in the time between he had to borrow some money but that was not difficult for him because he had many well known and political important friends. He also escaped a prison in Italy by just using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. Many critics think that is fake because it is more enjoyable to read but the woman who created the podcast claimed it as real because the ceiling of his room had to be repaired. 

The podcast and text are telling the completly opposite of the other and so we don't know what's real or what#S
