The woman said, that the source from chevalier is very accurate, but some critics say, that he invented many events to make his life mir exciting. In the text it says, thtát chevalier was poor and borrowed money, but in the reading it was like: he had to sell his property and had to wait for his money, so if he run out of cash, he had to borrow some. Also the woman said, he had met often with voltaire, but some critics say, that he never met him. Also the story about the escape from the prison in venice isn't correct. He shall have used a piece of metal to cut a hole in the ceiling and escape through the roof. But the critics say, that he has had connections to some politics and got a bribe offered. So the woman aked ironical, why they had to repair the ceiling in the prison.
