The text states that a lot of events of the Chevaliers memoires are not very accured. The speaker claims that these events were true events which had hapened.

First it is said, that the Chevaleir was really wealthy, even though he had to borrow some money from a merchant in Switzerland, because it always took some time to transfer the money he made.
Second, the conversations between him and Voltaire were pretty accuured in his memoires, because he took notes after each conversation and refered to them in his memoires.
Finally, the jail break had to be a real event, because the was little chance for Chevalier to get freed with such a status. Also, the ceiling had to be replaced.

After all, the speaker´s opinion is that his memoir is a leiable source, while the text considers most of Chevalier´s memoir as distorted.
