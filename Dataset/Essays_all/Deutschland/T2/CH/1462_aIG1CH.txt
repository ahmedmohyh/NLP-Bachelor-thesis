Chevalier de Seingalt was a man who lived from 1725 to 1798. He wrote a memoir with a lot of storys and adventures. But he got a lot of critic for it with the reason wes lying to make his sorys more exiting then they really were. Also they criticized that he wrote something things down years after they happend so it might be incorrect. But there are a lot of people who tell the opposite because he alwasy made notes. 
He has many follower who support his memoir but also many enemies who criticize it. He said that he got out of prison, but many people criticized it because there were more prisioners who have more friends whocould help them but were not able to breack out. But there was a scource that told that the prison had to repare the roof of his cell. If the storys are really truth will be in some cases never clear. The text is more criticizing and the audio is more supporting and are basing more on real scources.
