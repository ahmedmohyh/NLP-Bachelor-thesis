In the heard text, the speeker explaines why the Chevalier's memoir isn't invented and at least partly correct. He contradictes to the arguments in the text. The speeker of the presentation says that it is possible to live in Swzitzerland and borrow money, even though the Chevalier was rich, it is said in the memoir. The text claims that if the Chevalier was rich, he wouln't have been forced to borrow money. 
Critics are also sceptical about the conversations between the Chevalier and Voltaire, because they're too precise for being written down many years later, it is said in the text. But the speeker contradicts and claims that the Chevalier has collected many conversations with Voltaire, before he wrote his memoir. 
The text questiones the Chevalier's escape from a Venice' prison. In his memoir, the Chevalier sais that he made a hole into the ceiling and escaped. The author sais that this version of the escape would be enjoyable to reed, but very unrealistic. In contrast to that, the speeker mentiones that a year after the Chevalier's eycape, the ceiling had to be repaired. Thuís is a fact that prooves the correctness of the Chevalier's memoir.
