The Chevalier de Seingalt is with his memmoir an important  source for society in the eighteenth century. However, there are things that just don't add up in his memoir, critics say. His memoir is very exact in every detail and criticers say that no memoir can be that exact. But is that true?
Critics claim that many things are just exaggerated to make his life more interesting. For instance, the case that he borrowed money in Switzerland, although he was rich. But we have to ask ourselves: Where does this wealth come from? In order to achieve wealth, you have to spend money and things first and in this period you don't have any money. So, it could be true that he really was poor when he was in Sitzerland because of this reason.
Furthermore, critics say that the conversations that he had with Voltaire cannnot be a hundert percent correct because he remembered the exakt phrases and words and nobody could do that. However, there are sources telling that it might be correct, because he took notes after every conversation with Voltaire and wrote down everything after the talks. When he wrote his memoir, it is condfirmed that he used the help of notes which could have also been the notes he took from the conversations with Voltaire.
The third point that critics say is wrong, is his escape from prison in Italy. Critics have the opinion that he wanted to make a good story, so he wrote that he escaped through the roof where he made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal. Because this is a very unsual explanantion, critics think that he more likely was freed. Nevertheless, documents say that the ceiling of his cell in prison had to be renewed after his escape. And what reason should there be to repair a ceiling if it wasn't broken in a way?
To sum up, Chevalier de Seingalt stays a very mysterious source and person where you have to decie for yourself what you want to believe.
