In the text there is written that Chevalier de Seingalt met lots of famous people for example Voltaire.First there are critics that he cannot captured these conversations with Voltaire accurately. But the speaker explained that he wrote down all points he could remember after every nights conversation. So this point is possible. There are also critics in the point that he borrowed money from a merchant. Because we knew that he had to be really rich to live  his life in the way he wrote about it. The speaker explained that the fact that he borrowed money does not even mean that someone is poor. He could just have needed money because his money werent in the same country at the time. The last fact is that Chevalier de Seingalt wrote about his escape out of the prison in Venice. Its suspect that he should have escaped but other inmates which have more powerful connections out of prison couldnt.
