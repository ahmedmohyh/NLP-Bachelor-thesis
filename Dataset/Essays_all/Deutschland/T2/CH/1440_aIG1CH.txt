The téxt about the Chevalier de Seingalt, who livde from 1725 to 1798, is about his memorial. The Critics are very skeptical about the things he wrote down.
He says he has been very rich and could spend a lot of money but they found out that he had to borrow a lot of money. On the other hand everyone has to borrow money to get to start spending money on something.
That underlines that he was'nt poor.
Also they are skeptical about his escape from prison in Venice. For some it can not be true that he escape dwith s piece of metal. They say it is just for the enjoyable reading.
His conversations sound also not really real because Critics say it is impossible to know the exact phrases.
In the second source the women tells that no memorial can be corrected and that the points the Critics are skeptical about are not that wrong. 
The Chevalier wrote about his own life so he would has known if it is true ore not.
It is true that some points are not very clear but no one can say that they are wrong and they can not be corrected.
