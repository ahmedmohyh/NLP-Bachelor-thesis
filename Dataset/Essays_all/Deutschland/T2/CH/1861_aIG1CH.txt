Both the woman and the text talked about the same 3 points of the memoirs of the Chevalier. The woman said that he probably wans't poor and had wealth. She said that he spent much money on parties and gambling and that this was the reason for him borrowing money. So he just borrowed it for the time he waited to recieve his income. The author has another opinion and uses the fact that the Chevalier borrowed money as a proof that he wasn't rich. He doesn't explain that further though. The second point is about the Chavaliers conversations with Voltaire and him remembering excact parts of his converations with him. The author of the text claims that it is imppossible to remember exactly what you said in a conversation and that the conversation in Chevaliers memoirs is not acurate because of that. The woman does't think so at all and explains Voltairs ability to exactly rember the conversation with him taking notes. She sas that people around Voltaire admitt that he often took notes, so that he most likely did that in Voltaire's case too. The last point is about Voltaires escape from prison, the author sas its unlikely that the Chevalier escaped thru the ceiling like he claims in his memoirs and that it is more likely that he bribed the jailers to free him. The woman has a completely diffrent opinion and doesn't and said that back then in the prison it was hard to bribe the jailers and that option one is a more likely scenario. She claims that the ceiling had to be repared shortlay after the Chevaliers escape and that the only reason for that could be his escape through it.
