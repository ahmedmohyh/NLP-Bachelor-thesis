The Chevalier experienced a lot of adventures during his life in the 18th century. Caused by this life full of adventures there exists a lot of critics. 
First the Cheavieler wrote down that he was very wealthy while he lived in Switerland, but also he needed do borrow a high amount of money which leads to critics. This could be explained by the fact, that he had to sell all his stuff to reach such a high amount of money. Of course this did not happen on just one day, so he needed to borrow money to survive while he is waiting for his things to sell to earn his own money.
The next critical point in the text are the conversations between the Chevalier and Voltaire. Critics are skeptical because he wrote about this chapter of his life many years after that happened. The reason why he was able to capture all this anyway is that he consolted notices all the time during his conversations with Voltaire so that he could remember them all the time. 
At last Critics say that the Chevalier just brought in an escape of a prison to make his life look more interesting. They think he was just well-connected to some politics in Venice, who bribed to free him. In the audio was said, that other prisoners could escape also then, because they had even more powerful friends outside the jail than the Chevalier had. Also the sealing of his cell needed to get prepared, which is when the Chevalier used his chance to escape from the prison.
