In the following text, I´ll summarize the two explainings about the Chevalier de Seingalt, which lives from 1725 to 1798.
He wrote his memoires about his life and his adventures, which he had in his glorious life, but the life didn´t must so glorious, so have a look.

The memoires were very important and a historical source about the European society in the eighteenth century, but it´s critical, if the stories by the Chevalier are really then truth or they are flase.
The Chevalier was a big person in history, he met famous people, like Kings and writers, or he made many parties and events, which were very big and glorious.

An example for the problem is his party in Switzerland, where he had to borrow money, but in his memoires, he was a rich man, so it must be a lie by him, because for the debts, he made, he had to borrow money and a rich man, didn´t have to do that.
The Chevalier also must lie with his meeting with the famous writer Voltaire, because the critics said, that could not be happened, that they met and conversed.
Besides this two examples, the escape of the prison in Venice was a big part of his memoires, which could not be true, because he said or wrote in his memoires, that he escaped of the prison by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof.
It´s a very good history, which is exciting to tell somebody, but it could not be true, so it´s incorrect and impossible, that the Chevalier told the truth in his memoires.

All in all, there are many signs, which are showing, the incorrect memoires of the Chevalier by him.
He tried to make his life more adventurious, which is in our time a problem, because we don´t know, which parts of history are true and which are false.
