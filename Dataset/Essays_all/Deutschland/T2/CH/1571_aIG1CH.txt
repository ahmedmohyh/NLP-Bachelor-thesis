The woman talk about the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. She also critizies the arguments from text.
In her way of protecting the memoir she said that first of all he wasn´t poor. The only reason why he borrowed same money from other people is, that in Switzerland you have to pay a lot of money rihgt before you can aventiolly start to earn anything. The most of his money he bacem hat big partys where he spend a lot into them too. 
Another big point was that he had a few friends who had a higher position in life, why shoudnt it be possible to talk to other important people too? Maybe it is right that he did not know every single word but he could have taken notes whith wich he could remember such a few frases from these conversations. 
Aswell she critizieses the poin, in which he flew out of the prison. The most redigulous point for her was, why should the prison had to repaer the his room when he did not use a piece of metal for making o hole in his ceiling and escape. Even if he had some influaced friend, it was nnot possible to help him by his escape in an another way.
