The lecture and the text disagree on certain aspects, concerning the reliability of the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. The text for once claims that the Chevailr could not have been wealthy, since he borrowed money from a swiss merchant. Critics argue if he had really been rich, he would not have needed to borrow money. the lecturer however disagrees with that point and argues that, the Chevalier did not have his money in cash, but instead in physical property, wich takes time to convert into money, and for that time he reportedly borrowed some money.
The second aspect the sources disagree on is about conversations between the Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire. The text says that critics argue that the memoir could not capture the conversations accuratley, because it was written many years after the conversation has happend. The lecturte on the other hand suggest that Chevalier wrote down notes each night after each conversation and then refered to them later in his memoir.
the final point brought up by the text is about Chevaliers notourios prison escape. His memoir claims he had escaped the prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. Critics argue that it was more likely that he bribed the jailers through his political connections. The lecturer disagrees with that point, sibce there were many more powerfull prisoners who did not escape. In addition to that, she says that the ceiling reportedly had to be repaired after Chevaliers escape.
