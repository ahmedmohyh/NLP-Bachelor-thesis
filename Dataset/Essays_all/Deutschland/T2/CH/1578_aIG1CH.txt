The Chevalier was a man living in the 18th century. He was meeting several famous and important persons and collected his adventures and wrote a memoir abou it. HIs memoir now leads to a big discosuiin.

First of all you can say that the two different types of sources seem to aim a completely different aim. The Text about the Chevalier seems to doubt the reliability and correctness of his stories, whether the spoken words seem to confirm the stories of Chevalier.

According to the audition abou the Chevalier, he is a historical reliable source. The stories he tells about himself seem to be correcct. For example the stories about him partying and gambling for money in switzerland. Eventhough he was gambling for money he was not poor but had to borrow money several times to get over the time he needed to make his gambling profit to real money. Annother point that is mentioned in the audition is the prison break of Chevalier. According to the audition there are additional historical sources of the government of Venice which increase the reliability (after the potential escape of Chevalier the room was damaged).

In comparism to this the text seems to decrease the reliabilty of Chevaliers stories. Resulting out of this doubts many critics say that the some stories are invented (e.g the relationship to Voltaire. Also Critics say that the fact that Chevalier borrowed money would be an Antithese to his discribed wealth. An additional point that seems controversial is that Chevalier had several powerful friends while beeing a prisioner in Venice, so he possibly did not escape, he probably just used his cvonnections to get free.
