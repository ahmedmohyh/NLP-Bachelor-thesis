Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) was a really famous man because of his memorial which became a really popular historical source. He met kings, writers and other famous people and wrote about their meetings and conversations in his memoir.
But there are many people who don´t trust this memoir as a "historical" source because they doubt that´s is accurate to the historical content. Many people critized that it seems more like a written story or fairytail and not the truth that actual happened. This opinion is based on following arguments.
First of all they believed that it wasn´t possible for the Chevalier to write an accurate text about the conversation that happened years before. But in his memoir he wrote down a complex conversation with the writer Voltaire which made the people doubt that he was able to remember this conversation with that many details. The other side with a high opinion of the Chevalier explain that people from his timespan reported to see him with notebooks all the time and that he worked with those notes while writing the memoir. That is supposed to be the reason why he was able to write about such a detailed conversation that happened years ago.
The criticts also think that the Chevalier didn´t escaped the prison in Italy like he wrote in his memoir. He claimed to escape while using a peace of metal and the ceiling. Critics doubt that he was able to do this unseen and that he problaby just used his good connections that bribed him. The supporters of the Chevalier´s memoir claim that there were much more powerful people in the prison than him and that they weren´t able to get bribed so why should he. They think he was telling the truth because after he left the prison, they had to repair the ceiling and that´s how his story would make sense.
