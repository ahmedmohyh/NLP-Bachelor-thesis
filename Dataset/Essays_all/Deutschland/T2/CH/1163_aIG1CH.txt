                                         The Chevalier de Seingalt
First of the Chevalier borrowed money because he didn't had cash and not because he was poor. He just had to wait for his money to come and while he did he borrowed some. But in the text it says that critics argue about that because if he was so rich why did he had to borrow money. The second point is about his conversations with Voltaire. Many critics think that it's almost impossible to recognize such a conversation so accurately like he did. But on the other hand he claimed to be taking notes after every conversation they had, so he could use them to write his memoir.The last difference to point out is that critics belive he just bribed some people to be freed because he had many powerfull friends in Venice. But there were people with even more powerfull friends imprisoned too. So why didn't they just bribed there way out of there? And why did his cells' roof needed to be repaired after he was free? Those are all points that proof that he mentioned nothing but the truth in his memoirs.
