Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798.
Before his death he wrote a memoir about the adventures in his life.
Chevalier was a controversial person.
Some of his adventures are more unrealistic than realistic.

He claims that he was very wealthy during his life in Switzerland.
But critics argue, that if Chevalier had been rich, why did he need to borrow money from a Swiss merchant.
He sold parts of his belongings and needed to wait for the money, during this time he borrowed the money to live.
But borrowing money does not make him poor.
Chevalier once met Voltaire. 
He wrote down the conversation very accurately.
Critics argue, that if he wrote the memoir yyears later, how can he remember such specific parts of the conversation.
But Cevalier made notes after the conversation with Voltaire.
He wrote down everything he could remember.
These notes make his memoire so specific.
Another adventure was his escape from the prison in Venice.
He wrote down he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling.
Critics say he had politically very well-known friends, but other people in the prison had more well-known contacts than him and did niot manage to escape.
In addition a few years later they found out, that one ceiling had to be repaired.
