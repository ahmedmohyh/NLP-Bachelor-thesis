In the following i will summerize the arguments of the speech.

At the beginning of the text the woman said that memoires not always are correct.
After that she said that the chevalier is not poor. He just spendet very much money in partys, woman, and cars(!).
He got into a prison and had no powerful friends like the other prisoners. That contradicts to the text in whiche is  written that he "had a number of politically well-connected friends".
