The text and the presentation were about the accuracy of the live-adventures of Chevalier de Seingalt. Just before the ending of his life he wrote a memoir to sum up his adventures. But they all seem to be partly invented. When he was in Switzerland, he was described, as if it was not clear, if he was rich or poor, because he borrowed a lot of money and a rich man didn`t need to borrow any money. In the presentation the woman considers, that it does`nt mean he was poor if he borrowed money, because he could pay it back and still be rich. Another point to be mentioned, is that the Chevalier can remember the whole conversation with Voltaire, because he wrote down every single sentence years after the actuall conversation. The Chevalier also said, that he escaped from the prison using a piece of metal, to make a hole to climbing out. But critics, like the author of the text say, it is probably just written like that to make is adventure seem more exciting and glamorous. He expects him to have had a lot of friends in the government, who let him go, because they offered a bribe. All in all I think, that the Chevalier just tried to write a memoir having had a very exciting life and trying to make other people jeleaus. Also, as the critics have mentioned it is very unusual, that someone can remember a conversation so clearly. This was just a joke.
