Critics have seen a lot of striking points in the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. 
Ohne of them ist the conversation with Voltaire.The critics says, that nobody can remember every single word from a conversaition years ago. But on the other hand, there are people who said that each  night, he wrote down what he remembered, so that the whole conversaition could be writen down exactly.
Another point ist his escape from the prison. Critics have questioned, that he didn't use a piece of metal to make a hole in the celling. They said, that he must have had good politically and well-conected friends who let him escape. But other prisoners had powerful friends too and no one escaped. Forthermore, after the escaping from Chevalier, his old ceiling must be repaired. They believed that thats happend because of the breakout.
While he lived in Switzerland, he was very wealthy and  he borrows money from  a Swiss merchant,so he coudn't be that rich. Others said, that he only has to borrow money, because in Switzerland, you have to give money before you become something back. Therefor, he wasn't poor.
