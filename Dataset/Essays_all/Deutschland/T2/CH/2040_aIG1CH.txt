Both the text and the lecture are talking about the Swiss Chevalier de Seingalt and the accuracy of his memoir. While the text is very critical about it and brings up many arguments that make it seem like the Chevalier tried to spice up his memoir a bit with lies and remodeling situations that took place by adding some fictional details that would make them seem more adventurous and exciting, the lecturer had an explanation for every point the text brought up. She said that it was not a sign of poverty that the Chevalier borrowed money but simply a normal thing the swiss Chevaliers did while they were waiting for their money they earned from selling their property, it always took some days for the money to arrive. She also brought up that it is in fact possible to write down exact sentences from a conversation you had many years before writing your memoir, the text stated this as impossible but the lecturer pointed out that the Chevalier possibly wrote down the bits and pieces a remembered from the conversation shortly after having it and that he used these notes whilest writing his memoirs years later.
