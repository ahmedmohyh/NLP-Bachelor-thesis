In the following text, i will write about the Chevalier de Seingalt. 
He was an interesting and controversial figure, but some people have raise doubts about his memoir. They say, it could not be possible to remember all these things so accurat and some events in the memoir couldn't have happened in the way he described it. For example his escape from the Venetian prison. They say, he probably just talked to one of his well conected friends in Venice, so one of them could offer a bribe. They also say, that he had to borrow money while he lived in Switzerland, but he wrote he was very wealthy. In the other text, they say it was possible to remember so many details, because he always took notes and used these notes to write the memoir. And the prison break was probably real, because some other prisoners had event more powerful friends and they had to stay in prison too. Also there was a repair of the roof of the prison after he escaped, and he claimed to have gone threw the roof. 
The last thing is his wealthy life in Switzerland. He really had to borrow money, but that was because most of his money was not money, but expensive things he sold. He always borrowed money when he ran out of it, but then he sold some of his things and was abled to give the money back.
