i dont know what i can write down in this essay. I hate listening comprehension so much -.-'!
But idk the in the 18th century existing guy Chevalier de Seinglalt (1725-1798) wrote a long memoir of his life and adventures. For example he went to Switzerland and spend there lots of money for parties and so on. Also he had a big conversation with Voltaire and even he broke out of a prison in Venice. Ok thats it. Thats are the information I had from the text and the speech I listened to. But because Im very bad at remembering the things I heard in the speech I cant write down the differences which are existing between the text and the speech. Im very sad to tell you that MEWS :(. But maybe anyway I can make you smile. Yeah, you read right! YOU! Youre the reader of my text, yay. Obviously I have so many questions to you..Ok Im Anonymous for you but obviously I want to know who is reading this senseless text :'D!!! Do you a boy or a girl? Do you have brown or blonde hair? Are you a student or a senior, who doesnt have to work anymore but want to do something? These are question that could be very interesting for me to be answered. But you will never know my name, my adressee or if im a boy/girl or another gender...hmmmm. Sad life, but thats life. 
LIFE IS LIFE NANANANANA wow loved this song in my young twenties..ok no just kidding ^^
