It's about the man Chevalier de Seingalt who wrote a memoir about himself, but this memoir was wrote totally diffrent than the truth. He lied about a lot of things, however that doesn't mean he was a poor man. Chevalier was in the middle class in Switzerland, to have a lot of money, he needed to work hard. His life wasn't always easy because of that but he had a good wealth. He also met Voltaire, a famous person, in his meetings with him he wrote everything down that was interessting for him. However he needed also to go to jail in Venice, he became free because of rich friends but other prisoners had more powerful friends than him. 
In some points you can see, the differences to the text, but there are also simulties. Both say the memoir Chevalier wrote wasn't that true, he want others to believe, hoewever he lived in Switzerland and had a good life. The text it will be said, that Chevalier had a lot of money but the girl who presented him said he wasn't that rich or poor, he had a normal life but needed to save mioney too. In the text it will also be said, that Chevalier were bribed to get out of the jail but you can hear some rich friends payed money to get him free. It's also in the text that he had a lof of politically friends, the presentation didn't said who it was but that he had some rich people he knew. 
To sum it up, both don't say totally different things, just some small things like who were his rich friends or if he had money or not are different. However that he lived in Switzerland both are totally sure. So you can't really say what's true and what's wrong.
