The presentation says, that the memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt are correct and the critic is wrong.
First the woman says, that Chevalier in Switzerland spent his money on parties and gambling and had to borrow some, but only because of the reason, that he got his new money some days later. So he wasn't a poor man. The text says, that Chevalier faked his memoirs to make his life more glamorous. So in reality he was poor and have to borrow money, because he spent all of his money on parties.
Another aspect of the presentation is the real meeting with the writer Voltaire. The text is another opinion. Chevalier didn't meet the writer because it's not possible to capture the conversation in detail.
The last point is, that Chevalier escaped of a prison of Venetia. The record gives the information that Chevalier should escape through a celing, because the celing in his cell had to be repared after his escape. The text is another opinion. It says, that Chevalier had connections to politicians. Because of that he is escaped.
