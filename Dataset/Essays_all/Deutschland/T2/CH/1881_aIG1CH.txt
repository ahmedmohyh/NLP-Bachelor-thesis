In the listening part the woman mentioned that no memoir can be right. But in her opinion Chevaliers memoir could be right. Her first point is that just because Chevalier hadn't any money in Switzerland it doesn't have to be that he was poor. In the thext they mentioned that he wrote in his memoir that he eas rich at the time while he stayed in Switzerland but he borrowed himself money so they said that he lied with this fact in his memoir.
The second point in the conflict is the conversation between Voltaire and Chevalier. In the listening part the woman said that Chevalier wrote his notice about the conversations at the same night but kept it for years and thenn wrote them down so they are true. Critics say that this conversation can't be true becsause they say that he wrote this memoir many years after this conversation had been so he couldn't remember every word so he lied.
The third conflict theme is the escaption out of the notorious prison in Venice. In the listening part she said that it must be true that Chevalier escaped because they had to repair the prison room after his escape. In the Text the critics said that it can't be true that he escaped out of prison by a metal. That he just wanted to give his readers a adventure but the true is that he had well connected friends in Venice who could free him out of prison so in there opinion it's just one of Chevaliers lies to make his memoirs more exiting. 
In general the critics of Chevalier say that he is a liar and doesn't tell the truth about his life and his promoter say that every memoir can be true or false you can't know it but Chevaliers has to be true.
