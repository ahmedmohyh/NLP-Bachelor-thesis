In the lecture, they spoke against the arguments from the text.
At first there was mentioned in the text, that Chevalier claimed to be rich, when he lived in Switzerland. Critics say that this can't be true, because he borrowed money from a rich merchant.
In the lecture they say, that he still can be rich, because it was proven, that if you sold something in Switzerland, at that time, you had to wait a few days for your money. So while he waited for his money, Chevalier borrowed something, so that he still can go on parties and gambling.
The second thing are the conversations with Voltaire. The critics say, that he could not remember every phrase so detailed like Chevalier did, because those conversations are lying back many years from the time, when he wrote his memoires. The lecture says against this point, that Chevalier wrote down everything from the conversation, right after they were hold. There are also friends, which can prove it. 
The last chapter of Chevalier's memoires is, that he claimed to escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy, just by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climb through the roof. Critics say, that this was just to make the memoires more exciting to read, and in reality, Chevalier had friends, who had bribed the prisoners, in order to free Cheavlier. The lecture, in contrast to that, says, that there were other prisoners with stronger friends, who didn't bribe the prisoners and also, after the escape of Chevalier, they had to repair the ceiling.
So you can see, that the text is the contra side, for the topic of the accuracy of Chevalier's memoires and the lecture is the pro side, who defends Chevalier and gives arguments, why his memoires are true.
