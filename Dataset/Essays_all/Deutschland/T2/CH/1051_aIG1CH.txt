The Chevalier is a person that lived in the eighteenth century. His memoirs were used to earn a lot of information about the society in Europe at this time. There are critics who say that his stories are not a reliable source that you can trust on because of the Chevalier interest to present himself as special and interesting.
The held speech represents the opinion that his memoirs are a reliable source.
Some critics say that he was poor at some point so he borrowed money to say that he is rich. The opposite sais that he had to borrow money because he sold a lot of things and meanwhile did not have enough money to afford his life.
Another argument is given if you take a look at the conversation with Voltaire. Some say that it is not possible to remember specific parts of a conversation word by word. Others say that Chevalier met Voltaire more often so that they exchange their adventures and information constantly so that Chevalier could make an overall summerize of Voltaires thoughts.
The last point is that Chevalier should escaped from prison because of his friend in high politically positions.
In the speech it is said that the ceiling of his room in prison has to be repaired so he could easily escape.
