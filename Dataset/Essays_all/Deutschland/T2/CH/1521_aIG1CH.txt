There have been many discussions about Chevaliers memoir. Many people claim that may things he wrote can not possibly be true and that he just wrote them down to make his life apear more exiting and glamorous.But there is an explanation for everything.
In this essay I want to show that the arguements given in the text must not necessarily be true.

The fact that he borrowed much money when he was in Switzerland while he claimed to be rich does not mean that he was poor. Because you always need money to start something big like a business or a company for example. The second point that was criticised was his conversation with Voltaire. People think that it is not possible that he remembered every detail of the conversation over the years. But it is possible that he wrote the whole conversation down right after they talked and then add it to his memoir. The third point that was discussed was that Chevalier bribed someone in jail to let him out. But it is a fact that his cell door had to be repaired after he was gone. That implies that there must have been someone who opened the door by force, probably to escape. So bribery could not have been possible or is at least not very likely.
