The presentation wants to proof that the text is wrong. The examples that were given in the text might seem true but there are some hints that he didn't just invented thing. The text sais that the Chavalier wasn't really rich, because he borrowed a lot of money. It is true that he did borrow money but it doesn't mean that he is poor. The Chevalier just spent a lot of money on partys and gambling. This need a great amount of cash and when he was out of money because he had to wait until the next month, he actually had to borrow from others. This doesn't mean that he is poor. In addition the text sais that he couldn't have ever remembered the conversations he is writing about that detailed. To proof this wrong the presentation sais that he made notes after every conversation and just wrote down what he actually could have remembered from that evening. The last point from the text is the escape from the prison in Venice. The text sais that the Chavalier pretented that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling to climb out but he just wanted to write an exiting story and that he knew that the readers would enjoy reading it. He actually just had "well-connected friends". But the fact that the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired after his escpae proofes that the Chevalier did what he wrote. He also didn't have had that many friends in the prison. All the other imprisioners had a lot more friends that could have helped them to escape. So in conclusion the text wants to proof that the memoires are just made up by the Chevalier de Seingalt and that he just had the intention to write enjoyable stories for his readers. The presentation wants to proof the accuracy of the writings by proofing the examples of the text wrong.
