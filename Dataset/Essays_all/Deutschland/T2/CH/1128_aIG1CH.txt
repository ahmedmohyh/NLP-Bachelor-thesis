In the following essay I want to summarize the text an the video and show what differences are between them. The text is telling a story about the memoir from the life of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798). 
The audio is also telling a story about a memoir. The woman said that an memoir is a reliable historical source, like in the text. The woman explained that it isn`t bad to borrow money, it isn´t a sign of power if you won´t burry money from other people. This agument differntiate from the text. The text explain, that it´s a problem when you burry money.

The woman in the audio said, that Chevalier sit in prison but escaped in cause of the government which decide that he can escape the prison. That fact differntiate from the text below. The message from the text is, that Chevalier passed the prison by making a hole with ceiling and climbing through the roof.

All in one the audio shows the good side of the life from Chevalier. It isn´t bad to burry money, like he do and he escaped the prison by the resolution of the judgement, not by climbinmg through a roof.
