While the speaker agrees to the point that many memoirs are not accurate she thinks that Chevalier's memoirs are pretty accurate. About the point that he may not have been rich or wealthy while living in Switzerland she says that he was known to spend a large sum of money on parties and gambling and while he was wealthy it took him some days to turn his assets into cash that's why while he waited for his money to arrive he borrowed some money. About the second point the conversations between him an Voltaire she says that he wrote down everything he could remember from the conversations with Voltaire in the evening of the day they spoke. He then later used what he wrote down in his memoirs. And about the third point she says that others prisoners in the prison he was in had even more powerful friends than he had and they never escaped. Also the prison had to repair the sealing of the cell he was in after he escaped. In her opinion Chevalier's memoirs are in every aspect accurate and represent the history as it happendend.
