Fist of all is told that no memorials could be absolutely accurate at all. So in every case there is something not exactly right. 
The first thing is that the Chevalier wrote that he was very rich when he lived in Switzerland, but in fact he had to borrow some money. In the speech is explained that in this time it was normal to borrow some money if you acctualy have yet not enough money. Because in this time, it take some time to get your money if you want it, e.g. if you sold something. So if you practically run out of money you still have some money left, but you could not now pay your bills, so you have to borrow the money. This fact was in this century normal and no indicator of poverty.

The next thing is the conversation between him and Voltaire. This is also no indicator of a bad accuracy of the memoir. They told that maybe not every thing is right about the conversation, but the most important sentences or phrases he said he could remember and also the main message of the conversation should be right.

Last is his escape from the Venice prison. They said he not broke out, but wrote it to make his story more interesting. Also he had many politically connected friends who could help to free him. The speech refers on the former gouverner, who said that his cell was repaired after he was not in the cell even more. So it would make sence that the cell is repaired after he broke out, so this story could also be true.
