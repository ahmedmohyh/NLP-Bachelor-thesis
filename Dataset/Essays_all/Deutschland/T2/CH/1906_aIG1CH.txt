In the following text I will compare two sources about the chevalier. In the text the chevalier is a man who wrote a long memoir about his life but he added something and left something out so the people are really critical about his truth. Compared to the text the women said in her presentatio that he  wrote everything down before he sumarized it in his memoires so his texts will be right for sure.
First of all the text says that the chevaliers memoirs are raised doubts about the accuracy but the presentation says that you can easily refer to his memoir as a well used source for the eighteenth century. Furthermore the Chevalier had a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire is that what he wrote in his memoir but in the text it says that they never met eachother. Compared with the presentation its discusting that the text is writen like this cause it says exactly the other way round.
To come to an end I would say that you cant refer to every source you get because you do not know if it is right or wrong so you have to compare the things you found out about a topic and should not refer to just one source.
