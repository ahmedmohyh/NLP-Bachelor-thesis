Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life and adeventures he experienced but there are people who have doubts about the accuracy of his memoir because they think some information are controverse ore exaggerated.
Regarding his life in Switzerland he said that he was rich and living in wealth but had to borrow some money from a Swiss merchand. This can be explained easily because in Switzerland life is really expensive and during the first time Chevalier spend some money on partys and something like this to build up a good life so he had to invest first. When he had a good life he started to work but he had to build up good circumstances first so that is why even he was rich in this time he had to borrow money.
The seccond point that is unclear for some people is his conversation with the writer Voltaire. Chevalier wrote his memoir many years after the conversation so some people ask themselves how he could kepp the exact sentences in mind. The anser is that he just took notes during the conversations which he kept for the years when he did not write yet. In his memoir it is possible that the sentences are not original, but the most important aspects and the information in the conversation are still the same so he did not write down things Voltaire has never said.
The last poing that makes people think is Chevaliers escape from a prison in Venice. He wrote that he destroyed the ceiling and escaped through the whole but critics say he has had friends in jail who helped him to get out because they were politically well-connected. This doubt can also be forgotten because it is true that in the jail after Chevalier escaped the ceiling had to be repaired and why would they repair the ceiling if Chevalier escaped through another way?
