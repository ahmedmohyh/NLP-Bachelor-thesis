The Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) wrote in his momoirs some controversal tings people today discuss about, because many people think that the wanted to make his life more interesting than it really was.

In one of his historys he went to Switzerland and spent much time on parties and gambling what normaly shows that he was a rich person. But some texts said that he had to borrow money from Swiss merchant while he stayed in Switzerland, so the story becomes a little bit un unreal.

He also said in his memoirs that he has documents where he saved his full conversation with the famous writer Voltaire but there are many hints that he wrote the notes with the conversations many years after the conversation had take place.

The last controversal one is his prison escape in Venice, Italy. While sitting there with many guys who had much more contacts outside, he was the only one who managed to escape. This history isn't very trusted because it is known that he had political friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe.

To sum up the presentation showed that the Chevalier de Seingalt has some things in his memoirs that haven't take place for sure because they aren't very realistic.
