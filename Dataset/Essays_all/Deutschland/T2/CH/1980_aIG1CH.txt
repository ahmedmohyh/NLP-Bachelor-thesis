The memoir of Chevalier is an historical source, which is very controversial because of the fact that not everything is absolutely true. Anyway the speaker made clear that Chevalier wasn´t poor. He just had to borrow money because he spent to much in parties and gambling, which isn´t a sign of being poor but also not of being very rich.
Moreover, a memoir is never absolute correct in everything which you realize when you think about the fact that Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember from the conversation between him and Voltaire, it´s obvious that not everything happend excactly as he told in his memoir because nobp
Besides that, the controversial escape from a prison in Venice can´t be seen as totally wrong. It is a fact that other prisoners also had influencal friends who could have helped them to escape but nobody except Chevalier did, so it may be true what he told in his memoir. An argument in favour of this statement is also that the wall which Chevalier should have made a hole into, had to be repaired after his escape, so it is possible that he escaped the way he told in his memoir. 
The speaker first tries to explain that a memoir is never correct in every word so that couldn´t be a fact to say Chevalier´s memoir is in a way too unreal. After that the speaker directly takes the examples from the text to give arguments against. With this the speaker destroys the wohle argumentation because he doubts the importance of the examples the author gave in the text.
