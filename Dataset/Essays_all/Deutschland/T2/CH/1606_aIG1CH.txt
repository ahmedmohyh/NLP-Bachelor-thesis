The Chevalier has some accurate details in his memoir about his life, but different sources to tell what is right and what is wrong. There are stories that differ from each other. 

For example, in the text there's written that he spend an huge amount of money at his time in Siwtzerland and payed everything he did with his own money. But in the presentation there it says that because he couldn't afford everything with his own money, he needed to borrow it form a merchant. The critics say that he hadn't to do it, but at the view of the presentation it's wrong. There's a time in his life in Switzerland that he needed to borrow it. 

Than critics in the text also say that the memoir can't know all the details what the Chevalier and the writer Voltaire talked about. But in the presentation it says, that he wrote down everything he talked about with 
the writer Voltaire after he talked to him. The source found his writings and are convinced of that. 

Also in his memoir there is the history about how he escaped from a prison in Venice, Italy. In the text the source tells that he made a hole in the ceiling and escaped that way. Critics in the text claim about it, because Chevalier had enough friends to help him to escape. But the presentation tells a different story. There it says that he hadn't got friend while he was in Italy and couldn't escape with the help of them.
