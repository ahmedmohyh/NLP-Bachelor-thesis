The Women mentiones, that no memory can be completly correct but that of the Chevalier was pretty accurate. So that you can rely on his notes and memory. The first argument of the written text is that the Chevalier borrowed money from the Swiss merchant so he is poor eventhough he said he is rich. The Women from the spoken text responded that it is normal to borrow money and this doesn´t mean that you are poor it just means that you haven´t recived your money yet. Another argument of the text was that you can´t remember exact phrases of a conversation. The person said that he took notes of the conversation that he later reffered to. The text sais that it is not true that the chavilier escaped the prison with a piece of metal and he just said it for a good story. The other person on the other hand says that the cealing needed a repair and why whould the cealing need a repair if the chevalier didn´t escape through it. 
The argument of the coonversation are the complete opposite of those of the text and you could say that they just tell the other side of the story.
