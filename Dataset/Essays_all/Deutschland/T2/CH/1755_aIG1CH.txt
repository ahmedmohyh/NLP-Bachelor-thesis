From 1725 to 1798, the Chevalier de Seingalt met a lot of famous people, for example kings and writers like Voltaire, what somehow makes him to an historical source of European society. Still, the accuracy of his memoir often is discussed by critics, due to some bizarre happenings,or facts, that might look invented or disorted at the first view. 
In the text, you can see, that the author doesn't trust the Chevalier at all. He sais, that the Chevalier wasn't actually rich, because he often had to borrow money from a local merchant, while the woman from the recording believes, that his work only took a few days, to actually earn money, so during these days he obviously had to borrow money until he could pay it back after a short while. 
Another argument is, that his writings considering Voltaire, who he really met, can't be that accurate, because he wrote them many years after their conversations. Others think, that he always kept track of these talks and later used his notes and diaries to write his memoirs. 
While some people believe, that the Chevalier escaped the Venetian prison by "drilling" a hole in his ceiling, others believe, that he just had powerful friends, who could have helped him out. Still, the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after he escaped, what could be a prove for his actual escape. In addition, no one was able to bribe someone at this prison before.
