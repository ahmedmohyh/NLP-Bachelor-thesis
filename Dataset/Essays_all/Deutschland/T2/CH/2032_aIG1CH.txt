The statements from the text and from the audio are different.

It was said that Chevalier wasn't poor and that he had a huge amound of money which he spend on parties. In the text it says that Chevalier wasn't rich because he had to borrow money.

Furthermore the woman in the audio supports the opinion that the conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire were written down in a journal which means that the conversation really did happen and are correct. In the text that is doubted that the conversation is accurate because they claim nobody could ever remember the exact conversation parts. 

In addition the text says Chevalier didn't escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. It claims that he didn't escape through the ceiling ans that is was only made up so that it would be for enjoyable reading. The woman in the audio says that, after Chevalier's escape, a hole was found on the ceiling of his prison cell. That proofs his prison break.
