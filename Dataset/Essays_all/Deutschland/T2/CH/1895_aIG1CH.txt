The present audio file deals with the accuracy of the memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt, that described his adventures and the European society of the 18. century. In order to oppose the statemnts of the critics the speaker tries to convince her audience of the accuracy of Seingalt´s memoirs. She takes the three examples of the text that should show that Chevaliers iformation are not true and tries to make clear, those doubts have not any reasons.

The first example the loan from the merchant, that critics use to prove Seingalt was not rich. The speaker explains that he simply ran out of cash while gambling and did not want to wait for his money to be brought. 

Secondly she defends the accuracy of the memoirs dialogue between Seingalt and Voltaire. She claims Seingalt made notes after talking to Voltaire, helping him to retell the dialogue in an accurate manner evn years after the conversarion occured.

The last adventure is the escape from a prison in venice. The speakers prove for this story are old documents from a prison in Venice that tell that the ceilings of Seingalt had to be repaired after he was inside. Hence, the only reason for that is Seingalt´s escape.
