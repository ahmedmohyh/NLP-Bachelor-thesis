The Chevalier was a man, who lived in the eighteenth century. He had a very exciting life, what he has kept in his memoir. Many critics say that the Chevalier might have made his life look even more exciting than it actually was. For example: In his memoir he hold that he spent a lot of time, while living in Switzerland, with partying and gambling. 
From his point of view he was a very rich man and had no financial problems, but it is concluded that the Chevalier borrowed a lot of money from the Swiss merchant, what could be an evidence that he was actually poor. 
There are also doubts about the conversations between the Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire. 
Many think that the Chevalier did not even met or talked to the famous poetrist. 
In his life the Chevalier had to be sentenced to prison in Venetian and escaped from that too. He wrote that he used a piece of metal to break a hole into the ceiling and rescue himself over the, but many critics question this fact, because they believe that his good relationships with friends helped him.
