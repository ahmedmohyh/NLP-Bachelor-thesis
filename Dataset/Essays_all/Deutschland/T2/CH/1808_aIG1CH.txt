In the monolouge from the woman she counted three points of the Chevaliers. First the Chevaliers were often been in switzerland for games and parties. Second their money had not be arrived. And thierd they have political contacts to the prison in Venice but other people know people with more influence.

In the text was said that they have political friends in Venice. They have but only to 'friends', which sit in the prison. And normaly this are not really good contacts. Probably the Chevaliers are 'players'.

What also in the text was said that the Chevaliers have money but in Switzerland they had to borrow money and that is the opposite of being rich ''but the problem was that the money not had been arrived and not that they lost the money'', said the woman.

To sum up the text and the woman tell us about the same family but they have other information. The question is what are the right information. For example have the Chevaliers lost their money or has the money not arrived at the right time?
