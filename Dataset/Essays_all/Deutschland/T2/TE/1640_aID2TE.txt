Every student in school has some good teachers, which everyone loves and these teachers, which are doing lessons you would love to be at home instead. But which type of teacher is the best? The ones having an excellent knowledge about the subject but can not handle it, to work with children in school or the ones which can relate well with students but have not such a good knowledge?

On the one hand it is very important to be an expert in the subject you are teaching. You can not teach a subject or anything if you do not really know everything about it. This would produce some mistakes and this could be a huge problem for the students, which have to write exams in this subject. Another aspect is that you go to school, as a student, to learn something. It is the onliest aim of the school to teach you in important subjects to make your own knowledge better. This aim would be impossible to reach if you have teachers with just a few knowledge about their subject.

On the other hand it is also an important aspect to be a type of person as a teacher who can come along good with other people. You have to teach. This is what teachers have to do. It is their job and if you can not relate well with students, it will be hard to teach them something. The students would probably understand nothing and as a result they would not learn anything important about the subject.

At the end I think it is important to be a mixture of both types of teachers. In my opinion a good teacher has a lot of knowledge about his subject but can also teach it good to the students. There is no perfect teacher in this world but a good teacher has to do both to give the best education to the students, which is possible.
