A teacher has to be good at many things. They have to have nearly perfect knowledge of their subjects and they have to be able to relate to their students and motivate them to wanting to learn new things. But what is more important? Relating to their students or having an incredible amount of knowledge?

The most obvious answer would be that of course relating to the students is the most important. If a teacher cannot reach his students, they will not be motivated and will not have fun learning their subject. Without motivation students typically learn less than they would, if they had more fun doing what they have to do anyways. 

However the teachers still need to have an excellent knowledge of their subject because if they are not good at what they are trying to teach it does not matter how well they can relate to their students. The more a theacher knows about their subject, the easier it is for them to bring it across to the students even if they cannot relate to them very well.

On the other hand it is a big advantage for the teacher if they know their students well and if they know what methods of learning work best for them. This way they can optimise their lessons so that as many students as possible have the best learning experience possible for them. A teacher who does not know how their students learn the best and fastest and just uses the same methods in every classroom probably does not reach the best results.

All in all I believe that a good balance between relating to the students and having excellent knowledge of the subject is best for students and teachers because the better teachers know their student the better they can plan lessons designed for the class  but the same applies for knowledge. The more a teacher knows about the subject the easier it is for them to teach students so that htey learn something.
