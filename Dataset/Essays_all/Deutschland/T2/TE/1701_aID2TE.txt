In my opinion I agree with this statement. The relation between a teacher and his/her pupils is very important. If there is a good relation between them the pupils are willing to learn more than pupils with a bad relation to their teacher. This is just because it makes more fun to learn with a person who is able to sympathize with others. If this person is unable to sympathize with other persons it makes less fun and is even "painfull". A teacher should have the ability to relate well to his/her students, but he/her should also be strict to pupils. If he/her isn´t strict enough to his/her students he/her could loose the control over the class/pupils. So on the one hand it is very important to have a good relation as a teacher to the pupils, but on the other hand the teacher should have the right concept of teaching the pupils. As I mentioned before the teacher has to be strict to not loose the control over the completely class. He/Her also should have the ability to interest pupilsa dn make them concious in the stuff he/her is trying to teach them. In addition to that he/her should be able to form the class as one group. He/her should avoid a segregation inside the class.
