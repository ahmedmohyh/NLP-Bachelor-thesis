The main question is about the two main abilitys that a teacher must have. One of them is the ralation with their students and the other one is the specific knowledge of his thaught subject. So which ability is more important to be a good teacher?

Being a nice person who has a good relation to his students can be very helpful for the student. If he likes his teacher he might go happier into lessons of this teacher and tries to understand the told things better than he would do with a teacher that he doestn't like that much or at all. A teacher who is very strict to their students could fear them maybe or feel them very uncomfordable so that they don't want to listen anymore.
A problem of the ability to relate well with students is that this teacher does every time in class have some people he does like much more than other students he doesn't like. This could cause unfair grades for all students in a way of giving the liked students better or the unliked worse grades than they would deserve. This problem doesn't occure with a teacher who excellent knows his subject together with the things he would like to hear from his students in class so he can give them fair grades in order to their performance.
Being an expert of theri subject has mostly positive points for a teacher. You can answer question more accurate, explaining specific things better and helping some students if they don't know what do to. The only negative point might be that you are to fucused on your subject and may forget possible problems students might have.

So with this arguments i would say that both abilitys are somehow important for a teacher. The better you know about your subject the better you are as a teacher so there is nothing wrong with it. Being a teacher with a good realtion to their students could be bad in a way of giving unfair grades or liking some students more than other. So you have realte somehow good enough but not as a friend to your students.
