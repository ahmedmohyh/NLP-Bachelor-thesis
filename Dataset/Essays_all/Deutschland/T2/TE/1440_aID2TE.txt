In my opinion a teacher should relate well with his students but also should know his subject very well.
It's not good if the teacher just relate very well with his students without knowing his own subject because the students woukld not learn anything in the lessons. I think the students would not be so concentrated and they would lose their respect towards the teacher.
On the other hand it brings a very good atmosphere to the lesson because the students would be very polite and friendly towards the teacher. Also they maybe would act more interested in what the teacher does with them.
So I think it might be good if students would relate very well with the teacher but also the teacher has to know everything about his subject. It would make no sense if the knowledge of the subject would not be excellent because as I said the students would not learn anything.
In my opinion it is important that the teacher is a person students look up to and have respect but also he schould relate well with his students. The excellent knowledge of his subject and relating well with his students is verx important in combination.
The teacher and the students should be happy with the situation in the lesson and they should all work out their whole potential. The sense in school is not that teachers and students are friends because as I said that would not make sense in a good lesson.
It is very important that the teacher and the students are friedly towards each other and polite. 
So all in all the teacher should be a teacher person with kindness so that students have respect and learn something. But it is also very good if kindness and respect would exist in combination between a student and a teacher. It is a teachers ability to relate well with his students but also he should have an excellent knowledge of his subject.
