One the one hand side it is important that the teacher has an ability to relate well with students. By studying the subject he or she is basically agreeing to deal with students (older students and younger students)on a daily basis. Therefore the teacher should at least try to keep a good and healthy relationship with their students, at least on a kind of schoolish level. Obviously there are teachers who are more than teachers, some students would rather call them friends instead but that is not always the case. 
On the other hand side, there should be more to a teacher than him or her relating to students. If it is you job to educate, you should have a great or even an excellent knowledge of what you're educating. A teacher having an excellent knowledge about all the subject(s) he or she teaches shouldn't be exeggerating, it should be common. In fact, if you study a subject for about six years, you should be having a great knowledge about everything you learned (or what has been teached to you). Teaching the things somebody taught you, it's that simple. 

In my opinion, teachers should have the ability to do both: relate well with their students and have an excellent knowledge on what they're educating. We need more open minded people with lots of knowledge in schools. Why would someone even go to univerity and study to become a teacher if this person didn't like children or adolescents in general? And if you're great with kids and like to work with them but know that you are maybe not smart enough to be the teacher, the same question should be asked in this case. 
If you can't do both of them, you shouldn't do either.
