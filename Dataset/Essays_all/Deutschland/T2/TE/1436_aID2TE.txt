In the following, I will position myself and give a statement to the question which ability is more relevant for a teacher: to be well related to the students, or the execellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
At first I would recomment, that a teacher without knowledge is not able to teach students, because the teacher would not undestand by himself what he is teaching. On the other side, if a teacher have not a good relate to his students, the stundents would be listen to the teacher while the lesson. So I would say, that you should have as a teacher a well relate to your students and a good knowledge about the subject. 
If we are talking about ether exellent knowledge or a well realte with the students, I would say that the knowledge is much more important. But if it is about a semi good knowledge with a well realte with the students or a exellent knowledge but not such a nice relate with the students I would defenilly say, that a teacher with less Knowledge could teach the students the most. 
So I come to the conclusion, that it is more important to have a well relate with the students than a exellent knowledge when we are talking of the subject teaching.
