In the following I will discuss about the the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught".

The ability of the teacher is more important for the students because the students would be go to school in a better mood than the ability of their teacher is good. In a happy mood the students could learn better and they have fun in the lessons. 
If the teacher is in a good connection with the students he could understand the students better in a bad situation becasuse he knows the kids and their circumstances in their life. 
In the class would be a better feeling as in other classes. The methods to learn could be better because all persons in the class would be relaxed. So the knowledge of the subject could be as good as in other classes with a bad ability of the teacher.

But the good ability of the teacher could make a too much relaxed atmosphere and the students think that their are at home and not in the school. In lessons the teacher hasn't got the students in controll because they think that their teacher is like a friend. The students don't respect the teacher.
With this experience the knowledge of the subject is not good enough and the teacher's ability could be critizes.

In my opinion the ability of a teacher is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject because the students could learn better and become a better knowledge of the subject than the ability is good. But there are many different types of teachers so the experience of the statement is different, too.
