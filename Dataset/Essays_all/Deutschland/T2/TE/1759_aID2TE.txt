In the following essay I am going to discuss whether a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than escellent knowledge of the subject being taught or not. 
In my opinion it is important to connect with the students to build trust and respect. If a student has a problem he doesn't want to talk about with his family or friends a teacher that tries to understand the student and tries to help him out can sometimes solve the problem. But on the other hand students go to school to learn something and get prepared for university and their future so a good connection between a student and a teacher is irrelevant because they don't go to school to make friends with teachers. 
Another positive aspect is that if a teacher connects well with his students they can be more respectful towards him and listen to him rather than to a teacher they don't like. Nevertheless this aspect depends on the students because they can also gain disrespect towards his teacher because they might think that they can do whatever they want without the teacher getting mad and do something about it. 
On the other hand a good communication can lead to the student understanding the subject better and show more progress. But in my opinion the most important thing for a teacher should be teaching. A good teacher has to be able to be good at his job without his students liking him. In fact if they don't he has to be confident and structured enough to deliver knowledge and prepare the students for their finals. 
As it was said before the students go to school to learn and not to have fun so in my opinion a teacher should be able to teach his stundents the way it's supposed to be and on the other hand he has to be respectful towards his students as they have to be towards him. Otherwise students might not be concentrated and won't be listening to his teacher.
