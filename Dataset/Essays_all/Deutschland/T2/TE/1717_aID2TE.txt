The following statement deals with the topic if a good relationship of a teacher to his students is more important than his knowledge in the subject he is supposed teach. 

First, they are a few arguments that support the statment. On one hand, if a teacher is able to relate well with his students, the atmosphere during a class is way better. There is motivation to learn since the teacher is able to understand or even to identify himself with his students, it is a base for doing an interesting class. In addition to that, learning can be easier for the students because they feel comfortable in the class. 
On the other hand it is not useful if the teacher can relate well with his students but is not able to give them the knowledge they are supposed to get. It would be a fun, easy and relaxing class rather than a good learning progress, which is the the actual goal of a good class.

So in my opinion it is not more important for a teacher to relate well with his students than having an excellent knowledge in the subject because the goal of a class is to improve the knowledge of the students, even if a good relationship between a teacher and the students could help to achieve that goal.
