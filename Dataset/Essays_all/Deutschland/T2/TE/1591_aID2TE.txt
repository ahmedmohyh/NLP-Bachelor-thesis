The statement given says that it is more important that teachers are able to relate well with the students than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
In my opinion the statement is true, because I think it is always better when the teacher, whom you want to learn something from should be nice and understanding, because if he is, it gets easier to learn and maybe even makes fun to learn. Especially students, which have bigger problems in school and maybe even in life need someone in school, who understands them and can relate to them. 
But on the other hand, I think the statement is not true, because I think the job of a teacher is to teach the student something, not to be their friend. I think that teachers should know everything about a subject they teach, because it is their job to help out with every qusetion a studnet has. 
But honestly who didn´t have the problem in school with some of the teachers: The subjects they taught were great, but still they had no understanding for human beings, which were not like they wanted them to be. For example someone, who is bad with numbers. Yes, that means that they are probalby not the best in maths, but thats just how it is. Noone can change a thing about that and with a teacher not understanding that and not being able to relate, the student tumbles into a hole, where it is not easy to get out. 
So all in all I guess a mixture of both would be the best. So if a teacher is able to relate to a student and in the same minute has the best knowledge one can have about a subject, the job the person chose was the best option because that would make the best teacher.
