In the following text I will discuss the statement "A theacher's ability to relate well with student is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught". 

On the one hand students go to school to learn something in the different subjects, so the teacher must give them the knowledge in their lessons. This is the job of a teacher, to give the students knowledge and the students need this knwoledge for their future.
On the other hand a teacher with a good relation to their students, create a well atmosphere, in which the students can learn very well. In addition to this the students have more fun during the lesson and this includes, that their has also more fun to learn something in the subject. As a result of this, the students do more at home for the school and get an excellent knowledge too although the teacher and the students relate eachother well.

If you put it all in a nutshell, in my opinion is the statement correct, because if a teacher's ability to relate well with students, the students can also get an excellent knowledge in the different subject. Nevertheless is getting knowledge the first aim a theacher should have.
