The question weather the teachers ability to relate well with the students is more important than an excellent knowledge of the subject beeing thaugt is a very current topic in front of the background of the big lack of teachers we have in Germany. 
First of all I'd like to state, that teachers are not getting paid for getting along well with their students. They do not have to be interested in their social lives or in their problems. Teachers do not even have to like their students as long as they can help them learning important stuff for their future. Incompentce is the worst deficite we have here and most of the students feel as if they have taught themselves everything in the past two years (especially in subjects like German, Politics, Biology and a lot more). With connections to the ministry of education I am able to say that the situation of our land in relation to the lack of teachers is worse than ever. A lot of people with huge language problems applie for a job as a German teacher, sometimes even at gymnasiums. As I already mentioned beeing great in their subject is the only important quality a teacher should have, because we have enough incompetent teachers here in Germany. 
All together one can say that getting along well with the students is just a bonus ability to the job but not the main need.
