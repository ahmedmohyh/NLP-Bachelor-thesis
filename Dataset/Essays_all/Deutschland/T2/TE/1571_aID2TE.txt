With the statement that a teacher is ability to relate well with students is more important tahn excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, i would disagree.

 I think it is more important to have from both sides and that they are of the same weight. Students normaly aren´t happy going to school every day because for them it seems be be bopring after some time. But if you have for example a day full of subject in wich the teacher tells you likely everything he know about the topicstudents often turn out there heads. that is because stundenst are defently not interessted of just hearing so much stuff at the same time. 

But if you have a teacher who is ability to relate will with you it looks like it is funny but after some time it isn´t as cool as you would have thought about it. That happend because in some way he has to teach you something he had a great knowledge from. So it is important to get the attention from the students with a teacher how is abel to relate with students and who is good in teaching is excellent knowledg in an iterristing way, so that it is not so boring for the students and they are motivated to go to school becasuse they won´t hear to the teacher like in an audience.

So in the end it i would say that from my point of view it is better to get both in one.
