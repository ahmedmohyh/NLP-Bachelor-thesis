Some teacher have a brilliant knowledge but do not know how to support it. Therefore, the students are not really motivated. On the other hand teachers exist, who have a good relationship to their class but sometimes, they are not able to answer the student's questions.
It is okay to know not everything. Teachers are - some pupil do not believe it - also just humans. It can not be expected that they know everything. More important is to show the students how to get the information they are looking for. My class is working with iPads in school. If a teacher does not know something, we all look it up. Most of our teacher have a very good overview about the topics we are speaking about, so they are able to say if the found answer might be right.
Of course, some students loose the respect and the believe that the teacher knows what he or she is speaking about when a teacher always says 'I do not know'. 
But these respect can be made in other ways. For example with the way a teacher treats the students. A teacher has to be a rolemodel. Rolemodels have to be realistic. It is realistic to do not know everything. Nevertheless, the teacher has to know a lot of things about his or her subjects, he or she studied it. But even more important is a good knowledge made through experiences that he or she can share with the students. 
In my opinion, it is very important that a teacher knows what he or she is talking about. It is a good feeling for the students and exspecially for the parents. When a teacher does not know something or is not sure about something, it is important to say it to the pupil instead of explaining something wrong. Teachers also learn at school and they can do it together with the pupil. Furthermore the pupils get a good feeling, when they know the teacher explains everything he or she knows and and likes to know even more. That is very good for a relationship between pupils and teacher and the pupils have a good feeling asking questions.
