These days teachers can be divided into a few categories. There are the nice ones, who can relate to their students, the smart ones, those, who are both of that and those, who can nothing. Between students there is an ongoing discussion about what is more important, relating to students or being smart.

The relating teachers of course do have the advantage, that they know their students. They can help them to solve their individual problems and therefore to master school. Besides that, the students are more eager to learn something and to work if they like their teachers and their methods. Many students don't fail their classes because they aren't smart enough but because they are to lazy for doing their homework or learn for tests while on the other side the same students meat in the afternoon with a teacher to work on a project.
Having great knowlegde about the own subject however can also help the students. Most of the time it is easier for them to understand the topic; questions, no matter at which level, can be asked and are awnsered. This really can help alot to learn new things, which, after all, is the point of going to school. A smart teacher is also, in generall, more respected by his students, which can lead to a better learning environment, while most students think a nice teacher will let them do anything.

In the end I do prefer the teachers with a huge amount of knowledge. After all we are in school for learning. It may not be the nicest way of learning but it is the most efficient. The best combination however is when the teacher can also relate to his students.
