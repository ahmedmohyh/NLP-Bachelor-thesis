First of all I would'nt totally agree with the statement above, because in my opinion it is important to have the ability to combine these two things. If the teacher does'nt know how to relate well with the students it might be difficult to transfer this excellent knowledge about his subject to the students. On the other hand it's not enough to have a good connection to them. He needs to be confident with the content he's teaching. But I have to admit again that it is such an important part to a relate well with people he is working with. For me it should be a mixture of having more than an idea of his subject and a perfect connection between him and his students too. With a good relationship and an excellent knowledge of the subject, which is being taught, it is the only way to prepare the students well enough for their graduation and of course for their future life. Is the teacher not able to do so, he does'nt fits in this type of job.
