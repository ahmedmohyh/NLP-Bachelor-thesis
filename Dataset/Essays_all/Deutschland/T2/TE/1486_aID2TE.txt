In the following text the statement that "a teacher's ability to ralate well with students is more important than exellent knowledge of the subject being taught" will be discussed.
First of all it is very important for an good learning enviroment in school that teachers can relate with their students, because otherwise the atmosphere in the clasroom would be very unconfortable for both parties. The students would have difficulties learning, because the teacher would not know how to teach them propperly and especially for young stundents it is very important to have someone who can reach out to them. And that is why every teacher should be able to relate with their students and if a person can not do that, he/she should defenetly not become a teacher. 
On the other side it is important that a teacher has exellent knowledge about his/her subject so that he/she can answer any question asked on the topic being taught. Besides, teachers go to university and should be experts of their subjects and he students go to school for being taught and not to teach them the subject theirselves.
To conclude I think that both abilities are very important for a teacher and that one can't exist without the other. If a teacher can relate very well to students but hasn't anything to tell or if a theacher has a lot of knowledge but doesn't know how to teach it, the student will not be taught in a good way. That is why I beleve that there has to be a good balance between these two abilities and that neither of them is more important.
