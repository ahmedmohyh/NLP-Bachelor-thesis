What is better a teacher who is very nice or a teacher who has a very good knowledge about the subject being taught?

If you want to be a good teacher you have to have a good average in every ability. But is it enough if you be nice and have a good realtionship to your students ? No, its very good to have a good relationship to your stundents but this isn´t all to make you a good teacher. A teacher have to have a perfect knowledge about his topic, because this is what the students will also know about the topic and maybe they want to be a teacher too so the students of the student will also know this about the topic. So you want that your students know well for example about the WW2 so you try to get a good knowledge about the WW2 to give your students a good insight in the topic. But you also have to be nice with your students, because only if there is a good atmosphere to learn the students are motivated to listin you. There is no motivation if you allways scream.
All in all you can say that a good teacher have to combine a lot of things like the knowledge and the relationship to the students. You can only be a good teacher if you find your perfect average of all abilitys.
