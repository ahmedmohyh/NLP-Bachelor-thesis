A teacher has got a huge responsability towards his students. He doesn't only teach him a subject, but also moulds the student's character. So as he has got a big impact on this child, a good relationship would be helpful for the student's behavior in class and his motivation. The teacher and the student see each other every day and he becomes a kind of rolemodel for the child.
But of cause, the subject is the main point in the class. The students get grades for math and english, and not for "is getting well with his teacher". A too good relationship with a teacher can cause negative consequences such as unfairness. A teacher is only a human, too and wouldn't treat all the students the same way. And of cause, the relation between teacher and student could  become a bad one, too which could cause unfairness and prejudices. 

In my opinion, the ability to relate well with students and knowledge of the taught subject are both very important to make a good teacher. Thats probably why a teacher doesn't just have to study the subject, but also how to get  along with children. I'm sure that if a teacher can't relate with his students, they will lose interest on the subject. And if that happenes, the knowledge of the subject will be useless for teaching. So I disagree with the statement that a teacher's ability to relate well with his students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject that is taught. I think that they are equally important.
