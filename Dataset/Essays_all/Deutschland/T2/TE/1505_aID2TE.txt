There are a lot of advantages if the teacher has the ability to relate well with his students:
Firstly, there would be almost no student that is not interested in the lessons.
Scince the teacher has a good relation to his students they would be more excited about the lessons.

Secondly, this results in the fact that the students would concentrate and work in the lessons more efficient.
This could cause the fact that the students learn more from teachers who present just simple knowledge 
as from teachers who are focused on teaching a lot of knowledge without a good connection to his students.

Another important point is that the students do not just learn any scientific knoledge by heart but that they learn social competences and soft skills in lessons that includes closer contact and conversations with the teacher.

However, there are some points which are negative about teachers who do not present excellent knowledge in their lessons.
There is the problem that the students do not get information and knowledge that they might miss in international exams or jobs that require knowledge and skills at higher levels.
Moreover students could be bored by simple lessons over the time so that they lose focus.
If there are no challanges and problems due to lessons with high knowledge-level the students would not learn to interact with and solve these situation. 

The argumentation shows that there a some positive  points a teacher with a good relation to his students provides. Nevertheless it is still important  that teachers present lessons with a lot of knowledge.

In summing up I am of the opinion the the optimal lessons are presented by teachers that are familiar with the situation of the students so that there is good relation to them and that are able to teach good and important knowledge in a propiate way.
