pro: The attitude of students towards their teacher connects to their attitude of learnign. So if students don't respect their teacher because he doesn't know how to teach or how to relate with his students, they won't learn anything from him because they don't respect him as a teacher. So a good teacher has to know how to behave with children and teenagers, otherwise he will lose the students attention.

con: A good teacher has of course to know what to teach and what he's talking about. Without knowledge he is not able to explain the things to his students and it's the teachers task to give students all information they need. If he cannot do that he is certainly considered a bad teacher.

So the question is: What is more important? Sure, when he is good in both things it's the perfect situation and when can't do anything like that, he should retire. A good mix of both isn't bad either, but in my opinion relating well with stundes is more important because even a teacher that doesn't know that much can get through to the students and teach them the things he knows in a better way, than a teacher that knows a lot but can't do with children. I think he is a better teacher when he can relate well with children, than knowing everything. Especially because students dont want to hear antything from a teacher that cant teach, even though he has good knowledge. To summerize my points you need to have perfect knowledge if you know how to behave towards children.
