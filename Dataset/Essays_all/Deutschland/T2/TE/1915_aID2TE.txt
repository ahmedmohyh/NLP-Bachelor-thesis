Somehow I agree with the argument because I think the partnership of student and teacher is really really important because if they dont synergize in any way there will be no partnership but otherwise do not underestimnate the importance of knowledge in a specific subject. even if the relation between math teacher and student is really well he can not teach msuic to the student. On the other hand it does not work aswell if the teacher almost knows everything about the subject but simply cant reach the students. i think a mix of both would be the perfect thing to become a teacher and teach students.
