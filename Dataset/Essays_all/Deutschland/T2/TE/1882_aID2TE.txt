The statement is ' A teacher`s abiltity to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught'.
My first argument for this statement is when the strudents like the teacher, they feel safer in the things they do and are brave enough to say something in the lessons. 
Another argument for this statement is that when the students like the teacher they like his lessons more and looking foward to go into the lessons. When the students dont like the teacher they are not so arranged and good in this subject, because they don't want to go into this lesson.
My first argument against the statement is that when the teacher is a friend of the students the students have not so much respect of him. They don't want to make normal lessons they want to do other cool things like to go somewhere in the park. My second argument against the statement is that a excellent knowledge of a teacher about his subject is very important, because he want to teach the students something and they have to learn new things.
In my opinion both is important.In the one hand it is good for the students when there is a teacher who relate well with the students and is sometimes funny and sometimes strigt, on the other hand the knowlegde of a teacher is very imporant, because is the exercise of a teacher to teach the students the things of his subject.
I think the knowlegde of a teacher is imporanter than the ability to relate well with students. I think its so important that the teacher know what hes talking about and know things better then the students, because he is the one who have to teach the students and not the students have to teach the teacher.
