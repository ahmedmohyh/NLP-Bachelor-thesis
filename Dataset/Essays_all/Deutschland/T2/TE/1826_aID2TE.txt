The question, if a good relation between teacher and students is more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being thaugt, is very difficult. 
On the one hand, teacher needs to be well informed about the topic they are teaching, otherwise their is the risk, that they will teach wrong facts to the students, so they maybe get problems in tests or exams, where they could have needed these information, so they maybe can't get the points they need to study on the university they want to. And in case the students believe, that the teacher is teaching everything right, so they don't have to reserche on their own, it's even not really their mistake. The teacher studied for beeing a teacher, so it's his Job to teach right facts. 
But on the other hand a good relation between teacher and students can help to create to have a more relaxing atmosphere. If they can work good  together, the students might understand the subject better so it makes the lessons more confortibel for both sides. 
A good relation can also help to reduce the pressure that may lay on some of the students or even on the teacher. So it might be healthier for everybody. 

All in all the teacher needs a good knowledge of his subjects, otherwise it might be his fault that the students loose, for example important points in exams. But a good relation might be in some cases more important, than the exat knowledge of a subject. So the teacher should have a good knowledge of his topics, but expacilly he should have a good relation to his students.
