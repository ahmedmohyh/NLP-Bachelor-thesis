I disagree with the statement that a theachers ability to relate well with his students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

 I do think that it is important how a teacher relates with his students but i think it is much more important that the teacher has the needed knowledge about his subject.  Because we are in school and the mainpoint here is to lern something and I think its the worst case when you have a teacher who dont know enough about his subject. Its also bad when a teacher doesnt treat his students in a respectful way like all people should but thats not the most important point. Because there will be always people who you dont like but even though most of the time you  can find a way to work with them. But even if you like someone or not and the person hasnt enough knowledge about something its very difficult to work with them. 
Another point is that teachers get paid for there job and there job is teaching students so that they can understand the taught subject. But when they havent the knowledge they cant do there job in the way the should do. Its like a doctor hasnt any knowledge about medicine but still earns money for telling people things hat arent the truth or things he doesnt know about for sure. 
I think those cases are very unfair for people who do a hard and good job every day and dont get paid in the same way like those people who dont do a good job.
