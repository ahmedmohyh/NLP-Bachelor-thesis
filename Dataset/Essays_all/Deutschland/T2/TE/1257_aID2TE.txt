I agree with this statement because an excellent knowledge of the subject only doesn´t help the student to understand that subject in a comfortable and easy way. A well relation with the students is on the one hand better for the marks of the students and on the other hand are the students more motivated to work if they like their teacher. 
Of course it´s important that the teacher has a good knowledge about his subject because if he doesn´t have that, he wouldn´t be able to teach his students the things they need for their future. Having a good relation to the teacher gives the students a good feeling, they dare to ask him questions even if they are stupid or unlogical. They dare to answer things they aren´t sure about without being scared that the teacher will be mean. Another aspect why a good relation between a teacher and a student is so important is that the atmosphere in class will be much more relaxed. Being realistic, it´s not that possible for a teacher to pass his teacher exams without having enough knowledge so that wouldn´t be a problem.
 In the end I can say that the statement is true, it is more important to relate well with students than having an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught because even the needed amount of knowledge must excist.
