Who is the perfect teacher? Is his ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject beign taught? 


In my opinion it is important that the teacher has an good or even excellent kowledgge of the subject because he has to teach his students as good as possible. How shoulod the students learn or understand the new subjekts when the teacher doesn´t even know them or hasn´t the ability to explain it. 
But it is also important that he is nice an friendly to his students because only a nice and friendly atmosphere is the best atmosphere to lern.
