Is it more important to relate well with students as a teacher than having an excellent knowledge of the subject beeing taught? This is a difficult question to be thought about. 

On the one hand the teacher can not teach the whole stuff which the students need for exemple for their A-levels. That can have devastating consequences for the students. In addition to that could it be easier for the students to prank their teacher because they think the teacher will like them anyway and it would not have any consequences for the students. It is more important to have a perfect knowledge because then can every student learn that much how he wants and it is his or her own problem if he or she does not come to class. If the teacher has not got the perfect knowledge the teacher is the problem if the students would not learn enough and the students can not decide on their own how much they want to learn.

On the other hand it can help the students to have a teacher who like the students and the other way round because if the students have a problem it is more likely that they go to the teacher and ask if they like them than if they dislike them. Also can the good relationship between the teacher and the students make the students feel better and come more often to class and have fun at what they are doing. If they dislike the teacher the students will miss the class more often and they will not learn that much.

In my opinion as a teacher it is a bit more important to relate well with the students than have an excellent knowledge because even if the teacher can not teach his or her subject excellent the students are moreinterested in learning something than if they dislike the teacher with the perfect knowledge. Thus they will have a better athmosphere in class with a nice teacher and will learn more than with a bad teacher and a bad athmosphere.
