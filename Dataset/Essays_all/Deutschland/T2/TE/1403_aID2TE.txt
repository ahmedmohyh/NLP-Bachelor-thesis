A controversially dicussed topic in schools is that some say, a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more inportant than them having an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.

On one side, the teachers need to know what they are teaching about. They are preparing us for our future life but more importantly, for our Abitur. For us to be able to write a good Abitur, we need to have knowledge so that we get the best score possible. In our math class for example, we work hard every lesson so that we are well prepared for future exams. In Geography, we don't do that a lot resulting in us wasting lots of time doing pretty much nothing. That is why teachers need to take their job seriously in order to prepare us for our future.
On the other side, teachers need to be communicative towards students. They need to explain the subject in a way that as many students as possible understand what they are trying to say. Also, in a discussion they need to be open and neutral as well. The worst case scenario that I can think of at our school is when a teacher doesn't like a certain student for whatever reason and that this student automatically gets a worse grade, which is unfair. As a teacher, you shouldn't be allowed to do such things because there might be certain reasons for not liking someone, but that doesn't give you the right of decreasing their grade.

However, my personal opinion is that teachers should be able to communicate with students but also have knowledge about the subject they teach. School is a lot more fun if the teachers are nice and relaxed but on the other side, they need to prepare you for your future life and in order to do so, they need to take their job seriously. I don't think that teachers should be either relating well with students or having knowledge of the subject they teach, but I believe that they should be communicative as well as them knowing their subject.
