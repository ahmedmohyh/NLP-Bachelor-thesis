The statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" is a difficult statement.
In school is both important for the students. They have to learn the subject well so the teacher has to be have the knowledge about that subject and all the topics. The school is the location to learn different and a lot of things, but therefore the teacher has to have the knowledge.
But it is also important that the teacher's relate well with the students. Because the students has to have the feeling that the teacher likes them. Then they are going with a better feeling and more fun to school. The school is in that way not the place to have fun but if there is not any fun the students can be more unmotivated.
And when the teacher relates well with the students, the students will be better learn the knowledge of the subject that the teacher has.

So I think both of them, to relate well with students and to have the excellent knowledge of the subject is really important to be a good teacher. And because of that I can not decide for one thing from that, that both togehter makes a good teacher.
