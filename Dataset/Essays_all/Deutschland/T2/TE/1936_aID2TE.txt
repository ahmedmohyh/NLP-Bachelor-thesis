One of the most important things in a school is the atmosphere. In a school with bad atmosphere the students might be afraid of participating in class or going to school at all. This hinders the motivation and thereby the learning process. If teachers were to relate to the students more, a more relaxed and better learning atmosphere would be created. This however also brings the risks with it, that students become too relaxed and stop studying at all.

That however is more a sign of missing respect to the teacher and respect has to be earned, even by teachers. Having excellent knowledge of a certain topic, is in my oppinion something that ears more respect, than connecting to students. It shows that the teacher investet a lot of time to learn and is dedicated in teaching that knowledge. After all schools are there to teach students. The teacher would also be able to answer any questions, which students might have. 
One negative with a kwonledable teacher, is the fun in his class. While getting informed about a topic can be very interesting, it can also get very boring if the teacher isn`t presenting it correctly. If a teacher relates to a student, he knwos how to explain certain things better. 
A teacher that relates to students is also able to help with problems out of class like social issues. They are more like a friend that helps students if they need someone. 

In conclusion I would say that balance is important. A teacher has to be able to do both. Having knowledge of the things he is teaching is a basic requierment all teachers should have. It is however useless if the teacher is unable to teach it to his students. But if i had to choose on of these two traits I would go with excellent knowledge since that teacher could answer any and all question I have. Even if school would then be even more boring, it is there to teach us.
