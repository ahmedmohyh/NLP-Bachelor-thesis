In the following I will give Arguments for the pros and the cons of the statement:"A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.".

To start of with the pro:
When a teacher can't relate well with students, it's not relevant if he has an exelent knowledge, because the student won't learn anything. For example if my math teacher has the knowledge as excellent as Newton, but can't teach it to someone no one is helped.
But this (of course) works just, if the teacher generally have knowledge.  
Otherwise the knowledge could be more important, because it's essential in school and without knowledge you can't teach anything. And if the teacher have the knowledge he can just show how it works (with examples) if he can't explain it. For example the teacher solves a math problem and just shows and discribes his work.

In my Opinion one of them can't teach without the other: a minimum of ability to relate well with students, must have every teacher and of course the knowledge to teach.
A teacher and his knowledge must be abel to give this knowledge to the students.
