Teacher´s ability

Is a teacher better if he can relate well with students or are teacher´s importent who have a perfect knowledge of the subject they teach?
In the followin essay I will give a statement about this question.
A teacher, who is good informed about the subject that he or she teachs, can teach more than a teacher who isn´t really informed. But students won´t learn stuff, if they get so much to learn. It´s complicated to learn more than 1 theme for a day or a week. In this case it would be better to teach much stuff in funny way. A solution how studens better can learn stuff is a teacher who is well related to the students. Such a teacher knows how students want to learn.
The students will learn intensiv if they get teached by a friendly and well knownd teacher. They aren´t in stress and a teacher who isn´t really informed in his subject has the chance to learn all the stuff which he or she doesn´t know.

All in all one of the best teachers must be relate well with students and must have a excellent knowledge. But if the teacher hasn´t so much knowledge but even more than a student, I would accept him or her more as a theacher with excellent knowledge.
