Every year there is a big diskussion abou teachers at school. People talk about their knowledge and about their ability to relate well with the students. But what is more important for being a teacher?
Before you become a teacher you have to studying hard. Not every guy could teach every subject. So it is realy important that you have a excellent knowledge about your subject. In the university time you level up your knowledge which you learned at schoolo. It ist important, because some teachers regidnize know that hey are the wrong person for the subject allthough they habe known every thing about it in school time. So after the university we know that every teacher have excellent knowledge about their topic. But maybe there will come big problems after your teacher excam. For theaching children you have to have the ability to relate well with students. You never learn this ability at the university. And nobody test it. That is a big problem. Teachers are the persons, who bring the children thruw the younger age. It is an important time, to find their own character and to bild teir own oppinion. It is not good when we have teachers in this thime, which can relate well with the students. 
In future we will need some changes in our teacher system. Of course we need excellent knowledge by the teachers. But in the young age we need much more teachers, which can relate with the students. In my opinion it is the most important thing to teach teachers how they can relate well with their students. Maybe it would be a solution to have an extra course with an exam where they learn to relate well with students.
