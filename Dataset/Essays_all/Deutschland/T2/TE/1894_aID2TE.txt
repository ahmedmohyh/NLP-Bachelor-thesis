I think it is a mixture of both abilities that make a good teacher. A teacher can have a perfect knowledge of his subject but he can be unable to teach his students properly. Nobody listens for a long time if the teacher is holding a monolog for one hour, nor can he repeat what has been told. The teacher's ability to relate with his students is important because he can tell how his students feel, he can tell how well they understand the teached subject and if they don't, he can recorrect his teaching methods.
What I want to say is that a teacher really needs both, knowledge and a good relationship to his students. Complet knowledge of a subject doesn't help you if you can't teach it. A good relationship to your students doesn't help them if they don't learn anything. 
A good example for perfect knowledge could be a history teacher. He knows everything about history, he even knows the exact time when World War Two started. But if he is the only one who talks during his lessons, his students will not learn anything. They will simply fall asleep because a monolog in political history really isn't that interesting. 
If you can relate with your students, you can really fell what their problems are, where their abilities lie but you can't make proper lessons, they will also learn nothing. They will have a good time but they will learn just nothing.  
A good teacher has both. He has an excellent knowledge of his subject and he can relate well to his students. He can create an interesting lesson with a good atmosphere that makes it easy for his students to learn. He knows when his students have problems with the subject and he can help them. 
So, being able to relate with your students is very important but it doesn't help you with your lessons when you don't know what you are teaching. One should go with the mixture.
