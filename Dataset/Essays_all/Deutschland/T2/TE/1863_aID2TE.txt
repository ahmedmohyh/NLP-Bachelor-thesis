In school the learn atmosphere is very important for the education of the students and the work of the teacher. Because of that it's also important that the teacher has the ability to relate well with students. For example when the teacher knows the students it's easier to trust him or her and e.g. ask the teacher questions or talk to him or her about a topic. But on the other side, when the teacher doesn't have the knowledge of the subject, the conversation about a topic isn't so productive. The student wants to get information, because thats the reason, why he come to school every morning. 
Another argument is, that the teacher need the skills to bring this knowledge into the minds of the students. For that he need a talent and this talent hasn't every teacher.
Because of this reasons I agree the statement, that a teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject. Maybe it's also exciting and better for the students and the teacher to get together more information about a subject and to learn together.
