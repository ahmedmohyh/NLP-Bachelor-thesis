The statement: "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." is in some aspects right but on the otherside wrong in my oppinion. 
For example a teacher can be such nice to you, but when he can´t answer your questions in leesons what do you need him? I think it is more important to have the knowlege of your subject as much as you can, so you can help your stundets like they need it.
The other side is that if you don´t like the teacher students don´t like the subject too(in some cases) so it will be important to be nice to students to have a good time in class, but i think it isn´t the pinkt of school, if the teacher is´t nice but knows nearly everything, you will be motivated too to know as much as you can and ask a lot.
Another point is that you are going to school to learn something and not to be nice with your teacher, so students have to make their focus on the things they need. 
And if not the teacher have the knowledge than students can start and search the answers of their questions on their own. Nowadays they have so much possibilitys like the internet on their laptops, tablets or smartphones and with the help of google you can research everything what you want.
All in all i would say it is more important to have the knowledge of their own subject as much as they can to taught their student good and to be nice or not to be nice have been push in the backround, because it isn´t nessecary as the knowledge for what you are going in school. And if a teacher doesn´t give you the informations you need every stundet can research in the internet on their own and get the information  what they want.
