In my opinion, it is hard to say if you agree or disagree with the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught".
But on the one hand i would say a good relationship between a teacher and a student is very important, because if your teacher is abel to relate well with you and your classmates, the learning athmosphere is much better and pretty good and it will make so much more fun to do school stuff and work on your homeworks.
In addition to that your grades, in the subject you were studied by that teacher, will be better than by other teachers, because you like him and he likes you and so maybe he will give you better grades.
On the other hand the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is also very important, because if you got a teacher which doesn't understand what he's going to teach you, it could be very hard for you to understand this.
And just by the way, the people who are going to teach you in highschool or collages, are just your teachers, there aren't your friends or buddies and you only got them more or less three years in your live and after this years,most of you will never see them again and than it doesn't matter what kind of relationship you and your teacher had.

Include all this informations in on sentense, I would say it isn't good if you had a teacher who's able to relate well with students and don't had excellent knowledge of the subject being taught and it isn't also nice if you had a teacher who isn't able to relate well with students but he got that excellent knowledge of the subject.
So all in all I think the right mix and base between this both point is the perfect way to get a nice school life.
If you got both points in one teacher, that will be the perfect mix.
