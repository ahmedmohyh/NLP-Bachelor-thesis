In the following text I am going to present negative an positive aspects for agreeing or disagreeing of the statement: "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important then excellent knowledge of the subject being taught."
I tink it is important that teachers can relate well with the students becuase first then the students would listen to him and they would like to go to school or his/her lessons. It is much mor better when you like yor teachers becuase then you are ready to do something in the lessons or they would do their homework. Another poiont is that shy people would´nt be as shy as they would be by teachers with a bad relationship to their studetents. So it means better notes or resalts for the students and so they would be happier and that makes the teachers also happy. Well so it is an win, win situation.
But for some students it could be very bad because they soon want to get a master or to be an chirouge or something like for what you need an good education. For all these Jobs you have to learn very much and there you have to know very much and you woul´nt learn all these things when you have an teacher with a bad knowledge of the subjects that you need. So you have to do all these tings on your own and taht would be very hard for you and soon you could become problems because of that. Also the parents would wether choose an teacher with excellent knowledge then a teacher with an good relationship to the students. 
In the end I would agree with the statement because I know it from myself. But I would prefer teachers which have found the middle of these two ways. Like a teacher with a good and maybe not excellent knowledge but that you also have an good relationship to him like that you are not scared of him and that you can talk to him, if you have problems.
