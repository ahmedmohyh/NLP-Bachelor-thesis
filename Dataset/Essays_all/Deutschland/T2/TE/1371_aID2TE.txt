The statement 'A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught' is about the discussion if teacher's who should be more interessted in the wealth of the students than in what they teach. 
It's a difficult theme because everyone has a different opinion about that. School is important to everyone but it also depend on the teacher if the students want to learn something or even if they really learn it. If a person hasn't a good connection to people it shouldn't be the first vote to be a teacher. However the system how a country teach his children is also important, when the teacher need to do things in 2 weeks, what should be done in 4 weeks, the limit is faster and the students mostly not better. So the politic should be doing more, because it's not always the teacher's fault. However you need to say that some teacher's have no respect against students because they are younger or in their opinion not that intelligent. These teacher's are in the wrong place, because students want to learn something and that's why they go to school. Some teacher's are also not motivated enough anymore or never were. In such cases students can do whatever they want but never get good grades or learn something for their future lifes. 
To sum it up, it's really important that the teacher is getting well with his students because it depends on how good they are. However it's also important what and how they teach, so they need a lot of knowledge but without the connection to the students a good knowledge means nothing.
