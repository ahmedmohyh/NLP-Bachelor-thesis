The following essay is about the statement ´a teacher´s ability to relate with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught´.

The first argument against this statement is that if a teacher relates more to the students than thinking about his own subject he isn´t completely able to teach the students the things they have to know during important exams, for example the A-levels. The teachers can as much relate with the students as they want but that won´t help the students during their school time.

On the other hand side it´s always good if teachers can relate with students because even more important than a good knowledge of a specific subject from students is that the students get the feeling they can actually manage school. If a teacher just talks about the subject the students can feel very stressed and also desperate because they think they can´t do it. But if a teacher takes care of the students they might feel more confident about themselves.#

In my opinion it is for sure impotant that a teacher is able to prepare his students for the final exams but it is also quite important that the students have the impression that the teachers actually care about them and not just their grades.
