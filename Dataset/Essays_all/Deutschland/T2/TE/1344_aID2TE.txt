The schoolsystem nowdays has a very big diefference to the schoolsystem long time ago.
For example there is is differnece between the Schoolstuff the schoolsubjects and the teachers.
A long time ago the teachers were really stregnth to the children. Today sometimes teachers and students act like friends. 

On the one hand I think teachers have got the ability to relate well with students and also that it is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, because the children nowdays are every free second in their life on social medias and surf the internet. 
For some students school is the place where they get the only social contact to other people. 
School should be a good and important place for kids, because they have to learn important things for their future and also for their knowledge in- and outside school. 

But on the other hand it is the teachers cure to taught the students important things like maths oder things from the past. 

My theachers are very friendly and I think that it is okay that teachers relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
