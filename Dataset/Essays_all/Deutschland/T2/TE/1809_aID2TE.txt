In my opinion the question "A teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thougt" is for teens like us important so,

like a lot of children watch television every day a long time and their parents didn't interesting it. The children forget to go outside to play with their friends.
Yes it is another time but, should the children only       their time at home for the television? Day for day the children watched unrealistic series or films so they didnt have a feeling for the realistic world. for a few years the toys, the children played with are barbie dolls or lego, in this time the toys for children also barbies dolls or lego but most only in the television.

 a lot of parents want that the children watched television so they didnt have to search the childrens or play with them and have most more time for work.

if we dont want the influence that children watched all day long television we have to stop it. 

for example we dont have to stop that children watched television. but we have to stop that they watched it all day long. one or two hours a week are good like on rainy days, when the children cant play outside with their friends. or when the friends havent time for them so he/she can watch televison sohe/she dont watch
