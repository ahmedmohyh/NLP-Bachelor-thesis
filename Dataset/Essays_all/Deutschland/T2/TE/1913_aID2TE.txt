I agree with the statement. Yes it is really important that teachers are able to relate to their students. I believe a lot of people often forget how important it is for learning that the children and teenagers feel safe and understood. For example when a student has problems at home and the teacher does not realize it or does not care the student will not get better in school because personal problems are distracting. In that case a the student should feel so comfortable with the teacher that they can talk about the problems so that they might find a solution.
However knowledge is a big part of learning i guess we all can agree on that. how should someone learn something when the teacher is not able to explain it well. For example when you have an unusal math problem you want to solve in class and you ask your teacher about it but they have no answer you might not ask them next time.
Most important is that teacher and student are able to have a good relationship. So everyone feels good at school. The enviorment you learn in is really important for the process and the sucess.
I do agree with the statement because when there is a question the teacher can not answer we are all able to search for answers on the internet. Teachers are also only humans so no one should expect them to know everything. Especially because they are humans they should be able to relate to students and try to help them as good as they can in their subject.
