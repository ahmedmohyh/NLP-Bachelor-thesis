For teachers it is very important to have good knowledge of the subject beeing taught, but also need to have the ability to relate well with the students. But is one of them more essential?
If a teacher has an eccelent knowledge of his subject, he can really teach the theme by heart and is often able to make the students be interested in the subject, even though it is very theoretical or complicated.
But without the ability to relate well with the students, the teacher will not be able to help them with difficulties and maybe cannot understand why someone is not as interested in the subject as he is. To reach the pupils, the teachers have to be not only interested in their subject, but they have to care about their students.
 On the other side good knowledge is important to support the students who are interested in the subject, too. the teacher needs to be able to answer most of the questions towards their subjectt, to make them continue asking productive questions.
ON the other side a teacheer needs the ability to empathize with their students and be careful with them otherwise they either do not have any respect anymore or they are way to afraid to say anything in class, even though they want to learn something.
finally it can be said, that it is neccesary to have a very good knowledge towards the subject being tought, but to make the students listen and be interested, it is essential that teachers need to have the ability to empathize and to relate to their students. Otherwise they will not enjoy class.
