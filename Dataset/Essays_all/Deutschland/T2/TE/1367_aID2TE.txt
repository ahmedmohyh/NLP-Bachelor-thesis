A teacher is a person that teaches his subject, but should he being even more personal.
First of all the teacher must be smart person in his subject to teaches the stuff as easy as possible to the students. But being excellent in the subject is not that important as being a partner that learns with the students together. Children are going to school with an age of 6 or 7 years. So they need a teacher with a personal realtionship to them such as a second parent. That means that the teachers are not only teaches there stuff they also teaches to be friendly to each other or somekind of teaching being morally right. This also should happens when they growing up. Furthermore a teacher should valuate the student on there ability's and how they try to giver there best. Like in sport where everybody were valuate with the same goal. But instead of that the teacher should valuate how hard it is for the student to get that. 
In my conclusion I would say that it is clear that the ability to relate to students is much more woth then being an expert in his subject. Even if that means that teacher don't know everything they have the opportunity, like using the internet, to get more information.
