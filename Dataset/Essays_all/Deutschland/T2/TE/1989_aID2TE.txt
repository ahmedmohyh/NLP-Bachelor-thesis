One might say school is about learning and if a teacher has no knowledgge he is unable to teach anything of value. The school, hower, has also to prepare the student for th following life. Knowledge is defintetly good, but the ability to interact with co-workers or the boss in the job after school is just as important as knowledge. For example someone who's searching a job won't just be employed due to what he studied and how good his grades were. His social reputations will be regarded just as well .
Even if a teacher doesn't care about that, he will want his students to learn, make homework and in general be good in his subject (or he decided for the wrong job). Students, however, will only learn if they're interested in the subject. A teacher can teach a subject either interesting due to good ideas and a good relation to it's students, or boring. If no one likes the teacher, also the subject will be boring and no one will learn anything since the students won't pay attention in the lessons and won't do their homework.
Relating well with students is not everything, but it is just as necassassary as a good knowledge of the subject. A good teacher combines both, a pleasant personality and knowledge. Otherwise everyone who studied for example science or a language, or someone who can just interact good with people, could be a teacher.
