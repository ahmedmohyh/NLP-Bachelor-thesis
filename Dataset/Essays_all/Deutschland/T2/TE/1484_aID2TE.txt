Which is the most important value of a skilled teacher? Undoubtedly, an excellent knowledge of the subject is necessairy to do a good job. But which role does the relation between teacher and students play concerning the educative outcome? In general, a teacher's duty is to explain complex and difficult principles and relations in an understandable way, which is actually not much more than "Wikipedia" could do aswell. So why can't students just read some articles among the world wide web to gain knowledge? It's because a personal relation between teacher and student is indispensible to open a new way of learning. Education shall not only be knowledge, it's thinking and reflecting, which cannot be taught without any close relation and empathy. Imagine a teacher who has always been the best during his time at university. He might have the most excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, but nevertheless, he is absolutely incompatible with other people. Therefore, he cannot understand why a student doesn't understand what he just told him. Teachers are no encyclopedia, although knowledge is the base of education, the base of thinking. No house without a basement, but the house is missing yet. Teachers also have to relate close to their students to be a source of inspiration, to provoke reflection, to build a house upon their basement. None of the named values is useful if they stand alone. Student relation and knowledge both make their contributes to a good teacher.
