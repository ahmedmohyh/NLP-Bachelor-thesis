The topic if a teacher should rather relate well with students or should have excellent knowledge regarding the subject is hard to answer.

The main advantage to have a perfect informed teacher is that the students will not ever miss a single information that could be given. Occuring holes are not the teachers fault but the students. Furthermore, problems conserning efford could be a cause of a perfect taught teacher. A lot of students do not know about a subject because they do not like the teacher or they have never tried to understand the topic properly. Rough lessons with speeds that nearly no one can follow are boring, dry and just not fun enough.

A teacher that can get along with his students would be an option to inspire all the boys and girls even if the lessons do not have a high quality conserning the knowledge that is been taught. It is more important to get the whole group working as to have just a few people who raise their arm constantly. The excitement you need for a subject is in most cases the main influencer that will give you the mark in the end. Math is (experienced) the most hated subject in school because of boring lessons, students that lost track three years ago and teachers that could not give the students a feeling that they actually solve an exercise in the right and fun way. A good connection between students and teacher is needed if schools want to have good results and students that are at least ok with going to school.

That is the reason why I prefer teachers that can relate with students. A perfect solution would be if there were a possibility to have teachers who combine these characteristics. But as I experienced, that is a rariety.
