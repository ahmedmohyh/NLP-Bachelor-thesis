School is the place where students are prepared for their future and to help them decide what they want to do. It is common that some students are disappointed with their teachers. They might be too serious, too loose, too boring or too buttoned up. The key is to find a good balance between that. Students can be really picky with their teachers and some might have a different opinion but in my opinion it is important that a teacher can bond with their students but also have a good content in their lessons. Let's be real, who likes boring lessons, where the teacher only talks about our society or the next math exam? We go to school for 12-13 years so why don't we make class a little bit more fun? It is absolutely possible to teach the students while they're having fun learning it. Some teachers think that you can only learn the subject when you sit bored in class and give them a ton of homework, but that's not how students want to learn. It would be enough if you make some jokes here and then or just be nice. Sympathy is a huge part of a students way to see a class. For example my biology class: I hate biology and I'm not interested in our topic at all, but my teacher was able to make me like it, just through his fun personality and how he makes the lessons. On Fridays a student bakes a cake and brings it to class for the other students, so we can eat while we learn. Or in summer we like to go out into nature and just do our lessons there, so we don't have to sit in those classrooms all the time. It seems like we don't achieve a lot in our class but it is the complete opposite. 
In conclusion I would say that it is important to make class a little different once in a while, so the students won't get bored and may even be exited for class. And if it is just a joke or going outside, students will appreciate it.
