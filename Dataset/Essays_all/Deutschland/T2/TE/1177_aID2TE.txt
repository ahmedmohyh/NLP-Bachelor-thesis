In the following essay will be discussed whether the teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subjct being tought. 
On the one hand, excellent knowledge of the subject is very important because the teacher has to understand the topics himself he wants to explain. In addition, incorrect information and unclear explinations would confuse the student so he would have problems to understand. 
On the other hand,it is really important that the teacher knows how to motivate the class because it is difficult to remember things by learning without any motivation. Learning with motivated people is fun and so it is easier to learn for the students. Furthermore, only knowing much does not mean explaining well. Knowledge itself is not enough for a good teacher because the way of explaining is important for the students to understand. in addition to that, there are students who do not spend any time learning and practising when they do not like the teacher, especially in lower grades. Therefore, teachers have to build up good relations to their stundents. 
In my opinion, both aspects make the best teacher. Therefore, teachers should be trained in their subject, for example maths, and in pedagogical matters like dealing with problems at school and explaining students a topic of what they do not know anything at that point of time. A good teacher should see the student's pespective of not knowing anything yet and take care of him as individually as possible.
