The question I will answer in the following statement is if a teacher´s ability to relate with students is more important then the knowledge of his subject.
One aspect which supports this statement is that it´s very important to present the subject, the stuff, which have to be taught, in a way that offers the students a possibility to understand the taught stuff.
This aspect is very important according to scientific subjects like Mathmatics or Biology, which are sometimes difficult to understand by some students. Nevertheless, excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is very important too especially in subjects like Mathmatics, because teaching stuff without knowing it in detail could decrease the learning success. Because of this aspect Math- teacher in Germany have to make their studies in the subject Mathmatics and not in different version of Mathmatics especially for the teacher job, like how it is in the other subjects.
To put in a nutshell I can say that the perfect teacher is the mixture of both aspects, he have to be abled to relate to the students but he also have to have excellent knowledge of his subject. But in the end the ability to relate to the students is more important.
