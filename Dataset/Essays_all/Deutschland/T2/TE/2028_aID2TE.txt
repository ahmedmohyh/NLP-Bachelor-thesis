In every school there are teachers who connect better with their students than others. Those theachers are often liked by every student of the school no matter which subject they teach. 
I wondered if their abilty to relate well with their students might be even more important than the knowledge they actually have of their subject. 
In the following text I will discuss this question. 

On the one hand the concept of school and the job of the teachers working there, is to teach students and not to become best friends with them. 
It might even have a negetaive aspect if theachers and students are friends because students might not take them as seriously as they should. In the worst case the students won't even think of the teachers as a authority person.
That might lead to the students negociating their duties as students, for example doing their homework or taking notes in class. They will be like: "I'm friends with the teacher so it doesn't even matter wether I work in class and at home or not."
It's also very important that the teachers themselves have excellent knowledge of the subject they teach because one has to understand a topic very well in the first place in order to teach others about it. 
Furthermore the teachers have to be able to answer question that come up in the lessons immediatly since they don't want to seem uninformed to the students. 

On the other hand it might even be a problem if the teachers have an knowledge of their subject, that is too excellent, and if they are real geniuses because they might think too complex for the students to understand and they might not be able to answer the students' questions with simple words so that the students aren't able to understand their explanations. 
Moreover I can tell that I've experiencend more than once that it pretty much depends on the teacher wether a student likes a subject or not. This means that if a teacher is capable of connecting with its stduents they will be more willing to lea
