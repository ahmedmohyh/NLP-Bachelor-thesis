An often occuring problem in todays school society is that many students claim to not have a good relationship to their teachers. A locigal question regarding this problem would be: "Is a teachers ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught?". This essay will deal with this question. 
The student-teacher relation can be crutial when it comes to teaching a subject. Even if the teacher is able to teach a certain subject perfectly judging by his knowledge, it does not have much of an impact if the relation between students and the teacher that good. Students will not listen to a teacher that they do not go along with well. However, if there is a good relation between these two instances, teaching and learning new information will be much more efficent. Students will now be willing to actually listen to what the teacher says instead of being annoyed by him. The teacher will also have a easier time to teach something becuase the information given by the teacher is reching the students more effectively and more accurately than before.
A good "student-teacher" relation is also important when it comes to disciplining the children for their later carrer. Students have to learn that a friendly but respectful treatment is the norm. In a class where the relation is less well, this important "life lesson" can be missed because a bad relation can also lead to a disrespectfully treatment from both, student and teacher.
Furthermore, a Perosn spends an fairly big amount of time in school and the teachers are partly responsible for the students behavior and their overall social behavior. 
Lastly, you can say that the relation between students and teacher is more important.
