Whether it is more important to have excellent knowledge or have a good ability to relate with students depends on the situation and the end goal of a teacher.
On one hand knowledge is very important if you want to properly educate students about a specific topic.
A knowledgeable teacher has the ability to convey the nessesary facts and methodologies needed to master a certain area.
The goal of such a teacher is to give his students competence in certain areas, helping them in their future life.
But being knowledgeable is a very different thing than being able to properly convey your knowledge.
Then the importance of relatability comes into play.
A teacher with a good ability to relate can have a better connection with a student.
This makes it easier to understand the students difficulties, have a more realistic picture of his abilities as well as making the student interested in the topic.
Only a teacher who has a mix of both abilities can be considered a good teacher.
