The statement by a unknown person "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught" in my opinion is only true if the teacher's knowledge about the subject is not completely bad.
Teacher's that i get along with very well also very well understand their subject and teach it nicely while keeping in touch with the students. Though i had nice experiences with teachers that can relate to students, i have to dis agree because theoratically speaking if the teacher would not be able to teach the subject well then relating to students is no use anyways, because the students would not learn as much as with a very experienced teacher and that should never happen.
Another reason why the statement is not very valuable is because teachers that can keep in touch with their students often lose time in class because of too much fun or simple talking around the topic, which i have witnessed myself all over my whole scholarship, that teachers may lose time by that but it does help the "climate" in class immensly.

To sum it all up, i am against the quote's meaning itself in theory but practically this is rather rare and i have always seen the opposite that there are very experienced teachers that do not keep in touch with their students at all and in a result can not provide a  very important lust for the students to participate in class.
