If a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject that he taughts, is a difficult question that has to be think about.On the one hand it's the main exercise of teachers to teach their subject, and this is only possible if they have excellent knowledge of what they teach. Students go to school for getting a good education, and so it is neccesary that there are teachers who can make sure, that the education is on a high standard. But also it is absolutely necessary that teachers relate well with their students. If a teacher is great at teaching his subject but isn't able to have any relation to his students, the process of learning doesn't work that well. As a student you also have to feel good when you are at school and those positive feelings make learning more effective and easy. In my opinion, the most important thing is that teachers can teach their subject in the best possible way, because that's the idea behind school. But as a teacher you should definetely try to combinate both aspects, to relate well with your students and to have a great knowledge, to educate your students in the best way.I think that with the combination of both you can reach the best results and that the one isn't that effective without the other.
