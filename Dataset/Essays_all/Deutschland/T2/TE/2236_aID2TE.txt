Bening a theacher is not that easy. One had to coperate with the students and als have to have knowledge about the subject and other themes which one can integrate in the lesons. It is very impotant to make a real and good leson with the student because when your are not integrating the students they will not learn so much. They do other things because it is not neccesary to follow the lesons. Than the student will fail in the exams and wil not pass the a-levels. But also important is that the teacher knows something about his subject if not he is not that interesetat in it and starts telling other stuff like how the schoolsystem works or somthing like that. The importance of this both sites of thoughting is to way up. On the one site the teacher as mentioned can not consentrat on the subject if he is not interestat in what he is telling. But on the other site he also has to be able to integrate the students and help them to understand whats statet. If not the student will fail. So the teacher has to be got in teaching but if he has no knowledege of his subject he can not explain what is impotrtant and the student will also fail in central-a-levels.
So in my opinion both sites had to be talents of the teacher if he wants to be a good teacher.
