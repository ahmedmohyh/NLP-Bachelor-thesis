In the following will be discussed whether the teachers ability to relate with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught.
On the one hand, if the students like the teacher, they are more likely to listen to him and pay better attention, so they learn more. Also, there is a lower number of problems in class, because if the students dont like the teacher, they often disuss with him about (for example) the grades they got. And another argument to agree with the statement is that nobody is able to know everything and every human can make mistakes. So why should we expect that every teacher is perfect?
On the other hand, the learning in school is not very intense if the theacher does not have a good knowledge of the subject and the students may have problems to follow the different themes in class if they didnt understand something which relates to later themes. Also, the studenst should be prepared for their later career and in college the professors expect a good knowledge of the basics. Last but not least, a teacher is a teacher and not a friend. In the foreground of his job stands the teaching of knowledge and not the friendship with his students, so its unprofessional if their relation with the students is more important to them than doing their job.
In my opinion the knowledge is more important than the relation to the students, because of the mentioned arguments and because i had a teacher who was very nice and funny, but wasnt able to teach us things and i still have problems with the subject he taught and i have to take my a levels in this subject.
