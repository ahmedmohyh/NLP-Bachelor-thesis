Being a teacher with having an excellent knowledge is very important. But there are a lot of other things a good teacher has to complete. 
In my opinion, it is important having a teacher who has specific knowledge and a lot of erfahrung. But a teacher who has a great relation to all his students, who can understand the children's problem, this is the first priority. There are numerous reasons showing my opinion regarding to this topic: Who is an excellent teacher? 
When I think back to my school life, I remind these lessons taught by my favourite teachers. In these lessons, we were'nt taught by topic after topic. They made the lessons also funny, they talked with us privately and understood our problems. And the most important thing: They wanted us to reach our best. Students has to have teachers like this, so that they want to visit school lessons and that the rate of students who don't visit school will sink.
On the other hand, it is also important that the teacher has a specific knowledge and knows what about he is talking. But is this the only important thing? A teacher also has to be verständnisvoll. And does not every teacher has to study before he's going into his employment as a teacher? I think, the answer is Yes! So excellent knowledge but also being human is a great advantage for being a good teacher.
