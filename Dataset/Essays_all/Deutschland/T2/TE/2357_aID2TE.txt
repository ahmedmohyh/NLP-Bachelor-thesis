Is a teacher´s ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject beiing taught? With this question i will deal with in the following text.
One argument why it is more impotant to relate well with students is that the students have more fun at school when the teacher relate well with the students. Maybe they have more motivation to learn something new and want to learn  some new stuff. When the teachers relate bad with the students they haven´t got motivation to do something for school and for the teacher.
On the other side it is more important that the students are a good knowledge of the subject to become good marks and also a good education. A good education helped the students in their future life to become a good job and earn much money. Also you have more ways to decide when you have a good education and knowledge of one subject or more than one subjects.So you have many jobs and campanies who want you to work for them.
after looking at both sides i think that is more important for me to relate well with the teacher becuase they could give you bad marks when you have a bad relationship to them and when they relate well to the students they relate well to the teachers. I think this is a good base that you want to learn something new and do it also in your freetime at home.That is why i think that it is more important to ability as a teacher to relate well with students than teach the students excellent knowledge of the subject.
