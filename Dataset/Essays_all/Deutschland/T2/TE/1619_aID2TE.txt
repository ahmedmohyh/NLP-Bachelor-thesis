There are reasons for why the teacher should relate well with students, as well as for that he should have perfect knowledge of the topic.

While a teacher may be perfectly good at the topic he's teaching himself, that doesn't directly mean that he will be able to teach it. On the other hand, if he doesn't know a lot about the subject, he has nothing to teach his students either.

But let's assume the teacher perfectly gets along with his students, and knows a lot about the topic to be taught. It is also possible that the students don't want to learn in class anymore, because they've got that friendship-like relationship with their teacher. But if not, being able to relate with students might be a great thing, since the teacher might be able to adjust the content of class or the way he presents it to better fit the student's taste. If done so, their interest in that subject in general may even increase.

In my opinion, the teacher should know enough about the topic to be able to teach it properly, but even more important than that, he should be able to pass on his knowledge. For that matter, you have a better chance of keeping the information taught, if you enjoy learning them. And whether you enjoy class, or have fun learning about new things, largely depends on how your teacher presents that information.
