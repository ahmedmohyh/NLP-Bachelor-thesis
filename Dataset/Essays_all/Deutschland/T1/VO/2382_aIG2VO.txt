That the current voting system in The US isn't great is propebly known to everyone, but the concept of only using computers doesn't garantee to make it any better.
The ballots are full with names and it's hard to find the candidate you want to vote for, but the plan of complete computerization doesn't consider people who aren't used to computers and have trouble using them. Officials make mistakes from time to time and a well programmed computer could solve this problem, but if one programmer maked a mistake it would cause much more trouble then an official.
Finally no computersystem was perfect since it's release. Constant development is neccessary to keep the system up-to-date. In the voting system it have be perfect from the beginning, but noone is able to garantee this completely.
