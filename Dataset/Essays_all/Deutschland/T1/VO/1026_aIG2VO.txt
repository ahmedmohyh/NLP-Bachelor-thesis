Computerized voting is easier for people who are used to computers. But people who don't work often with computers may have problems because they could make some mistakes by choosing their canditate they want to vote for. In the text aren't any arguments against computerized voting but the author says that computerized voting is easier than the traditional voting which is inefficient because for some people it's hard to find the right canditate on their ballot, especially for people with poor eyesight. Voting with the computer should be easier because they just have to touch the name of the canditate. In the text and in the speech is said that the people who have to count the ballots can easily make mistakes because they have to count over thousand ballots one by one. But when we vote with the computer the computer does the work of counting the votes very fast. But in the speech is said that computer programmes are made by humans and humans can make mistakes by doing that which can cause problems in spite of all the advantages of computers. In addition to that, programmes don't always work flawlessly.
The text is about the advantages of computerized voting and the speech is about the disadvantages of computerized voting.
