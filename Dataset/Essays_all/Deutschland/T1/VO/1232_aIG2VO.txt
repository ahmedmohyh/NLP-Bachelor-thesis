The two textes were about the mistakes happening in the election and how a computer could correct this mistakes or make more mistakes.

The first text said that we should use computers for the election, because they won't make mistakes during counting the ballots and the included votes for the candidates. Also the text told us that people with poor eyesight will mark the wrong person as a result of their bad eyes, which shift in the line during choosing the box to mark. In addition computers will have an easy programm, in which you can touch the name of the candidate you chose and you will be able to toggle the zoom of the virtualpaper, so people with poor eyesight will see the names better.
The second text said that computers were still be programmed by humanbeings and this will cause mistakes in the programm, which lead to heavier mistakes. For examble if a human counts the ballots he will only misscount one to twenty ballots, for a computer there can be a mistake in the programm which can cause to misscount houndreds of votings. Furthermore there are no physical replys of the ballots so you can't check if there were no mistakes made. In addition the computer could also cause trouble for people using a computer for their first time. Also it is also insufficient, because there is only one election every two years.
