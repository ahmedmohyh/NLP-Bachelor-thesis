Votings


Critics say, that they would like the traditional and trustworthy computerized voting system. But the computerized voting system is only easy for those people who know, how to use a computer. They also say, that the current voting systems are inefficient because miscounts can be demaging if is closly contested. But the traditional way can be a problem especially for people with poor eyesight. they can easily mark the wrong name of the ballot, because it´s only a small mark next to the name. And it´s also more complicated and takes more time to count the votes from the ballot.
The woman in the audience says, that humans are only make a few mistakes. When computerized systems make a mistake, then there are thousands of miscounted votes. So computerized systems do not remove the possibility of human error, because both did the same. So the critics are not in every fact right. Computerized systems did the same mistakes as humans.
