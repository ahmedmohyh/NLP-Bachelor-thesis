The text talks about the voting system in the United States.
First the text says that critics say that current voting system used in the US are inefficent because misscounts can influence an election. The critics say it because they like the traditional system because in their opinion they are more efficent and trustworthy than computerized voting.
There are two sites, once the pro and then the contra arguments aswell. 
On the one hand, the current vonting system used in the Us is better than the traditional system because the work with computerized voting machines are much easier. And in the traditional voting system it's very hard for people to count the votes one by one, there can happened an misscount very easy. But it's also right that by computerized voting can happened an misscount too and that can influence an election anyway, it doesn't matter if it's by traditional voting or by computerized voting machines.
 But not always computerized voting can be positive because if there's an error, the recount would be very long and expensive too. And it's also important to say that some people have problems with computers (often old people) and then to fill out a letter is much easier for them. 
Summarized you can say that each voting has their pro and their cons.
