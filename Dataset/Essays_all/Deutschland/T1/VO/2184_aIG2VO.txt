Up to know people in America vote by handwriting on a sheet. Should this have a change in the future? May people should vote on a computer?Like it is told in the text, this would be more efficient and trustworthy. People often cannot see the difference between the name of the candidate they want to vote for and the other names on the sheet when they have a poor eyesight. So that they take their mark next to the wrong name. On a computer they only have to touch the wright name. But peolple are often working with computers would have an advantage against them, who never work with computers. They have difficulties to vote on the coputer. Anyway it would be easilier to count the votes without mistakes, because the computer would do this. But if this high technology makes a mistake thousands of votes are wrong.
The person in the presentation wants to have the old systems on, the person in the text wants to try it.
