In the traditionall voting system of the United States are many that could be done better than they are done right now. There are many people and critics which want a new system which is computerized. But as we now know there are also many things that could go wrong with this type of system. For example people who do not work with computers very often in their daily life could have major problems with the system and this could lead to wrong votes for the wrong person. The text says that even people who do not use computers very often would easily handle the voting system and the touch-screen of it.
Another argument against this system ist that computers are just programmed by humans and every human makes mistakes. If they would do something wrong in the code of the voting programm it could cause an error. This could lead to the total destruction of the election if votes get lost or the system counts the votes wrong. This shows the total difference to the argument in the text which says that humans theirself do a lot of mistakes an it could cause a wrong election. 
One more thing that was mentioned is that we use banking programms every day but they are used massively and they get improved every day. But this voting programm would just be used twice a year. This causes that the programm can not be improved or at least not that fast as the banking tool. It shows the total difference to the argument in the text which says that we trust in programms every day. 
The text and the audio cast we heared totally show the opposite of the other one. The text shows arguments that count for the new system and the audio gives arguments against the new voting system.
