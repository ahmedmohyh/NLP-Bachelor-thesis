The text and and the voicenote are about voting in teh US. There is the question if computers are better to give and count the votes. 
At the one hand the text says with computers it is easyer to vote because the voters cross the right name, they want to vote. On paper there is the danger to cross the right name, but the compter which counts the wotes maybe dont know where the cross is and count the vote for the other name. If people count the votes, there can be the mistakes that they count wrong because it is human to make mistakes. 
At the other hand the audio says that there are these positive sides to vote with the help of computers but there is also a negative side. he people who use every day a computer, for them it is very easy to vote with the help of touchsystems but the people who do not use computers like older people they are not able to use the computers to vote because they do not know how it works. To count the votes with a specific program, there is also the risc to have  faults in the number of votes. It is normal that humans do mistakes, but everybody trust computers,because they think the computers do not do any mistakes. The progams of the computer are all based on programming by humans, so it can be that there are mistakes in the progam and the program do not count maybe over 1000 votes. so if the computer does not count correct, the votes are away and humans cannot control the votes and count them again to know if the computer counts right. 
So there is the option to vote and count the votes with the help of computers because many think they do everything right but there casn be mistakes of humans and computers because it is naturally to do mistakes.
