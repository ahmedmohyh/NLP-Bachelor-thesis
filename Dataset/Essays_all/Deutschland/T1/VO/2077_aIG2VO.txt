the woman says that if the traditional system of voting is replaced by the new computerized voting machines peopel who aren't used to computers will have a big problem to vote. Also there's the problem that computers can do mistakes too but these m,istakes are much more havier tahn the mistakes of human because they can count some votes wrong but the computer can count 1000 votes wrong or it will delete them if there's an error. IN constrast to that the text is written about the critics of the traditional system.They think that it leads to inaccurate counting of votes and people woh have problems with their eyes can easily vote wrong because there are so many names on this large sheet of paper and they can make only a small mark next to the name of the candidates. these critics want to replace the old system with the new computerized voting machines because they have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology and the votes don't have to be count one by one so the possibility of human error is removed.
