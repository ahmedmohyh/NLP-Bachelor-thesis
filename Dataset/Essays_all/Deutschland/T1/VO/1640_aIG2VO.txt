Voting is very important for every country. In the U.S. they are thinking about making the votings with computers. Critics think the old voting systems are inefficient and computers would be much easier. But there are not just advantages for the new voting system.
At first we have to talk about the comfort of using computersystems. The critics of the older system say, that there are to many names one one ballot. This could course problems by making a mark at a name. Finding the name takes a long time and it is hard for people with poor eyesight, because they could mark the wrong candidate. a computerprogramm would make these things easier. So candidates are esier to find and the names would not be written tha small. The disadvantage of this aspect is, that using these programms are easy for people who are used to computers. For example older people will have problems using the programm and this could also bring wrong votings and votings for the wrong candidate.
Another point to talk about is that humans can make mistakes by counting all the ballots and could miss some ball0ots or just type in the wrong candidate. Critics say, that this can be prohibited by computers, because the programm reads all the votes and save them. The problem on this aspect is, that the computers are programmed by humans an they can even do mistakes by that. When they do something wrong during programming thousands of votes and even more could get lost. 
So computers have advantages but also disadvantages.
