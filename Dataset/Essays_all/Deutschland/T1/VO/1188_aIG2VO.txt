The criticsim of the United States voting system that it´s inefficient is basicly right but the question that it will be improoved by computers is not that trustworthy as well. to make mistakes is yust the way humans are and computers are still made by humans so mistakes can happen to.
So what is the better option?
If there is a recogniced mistake while the counting of the votes, they have to be recounted compleetly but if the computerprogram makes any mistakes there is noonewho will check that. And computers also can be hacked wihtout knowledge of anyone. So I would say that the better option to take is the human counting, it´s not perfect but not that riscfull than counting complletly by computers.
With all this criticisim about the voting the main problem that there are no constructive decicions made in US-politics is the politicsystem in total.
