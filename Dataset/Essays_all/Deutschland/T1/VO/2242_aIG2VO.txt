The voting system in the United States is heavily criticied because miscountings can be damaging if an election is closely contested. Critics want to replace the human counting system with computerized voting and counting system. A major source of inaccuracy is that voters accidentally vote for the wrong candidate because they need to find their name in a paper sheet where many names are written, the ballot, and can easy tick the wrong candidatze with the small mark. People with eye damage or eye weakness are a great example for these mistakes. Computerized voting is therefore a good alternative because of the easy-to-use touchscreen-technology. But it might seem easy to use for user with computer expierence but for those who dont work often with computers it can create even more trouble because they dont know how and where to set there mark. Also these programms who count the votes are programmed by humans which may programm these wrong or incorrect and if an error excists the programm might miscount 1000 of votes or even delete them from the voting which can lead to a major problem. Humans otherwise need more time to count the large amount of votes where a miscount is nearly inevitable. If an error is detected a recount takes large amount of time. Computers on the other hand can miscount too since they are not used on daily bases like online banking, therefore they tend to make mistakes.
