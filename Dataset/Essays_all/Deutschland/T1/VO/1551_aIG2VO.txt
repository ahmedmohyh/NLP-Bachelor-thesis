There are many different opinions regarding the efficience of the voting system in the United States.

The madame who told you something about the system in a presentation, states that the voting system which the humans use now is better then a computerized voting would be. In her opinion computerized voting is only easy for people who often work with them. In contrast there are lots of others who do not do that and they would have large problems. Furthermore such programms are designed by humans and only one error in the programm could mean 1000 or more misscounts. Another point is that a good system needs time to be reliable, but national voting is only every two years in the United States. Thus it would need a long time to develop a system which is as good as the system nowadays.

On the other side the author of the article prefers computerized voting. He states that our voting system nowadays has the problem that there is a large sheet, a so called ballot, an there are lots of names on. Furthermore people with poor eyesight could miss vote because they cannot seperate the boxes.  Computerized technology instate have a easy technology to use, trusting the opinion of the author. So, he state it is easy to use the programm, but the madame says that there are also many people who might have a lot of problems.
A further point is that, the author says that there would not be so much missvotings while using a computer software for counting the votes. This is a really big contrast to the madame of the presentation.
