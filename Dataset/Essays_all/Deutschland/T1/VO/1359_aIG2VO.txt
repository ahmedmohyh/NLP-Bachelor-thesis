The topic of the two information sources are if a new voting system with computer in the United States are better than the old one with a large sheet of paper containing many names?

The first source was for the new system of voting and the second against the new system of voting.
Arguments for the new system are that you don`t have a large sheet of paper and you don`t have to make a small mark next to the name. Becouse If you have  to make a mark and can`t see really well you can miss the name and mark another name. 
A argument against that is that some people say it is too risky to implement complicated voting technology nationwide. 
But governments and individuals trust other complex computer technology every day to be perfectly accurate in banking transactions as well as in the communication of highly sensitive information.
Aother contra argument is that some people have a fear of technology.
The argument against this is that the computer are easy to use and you just have to touch the screen. So it`s easier to touch the name of the candidate against do have a large sheet of paper and to make mark.
It`s possible that there is a error in the computer system and many votes are away and in the old voting system we can`t lost the sheets of paper.

In the end there are many arguments pro and contra arguments for the question.
