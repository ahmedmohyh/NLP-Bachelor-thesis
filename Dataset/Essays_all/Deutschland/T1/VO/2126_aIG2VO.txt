The text speaks about the errors that happen with traditional voting and the neccessity of voting by a more efficient and trustworthy computerized system.
The text stresses how important it is to at least consider computerized voting as an option, where as the arguments of the audio presentation defended the traditional voting system.
The audio presention holds on to the believe that computerized voting would be even more doubtful, because many people wouldn't even know how to use a computer to begin of. All the people who didn't grow up with technology like the millenials would struggle. There are also the people who can't afford a computer. So those two issues would discourage people from voting. 
Another thing is the doubt people have in the perfection of the technologie of computers. It argues, that if human make mistakes, computers make even bigger mistakes, because they are build by humans. If a program was defected which caused miscountings of votes it would have a much larger impact on the election. If computers make an error, the won't be able to recount, because there would be no physical evidence of the vote left. 
Votes only take place once a year, so why would it be such a big problem to just count them the same way as ever, because that would still be safer and make smaller errors than it would be with computers.
