The shown text supports the idea of reforming the old and unreliable voting system in the United States. Manual elections with paper and pen have been shown to been inefficient and often caused problems for voters and counters alike. 
Especially old voters have problems with the election sheets and their small letters and squares, because they aren´t able to identify them.
Another big issue of the old voting system is that the counting of these enormous amounts of election sheets and their summarising often leds to mistakes and miscalculations. 
According to the text, modern technology has shown to be much more efficient and exact than humans themselves and would eliminate these sorts of problems without any risk. The computer technology would be easy to handle for young and old people alike and the counting systems can´t be false due to mathematic coding. Modern technology has shown to be a thrustworthy ally in governmental functions and other kinds of important state regulations. It could also be a good method to be installed worldwide in every nation. Therefore it only seems plausible to transfirm this kind of governmental work also to computer systems. 
The audio sample is strongly against this kind of reform action and has also arguments against it. First of all, technology itself is made by humans and therefore also able to make mistakes. While it´s truly very unlikely for a computer to make mistakes in counting, all man-made softwares are able being hacked  or infiltrated. There are also many people who are unable to work with computers and may have their problems with them, especially the old people, who, according to the text, wouldn´t have any problems.
