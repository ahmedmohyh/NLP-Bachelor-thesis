The actual voting system of the USA has many criticers, which are saying that the computerized version of an voting program wouldn´t cause so many miscounts than the traditional counting system. On the ballots you can easily tick the wrong box an than you vote for the wrong person. This wouldn probably not happen when they would have the computerized system, which is improved and where can´t vote this easy for the wrong person. An argument against this new technology is, that it costs a lot of money and time to improve it. It could also be that less people are going to the important votings because they don´t trust the new voting system. 

The idea of an new voting system has arguments for and against it so it is the best, first to vote about the voting system and than to make the real voting.
