So the question is if the votes with the computer system are more efficient.
An argument is that the people make mistakes by counting all the votes of every human and its a heavy work but the computers are made of human so you can't be sure that the computer works perfectly or even better than the election of humans. If the system has a mistake the consequences will be worse, so the it's not really clear if the computer has done it right. 
Another argument is that espacially old people who ar not used to control a computer or don't even know how it works with the mousepad or touchscreen the people can't vote for their candidate so it's the same thing as it was before. Mostly old people don't have good eyes and can mark the wrong name. So their are positive and negative aspects for the computer election. The old system worked before so why you have to change it?
