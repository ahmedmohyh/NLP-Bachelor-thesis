The text "Voting" says, that theres a big Problem with the traditional Voting. People that maybe can´t read or have a poor eyesight can easly vote for the wrong candidate. So the text is for the easy-to-use touch-screen technology. Where the People can touch the name and a voice tell them, which candidate it is. 

The speech is against this technology. If this technology is using every where, the peole who doesn´t know anything about computers can get real problems in the voting. Also this computers are progammed by humans and humans error in this case can be bad for the whole state. If theres a miscountig the whole state have to vote again, that´s expensive and bad for the people who have to vote twice.

So the people who have writes the text and makes the speech have an extremly different sight. 
What´s good for people with bad seeing conditions, can be bad for the whole country. 
It´s easy to count for the computer and hard for the people who have to count the traditional voting, but if theres a problem with the programm, again the whole state have a problem.
