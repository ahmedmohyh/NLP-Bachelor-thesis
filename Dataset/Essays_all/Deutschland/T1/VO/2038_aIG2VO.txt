One argument against computerized voting is, that computers are not good for people who are not comfortable with them. Older people ore people who dont know how tu use it correctly may tick the wrong answer ore did not know what to do anyway. As an difference the text says, that computer would have an easy-to use touch-screen and even voters with poor eyesight could easily make the right mark. Another point wich is said is that the humans who count the marks can have an error in there and then a long recount has to take place. But when you use computers for the votes the votes would be count by computers and if any computer would have a mistake in there almost all votes wich are count by this computer can be wrong. So the desaster would be much greater. 
It also says that computer will miss the private concept which you have in a normal vote. But all governments and indivduals today trust computers. Either in online banking transactions but as well as in communication. So the computerized vote will not get any more private information then you definitly use either.
