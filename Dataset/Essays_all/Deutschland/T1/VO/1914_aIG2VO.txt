In the audio the woman tells about the computerrized voting is not so good for the election because on the machines are programms which programmed a human and human are not perfect. So they can programmed the programm wrong or not fake. Then there can be a lot of miscounted. This is impossible to vote with machines because it is not save that all the votes are counted.
Also in the audio the woman tells that the technology on the machinse can fall out. Then you have a big problem because all the votes are miscounted too.
The text tells exactly the opposite of the audio.
The text tells that people with poor eyesight can easliy mark the wrong names on the sheet. 
If a sheet voting have to miscounted votes in a election so it is so hard , expensive and need so much time to recount this votes. But if you have a computerrized system then you have just to remove the possibillity of human error.
