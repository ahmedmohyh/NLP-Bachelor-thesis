Voting is the most important part of our politicalsystem and gives the people a chance to interact with the poleticians of there nation. Poorly due to a failure of three of the Headphones I wasn`t able to hear the listening parts. So I only can give my opinion to the the text.

In my opinion the Votingsystem is the problem in the US you don't vote the canditad dierectly, you elect a votesman, who votes for you the president, what is confusing for voters, who do not know there respectiv votesman and so missvotes can happen far more often than it should be. Also the laws to sign in for voting have lead to that in the past years only 40 percent of the people that could vote, have actually voted in the US what isn't that many. 

The argument that people with poor eyes can't vote is in my opinion not that strong, yes people with poor eyesight see worse than people with better eyesight, but that doesn't mean they can't have glases, so that argument is quite weak. 

More interesting is the question, why they don't vote per app. On the one hand it's easier and it could help people with disabilitys, when they can't walk to the next voting cabin on there own, or stand for 3 hours in a line for a line to vote. On  the other Hand is this kind of voting through the internet extremly unsafe, somebody with good computer skills could hack the app and make thousands of fake votes or even worse.

At the end they have to decided between as the series "Southpark" said between "Giant Douche" or "Turd Sandwich".
