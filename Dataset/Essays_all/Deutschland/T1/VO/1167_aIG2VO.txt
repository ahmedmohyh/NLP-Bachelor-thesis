In the speech about "Voting" a woman tells about her opinion about votings with computers. She is against computerized voting machines and brings some good arguments. The author of the text has another opinion, he says computerized votings make those votes easier. For example he says that many people accidently vote for the wrong candidate. That shouldn´t be a problem with computers he says. But the woman who gave the speech says that it may be right for experienced people who often work with computers and have a good knowledge about technology. But people who are not that experienced, for example old people, may vote for the wrong candidate. And the woman says that those who vote wrong as a consequence of non-knowledge are far more than those who accidently vote wrong on a paper. Another argument against computers, which is brought by the woman, is that the mistakes, a computer can make have very bad consequences because there can be mistakes that make thousands of votes being wrong. Naturally a human makes mistakes but if one counter makes a mistake there might be one wrong vote, not thousands of votes. And the computer votes are tested only once or maybe twice a year and that´s another argument, why it can´t work. A computer programm of a concern is used everyday so that mistakes can be found, but the computerized voting machine isn´t used that often so a mistake may happen in a big election and especially in the beginning mistakes can happen very often, but a mistake with this consequences like thousands of wrong votes is not possible in an election.
