The presentation is saying things against the arguments in the text. In the text it was said, that votings with a computer would be much better and there wouldn't be that many human errors, because with normals votes there can be misscounts which could not happen with a computer. In the Presentation they say, that there could be even worse human errors, for example, if there is a mistake in the voting program. This could lead to 1000 or even more missvotes (which would be especially bad, when there is a close election between two candidates) and this would lead into a revote which is almost impossible with computer voting because there is no backup of the voting progress. Also, there aren't votes that often, so it's pretty hard to create a really good voting program which is optimized to don't do any mistakes. Also it would be hard for people who don't have any knowledge about computers and they won't know how that would work. Even with an explanation it could be hard because they just click on the wrong thing or something like that. In the text on the other hand is said, that with computer programs there wouldn't be any human errors anymore and that there is an easy-to-use-touch-screen technology, where people just have to click on the person who they want to give their vote to. So all in all the presentation is just like the complete opposite from the text and tries to weaken the arguments from the text.
