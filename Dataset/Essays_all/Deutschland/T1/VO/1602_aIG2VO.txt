The presentation was about the question if the traditional or the computerized voting is the better way to count the votes. An argument was that some people don't get along with computers because they never used one, for example. Another one of the presentation was, that technology faults are possible, too, and that those faults would be even worse because thousands of votes would be escaped and wouldn't take place in the election, so the whole election would be manipulated by the computer. A part of the text says that computer systems are very risky, too, as in the presentation. Otherwise, those computers had been improved a lot before they could be used and computers are used by the government or in other jobs every day, so the technology way is fully trusted by them, too. That's an argument which is also in the presentation and in the text. Another argument of the presentation was, that computers are the better way for those who get along with computers, but that's not in the text.
