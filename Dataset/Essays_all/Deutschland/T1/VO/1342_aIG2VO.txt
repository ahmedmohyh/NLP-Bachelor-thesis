Some critics say, that current voting systems is inaccurate and can damage the voting, but problems with a digital voting system can damge the voting even more. People with bad eye sight could make a wrong mark on the ballot, but people who don't know how to work with a computer could make a wrong mark too, so it isn't sure that no one make a wrong mark.
Another point is that people have to count the ballots one by one so it's nearly save, that they will make a mistake, but on the other hand voting programms are designed and made by human too so if they did there a mistake, the voting could be inaccurate too and they could have to carry a bigger problem, because if a human make a counting mistake, he forgets maybe 5-10 votes, but a bug in the voting system could influence thousands of votes.
They say too, that people trust banking systems too, so they could trust the voting system. But a banking system didnt' work well in the beginng too and it needs years of developing to make a working system, instead of the voting system wich is only in usage every 2 years so there is no test time to use it or develop it.
