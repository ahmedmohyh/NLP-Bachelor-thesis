The Woman in the just heared Text descripes Computer controlled Voting as Something unrealible and damaging.

She begins with the smaller problems of computer controlled Voting.
Some People cant afford Computers or cant handle that Technology Right, this can lead to missvotings which can lead to The Wrong Candidat winning the Election.

A Bigger Problem is that the Programms are made by Humans, Humans can make mistakes, so the programm will also have them. Normally some Hundrets of people make an voting mistake, leading to there votes not beeing counted. But Computer with an Error can cause 1000 and more Votes not to be counted. This Would have an immense effect on The Election. 

So this Computerprogramms have to be improved to make them more efficient and stop errors to happen. But The Woman says, its almsot impossible to do so since the Elections only happen every 2 years, so the chance to find all error is really small,this would make the Development extremly slow.

These statements don't agree with the Statements in the Text.
The Text says that the voting System in America is extremly ineffiecient causing many Miscounts. The old System also makes people vote the wrong candidats , which is damaging the election. While the Woman says Computers are bad, the text writes that Computer voting systems are easily handable and even help people to not vote the wrong candidats with highlighting them and making them easier to read. While She mistrusts the Computer counting the votes, the text says that the old system needs to many People to count the votes. If errors happen everything would have to be counted again which makes the counting longer and longer.

So in Conclusion both views have there positive and negative arguments but i think the Computers will win this fight for the perfect voting Systems. We just have to many people voting and Humans wont be able to handle that much Longer.
