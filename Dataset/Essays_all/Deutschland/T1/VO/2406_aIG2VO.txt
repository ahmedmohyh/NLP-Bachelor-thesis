The text is critisizing he current voting system of the US. The ballot which has to be filled out by hand is full of different kind of names, which makes it hard for people with bad eyesight and its hard to concentrade. The voting system in the US should be computersized, so the votings can be qount faster and auomatically. This would take off a lot of human work because they have to count each ballot by hand. The text believes that a computersized sytem is more trustworthy but there are still some people who find it very risky. The audio data is against counting the votes by comnputers because lots of people have problems dealing with a computer. Especially people who dont PCs on a regular basis und cant afford one would have major problems with ths new counting system and could be discouraged to vote at all. The computer system is programed by humans anyway, so how could the computers be more trustworthy?
The text is referring to computers used daily in banking transcations but, as the audio data says, these banking system is being improved day by day to work smoothly. Furthermore, banking is used regularly but voting happens only once in two years. It`s better if we dont leave the disabled and elder generation out of eyesight and make it the easy way for all.
