At first they said that computerized voting systems are only helpfull for people who are using computers every day, because for all the people who don't know how to use a computer or aren't able to use one it would be impossible to vote with a computer-system. Another point was that the system is programed by humans and when they make a mistake by programing the system it would be very dangerous because the defect programm can effect the voates and it would be impossible to make a recound with the computerized voting so if there is a mistake it's quite worse than making a mistake by counting the votes normaly, but the text says that humans are mistakes every day and it is really expensive and costs a lot of time to recount all the votes one by one and that a miscount of the votes can damaging a contest and that computers are not making those mistakes. Also the system that we are trusting every day of the banks took much time to be proved but it is possible because we are using it every day so that there are much possibileties to find the faults and to solve the problems but a computerized voting system is only used a few times per year wich is making it very difficult to see and solve the problems, but the argument that it is too dangerous can't be used if we are trusting other computer systems every day. In the text it is also named that it is easy to vote for somebody wrongly, because they have to search the name of a long list and make a small mark next to it, with a computerized system they only have to tap on ascreen on the name for example.
