Argumentation: ,,Voting"

The text and presentation, about the topic how votes could be often incorrect, are giving both a critic to different ways how you can vote. The text will show the readers, that a computerized system for voting is better than the traditional voting.  One argument were that traditional voting have more miscounts than a computer voting because the computerized systems have a better possibilty to recount wrong votes. In contrast a traditional voting, where a human is counting the votes, it is more difficult to analyse after counting the wrong done votes.
The presentation of voting has the opposite opinion to the text. The woman in the presentation says, that computerized is more easier to use, but if a computer also will do a better job than a human, is questional. Cause maybe the computer programmes could be defected or manipulated. A voter can not know this when he is just vote.
