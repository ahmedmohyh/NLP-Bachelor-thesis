The text above and the presentation are both about voting in the United States. The text outlines the problems about voting and that it is inaccurate when it is counted and also voted by human. The presentation is about the problems that would be there if the human is replaced by computer.
First, the text says that the people who are voting can easily mark the wrong person. In addition to that, there can be miscounts by the people who are counting the votes in the ballots because they are often not many people who have to count thousand of votes. Furthermore, computer systems could erase this major problem and they are also much faster. Computer technology is used every day by people so there will be no problem for the government.
Whereas the presentation says that this technology can not be better and that it is not sure that there would not be any mistakes. It is also a major problem when people are not used to computers every day so they don't know what to do. If there are mistakes, the damage would be much more than a miscount by one person. At the end, it is hard to develop trustful technique which can be used at the government.
