Critics say that current voting systems in the US aren´t that efficient as they should be. People can not vote easily because the human voting system, to mark your opinion on a piece of paper and others will count them all to find out the final count of numbers for each candidate. It is not easy for older people to vote  for the person they want because they have a poor eyesight and often mark the wrong candidate on the list. Another problem for older ones is the long list  on which all the candidates are named. it is possible that they can not find them on the list because of the lenght. The people who count all the votes can also make mistakes while they are counting them. All in all it leads to an inaccurate counting of votes that is inefficient and not that helpful and correct as it should be. There is another method of voting. It works with a computer. First of all it sound quite good because computers can not make human mistakes. But if you think about it a little bit longer, you see that there are also some problems. Maybe there are some people who do not know how to work with a computer because they do not use any. So it is very difficult for them to vote. Another aspect is the possibility of an error in the computer programms. 
Finally there is no good solution for voting. There are many aspects against voting with a human voting system which could be a solved with an voting system on a computer to mind a human error but as it is showen here, voting with computers is not a good solution too. Both voting systems have many negative aspects against their voting method but now it is not the time to discuss which of them is the better one. It is time to find another and better method for voting without any errors.
