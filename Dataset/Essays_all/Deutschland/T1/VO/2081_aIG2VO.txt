The text is about elections and how to vote. Usually you can find the name of the candidates on a paper and mark the person you want to vote. 
But some people think that people with poor eyesight can mark the wrong candidate. They want votings on the computer. The voter just touch the candidates name and vote for him or her. But people with poor eyesight also can touch the wrong name.
Another argument for their computer voting is, that the machine can count the votes better than a human, because humans aren't that clear all the time. Computers are at one level anytime. But humans done this computersystems and maybe they done something wrong with it and it's not right anymore. 
Computers also have the posibility of an error and all the votes are away can't be count anymore and they have to vote a second time. Votes on papers can be count a second time and aren't away. 
Some people think it's too risky to vote on computers, but they say it's a safe way to vote.
