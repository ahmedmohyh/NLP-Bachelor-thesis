In the speech the computer vote counting with computers is a problem because their are often people who dont use computers at home and dont know what to do with is as a result they maybe vote for something they dont want to wote for because they are not able to vote for the right thing or they just vote for the person all the others vote for. In contrast to this the text supports the use of computers in the vote couting because the technology dont do so much mistakes like human. This critizise the speech because if a computer make a fault  it is a whole miscaunt. The error is in every count but when humans do it  there is just one or two mistakes not a whole miscounting. Sometimes people with poor eyesight vote for the wrong thing but others also can do it if they dont have the knowledge for computers.
