In the text it says that it will be better if you have an election that you use a computer voting system. This shall overcome the humans mistakes which you do by voting with a piece of paper. There you must search the name of your favourit candidat in a long list and have to mark it with a little sign. Here it is possible to mark a wrong name because everything is so smal. 
They also write that by a computer voting you only have to tap the candidat´s name at the screen.
But the meanings can be different. 
The speecer they say that computer systems were made by humans. So there could be an error by make the program for the voting and this could be the reason for mistake and a wrong voting. 
Also it will be definetly easier for people who knew how to use a computer than the other way round. They say that it will give problems because the people don´t knew how to use the computer in the right way. 
Because of that it is better to use the traditional way of voting with a piece of paper because the mistakes people do here are totlly normal and you will always have people who make mistakes. 
It doesn´t matter if the mistakes are at a piece of paper or because of a computer system. You only have to decide which way iof mistakes are better or a little bit less then the other way. That´s the point were the different opinions are formed.
