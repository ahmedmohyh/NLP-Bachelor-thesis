The topic is the current voting system in the United States and possible alternatives to improve it.
On the one hand voting by computers is good on the other hand it is not. The second source tells something about the second case. 
One problem of the computerized voting is the ability to handle the technologie. For all the people who are used to modern technologie, especially computers, it's easy to do the voting process but for people who aren't used to it it might get very hard to vote and to vote correctly. Some people for those it isn't easy may decide not to vote because they just don't know how or because they have a certain fear of technologie. 
Another problem which is named is that there is doubt wether the computerized voting is safe. Computers can't be perfect because they are programmed by humans and humans can make mistakes. If they did some in the programming process there will be thousands of wrong votes, counting the votes one after another will just bring a few individual mistakes. For a system it's important to improve which is only possible if it is used daily. A voting system will just be once every two years which makes it hard to be confident about it.
All this arguments of the second source are in contrastb to the first one. The first one tells something about the pros of computerized voting. It says that voting with computers wont result in as much mistakes as normal voting because it's an easy-to-use touch-screen technologie. It is also possible for the voter to magnify the name for easier viewing. In regard to countig the votes a computer will improve this process massively and there are no human errors.
