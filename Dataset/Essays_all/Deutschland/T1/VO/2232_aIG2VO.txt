First of all, it has been said that computers are not much better than humans because voters who might not be used to using a computer could feel overwhelmed with the situation and would not know how to coop with it. This could majorly lead to the point that they stop voting because they are not pleased with the system. Another point is that computers are made by humans and there could also occur an error so that thousands of votes cannot be counted, which shows a lack of confidence. Confidence that can be hardly build up over 2 years, since there is only one election every two years nationwide.
The arguments listed above are very much against computer systems, whereas the text states the new founded systems more efficient. It is likely that humans often miscount the votes because there are so many of them but it takes so much time to do a recount. Computers could easily count those votes in a few minutes, which saves a lot of time. Moreover, people with poor eyesight can probably barely see the names or make a cross for the wrong name, which also leads to a wrong count, computer voting systems would provide this error because one can zoom in on the paper and find the right candidate faster.
