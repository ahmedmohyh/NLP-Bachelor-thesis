In a speech a woman gave she gave her opinion of the often wanted computerized voting systems and in the following part I am going to summarize them and compare the arguments she gave with arguments from a text that is on the positive side for the systems.
The woman told that the computerized systems are a difficult and complicated thing because people who can not relate with technology or are even afraid of it can make mistakes by voting a person or something else. They can vote for the wrong person because they do not know what to do or tap on the wrong person. 
But comparing to that the text is pointing out that people can make mistakes by voting on papers that contain a lot of names and for example for people who can not see very well it is hard to see if they make the right mark for the person they want to vote for. They say that it is easier to make a more viewable vote for the ones on a computer because it is easier for them to just touch the name of the person they want to vote for.
Also the speech of the women includes the errors that might happen by counting the votes. She said that the "human error" which means the false counting by votings can happen by computers too. She said that computers are created by humans and she even asked if it can be reliable and always right when a computer counts the votes when it is made by humans that are meant to make mistakes. 
Comparing to the speech the text is describing the "human error" and that people are making mistakes by counting thousands of votings and that can lead to a recount that is expensive and a long way. Also it can lead to the wrong result of the voting. The text is pointing out that the computers can count the votes automatically and extremely fast what can lead to the possibility to remove the "human error" and make it more easy to come to a result.
