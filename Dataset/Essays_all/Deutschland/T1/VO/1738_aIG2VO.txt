Voting is something relly important in every country and should be taken seriously.
But the voting system  is very critsiced by many people because they say it would be better to use computerized voting machines for the votings in the United States. 
But the problem is that many people are used to vote with a large sheet of papaer and maybe the people are not able to use the computers for the voting or they do not know how to use them, and this can bring troubles with it because if the people do not know how to use the computers maybe the voting can go wrong and this makes a lot of people frear.
It says that humans make mistakes in counting the votings and this is not unusual but the point is that computers also make mistakes because they are made from humans and the problem is if this computers have technological problems the reuslts or the mistakes are worse and bigger than the ones which are made form us.
Also the point that this computeriezed voting machines are very time expanisve in their production , we ask ourself if it this is really nessesary to do beacause , bankings who do use this type of mechanies every day can produce them , but the votings are normally just ones or in some countries twice a year .
From the point of view of the text writier mantions mainly the negative aspects of the regular voting system , that people with poor eyesight can make mistakes and that the computeriezed voting system is easier and clearer to see for everyone and the problems with the count of the votes is actually the fault of the humans and the computers wouldnt make mistakes instead of that they would yount the votes quickly and without mistakes.
and the point with the usage of this technology in other parts like banking it does work everyday and there should not be a problem to use the ones for the voting in the audio the usage of this technology for votings was shown like unnessecery.
