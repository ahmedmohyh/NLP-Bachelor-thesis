The computer-vote-system is quiet good and modern, but not that save than the traditional voting. The reason is that the computer system is easier to manipulate. 
It is true that the traditional voting got some problems for the older people because of their poor eyesight, with this problem these people put the mark to the wrong name and did not even noitese that. But I do not see that they woud not have these problemes on the computer as well. The computer system is reneweable and mordern and I think it is better than the traditional system but I think the systems got the same problems. The advantage of the computer system is that you maybe can vote from home, which mobilisate more people to vote and maybe it is quicker. When you can vote from home it is maybe cheaper for the goverment and they do not need so much space, like a sportshall from a school or something like that and the thausends of people who sit in these buildings and do the administration.
