The speach which was told by a lady deals with the dissimilatities between a voting by an electronic computer or by voting in a traditional way.
It appeals to the reader that a voting which is done in a traditional way - the ballot -  could have many miscounts or accident votings for the wrong candidate. The text also mentioned that the people who have to deal with all the ballots will make mistakes. Besides the speach also talks about an error which could be in the computer which was created by a human. Such errors which are made in a ballot are only a few whereas the errors made by an excellant computerized voting are thousand times worse than in a traditional way. 
At least the lady mentioned that the voting only happens twice a year but the text talks about the technology nationwide
