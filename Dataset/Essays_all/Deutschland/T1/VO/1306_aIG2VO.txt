The voting system in the USA is pretty different than those we have in Europe. It is very complicated, which makes the voting for civilists kind of difficult. 
To overview all the names of the candidates, the voting lists are very long and the letters on it are very small. So for example for older people, whose eyes aren't the best anymore may tick the wrong candidate, because the can not read the name exactly. To solve faults like this people want a new more technical voting system, that is easier for overviewing and for crossing the right name. Furthermore a computerized system can avoid human mistakes by counting the votes.

They may touch the wrong button, because they don't know his consequence. An other piont is that the computer programs are inventet by humans, which may lead to system problems.
