The heard text about the voting process in the united states is concluding some important points.
In the first part of listening, they told some informations about the voting system. The sytem were failed in some ponts, so the 
Ergebnis is not right. Also they told about the computers and that they were to unsafe, so the Ergebnis wurde verfälscht.
In the text below they told us a bout how safe it would be and easily to use for every humen. Also the voting machines have modern touch screen technology so it is easily to use for the user. The user can see their name on the screen and can answer the questions very fast.  
The votes can fast and digital ausgewertet werden. so mistakes can ausgeschlossen werden.The old voting sytem is not as good as the new one because of very much problems and not so genaue auswertungen. Also told us the text that the governmant want the computer technoligy because of the perfectly and accurate communication of high sensitives informations. 
The text and the heard speech are in some points not the same meaning.  
The 'text' is for the technology and the 'speech' is against it.
