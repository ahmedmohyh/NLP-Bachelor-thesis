In the following text I am going to describe the arguments of the speach, i heard and compare it with the text, i read.
In the speach was said, that computerrise voting is much better than voting with hands.They also said that by voting with hands often happen mistakes. It often happen mistakes by computerrise voting anymore.
In the text was said that current voting are inefficient like it was said in the speach and it often happens mistake and so they vote for wrong candidate."People with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name" as well, that is why it is also inefficient. 
But when they vote with a computerrise voting it is much better, also for people with poor eyesight. The text also said that computerrise voting is much better, because the vote counting is done quickly and also automatically. 
The speach and the text also have critics at the computerrise voting. 
All in all both said that computerrise voting is much better than voting with hands.
