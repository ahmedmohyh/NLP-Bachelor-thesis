Essay 

The speech was about the problems a computerized voting system is bringing. The first problem the woman talked about was that some people havent got any knowledge about computers and that this could course these people not to vote. The text brought an opposite point against the current voting system. It said that some people could have some disabilitys that course accidantly wrong votes. Both, the text and speech say that humans are making mistakes. The text said that humans could count wrong and that it would take a long time to count all votes again and that a computer system would be more accurate. The opposite argument of the speech is that human mistakes would be small compared to a computer error, because every count could be lost forever. Another arguemt of the text is that the computer system is made by a human and that human are making mistakes, so the speech is taking the argument of the text that humans are doing too many mistakes and uses it against the text.
