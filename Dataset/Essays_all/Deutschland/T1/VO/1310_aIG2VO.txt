There are two types of voting, the traditional and the voting by computers. People have critics of both of them. They say for older people it´s heard to finde the name of the canditate on a large sheet like it is traditional. at a computer you only have to touch the name. The others critics that there are many people to know how to use a computer but there ar people who dont know how to use. Otherwise people make mistakes. So not often in the counting it happens they make mistakes. A computer don´t make mistakes and have a correct voting. "Yes" the traditional says, but the computerprogramm is making by people too so they can be a mistake too. Then tey have to do a completely new voting. At this point the others says that everyday highly sensetive informations, baking, booking and so on are make with the computer. There is no risk that these importan informations ar wrong because the programm is not perfect. But traditionals dont think its a god idea, thes banking is everdy but voting just evere scond year. It is not the same. Finally there are two groups with an other meaning of votingtypes. Both have god reasons for theire opinion.
