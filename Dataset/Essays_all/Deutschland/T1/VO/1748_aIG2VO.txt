The message of the text is that old voting systems are inefficient.They say there are many sources to make mistakes when the people has to vote on a little cheat of paper. For example old people could mark the wrong name and so he woted for a wrong candidate. The audio has shown that the computer rised voting is very risky. The computers are programmed by humans and humans make mistakes. When they use the computers only once in two years they can make mistakes and get in trouble with the machines and that´ll be a very big fault. In a bank they use computers every day and so the risk to make mistakes is not so high then to make mistakes with a programm you use not daily. So the text say that voting with a paper is risky and a computer rised voting is not so risky because its used all day. The audio is against these statement and says that it is very risky to vote with computer programms because you don´t use computers for voting so often and when you make a mistake it is bad for so many people because maybe they have to vote again.
