In the following it is my job to write an essay about the voting systems in the United States of America with the arguments from the text above.

In general you can say that the voting systems in the US are very old and discutable. It is very easy to make tiny mistakes but the problem is that this "tiny mistakes" have huge consequences. For this I want to give you a typical example. When someone goes to the vote station and is going to make a tick on the pc by the person he wants to vote, it can easily happen that you tick on the screen the wrong person and your vote is over. It is also problematic when the officials make a mistake after all votings are finished, because mistakes get very expensive and it is hard work to make them right again.
