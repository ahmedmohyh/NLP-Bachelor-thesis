The presentation is about the voting system in the United States of America. The speaker prefers the traditional system of election to stay instead of an election, where computers are used. Because the computerized election system has far more risks than the traditional one.
Although there would be a faster count of the votes by using computers, there would also be a bigger risk too. Because many people don't keep contact to computers and their systems every day. That's why they could vote wrong easily without even knowing what they've done. The knowlege of how to deal with computers is missing. For example old men have eye problems so it's more difficult for them to read what stands on ther voting sheet. A list on the computer would be easier to read, but they are not born in the generation of technical information. As a result they are not able to handle the voting by computer.
The texs says that human are more capable of making mistakes, but in fact the computersystems are made by humans too. So if there is a mistake in it, it would end in a big mess and would be worse than some traditional votes, which weren't count.
