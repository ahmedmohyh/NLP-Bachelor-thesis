If computerized systems would be used for the elections, voting would be easier for the most people, because for them using modern technology is normal. But the problem would be, that especially older generations often aren't able to use such technology, because they lived a long time without computers, smartphones and things like that or aren't already using this modern technology . So they could make mistakes while voting or even don't go voting. Another problem were the possible erros in computerized voting machines. This programms are made by people, so mistakes are possible. Besides elections were held only once in a few years, so the voting programms aren't used and tested very often. The text says that computerized systems remove the possibility of human error and are making the vote counting done more quickley. Besides it is saying, that computerized voting machines are an effort for older people, because it would be more uncomplicated to vote, because of leaving out large sheets of paper containing many names.As you can see the text and the writer of the speech are very differnt opinions, because they are using same types of arguments, but with different intentions.
