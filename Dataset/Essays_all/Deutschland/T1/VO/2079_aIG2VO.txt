The speech of the woman is about the computerized voting in America and gives arguments for and against it. First she said votings on computers are easier for people, who know something about them and work on computers often. For people, who don´t know anything about computers, a voting on it can cause fear.
Then she manchend the point, that human make mistakes but that the computerized voting is also programmend by human hand. Maybe some ballots can be missed in the programm. Although a computer is better in counting and a human can easily forget one vote but the computer doesn´t.
Her last point is that these programms are used often for example for banking. So they are improved again and again and will become better until they have developed a programm, which won´t lead to fear anymore.
In the text it says that current voting systems are ineffient and lead to unaccurate counting of votes. The woman says that too and thinks computers aren´t as failable as humans but she gives a point we have to think about too: that the computers are programmed by humans too, which can cause mistakes.
The whole text doesn´t give any negative arguments about a compterized voting and lists only positive things like that people with poor eyesight can´t mark the wrong name on computers as easy as maybe on the paper. The woman gets us to know both sites and gives the argument people can have fear of computers, which is different than the opinion in the text
