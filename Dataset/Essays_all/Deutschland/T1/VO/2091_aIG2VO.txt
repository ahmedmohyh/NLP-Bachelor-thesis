The topic today are the traditional voting systems in the U.S. in opposite of the idea of computerized voting systems. The presentation said that computerized voting systems aren´t better than the traditional voting systems because e.g. for old people who are not working with the computer allday they find it harder to understand the computer instead of people who are working with them every day. Another argument against the computerized voting systems is that computers are original made by humans so it could be possible that some computers are wrong-programmed and have a failure in their system. But the thing is that at the traditional voting systems are also things that are not really good e.g. critics says that current votings in the U.S. are inefficient and inaccurate caused by human error. The humans who have to count the voting ballots could easily count them wrong and than it has to be count again. Some things like that take too long time. Also miscounts can be damaging if an election is closely contested. Another problem at the traditional voting systems are the votes for the wrong candindate. When a person has not that good eyes anymore than he/she could easily mark the wrong name. It is too inacurrate because the ballots are with so many names on it and is written to small. In the presentation is also said that the computer programs are reliable now and we trust in them but at the beginning of it we didn´t.
