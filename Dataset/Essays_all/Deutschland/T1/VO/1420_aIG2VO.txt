The speech says that the traditionell voting system shouldn't be changed to computer voting systems, because many people actually don't know how to use a computer. In effect, those and also other people are maybe voting for the wrong candidate. The computer voting systems are also programemed by humans so it's also possible that those programmes have errors or they don't work like they should do. 
The text says that the traditionell voting system should be changed to a computer voting system, because the old system is hard to old people who can't read well anymore so they are maybe voting for the wrong candidate. In the old system, the votes also have to be counted by humans and sometimes there could happen some horrible mistakes, so you need to start a recount or in extrem cases a revote. 
All in all both springs missagreeing in some points: The text says that old people can't read the old voting sheets anymore but the speech says that they don't know how to use a computer. An other argument of the text is that human need to count the votes and they can make mistakes but the speech says that the programmes are made by human and there can also be mistakes. The votes are also not quite often so it shouldn't be a problem for the people to count votes sometimes. The text says that the old system isn't safe anymore and it can get manipulated easiely, but the speech said that programmes can get hacked so they are manipulated too.
