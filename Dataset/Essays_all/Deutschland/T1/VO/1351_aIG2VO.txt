In the following i will write a essay about "Voting"
Today we elect f.e. the US president about the computer because a computer is faster by counting the votes, easy to understand the system and for people who can not good see with there eyes. But computers arent good for people who dont have one. So they dont understand the system and they can mark the wrong president candidate. But when we dont have computers which count the votes, so it have to do a person. And it can happen that people miscounts and then they release  wrong datas. People ar slowly by counting the votes as computer. The computers are easy to use  f.e. the touch-screen technology. the text say that its easy to use a computer but in the outher version they said that its dificult to use a computer because not every one have an computer theny they cant use a computer and so the can mark the wrong name.
