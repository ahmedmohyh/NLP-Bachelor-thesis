In the written text stand that the traditinol voting makes many mistakes. So one example is that people with poor eyesights can vote for the wrong candidate because they mark the wrong name. With computerized voting this can´t happen because you can easier find the name of the candidate for who you would vote and when you tap on the name you mark it. Also the written text says that the computer technology is used every day for example by banking transactions.
In spoken text you hear the other side. The woman who spoke agree that peolpe make mistakes by traditinoal voting but she also says that it´s only easy for people who used the computer to make the computerized voting because maybe the other don´t know what is to do.
She also says that humans make the computer sytstem for voting, so they can also make mistakes with the programm, so this could be a bigger mistake than mark the wrong name. At the end she says nearly that you can´t see the banking systems and the voting systems at ones because the banking is used every day and the votings only every two years.

The different between the both ´texts´is that the first in written form is only for computerized voting and the second one which is in speaking says that both make mistakes but laso that the traditional voting is the better one.
