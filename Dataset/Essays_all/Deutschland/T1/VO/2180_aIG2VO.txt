The english presentation depicted the negativ arguments of a new computerized voting system in-depth.
One argument of the speaker was the the fact, that not everybody knows how to use a computer. Specially the older generation do not know how to work with a computer. In contrast to this the written text says that it is hard to find the right name on list of candidate for old people and with poor eyesight.
Aother argument for the new system is the huge quote of mistakes by counting the votes. It takes a long time and it is very easy to make a mistake. But on the computerized system one fault is bigger than with the old system and the system is made by humans so there could be an error.
Furthermore the process of the development for a working computer system is very long and takes a lot of time to be perfect. The written text says that everybody trust in computer technology like the banking transactions and the communication on the internet and that there is no reason to do not trust the computerized voting system.
