The previous lecture was about the downsides of computerized voting. 
One of the arguments was that computers are not easy to use for everyone. Some people are unfamiliar with computers, cannot afford computers and some might even not know how to use them. The text on the other side states that common ballots aren´t easy to use either. It sais that "people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name". so it looks like both systems have their flaws.
Another argument was that the computer system would be programmed by humans and if there was one tiny error in the system it could cause fatal voting results. However, the text says that computerized voting would make it easier to count the votes because nobody would have to deal with thousands of ballots. 
A third big point was that there would be no record of votes and if there was an error in the system it would be very hard to recount the votes. As bad as that sounds, the traditional system isn not great either. If there was a major mistake made, all of the ballots would have to be recounted and that would take a very long time.
In conclusion one could say that both voting systems have their little flaws and that it is not easy to decide which one is more efficient and better.
