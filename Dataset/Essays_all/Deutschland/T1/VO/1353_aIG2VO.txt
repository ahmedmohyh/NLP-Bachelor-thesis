Computerized voting is not that efficient and trustworthy as the critics of the current voting system always say. It may cause even more inaccuracy in the voting system. 
To use a computer is not that easy as people are always saying. Some people can not afford a computer and therefore do not have any experience of handling with it. Others could affort one but would not use them because they can not connect with all those new technical inventions. This could affect that those people would vote for the wrong candidate because of those arguments. It also may prevent some people of going vote because they are afraid to make mistakes at using the computer. And even if computers are used in our daily life for highly sensitive information, some people are not using it right now.
Another big deal is that every system has its mistakes and therefore computers are not excluded from this. An error in the voting program could lead to following situations: Every vote which was marked with the program could be removed by an error. The whole election has to be started again, what would cause high costs. Also it is possible that an error could vote the wrong candidate even if the voter marked the right candidate. The progam then would manipulate the voting In conclusion this would have the same inaccurancy as the current voting system.
The last point against the coputerized voting is that it would take verly long time to establish the new voting system. At first there will be many errors and mistakes in the system that all have to be corrected. This needs time. And because elections are only every two years in the United States dominant errors are only detected very slow.
