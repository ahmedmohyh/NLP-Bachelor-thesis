In the presentation showen before the women said that a computer election would be much riskier than a normal, "old", election. In a normal election with making a cross on a piece of paper and let the votes count by people, the people may miss one, two maybe ten votes, but that is normal because human are making mistakes. But if the election is made by computer the risk of votes not counting is much higher. With an error in the system their can a miss-counting with thousands of votes and not only two. In addition not everyone can afford a computer and / or knows how to handle it and makes the cross at wrong candiate or party. And that is what the text showen above is criticising about the current voting systems. It says that a computer election would be easier because of the touch screen. Obviously a wrong vote is with that nearly impossible. And in addition a error is removed by computer sytems and as the text says not possible. 
These two points, error and voting mistakes are the points where the speech and the text are different. The text says it's easy to vote, but the speech says many people can not afford and handle a computer. The text says a error is impossible, but the speech the risk is even higher because an computer would be more heavy. So the meanings on this topic are as showen very differnet.
