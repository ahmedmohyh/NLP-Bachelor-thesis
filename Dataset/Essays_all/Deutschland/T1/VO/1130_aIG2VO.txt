The following text is an essay which compares the text above, and a presentation I just heard. Both talk about the voting system in the US, and about the question if it is smart to change it. The problem both sources are arguing about, is the question if the counting of the votes should be changed from counting by hand to beeing counted by an computer. And if it is easier for the general population to vote on a computer, or on a traditional ballot.
The text say´s that a lot people make the cross accidently by the wrong candidate, if they vote on a ballot. The answer is technology, because the canditates can be better showen, and it is easier to just tab on them. Another problem that is adressed, is the problem that the officials which count the votes make mistakes, and that the elections get influenced by that. The answer for this problem is again the technology, because computers make, as the text say´s, no mistakes. An good example is the technology used for banking, and communication systems.
The presentation opposes the arguments from the text. It said that it won´t be easier for the people to handle the computers, because not everybody uses computers or one one. That leads to the fact that not everyone has the same practice with computers ,a nd not everbody can handle them.
Another counter argument is that computers are programmed by humans, and so there can be mitakes in the programming. That means if a computers makes a mistake, because of the wrong programming, all the votes would be lost. And the election would be wrong too.
