The first text is about the traditional voting in the United States, these votings are inefficient and also lead to the inaccurate voting systems.The text says that it is very hard to vote, because the piece of paper is very small, and with many names, so it isn´t easy to take the right mark. Furthermore the people who helps with the votes, they have to count up the votes one by one. Nowadays there is a new touchscreen, but often it could be that the people touch the wrong point of the screen so they vote  for the wrong candidate. But the text also says that it isn´t able to make mistakes, because every error has a long and expensive recount to take place. 

But on the audio they said that the humans often make mistakes, so they wrote the wrong person. The audio is also about the theme that normal humans make mistakes. But they also critices the computer system, because they need to improve. The computer aren´t often used just every two years but not often, so they have much mistakes, which aren´t improved. 

Both texts are about the voting in the United States, but the first text  says that the new voting systems on the computer are good, and there are no mistakes, but the audio says that there are many problems, which aren´t improved.
