The presentation is about the voting system in the United States and that the system should stay in his old way and should not be computerized. The presentator said that the computerized systems should be easy but they aren´t. They are only easy for people which can handle with the computer. He told us about the fear of the technology. The presentator said that to count up the votes one by one ofcourse isn´t 100% safety and there could be someone who won´t count 5 or 6 votes but a computer could easily delete thousands of votes by having a error or something else.

The text is about that the voting system should be computerized and that it should be easier to vote. Especially for people with poor eyesight, who can easily mark the wrong name on the old system ballot. They also say in the text that the computerized system is with a touch screen. So the argument " It´s very difficult to handle a computer" is very senseless now.
