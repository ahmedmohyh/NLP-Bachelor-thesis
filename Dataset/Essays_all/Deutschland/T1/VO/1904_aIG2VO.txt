In the now following essay I am going to compare the speech I just heard with a text I read before.
The current election system is criticized of not being efficient. In the extract of the text they wanted to have a computerized voting system. They argue that humans make mistakes when they count the votes by hand. This is probably true, if they have to count for hours. But the speaker says computers are made by humans so there might be mistakes in it, because a developer created it like this. When there are mistakes and votes are not counted correctly it is not possible to recount them. However when a human is counting the votes, he can just recount them when there is a fault in it. 
Another point I heard in the speech is, that some people do not use computers very often and if they then have to count with a computerized system, they are not familar with, there could be problems. But the text argues, that when people vote traditionally, there is such a big amount of candidates that they also vote for the wrong . It is also very hard to establish a functional system, which do not have mistakes, because elections are very few so problems could not be fixed fastly.
