The critics say that they will not have any problem on the the coumputerized voting system because they can choose the name easily by touching the display and the names are bigger.
It is written that we should give it a try because computerized programs are used nationwide and the banking transactions are already computerized.

The oral text is against the computerized voting system.
The woman says that the new voting system is not going to make it any better.
The computer program is designed by humans and if humans do mistakes while counting ballots, why should they not do them when they are designing the computer program. If their is a mistake in the computerized voting system it will cause much more trouble because the whole voting will be wrong and this could be big disaster.
The woman is telling us that the system has to be perfect and you will only reach this if you improve it every year.
