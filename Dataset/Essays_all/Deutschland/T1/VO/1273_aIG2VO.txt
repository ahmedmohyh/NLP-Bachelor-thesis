Many critics of the currrent voting systems say, that the traditional voting system should be replaced with computerized voting systems for different reasons.
They say, that it is safer to vote for the person the voters intend to vote because in the current voting system the ballot is very small. This problem does not appear in the computerized voting machines. The critics also say, that the people who count the votes can easily make mistakes and if that happens, they have to recount all votes. The computerized system should be safer. The critics also say, that people should trust the technology because they do it also every day in banking transactions and other things.
The people who are against the new voting system say, that the argument, that humans can make mistakes, is not a good one because humans make the computers and that they also could do a mistake when they build them. If there is a mistake, this error is worser than a mistake in the current voting system, because they have to repeat the whole election. The critics of the current voting system say, that this is not the case and that the current voting system is safer.  As well the computer record is impossible and that it is easier with the current voting system.
