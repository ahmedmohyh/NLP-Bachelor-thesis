In the presentation the speaker was talking about a new voting system with a computer. He is against it and explains it with the following statements. Computer may be good for our young generation, because they are used to them. But the speaker said, we also have to think about the older generation, who might have no computer at home or aren't used to the whole new technology. They might get "fear" and be so confused, that they won't go voting. On the other hand the author from the text above says, that it would be easier for the old people to see the candidates on a computer screen, as on a long ballot sheet. 
Another point from the speaker is, that computer programs still make mistakes, because they are programmed of humans and and it is humanely that a human makes mistakes. That is also the opinion from the author. Humans can make mistakes, but they probably do much more then a computer system. It is also a really hard work to count up over thousand votes one by one only by hand.
 At the end the author gives his conclusion, that a try should be worth it and other companies and entrepeurneurships trust in the computer system too, like banks, who are counting their finances with it. So why the goverment is trusting the computer system in this fincial thing and not also in the voting things. Because both contain highly sensitive information.
