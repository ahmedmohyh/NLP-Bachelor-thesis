The text and the presentation were about a computerized voting system in the United States. The text says people possibly vote the wrong person caused by the ballot on which too much information ia written to small on a large sheet of paper. A computer could change the size of the words and you would only have to click on it. But there are many people who are not used to computers and do not work with them so they get in trouble with using voting systems. That could lead to less voters or mistakes during the election. 
Another problem with traditional voting is said to be the counting of votes. Humans that count thousands of ballots are making mistakes. It is not possible to defend them because we are just humans. If the voting was computerized, the counting would be done by computers so the possibility of a miscount is much lower. Otherwise, computers are human made which means they can also make mistakes. Thinking about a computer error in relation to a human error who only misses maybe 100 ballots, the damage of a computer error is much greater. It could be that he miscounts thousands of ballots or misses another thousand. 
The argument that we also trust computers as we do our banking transactions with them or communicate with it is easily rejected by the presentation. It says, the daily use of computers in communication or banking was improved over years. That was possible because many people are using it very often but in the beginning there were also many mistakes in these systems. A computerized voting that only takes place twice a year would need too much time for improvement and it would not be trustworthy the first ten years.
