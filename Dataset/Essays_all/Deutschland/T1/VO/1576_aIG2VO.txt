The text as the audio dealt with the topic of voting systems in the USA . The audio seems to be against a computerized voting system . They believe that this would only work for people who are used to dealing with a computer . Others who perhaps can not afford one or just don´t know how to deal with a computer as the older generation would probably do have no chance to take part in the voting process at all . And that would be a shame because we can not just refuse such a huge part of our society the right to vote . Also the point that humans would make mistakes counting the votes does not seem to impress the people heart in the audio . They believe that it would be even more dangerous to let a computer make the counts because they are made by humans and a technical error would be even more harmfull to the whole process . All in all they are convinced that a computerized voting system can not be fully trusted . The text in comparison is of a totally different opppinion . They say that the voting systems lead by humans are not efficient at all . Humans easily miscount they say . Their voting system should be replaced by a technical systems , means that a computer should count the votings of an election . That would also decrease the risk of voting fot the wrong candidat by accident . This usually happens when you are asked to tick a small box on a sheet of paper with the names of the candidats on . The author of the text has more trust in todays technic than in human beings .
