The woman explained how the tradionatiol voting system is better than the newer and apparent safer one with computers. Her first argument is that still many people are not used to computers and will accidentally vote for the wrong person or not got vote at all because they are scared of them. The text opposes this by stating how the computers are very easy to use and can even magnify names making it almost impossible to vote for the wrong person while the tradional sheets are very large and even complicated. The woman's other argument is that computers and the programs are too risky and can lead to fatal mistakes like missing votes which can be avoided by humans by simply recounting. While the text says that we use computers daily for everything and even our banking the woman uses exactly that as an argument against them. She says that programs have to be tested and improved which is easy for those being used every day but very hard when it is only used once or twice a year.
