The question in the text and in the audio is if voting should be digitalised. In the audio it is questioned if everyone can vote digitally without accidentally voting for a different canditate because people who aren't using computers in their daily life might have problems. In the text is exactly the same argument used but the other way around. People who have problems with watching for example some old people could cross on a piece of paper accidently the wrong name.

In the audio it was said that a digitally voting system would be problamatic because of errors in the programming. This could lead too wrong results of the election because one error affects a lot of votes. In the text it is said that computers don't commit errors if they count the ballots which would be better than if humans count the ballots. If there is an error because of miscounting of a human the recounting costs a lot. In the audio is argued that it is better if you can recount than if it is because of the complicated computer programming impossible to count the ballots again.
In the text it is said that we trust digital systems even for banking and it is asked why we shouln't trust technology for voting. On the other side in the audio is said that the system for banking had to be improved over years and is used daily. The voting system would be used a lot less. Also it is questionable if it woold work at the beginning really without any errors.
