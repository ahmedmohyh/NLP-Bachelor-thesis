The topic "Voting" is a high discussed thing and experts are trying to make it as easy as possible for everyone. So they came up with the idea to computerize the voting progress. 

The reason they even thought about changing the paper to computer screens is that a lot of people have problems to read what is written on the paper. Difficulties like that can easily lead to voting for the wrong candidate. Also there is a huge amount of those voting sheets and they all have to be counted by mans hand which takes a lot of time and effort and as soon the human being has it´s defects there an easy chance for the result to be wrong. 
This is also one the main reasons why some people think compters are the solution. Since they think computers are unmissable in what they are doing the voting will become accurate again and the time problem is basically gone. But first there has to be a software for this voting progress and as all softwares there will be problems at the beginning so thousands of votes won´t be count and this is a drastic influence one the results. It takes it´s time to envelope the program and it might be even useless because the elections are pretty rare.  Also experts say that might bring fewer voters with it because espacially older voters who aren´t used to work with a computer on a daily basis are even more afraid to vote for the wrong person. So the main goal is it to get as many people as possible out to vote and with what strategy they will reach this goal is still to be discussed.
