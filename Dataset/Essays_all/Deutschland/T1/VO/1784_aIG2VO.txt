The american voting system is a very difficult topic, about which it is argued a lot. Critics say, that it is inefficient and could lead to mistakes based on counting the votes, since they are counted one by one by officials. Computerized systems would ensure that human mistakes would not happen anymore and the counting would be fast and automatically done by computers. Also it is said that many people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate, because they are confused with all the names on the ballot and cannot see their candidate. But voting on a screen is not necessarily easier than voting on a paper. There are still as many names on the list and elders might not be able to handle computers because they are simply not used to them. Also many people cannot afford a computer and might be inexperienced with them. The risk that their right to vote is taken away because of this is too high. Also the computer programms are programmed by humans, so there is no guarantee that there will be no mistakes at all. And while a human counting mistake can be undone easily with a recount, it is impossible to recount the votes on a computer, since all the information is deleted. So there could be an error causing thousands of votes to get lost. The speaker also said that no programm they are using in finances was perfect from the beginning, they had to be improved by time. The votings only happen every fourth year, so the votings are way too rare for the system to be checked and improved. The speaker was not pleased with the idea of computerized votes and prefers the traditional way of voting.
