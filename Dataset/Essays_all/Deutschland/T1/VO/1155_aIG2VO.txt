The Talk is about voting. It discuss if voting about the computer is better than traditional voting. 
The first argument against computer voting is that computers have and make mistakes. Also humans make mistakes, but the mistake of a computer are worst. It could change the completly voting ends. Humans mistake would only be that they have counted wrong so that one or two votes are not correct. 
And also a problem about computer voting is that there are a lot of people, specially old people, who have never learnd to work with an computer. So that they can't handle with that, what can follow that they don't vote anymore. 
The text about the tranditional voting says that people can do a lot of more mistakes. For example that they vote for the wrong candidate. It's because they have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper with lots of names. People who have a poor eyesight can fastly mark the wrong name. 
The text says also that computerized voting machines aren't complicated. Opposited, the computers have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology what is simple to understand, you have to touch the candidate's name on the screen to record the vote for the special candidate.
And also that human mistakes are better than computer mistakes is wrong. It needs a long and expensive recount. In contrast mistakes by the computerized systems  are human errors so that the vote counting is done quickly and automatically by the computers.
