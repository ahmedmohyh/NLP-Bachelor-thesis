The speech I heard is about the advantages and disadvantages of help from electronical devices like computers for the elections, with focus on the disadvantages. The speaker tells us about the plans of some people to change from a physical voting system to a computer voting system, so the humans can not make any mistakes when they for example miscount the votes, but he tells us also that the computers are programmed by humans and that our trust is wrong here, because computers can cause a lot more damage by deleting thousands of votes at once. The systems we rely on daily are tested more often and for these improvements the elections are not often enough. On the opposite of this is the opinion from the critics in the text. They say it is more easy to vote with a computer, espescially for people with poor eyesight. The speaker has got a point for that, too, because he mentions the problem that some people might not be able to use computers or cannot afford them. As a conclusion one can say that there are probably some pros and cons for both sides and that computers will take over the power in the future no matter what.
