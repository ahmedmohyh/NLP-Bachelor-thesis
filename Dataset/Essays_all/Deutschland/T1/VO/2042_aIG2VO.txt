There are people who critizice the current voting system because of its inefficiency and the human errors which include miscounts or marking the wrong candidate and want to introduce a computerized voting to improve the voting system. But this computerized system has itsb faults and difficulties too: one problem ist that some voters, especially older people, aren't used to computers and so this new system wouldn't be an easier option for them. Maybe they can't handle this new system and accidentely vote for the wrong candidate too like in the traditional voting system. Another point ist that there are not only human errors but computer errors too. Computers are made by humans and if humans program the computers wrong, it's a much bigger problem than the case that only one human miscounts a vote, because the computer will continue to make the same fault because it is a totally wrong programmed system. and the whole election is not accurate, but people usually only miscount a few votes. That means that computers are not reliable either and it might be better to not change the current traditional voting.
