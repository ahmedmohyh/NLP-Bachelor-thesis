In the following essay I'm going to compare the text and the heard presentation regarding the content. 
First of all I can say, the first conclusion saying that the current voting system leads to mistakes made by the people counting the votes is the same both in the text and in the presentation.
But if you go further into both, there are some different opinions. The text says that it's easy for everyone to vote for their candidate because they just need to touch the name on the screen. It also says that if an error is made, it's very much work to do to fix that issue with the old voting system, compared to that the electronical one is much more quick and safer.
That is a direct contrast to the oral presentation, where it says that computers only do what their developer told it to. 
All in all you can say that the texts author wants to renew the old voting system because it's too easy that a human makes a mistake, and regarding to that the presentation says the old one is better because computers only make their developers mistakes.
