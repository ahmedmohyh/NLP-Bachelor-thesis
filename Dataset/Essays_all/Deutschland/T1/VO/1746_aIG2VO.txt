The Text and the presentation are both about the voting in the US.
The text say that many votes get lost or are miscounted because of errors and that there should be a computer system that is able the count the votes without and mistakes and missvotes. The woman in the presentation is against this method. She thinks that the human error could appear in the progam as well because it is programmened by humans. That means that one single error could ruin the complete election.
The next point in the text is that the people often accidently vote for the wrong person, that is cause by the fact that old people often have a bad eye sight and can't see who the vote for because the writing on the voting papers is really small. A cure for that problem would again be a computer program that makes it easier for the voters. They would be able to zoom in in the screens to see who they are actually voting for, so they don't vote for the wrong person. The woman in the presentation says that this could cause some problems as well. Because mostly the elderly people have a bad eye sight and would have a problem with the technology because they don't know much about it and would need help so somebody would explain to them how it works.
