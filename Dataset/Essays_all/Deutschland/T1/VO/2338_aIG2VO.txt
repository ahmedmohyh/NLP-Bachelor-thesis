The referent takes position against the text. She said that a problem with a computer voting system would be that only people who have a computer can vote and people who do not know how to use computers can easily make mistakes. And about the argument from the text that computers would not do any mistakes like humans while counting votes she said that the computers are programmed by humans so if they are wrong programmed there can be even much bigger counting mistakes. And beliving to the referent you can not compare voting programs with banking systems etc. because these systems are used everyday and are impoved every day while a voting program would only be used every two years.
