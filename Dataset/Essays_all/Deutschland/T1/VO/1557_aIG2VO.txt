There are two different voting options. The first one is to make a mark for the candidate who you want to vote on a big sheet of paper. And the second option is to vote with the computer.
Critcs say that there are too many mistakes of counting the votes, when the people votes on the ballot and the people vote too often the wrong candidate. If there is an error, the counting humans must recount all the votes and that will be expensive. The computer works much faster and it is very cheap. also it is an easy-to-use touch-screen technology. But the other argument is that the counting people also only humans and it is normal that they make sometimes a mistake. Also the computers can make mistakes too, because the humans make these systems on the computer. An other point for the ballots is that people who do not use the computer in their daily life can have problems to use the computers for voting.
