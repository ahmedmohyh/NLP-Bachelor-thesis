In the lecture, the arguments given in the text passage, were proven wrong or at least opposing arguments were given. The first argument of the text, that computerized voting would reduce the possibility of voting errors caused by bad eyesight or something similar, was neglected by saying that people without computer experience, who can´t afford a computer or just don´t want to use one, would either be confused by the technology and wouldn´t know how to vote, or would be prevented fromn voting because the are opposing the technology used in the process. The second argument, stating that computers would cut out human errors in the counting process, was proven wrong by saying that the computer programs used to count the votes in a computerized system, were written by humans and could so detain humman errors, too. Also these errors would be far more significant, as they could lead to major miscounts or votes not counted at all. For the last argumant, that we trust computers and technology in many other really important aspects of  our daily life, like bank transactions and important communication, the author of the lecture had an opposing argument saying that all the programs used in daily life are often and heavily used. These programs undoubtedly had errors in the beginning but because they are used on a daily basis, these errors were soon detected and the systems could be improved. Major votes, on the other hand, don´t happen that often, nationwide votes only once every two years and smaller votes in the different districts about twice a year. Since the computerized voting system would´t be used on a daily basis, it would take a long time to detect possible errors and it could cause a lot of damage before these errors can be detected.
