The thalk says at first that a computerized voting system is´t good for non computer users, so that tehy could easily fail the vote and vote something they didin´t wanted whisch is the same like in the other text with the traditional voting system. Another argument against the computerized voting system is that the computer could also make mistakes because eof wrong pograms, but if they make mistakes they could be much bigger than the mistakes the humans would make.The text says that the coumputer would be much faster than humans  wich makes them realy much better. The humans would make mistakes with one or two , but if the computer has a problem thousends of votes could get lost or to the wrong candidte. That computer are made by humans could also be a problem because the could be hacked or on other way manipulated.
