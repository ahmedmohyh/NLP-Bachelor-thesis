The text and the speaking informations are about voting. They have informations for the different voting types. In the text critics say that current voting systems used in the United States are inefficient. People can vote the wrong person because of their poor eyesight. 
The speaking information are about computers and that they can make voting more easily. But some people have problems with the computer voting.
Another point is that computers didn´t make false things but Computer were make by humans and humans does false things. If the human make one mistake, over 1000 voting informations were gone. The text says the computerized voting machines have an easy technology. For the Computer there are only positiv arguments, it says the computerized systems remove the possibility of human error but they didn´t. It can be a small mistake of a human and the computerized system has a big mistake. They must giving it a thought. All types of voting are risky. One more than another one.
