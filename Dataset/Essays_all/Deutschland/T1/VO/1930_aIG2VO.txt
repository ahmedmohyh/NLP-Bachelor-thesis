Both of the two souces are dealing with the theme "should we use computerized voting or traditional voting?".
The text says that computerized voting would be better than the traditional ballot voting. Ballots have to be counted out hand by hand, and this is a heavy work, because there're thousands of ballots. In addiction to that, the people who count out the votes can make many mistakes and a recound would be neccesary. 
It is easy to make a wrong vote, because the marks on the ballot can be placed next to the wrong name, as the names are marked very small. The text says that a computerized voting system would be faster, uncomplicated and trustfully. 
The other scource disagrees in this point. Computerized voting would be faster and uncomlicated, but first of all, you have to trust this system. The votes aren't count out by people, but by a computer. People wouldn't trust a computer, it could be programmed wrong. 
Many old people would have many problems, too. They aren't used to computers and so its hard for them to trust a computer, it is said.
