The woman in the speech has a totally different opinion on computerized voting systems than the writer of the text. While the text says that computer technology would be a great help for counting votes since it is a lot faster, the speech says that computer programs can make huge mistakes because they are programmed by people. Thousands of votes may be forgotten or miscounted while a person counting the votes would'nt make more than a few little mistakes that would'nt change the result. It also reads in the text that computers would have advantages for people with poor eyesight, but otherwise some people never get in contact with computers and they don't know how to handle this modern system. Some people, especially the older generation have fear of technology and doing something wrong with it.There can be no trust in computer technologies, voting finds place only like once in a year for example and then it is doubtful that computerized systems can help. Manual voting and voting with a touchscreen can't be compared. Since computer systems are able to make huge miscountings way worse than a person counting votes would do, this alternative isn't trustful at all.
