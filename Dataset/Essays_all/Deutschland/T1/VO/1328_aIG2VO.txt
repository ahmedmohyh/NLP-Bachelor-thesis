In the passage it said, that the computurized voting system would not neccecarily be better than the traditional voting sytem and eliminate human error like it was said in the text. 

Computerized voting may seem easier for people who are used to technology but others may not know how to use these voting machines properly. This could then lead to the same problem mentioned in the text; people vote for the wrong candidate by accident. 

Another point mentioned in the passage was that the machine could result in a much bigger mistake then people missing a few ballots when counting them, as the computers are also programmed by humans and could have errors which can result in misscounts or even deleted votes. A recount would be impossible in that case. The voting process would have to be started again which would take a lot of time.

Lastly, the passage mentioned the importance of the voting technology working on first try. Other technologies used for banking or communication has been tested many times and has also been improved a lot. The voting technology could have errors which will only become visible during or after the voting process, which would be catastrophic.
