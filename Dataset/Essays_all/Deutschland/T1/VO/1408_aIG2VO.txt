In the following paragraphs I am going to summarize the arguments of the presentation. 
The presentation and the text are about voting. In the presentation there were mentioned some arguments against the voting with help of computers. It is more riskful when computers count the votes compared to when humans count the votes. When humans count the votes it can be possible that they forget one ballot or that they make some other type of error. In the worst case they have to count all the ballots again from the beginning. But if computers make an error it is even worst because they can't detect errors and if they do a mistake it could be possible that they don't miss one ballot, like it happens when humans count the votes, it is likely that they miss even thousand votes or more. Voting is just once every few years so it is important that the results are correct. Computers aren't developped enough so that they do any mistake. 

In contrast to the presentation the text arguments for a voting with computerized voting machines, so that the voting results are right. It is easier to see the candidates name on the screen of the computer than to search the candidates name on the long paper sheet. For people who have problems with their eyes or an eye sickness it is hard to find the candidate they want to vote. On the computer it is much easier, because it is easier to find the name. In contrast to the presentation the text arguments that computers don't make mistakes and humans do.
