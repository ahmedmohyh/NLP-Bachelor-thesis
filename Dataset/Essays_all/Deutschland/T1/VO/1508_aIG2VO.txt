The alternative to the traditional voting system, a computerbased one, can probably minimize human error during counting. The inaccurate one-by-one counting could be computerized, but what if the human error, we try to avoid, is implemented there too? If the program is defect, the computerized voting symstem could have an even bigger error than the human counting would. On one hand computerized counting would be faster and safer - if the program works - but on the other hand - if there is an error - it is impossible to recount with a coputerbased system. 
It can be risky to implement such a system nationwide, but people trust in them daily for banking and sensitive communication. But the point is, that they trust in them "daily". All these systems are used daily, not only once or twice in a year. Online banking and communication systems were not reliable in the beginning and needed to be improved step by step until they became as reliable as they are today. It could be a problem to do this with voting systems, because no one knows how fatal the errors during these elections could be.
In addition it can be easier for people with eyeside problems to vote on a computerized system. They cannot accidently cast a wrong vote because the candidates name is printed too small. But most people with bad eyesight are older. These people are not used to work with computers, no one can guarentee that they are able to use this computerized voting system without help.
