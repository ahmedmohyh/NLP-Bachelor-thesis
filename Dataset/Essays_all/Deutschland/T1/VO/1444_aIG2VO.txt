"Voting"

There are many issues with computers beeing used for elections. First of all not everyone is used to computers or the "new technology" in general. This offeres a high risk of wrong casted votes or even not voting at all, which could be related to a fear of technology. But the computers would make the whole process of voting a lot easier. The most commen mistake is voting for a wrong person, because the list is that small, that the voters can't see who they are voting for. Another mistake which could be improved on is the counting of the votes. Many votes can be misscounted whch relates into a difficult process of recounting the votes. So the most mistakes are made by humans and have nothing to do with the votingsystem. 
But the computers have issues aswell. Computers are also only programmed by humans  and a mistake made by a computer can result into thousands and thousands of misscounted votes and even in vanishing of many important votes.This would be even worse than misscounting maybe a few votes The new technology takes time, routine and daily usage  to work propperly. And this daily usage isn't given in a election which only happens once every two years or maybe twice each year in different countries for example locals votes. Computers are just too dangerous to use in such an import process. You should rely on the humans and on the system which has worked many many years before, computers are no better than the current system.
