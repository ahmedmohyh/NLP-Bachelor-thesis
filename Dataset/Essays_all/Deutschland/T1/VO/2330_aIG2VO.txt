There are problems with a compuerised counting systems.
Voters that have difficulties using a computer could potentially vote for the wrong candidate just as voters with poor eyesight could voting on paper.
Compters that count the votes are programmed by humans, and humans make mistakes.
A mistake made by a Official will result in a couple of wrong votes.
A mistake in a computer programm will likely result in thousands of wrong or lost votes.
While some computersised systems are safe, they needed a long time and constant use to be improved to that point.
Computerised systems for voting on the over hand would only be used once every couple years and errors could slip throu unnoticed for a long time.
Information can also be lost far more easy than physical sheets of paper.
