The speech I´ve just heard was about the same topic as the text, but with a different opinion on that. The text wanted to show us the advantages of computerized voting, concentrated on the U.S.A., and wondered about the government using the same technology for other sensetive and may secret things like communication or banking, but the government complaining about using these technologies for voting in the future. The speech showed us that on the other hand human mistakes can´t be provided. In fact, it´s a bigger issue to miscalculate just some votes, than producing huge numbers of miscounts by programmingmistakes and other errors that have a bigger influence on the vote. The question is if the people who are trying to make the voting system more accurate, want to risk those major difficulty just to incrase the reading and counting systems. Voting should be more time taken for. Its your decision in what hands you want to give your county to. Readingmistakes wouldn´t happen if you would take time and just be more concentrated, and counting should be an easy thing even if you have to handle with big numbers. So its thot worth the high costs at all
