The text says that the traditional votes are inefficient and there is a inaccurate counting of votes. So they want to have a computerized voting system. This would be easier for the people with poor eyesight because the names on the large sheet are too small and you can easily put your mark to the wrong name. In the speech they say that this computerized voting would be easier only for people with knowledge about computers. And there are people which are scared of technology. And the mistakes of counting could also be a problem with the computerized system because computers are programmed by people.
In the text they also say that we are using computer systems every day and they work perfect accurate in banking transactions or in the communication of sensitive information. So they want to install a computerized voting system to remove the human error in the counting of the votes. The speaker said that such an error could be on the computerized system too. And if there would be such an error everything would be gone, this would be much more expensive than a long recount.
