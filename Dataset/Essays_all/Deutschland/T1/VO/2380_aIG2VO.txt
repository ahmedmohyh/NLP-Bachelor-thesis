The text and the audio deals with the problem in the voting system of the United States.   
The audio has disadvantages of computer programs. Not all people in america have computers. These people have, evedently, a big disadvantage and must buy computers if they want to vote. Otherwise the text says it is inefficient to vote on paper. Fot exsample, people with poor eyesights can mark the wrong name.
Another argument of the audio is that people have also doubt and fear of technology. Programs are just made by humans, so the programs are also able to make mistakes in voting which is even worse. This kind of errors are more serious, for exsample if votes are removed it is impossible to recount them. But a point from the text is that people can make mistakes, so the counting must be done again. Computer programs could remove the possible error. Also a lot of time is needed to count every vote. The counting would be quicker with machines .
