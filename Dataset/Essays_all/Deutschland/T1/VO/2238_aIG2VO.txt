Voting 
The Text shows that the Voting system in the United States has many critics because the names on the paper are often written very smal and so many people may have problems by reading the the letters and so they maybe choose the wronge name, this problem is not given, if the people do not have to vote on a sheet of paper, but with a computer system. 
Also the way to count the votes is much easier if the US would allowed to vote with a computersystem because today the votes has to be count by humans and humans makes mistakes. But in the listining pard is the fact given, that also with computersystems there are maybe problems because no system makes no mistakes from the beginning. The systems have to be checked and correct. And this ist a second problem because the votes in the United Stades are all two years and so there are maybe many problems  over many years. 
In the presentation is also mentioned that maybe many people do not have problem in using computers because many people use them everyday but there are also peoble who have no experiance in using computers.
