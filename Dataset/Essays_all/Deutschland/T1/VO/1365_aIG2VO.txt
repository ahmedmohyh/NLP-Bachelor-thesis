The voting system of the United States is often critized for beeing too inefficent and often leads to inaccuracies. Therefore many people say it should be replaced by a computerised voting system. But despite all the flaws of a computerised voting system there are also very huge drawbacks. Voting on a computer seems to be very easy for most inhabitants of the United States although it is not that easy for everybody. There are people who are not used to computers, who can not afford one or simply do not want one. For them it is as easy to vote for the wrong candidate as it is for other people to do that on an election paper. The criticism on the actual voting system names the errors in counting the votes by hand as one major reason for the inaccuracy. Nevertheless computers make mistakes too. They are programmed by people and people make mistakes. In fact the mistakes a computer does would have a way too big influence on the election because of the hundreds or even thousands of votes that get lost while handcounted votes get lost by single numbers. A new system would bring many difficulties are there is no safety that a computerisd system would work out that much better than the actual one or even better.
