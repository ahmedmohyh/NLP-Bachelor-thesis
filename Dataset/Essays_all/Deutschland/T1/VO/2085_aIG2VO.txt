The right to vote is the base of every democratic state. The improvements of technology offer the opportunity to use elctronic mediums to vote, but is a computer trustfull enough to have the power over all our votes? Or is it safer to rely on the traditional voting by hand?

On the first sight voting by a computer seems much better than dealing with the troubles of doing it by hand. The chance to give your vote to the wrong candidate because of too small letters is minimized by computers and there won´t be any wrong countings by man. But what happens if a computer has an error? There won´t be just a minority of wrong counted votes, there will be huge mistakes, lost votes, anything you can imagine because if a computer gets something wrong it will probably get everything wrong.
This problem is mainly caused of the lack of using a voting programm. There are other programms that are used daily so it´s clear that there are improvements every now and then. But if you don´t use a programm very often it´s much harder to find the errors in it and erase tehm. One of the best examples for such a programm is  a voting programm. 
Another big problem is that everybody has the ability to write but there are of course people who either can´t afford computers or who can´t work with computers. Especially elder people will have major problems with using electronic things to vote.
So of course the computer voting is a chsnce and something good but it´s important to remember that it´s not automatically better than the traditional voting and that there are still improvements to be done to ensure comnputer voting as a save way to elect.
