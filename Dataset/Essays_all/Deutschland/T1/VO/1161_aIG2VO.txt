The woman talks in her speech about the problems with the voting system and that it is a big question whether to improve the system and put it on a technical 
basis or leave it the old fashioned way. She mentioned that voting is not that often, in the USA even just one time a year, so in her opinion is that it is worth the effort which is needed to put in with counting the votes one by one. She did not seem to be a big supporter of the technical way of doing the whole thing and her trust in the technology does not seem to be that big. 
That is the biggest contrast to the text. The author of the text talks about how great it would be if the voting would be handled with technology. It was mentioned that the "old" voting system leads to inaccurate votes, because it includes disadvantages for, for instance older people, who are not able to see and read the ballots correctly, so they maybe mark the wrong name and as a consequence of that vote for the wrong candidate. 
The text talks about people trusting the technology everyday in their normal life and in their jobs, so it should not be a problem to trust the technology in politican questions. 
The woman has a different opinion and wants to keep the old way of voting and would rather put work, time and effort in handling this whole thing without the technology, than to do it the way the author of the text wants it do to. The author of the text supports the statement that people can make mistakes with counting the votes, but the woman does not have such a trust in the technology to think that it will not make mistakes aswell.
