In the presentation an argument was that voting on a computer is just easier for the younger generation, because they are work almost everyday on a computer, and in the text is said that peolpe with poor eyesight could easier vote on an computer. Another point from the speech was that computers also make mistakes while they are counting the votes, a computer could have an error or could be hacked, and in the text is just said that when people count it take much time and its inevitable that they will make mistakes while they are counting, but in the presenation is said that you have bigger problems when the computerized voting system has an error. And computers are made by person and if person could do mistakes while counting a system made by person could also make mistakes. Another point that the women said was that you can`t completly trust computers, but in the text is said that we criticers should give complicated voting systems a thought, because goverment trust other complex computer technology every day. Also in the presentation was said that also person could mark the wrong name on a touch-screen, so its not like they said in the text, ther they said thats its much more easier.
