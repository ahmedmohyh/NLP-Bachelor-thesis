Voting today can make a huge difference, so it's important that every vote is counted correctly. The technique that is used today is counted by humans and is being used for centuries, so why change it to computers? Especially people who don't have or can't afford computers at home may have problems handling them and they could vote for a wrong person. Also these programms are made by people who could make mistakes, these mistakes could ruin a whole day of voting. Another complication could be, that the votes are being deleted by the programm and everyone would have to vote again. On the other handside critics, like in the text say, that people could make mistakes while they are counting. For example they could skip votes or could manipulate the ballots. But the voting by computer could make a huge difference for people with bad eye sight, who have problems reading, then the ballot is full of names, which are written small. The computer could also help by marking the right candidate because it has a simple touchscreen wer you can magnify vor a better view. 

All in all it is to say that these two sides are against each other. The text talks about how computers could help by voting and how counting is inefficient and how it could make it more precise and the speech is about how the computer programs may also be the wrong system for voting.
