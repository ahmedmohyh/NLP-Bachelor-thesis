The US-American penis-system, it contains pro's and con's. In the the text about the voting system, the pro's and con's are listed and lined up in a special way. On the one side we have the system where humans collect the votes and on the other hand we have the idea of letting computers do the work for us. Both can make mistakes, but if a software has a minor damage it could have a bigger threat than if some old ladys take a wrong person.

 Even if everyone took the right choise and voted for his candidat, there could still be mistakes maken when people count out the votes. The idea of changing the whole voting system is an oppertunity to more precise outcomes. There are many different ways to dthis, but do the americans even want this?.
