In the following text i will summerize the two lectures to viting systems in the USA.
The current system is that voters have to search their candidate on a large list with many names. It called the ballot. But so people can vote for the wrong candidate if they have poor eyesight. Even during counting the votes it can be that miscounts damaging closely contest. But a recount would be very expensive and take a long time with it. So why don't they use computer based voting systems when these are used in everyday situations. The programms are easy-to-use and so every person can vote. But some people have a fear of technology because they don't know how to use the computers. Furthermore the programms are also written by humans so there could be also mistakes in the programms. But in programms we can't make a recount and so a miscount would destroy the vote that is only every two years.
