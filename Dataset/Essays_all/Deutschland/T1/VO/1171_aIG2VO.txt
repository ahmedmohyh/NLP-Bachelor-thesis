The woman told me two important arguments mainly. first of all her opinion was that voting should not count by computers because of two main and understandebel arguments. Thirst she put the focus of her speech to the people who dont use a computer often as a result they would not be able to vote for their politician because of low computer knowledge. She said that the programm would be to big and to difficult to understand for beginners of usiong a computer. She also said that computer would can do misktakes so lots of votes their lost as a result the whole voting would be flase and have to astart again. The text of the titel "Voting" tells me that the computer programm would be aesy to understadn for every person an that it is equal if this person ist a beginner or a proffesional user of a computer beacuse of this special technology which is called "easy-to-use touch-screen. This technology allows you that you only have to touch the name of your politician that the vote can be count. The text also said that this programm is also used by lots of banks .
