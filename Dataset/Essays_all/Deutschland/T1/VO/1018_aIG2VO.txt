During the audio, the following arguments have been mentioned: 
Not every citizen of the US is used to deal with computers every day, so it might be very hard for some people to use a computerized voting system.
Computers are also programmed by humans, it is possible that the computers make mistakes too, because of the people who programmed them.
If a computer makes a mistake, it is impossible to recount the Votes, because they never had a physicall existenz.
It would also be hard to develop a computerized voting system, because they only take place every few years, which makes it hard to correct potential mistakes.

Summed up the adio says, never change a running system. The voting system of the united states has always worked and the people are used to it. Everyone knows how to put a mark next to a name, but not every body knows how a computer works.
They also say that mistakes cannot be prevented but the "old" system at least leaves space for mistakes, the computerized system doesn´t, it is possible to recount the ballots. An argument of the text is, that people worldwide trust computers every day to be perfectly accurate and thats why they don´t understand why nobody wants to give the compuerized voting system a chance.
