The text describes how inefficien the voting system of america is. People in America want the traditional sysstem back. The want voting to be computerized. The text also gives infromation about the people voting false by accident. Reasons for this are for example that older people are more likely to vote false, because their eyes get weaker. Another view describes the people who are counting the votes. It´s a exhausting task and it`s possible to miscalculate there too.( Most of the time there aren´t even enough people to count those words). Otherwise same goes for the computeized system to the looking on the point of human mistakes. It´s programmed by people as well, so those systems can´t be flawless either. Another point of view is that some people are not used to computers. Especially the older generation may not even own a computer. The only type of people who could be loving the computer voting are the teenagers. It´s a modern way and surely a lot of teens will think of it as cool and hip. 

To come to a conclusion, both sides have their pros and cons but America hs to expand their field, to get more and more people to the elections. It´s a point of trust in human and technology.
