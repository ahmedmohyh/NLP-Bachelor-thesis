In the United States of America  are critics about the voiting systems. Some people want the traditional voiting systems replaced by a computer voiting system but for both systems are a lot of  advantages and disadvantages.
The tratidional voiting system can damage an election by miscouting the votes. They also lead the people to vote for the wrong candidate because there are many names on the voiting sheet, which leads them lose the overview. People want a computer voiting system because the technology doesn't make mistakes if they have to count the votes.
The computer voiting system has risk aswell because they are man made so it might be that humans made mistakes as they worked on the programm and if the programm has an error maybe the whole votes will be gone. The computer voiting system is also difficult to use for people who don't have a computer or don't use it everyday. An example are older people because the most of them hadn't any computers . People need time to get used to something so they need a while to get used to the system but an election isn't that often.
