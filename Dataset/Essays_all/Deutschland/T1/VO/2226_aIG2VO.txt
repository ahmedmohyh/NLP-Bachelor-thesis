The subject of votingtechnology is being heavily debated.The text extract reports about the opinion of the critics that go against the current system of the US.
Said critics think that a computerised voting system could improve the way vote drasticly, as many "human errors" can be prevented this way.One of the example they give is the possability of someone voting the wrong canditate becouse of the small letters on the votingsheet which may lead to a voter ticking the wrong box instead of the one they intented to.Another aspect the text brings up is the process of vote counting.The counting of votes would be too time consuming and too inaccurate if done by hand.They state that this can be improved by using a computer to sum up the votes insantly and accurately so we could have a cheaper and faster way.The last point they mention is the fact that we already use Computers for most of our day-to-day acitivities including money transactions and flow of sensitive data and tha we should atleast give it a try.
Contrary to that we heard a Presentation with an answer to that article.They say that the idea of an Computer eliminating wrong votes would be false becouse computers aren't accessable for everyone be it mentaly, that they dont want or know how to use a computer properly or be it Financialy, that they can't afford a computer.This way, they say, we could have way more human errors or even people to refuse the vote.Another thing they talk about is that computers aren't perfect either;A computer may have less garantied problems but if there would be one it could have a way bigger impact on the voting result and we also wouldnt notice it.Lastly they want to mention that the idea of "just trying it out" is too dangerous as ,while its true we use technology for important stuff already, we dont use it on a daily basis.The system would have too less time for improvent becouse its only used once a years or once all 4 years.
