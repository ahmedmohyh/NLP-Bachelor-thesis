The woman talked about the problems of electing by computers. She said that we shouldnt trust the computers because ife we elect by an computer it can maybe come an problem with the computer and many or maybe all votes will be deleted and the whole election will start from the begining. But in the text is said the oppsite of that what the women said. In the text is said if we vote without computers and we put our vote in a box it can be come the problem that the voters maybe voted for the wrong one.But if the vote system is by a computer it will be easier and better to vote because the voters just must click on a picture of the person that they want to elect and the person got than a vote from the  who was on the picture.In the text also is said that the person who are counting the votes maybe cant make an mistake and the whole vote system will than be failured because maybe the wrong person is elected or it gives two persons who have the same vote numbers and the whole election will be start from the begining.
