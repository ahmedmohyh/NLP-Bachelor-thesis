Voting with voting machines is a very complicated thing in the Us because votings are only every two years in the United states. There are different opportunities to vote. A very popular program is the "Computer Rise Voting". But it's a risky system because often there are mistakes and many people have problems with these voting machines. They don't know how to use it or having a fear of technolgy.  Sometimes there are also many mistakes oin the program and an error could make thousand of votes miscounted. 

The other text mentioned more about what critics said. That the system is unefficient and often someone votes the wrong canidate, because of poor eyesight. But in comparison to the sayings it is said that the voting machines system ist easily to understand and there are no problems but in real the system is risky. It isn't mentioned that there are usually so many mistakes in systems and that an error can miscount so many votes. Another point is the count of votings, the machines can do this on it's own and the votings musn'tz count one by one. critics want the tradiotional system but the voting machines are faster and easier to handle so it isn't clear why the want to have the old system again. In comparison with the other there are often wrong votes and many people have problems with the whole system. On the one hand there mark the wrong name or there are problems with the machines. Both of the systems are inefficient.
