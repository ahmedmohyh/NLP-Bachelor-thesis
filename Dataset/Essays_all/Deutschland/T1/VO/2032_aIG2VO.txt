The main problem of the question if the election should be voted through computers is that not all citizens are used to working with computers. They may have no idea how to use the technology or how to vote for their favorite candidate. The main statement in the text is that some voters have bad eye sight and can not properly vote because they maybe choose the wrong candidate by not seeing who they are voting for. Furthermore the technology is programmed by human and they can make mistakes just as human by counting the votes without the computers. It is more likely that human may make mistakes with voting but if something goes wrong with the computer technology it is possible that 1000 of votes are removed instead of just a few. A recount with computers is impossible because you can not do the election again and tell everyone to come and vote for the second time. It would cost massive time. A recount with counting the votes by human costs time as well but it is possible because you do still have the ballot.
