The text and the speach are about the voting in the United States of America. In the text is said that computerized votion system is better than the traditional one but the woman in the speach has another opinion of this topic.

In the traditional voting system where people have make a small mark next to the candidate's name, are often make mistakes especially in the counting of the votes. They have to deal with thousands of ballots nowadays so it could easily happen that mistakes are made. In this possible situation a long and expensive recount has to be done. With a computerized system this problem could be solved because the possibility of human error would be removed. In addition the counting of votes are done more quickliy. Another problem of the traditional system is that the voter especially if he or her has a poor eyesight could mark the wrong name and vote for a candidate he actually doesn't wantend to. 

The woman in the speach thinks a computerized system isn't better than the traditional voting system. In her opinion people who don't deal with computers daily, could vote for the wrong candidate because they don't know exactly how to handle the technology system. Another argument against the new system is that there also could be problems by counting the votes because computers are also programmed by humans and so the problem of human error wouldn't be removed. So it's important to don't make mistakes because there isn't an election every day. That's why all has to be done right from the beginning to the end.
