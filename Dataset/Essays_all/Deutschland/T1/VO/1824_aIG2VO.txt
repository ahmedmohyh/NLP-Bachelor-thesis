In the following text I will explain the problems of voting systems in the US. 
There are two ways of voting in the United States. First the traditional vote: the people are using a sheet of paper, called ballot, to give there vote. Problems at this way of voting are pretty big. People who critize the tradional voting system have a few good arguments against it. They say that the voting system is inifficient and causes a lot of miscounts, which is damaging the election heavily. There are to many papers for the counters to do no mistakes. Also the ballots are large sheets of paper with many names and often it is quite hard to find the right name and to make the vote you want to. 
Computerized voting machines have not these kind of problems. They are easy to controll critics of the old voting system say. They are removing the possibility of human errors and be more efficient as well. 
On the other hand the computers could cause more and maybe larger problems than a human could. The program the computer is running is programed by humans as well as the computer. A human can make mistakes or miscounts but a computer could refuse a tousand more than a human. If the program would fail many votes could be deleted and stay uncounted. And another problem of computerzied counting is that the fear of using computers of older people is pretty high. Many persons cannot use a computer and the difference between young and old people is high. The older people have to been told how a computer is to be used. Traditional voting has problems as well as the computerzied voting has.
