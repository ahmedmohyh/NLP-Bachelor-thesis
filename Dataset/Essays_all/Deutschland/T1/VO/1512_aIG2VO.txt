In the lecture many of the arguments given in the text are opposed. For example it was said that even though some people with e.g. poor eye sight could cast their vote easyer with the magnifieing function in computers than on the large ballot containing many small names, far more people that don't use computers on daily basis and aren't as used to them could be discouraged from voting.
Secondly the damage done by the human error occuring when people have to coun't the votes and they miss ballots may be smaller than the one a mistake in a counting computer programm could do because these programms are also made by humans and a mistake, e.g. missing thousands of votes may not even be realised. That could be a big problem in closely contested elections.
Lastly the text says that the same people that find technology in terms of voting too risky rely on machines every day for example with banking. The Lecturer has the opinion that these reliable systems had to be improved for years until they worked as good as they do. A voting system would only be in usage every two years nation wide wich means it isn't tested as much.
