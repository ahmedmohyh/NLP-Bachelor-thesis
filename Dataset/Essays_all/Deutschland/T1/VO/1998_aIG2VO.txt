The voting system in the United States are a difficult topic. In traditional voting the people get a large sheet of paper with the candidates on in and the voter have to make a small mark next to that name which their vote. But it can be risky because people with poor eyesight or people who vote fast could make mistakes and maybe they make the small mark at the wrong place. In addition to that the question is if it is helpful to make the voting on computers so the risk is smaller.
  If the voting is computerrised the voting coulkd also be risky because many older people do not have the knowledge about the ney technology and the new computers. Another problem could be that the computer miss votes or recount some votings. If people count the votes you can mostly trust them but a computer? Nevertheless the computer is created from humans so the computer is helpful and maybe it is a possibility to make the votings easier. 
  The voting is very important because the voting is only every two years and the candidate for the United States could make everything diffrent. So you have to trust the computer very much because the voting is about your life. 
  In my opinion the the computer could be helpful. The people could also miss votes like the computer and both of it could be risky because you also can click the wrong name on the computer or make the mark on the wrong place.
