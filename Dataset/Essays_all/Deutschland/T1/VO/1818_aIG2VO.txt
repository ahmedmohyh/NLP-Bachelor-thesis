There are many types to vote in the world, but some are easy and some are really inefficient. Now i`m going to compare two different types.

In the US the you get a sheet of paper with many names of all the people you can choose and you have to tick a small mark in a small field for your favorite person. Many people are not able to read it correctly or good an tick sometimes their mark in the wrong field. So it`s possible to give a vote for a person you dont wanted to vote for. Critics want a moden vote system with computers, a better overview across the names an easier way to tick your mark for the person you want. But there is a problem too. Many old people dont know how to handle a computer and dont understand how they work. Another negative point for the sheet voting is, that every vote has to be counted by an official so it`s human that you count a vote false an the result get`s disturbed. A computer counts thousands of votings in rather than a second and no one has to be payed for count the votings, neither the computers are programmed by human and its possible that they make mistakes too. So if one computer runs not correct it is possible that thousand of votings are false and a false person get`s the canditatur or something else.

At the end we could say, there are problems in any voting system. There is always a low percentage that anything goes wrong. So you must choose your favorite, mistakes are in every system!
