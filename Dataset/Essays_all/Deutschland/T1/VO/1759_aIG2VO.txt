The voting system is criticised by a lot of people. Some people say that the current system isn't trustworthy and others say that voting by technology isn't trustworthy. In the lecture was said the current voting system ist better that technology because it isn't that easy for older generations to use computers because they aren't used to it. Also computers are programmed by people so if somebody makes a mistake the entire program won't work the way it should. If the system has an error it could mess up a huge amount of votes. Therefore it's better to use the traditional way of voting because a human can only mess up a few votes if he isn't looking very carefully. If so the person can start over and recount the votes, a computer can't do that. All in all computers aren't very trustworthy especially because computers since they were invented  always had some problems. A single person won't be able to do as much damage as a computer could. 
The writer of the text is taking the opposite position. Because of accidentally voting for the wrong person or because of bad eyesight votes could be counted wrong, while computers count more carefully. Computerized counting is done a lot faster that by humans especially if humans have to recount all of the votes is a mistake is found. Finally the author is saying that if we don't give computers a try the current system will keep doing mistakes and wrong counting. 
As a conclusion both systems have their good and their bad aspects so it isn't very clear what system is doing a better work.
