They say a computer programs would not make those miscounts and also would make voting much easier for everyone. On the other hand people that are against a new voting system with computers say that especially old people and people that don't have that much experience with computer would be feared of voting because they don't undestand the technoligy behind it. They also talk about how many errors a computer could make without the humans noticing because the computer wouldn't notice them either. They say that humans may miscount but they could notice those miscounts and could count the votes again. Critics say that the recounting of the votes would take way too long so they would prefer a "computerized" system so that those recounts don't have to be done. They also give arguments like a magnifier on the computer or in the programs so people with bad eyesight could magnify the names of the candidates they want to vote. With the current voting system there would be a chance that this people could mark the wrong candicate on the paper because there are so many candidates.
The critics of the computer voting system give the argument that this program isn't like bank programs that are used on daily basis since the voting system is only used once a year. That means that the voting program would take a lot of time to get improved and make accurate voting possible.
