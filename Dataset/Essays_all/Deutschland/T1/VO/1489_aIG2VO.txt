The teacher held a lesson about the elections in the United States and told a few arguments that are in difference with the text. In the text was written that the current voting systems in the United States are inefficient and should be replaced with a new system which works with computers. The author from the text has the opinion that we humans make too many mistakes when we vote for someone, for example voting for the wrong candidate. That would not happen with a new technology-system, but the teacher from before says that even with computers people can make mistakes. What if someone doesn´t know how to use a computer or can´t afford one. That would be the same thing. In the text was also written that the ones who count the votes, need to count every vote one by one, they could also make many mistakes. The teacher thinks that it would be far more damaging if the programmers would make a mistake in the programming of one of these computers and even if these computers are used daily in banks they got improved over the years. At the beginning these bank-computers had many errors too. The computers for voting are only used a few times in a year. On top of that it would occur thousands of errors with these computers for voting.
