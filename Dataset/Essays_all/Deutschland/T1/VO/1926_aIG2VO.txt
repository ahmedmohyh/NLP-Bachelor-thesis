The presentation "Voting" is about a computerized system. This should be use, if people vote vor a candidate. A computerized system is good for people, who use it, but not good for people, who don't use technology in their life. This people could get afraid of the technology and will not vote. If people count the votes, they could make a mistake but the computerized system is also made by people so this could also have an error. If this happen, Votes of many people will be wrong. People use technology every day. They also work with a computerized system in a bank but this has been improved and sometimes even this systems have an error.
The text about voting doesn't agree with the arguments from the listen part. The text says, the system in the U.S. is inefficient. People with poor eyesight mark the wrong name because they get a large sheet of paper. In contrast to this a computerized system remove mistakes so people can trust it. If this would be used no mistakes would happen when the votes are counted. If people count the ballots, it will be almost inevitable that they make mistakes. 

To conclude this, the arguments in the listen part prefer the old system and the positive arguments in the text prefer a new computerized system.
