In the two sources they discuss, which voting method is better the analog or the computerized way.
The woman said some critics about the idea of computerized voting in her presentation.
A big problem for her was, that not every person is used to computers, so they dont know how to handle with the new system. 
For some people a computer is not affordable, so that they will not be able to take part ion the election.
She sad that its possible that mistakes can happen while humans counting the ballots, but computers are programmed by humans, too.
If the computer programm has a problem, over thousands of votes could get lost, while a human counting mistake can only lose a few votes.
Her last argument was, that elections are not so often that they do not have the chance to improve the system.
This arguments are completly against the arguments of the text, because the opinion of the text was for the computerized way of voting.
The text said that the voting sheets are really messed up with all the names of the candidates in a really small font. Voting for the wrong candidate for persons with eye problems is very easy.
After this problem he used the argument, that computers are able the magnify the names of the candidates.
Deleting human mistakes with this computer system was the argument from the text, but the woman destroyed this argument.
