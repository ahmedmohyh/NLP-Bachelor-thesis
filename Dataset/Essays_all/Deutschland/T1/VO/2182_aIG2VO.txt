The text and the oral presentation are about the same thing, but the critics are on different points.
The text is about the much better ability of computerized systems for voting because of the clear structure and the automatical help. It says that this type of voting would be much better for people with bad eyesight and less concentration would be necessary.
The presentation prefers current voting systems with the argumentation that peolpe wo do not use computers very often will not be able to use those systems. So old people or poor ones who do not have daily experience with computers would have a huge disadvantage.
Another point for computerized systems is that the counting at the end will be much easier because people won`t be used anymore so less misatkes will happen and the process will be much faster.
Critics say that we can not be sure that computers do not make mistakes bacause they are programmed by human beings so there can be already misatkes in the progamm. Another argument is that technologic systems have to be improved very often until they are without mikstakes and votings ar no processes which are made daily so the risk of mistakes is higher. They also do not agree that the mistakes will be less often because humans would just make one mistakes but when a computer programm is wrong programmed the whole count of votes will be wrong and the process will be often not found.
