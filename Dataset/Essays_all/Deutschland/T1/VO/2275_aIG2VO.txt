Out of the two texts regarding voting systems in the US there were some major arguments contradicting. On the one hand, the traditional voting system is way slower and has way more counting mistakes in it, but a computerized system may contain programming mistakes which are a whole lot more serious, since this mistake will apply onto every single vote counted by this program. As there are also possible enemies of the election or the government or maybe the program crashes without saving the votes there is one more reason people mistrust this new system. The online banking is used every day to transfer money by millions of people, but it had more than enough time to be developed and also more testing results. A voting system for an election, may it be national or not, is hardly tested twice a year. Also, not everyone uses computers on a daily basis, there are people who either cannot afford or simply do not want to use computers as much as the people in "computerized" areas do. Those people can be easily confused by this new system and do a mistake with the election out of confusion. Seeing all this, there are controversive meanings on this
