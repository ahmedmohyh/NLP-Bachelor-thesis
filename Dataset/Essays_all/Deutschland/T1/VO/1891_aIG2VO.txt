Many people in the United States think that we should release the opportunity to vote on computers because this would make the system safier and mistakes could be prevented. But why isn´t it better to vote in the traditional way?

Today in our society everyone got the right to vote, it doesn´t matter which gender you have or which age you are, if you´re old enough. But we have a lot of people who don´t own a computer or are already that old that they don´t know how to use it. In this case many peple couldn´t participate in the election and wouldn´t be able to vote. 

Often humans do mistakes by counting the votes and then they have to count another time. But computers also can do mistakes, because they are obviously programmed by humans. And if they do a mistake, that could be even thousands of mistakes while a human only would do 1 or 2 mistakes. The risk that a computer does an huge mistake is higher than by humans

Although the system by computer could be easier, we only vote aprox every 4 years or in small elections maybe two times a year. That means that it is not very important to change our system because we would have to do a lot of changing process.

Finally we can say that it is not that important to change our system. There is a high risk that computers could do mistakes and people even are just not able to vote!
