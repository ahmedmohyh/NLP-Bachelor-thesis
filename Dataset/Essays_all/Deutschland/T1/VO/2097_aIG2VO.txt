The text and the speech tell both about the voting. They tell about the traditional voting by a sheet of paper and about the new voting, the computerized voting. The written text gives much arguments for the coputerized voting. The first argument is that people often vote the wrong candidate because of the long sheet of paper where they only can make one marke next to the name what is not easy for people with poor eyesight. On the text is written that on the computer that is much easier because of the easy-to-touch-screen technology. The speech says that the computerized voting is good for the people who work with computers but older people often have problems because they don't use computers at home or at work and because of that they can make mistakes. Another argument of the text is that the counting of the votes by computer is much easilier than by hand because the computer counts faster and automatically and don't make mistakes. But the text also says that some people think it's too risky. The speech says that there can be mistakes by counting by hand but with the computer there can also be mistakes when the program which counts the votes has a mistake. So finally the text and the speech have a different opinion by talking about the voting systems.
