In the discussion about the voting systems the speeker have some crtitcs on the computerized voting. She said that it could be trouble for people who have problems of using a computer and do not really know how to work with them. She also said that there could be big problems if the programs are defect or have an error.
But on the other site the text said that it would be easier if you use the computer to vote, because it is easy to use and the counting will be much quicker and without any mistakes. It also said that the traditional voting is inefficient and often leads to an inaccurate counting of the votes. An other point whicht is in the text is that it could be that the people vote for the wrong person which they do not want to vote for. The last point is that in the traditional voting system the votes are counted by people who can make mistakes.
