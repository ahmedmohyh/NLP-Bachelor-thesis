The question if new or old systems should be used to do the votings, does show positive and negative aspects for both sides.
The main problem with the old system  mainly are the human errors which can be made. One of these errors can be the miscounting of votes which is simply a consequence of one human needing to count up to thousend of votes one by one. Following the text suggests to replace the counting persons with computers, which will not miscount the votes.
However in the given speech it is stated, that a error in computer programm might have a much bigger impact, because thousands of votes might be given out false or just be kept in, so for example 10 votes too much might be he smaller problem and also could be fixed.
The sencond problem in the old system is the error by the voters which accidently vote for a wrong candidate just because of their bad eyesight.
As a answer to that problem, a touch system would help, but as a counter argument the people, who are not familiar with technology also might make the same mistakes as in the old system and accidently vote for a wrong candidate.
So following as a result you can say that both parties, the old and the new voting system would have negative and positive points.
