The topic "Voting" is about introducing a new method of voting. Instead of voting on a piece of paper people should vote on computers with touchscreen.

The thought about this method is to make voting procedure clear. People with eyesight problems could mark the wrong name on the paper because it is hard to see, which candidate you are voting for. On this voting papers are too many names although they are not  even in the election. That is why the touchscreen computer should come. With this method voters can not vote for the wrong candidate because you can magnify the screen and you can search for the candidate you want to vote for.
But this method also brings new problems with it. People who do not use computers everyday are not used to them. So they may could not handle computers. However it is very easy to use them. A touchscreen is easy to use because as the name says you just have to touch the candidate on the screen you want to vote for. Further more this method helps counting. Officials could easily make mistakes when they are counting every single vote. But you have to keep in mind that computers are programmed by humans and also these humans can make mistakes. The first software systems of Microsoft and Apple were not perfect too. So why should this program be perfect by first try? Probably because it is easier to program. This software is not that hard and almost everyone with programming skills could program this.

So in conclusion the new method by introducing computers to voting seems to be a good solution for voting. Both human and computer can make mistakes, but officials are more likely.
