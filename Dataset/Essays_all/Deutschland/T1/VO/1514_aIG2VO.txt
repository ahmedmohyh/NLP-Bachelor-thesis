Firstly to vote via a computer may be easy for young and middleaged people, but not for some other ethnic groups which would maybe have never used a computer before. It could be difficult for them to subdue their fear of technoledgy.
Humans do mistakes. And if they count thousands of ballots by hand it is inevitable to make any mistakes. Maybe a computer would make less ones, but if there is a mistake in the programm - which is made by humans, too - it will be much more far-stretching than a simple mistake with only one ballot. Of course, a lot of people do their daily banking per computer and trust it's programm but these are improved systems based on errors in the past.
They're different to the ones from the text; here are listed up many arguments for computers. In contrast to the report the text never tells about the disadvanteges of the technological voting. For example the far-stretching mistakes such programms could make. Of course, it would make less work but could the gouverment even bear such an error if it appears? They do not tell about the difficulties in the text which old people might have with technolodgy. They especially mark the advanteges and list the disadvanteges of the regular voting, but far away from any realisicm.
