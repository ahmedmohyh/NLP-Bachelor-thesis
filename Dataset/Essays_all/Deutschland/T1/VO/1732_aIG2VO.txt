Voting is an important subject, Many people have their thoughts about the voting systems in the United States and want them to be computerized. But not everyone has the same thougths, for example a woman who held a speech about it.

In her mind, it is easy for people who are used to computers  to vote electronically. But elderly people aren't as confident as young people with computers, so this system may discourage them from voting. On the other hand, a text given said that this system may help elderly or just people with poor eyesight to read the ballot and to mark their answer, so it will be easier to vote. 
The women also said that it isn't proved computers are any better for counting votes. She knows that people do mistakes while counting and that they need much time to count the votes and to write down the results. But computers aren't that good either because they are made from humans, so they don't work flawlessly, you have to expect mistakes. Also, if there is one fault in the computer system, many votes could disappear or be counted twice. It is better to need much time and to go over the same votes again and again than disappearing votes and problems with computers. The writer of the text on the other hand says that if people do a mistake during counting the votes is expensive and needs too much time.

So the womens speech and the text given are the exact contrary of each other. The writer of the text wants the computerized voting system, the women wants to vote the traditional way. Both give arguments for the other side but are confident, their thoughts are right.
