On one hand we have the text on the other hand we have the speech. The text and the speech are about the vote system, especially in the USA. IN the text there are many critics who are against the human elecction because humans are making too many mistakes and are miscalculating the votes, what would be drastic for a important decision. Furthermore there are many positive points, if the people could vote with computerized systems, especially for the people with poor eyesight. Some of them can not fint the names on the votelist and they are marking the wrong names. If they could use an easy-to-use-touch screen, they only would have to tap the name and the letters can be eaysoly written because they are written a way bigger. Many people are saying that itb has a high risk to use this computerized technology, but they have to think about the whole communication in the world. These days everything is controlled by these systhems, for example the banking. 

I am sorry but I can not write about the speech because my ear plugins ( do not no the word in english) were broken so i can not resume the content.
