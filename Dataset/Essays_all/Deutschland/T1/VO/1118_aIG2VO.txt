The normal Text is for a new voting system in america and the listening text is against a new voting system. 
In the text critics say that the current votung system in the U.S.A. is way to old and has to get replaced by a computer technology. While the listening text said, that the voting system in america worked for the last centuries and why should you change a running system? Then the text said, that the technology is way to old and there are to many mistakes, when a human being would count the votes. But then the voicetext said that on the computer is only a progamm, which is programmed by a human. If a human is doing one mistake on the programm it could decide who should become the next president. But in the Text they said, that we trust the computers blind. From giving them our "secret" bank account to highly sensitive information. On the voicetext was a very good argument, that only the young generation could use the new technology and the older generation could not manage it to use a computer. The text is arguing, that the old persons could just not read the names, because they got problems with their eyes.
