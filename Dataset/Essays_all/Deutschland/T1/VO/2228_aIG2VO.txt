The woman in the audio file says that computer programs can have mistakes as a result of the programming by humans. Humans are tending to do mistakes, so it is not impossible that there are mistakes in the computer programs, which are counting the votes. Furthermore she examines that the computer programs of banking had mistakes in their code, too, at their release. But banking with computer programs like online banking is a thing of daily live and the programs were improving. In contrast to that the voting is only every second year so it is not a thiing of the daily live and there is not a development of the program code like the the code of the online bank. Whereas the text says that a computerized system is needed as a result of the mistakes made by humans while  marking the name of candidate or counting the votes afterwards. It is possible that voters with bad eyes are marking not their right candidate as a result of their bad eyes and the long lists of names in contrast to that a computerised system with tablets would eliminate these problems. The mistakes while counting would be eliminate too by the computerised system, because computers are not doing as much mistakes as human beings. A other point of the text is that the society is trusting computerised systems in everyday life such as online banking or online shopping.
