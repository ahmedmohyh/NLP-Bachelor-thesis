In the argumentation the woman said that computer technology to vote isn't that easy for everyone. A computer technology vote is easy for the people who used computers often and know how to use it but people woh don't use computers often maybe will have problem to vote with one because they don't know how to correctly use a computer. The woman also said that by a computerized voting the system which is setup by a humen can also have an error and so maybe 1000 of votes can't be counted correctly.
The text said that computerized votings are easy to use because of the computerized voting machines which have to be used by an touch-screen where you have to touch on the name of the candidate. 
It also told a pair of negativ arguments to the old votings. It said that on the ballot you have a list of the names from the candidates und habe to make a small mark next to the name and people with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong person. A other problem is that the people have to count the votes one by one and there they will make a mistake the taxt said.
