In the following essay the points of view of two different people should be summarized and compared. The topic is the question if the current voting systems or the traditional voting ist safer to receive the correct number of votes for any candidate.

It gets obvious that the woman who presents the topic is against the computer voting. She says that it is difficult for people to vote who are not used to computers or who do not have the money to buy a computer. She also mentions that many people fear the technology because they do not trust computers. They think that this voting system is not improved enough because it is not used often. The woman also says that some people are afraid of human making mistakes by counting the votes. But she argues that computers can make mistakes, too. An error is always possible on the computers and this error can lead to votes being removed. 

The contrast between this presentation and the text is that the author is for the computer voting. He says that many people think that the current voting systems are inefficient and that the traditionell voting is better. But the author thinks that it is possible that people who are not able to see well can accidently vote for the wrong person. The computer system is safer for them. He also mentions that the people who have to count the votes will make mistakes after they had to count thousands of votes. 

All in all you can say  that there are people who are for and against the current voting systems but it gets obvious  that there are positive and negative aspects for both of the voting systems.
