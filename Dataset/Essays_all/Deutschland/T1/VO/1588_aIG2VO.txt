In the articel "Voting" the voting system of the United States is hardly criticises and many wish the traditional system to be replaced with a more efficient computerized voting system. 

Many critics say that the traditional voting system is way to inefficient and the voting can't be counted perfectly correct. In this case miscounts can happen and would be really painful, if this decides a close election. So the wished compuritezed voting system may be better or even not so old-fashioned, but it also has some deficiets that could damage a clear and correct vote. The computerized system makes many miscounts too, because older person or disabled persons may click on the wrong person and the vote is gone. You need to make only on click to sent your vote and it's gone. Otherwise it solves the problem with non precisious vote, because the vote can be counted correctly and automatically, so this ends the problem human error. Also the computerized system may a hacked, because these days many excellent hacker exist or can be changed by the government, because they don't want the vote to be real.
