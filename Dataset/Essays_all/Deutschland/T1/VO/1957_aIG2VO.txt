The woman who made the speech made clear that using a computerized voting system doesn't make the voting situations in the U.S. any better.
People who aren't used to coumputers, because they can't afford one at home or just don't like technology, will be scared away from voting at all. This stays in contrast to arguments from the text that say that in traditional voting especially old people accidentally vote for the wrong person and that using a computer this would not be a problem.
The second argument of the speech is that human errors would still be there because computer systems are made by humans and not always perfect. If there is an error in only one of the computers this would result in thousands of votes missing. So the human mishaps in counting the votes are not that dramatic as a computer having a problem. This stands again against the text which says that mistakes made by human would be removed by a computerized voting.
In the last argument the speech disagrees with the argument of the text that computer technology works fine on the every day basis for example in banking transactions and this means it would work as well in the election process. The technology used daily did not start out as good as it is today it had to be improved a lot. So using technology in a voting system where people vote only every second year national wide will mean that it would have problems that will not be improved as often as things used daily by millions of people.
