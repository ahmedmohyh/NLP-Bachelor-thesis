The two sources are in conflict to eachother because one of them is more advertising for a traditional and the other one wants to reform and make the voting system of the US more efficient and trustworthy.

The speach said that the modern election and voting system is not made for everyone because not everyone knows how to deal with an laptop or an computer. In this case older ones or people that have no education at the laptop or PC can not vote without problems. But in conflict to this these elections could be installed easy so that evryone can use them by one touch. Additional the speach informs about the reliability of the Computer. We are using them all day for example for baking and they seem reliable. But any system-mistake or any other mistake in the computerized system can influence them and destroy the vote. But on the other hand there is undoubtly no save realibility of human counters. They can miscount or influence the votes/elections by giving wrong numbers. Also it can happen that there are some persons, who accidentally voted for the wrong canidate (sometimes even because some things are written to small to read them without glasses).
