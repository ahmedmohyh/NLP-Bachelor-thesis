In the lecture about voting in the United States of America the woman explains why people may be aposed to computerized voting systems.
Although the USA is a technologically advanced country there are still people that are not able to effort computers and are therefore not used to them. For these people it might be discouriging to vote with an compterized system because of their fear of technology.
Human errors may eccour in the regular election but missing physical effidence could cause far more serious damage because the system is not used as often as other programs like online banking that had to be improved as well. The speaker makes clear computer voting programs would have to be more used in order to be fully functional and trustworthy. Until then people would react more negativlly to them and it wouldn't help the USA to improve their inaccurate elections.
Problems like accidental votings when somebody ticks the wrong bocks on the ballot and counting errors that were critizised in the text could be solved with a computerized voting system in order to clear all problems with close contest elections
