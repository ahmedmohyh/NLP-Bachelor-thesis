In the text presented earlier, it was explained how computerized voting could help make the voting process more reliable, easier and faster so that the elections can proceed easily and without inconveniances. It explains how the computerized voting process could help make it easier for the people which have sight problems, how it could eliminate human error, and, how the counting process could be over as soon as all the voting locations are closed. It argues, that we have been relying on technology for some time now, so why not change the voting process to keep up to date with the times?
On the other hand, the lecture talks about all of the downfalls that the computerized electronic voting process could bring. For example, people who do not use computers regularly might not be able to understand how the process works, therefore making the wrong choice, or even not attending to vote at all for fear of being lost. Also, the lecture talks states how computerized voting errors could lead to the loss of hundreds or even thousands of votes, due to the fact that because we are not able to try out the system that often, errors might appear that could lead to a devastating effect. After all, computers are also managed and programmed by humans that can make mistakes.
