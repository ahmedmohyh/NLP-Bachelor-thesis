The topic is the voting system, in the USA.

There are many problems, when you are using a computer system for voting, because not everyone can use a computer very well.
Allthough the technology is a trouble and nobody can say that it is perfect, because the programms can make many mistakes and that causes mistakes at counting the votes, so the election is not right and that can causes big problems for the nation and the world.
Another major problem is that people think that they can handle with the computers, because the are using them for banking and texting every day.
But it is not true, there are many differents between using a computer for daily things like banking or using it for a national voting.

The author of the text has an another opinion, he thinks, that it would be better to use more computers for voting in the USA.
He says, that in traditional voting a major source of inaccuracy is that people vote for the wrong candidate, because first they have to find the name of their candidate at the ballot and then they can mark the name.
Another major problem is that people have to count the votes later on and there get many mistakes.
They have to go through every ballot to count the name of the votes and you can count wrong, so you have to start again.
At the end you have so many ballots, thousan of ballots, which you have to count alone without helping by a computer system and this is not godd for the election.
The author says that the computer systems remove the possibility of human error and the vote counting is done quickly by the computers but there are some people who say that it is risky to think that the technology makes everything for you.
