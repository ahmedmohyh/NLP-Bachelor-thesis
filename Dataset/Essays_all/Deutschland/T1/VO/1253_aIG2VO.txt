Pc`s can count the votings even better then the people who did this because the fault from the humans that a few votes get wrong or something else is not there. But the pc`s can destroy a voting from 1000 of people if they dont work or do something wrong. The name of the people who can vote are on a paper where the students or parents or other people see the namens. If the names too small it can be happen that the people vote the wrong person. Also had the people not the chance to get information about the persons and need to search the names of the paper if they know somebody of them. Pc voting machines are even better then papers where the names too small because all people can see the names easily and need only to touch on the name of their candidate. Also the pc`s are faster then the people who count every vote one by one, because the fault that a vote is in the wrong box can not happen at the pc.
