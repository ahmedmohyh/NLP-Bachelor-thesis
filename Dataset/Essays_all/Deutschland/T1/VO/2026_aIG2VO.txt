The voting for new candidates in America happens once every two years. There are different voting systems, with it you can choose your major candidate. 
In traditional voting, you just have to make a mark next to your canditate on a paper. So officials hvae to count up the votes one by one and there they can make counting faults. The current voting system which is used in the United States,  works with computers, where the voter has to touch the canditates name on the lap tops screen to record a vote. The advantage of this technical voting system is, that people with Leseschwäche can magnify the candidates name. But there are also especially some points against the current voting system. People, especially older people who weren't grown up with technology like computers or mobile phones, can not work with this computerized working. Anyway, it often could happen to mark the wrong name because you can't see very well. The biggest disadvantage of the current voting system is that first the citizens have to trust the computer technology. An arrow could happen in a vote for a new candidate and in cause of that the votes of the people aren't benutzbar anymore. 
In the text, critics rather like the traditional voting. They argumentate that the current voting system is 'inefficient and often lead to inaccurate counting of votes'(l. 1)
