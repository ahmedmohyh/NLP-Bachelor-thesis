In a text and in a listening part were many arguments about standart- and computer voting systems.
So on one side there are the arguments for the classic voting system, which we all know. Some people can't read the papers, which the names on it, because they are to small for their eyes. So maybe they will take his vote at the wrong person. 
After a vote in a country lots of people have to count the votes. So there might be people, who don't count right. So there comes mistakes in the results by this humans.
A new idea is a voting system with computers. There are lots of pro arguments. Everybody can read it clear and don't make any mistake. And also older people, which aren't able to walk to the vote, can vote. A problem with the computer systems are, that you have personifical information there. Maybe people can view over your vote and can change you vote. An other problem is, that the computer voting system is managed by humans. So maybe they make a mistake while programming the program. So in consequenze there are about 1000 wrong votes.
The two parts aren't fit to each other. For example at the corecting part of wrong votes of the classic vote system. And they have a differnet oppinion at the vote  system in the USA.
