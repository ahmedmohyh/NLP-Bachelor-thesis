Theres is often a big discussion with the theme of voting system. 

The woman says, that when a human makes a mistake counting the ballots, you only miss a few votes. But when there is a error in a computer sytem, it could be, that thousand of votes were miscounted. These smart systems have to be tested first.
In the section of the text critics show their opinion of the new technologies. They believe, that its easier for people with poor eyesieght to mark the right name because they have an "easy to use"- touchscreen.So they can not vote for the wrong person.  Furthermore, the officials of these elections do not have to count every single ballot.

 I think its better to use computer, because the most people have experiences with them ans they know how to use them and i can  not imagine, that a computer system make such a big mistake, that thousands of votes were miscounted.
