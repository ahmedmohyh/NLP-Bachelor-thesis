The problems between the old voting system and the traditional system in America is a big problem for the citicens. Both of the possibilities have some negative sides. At first the traditional voting system with the positives and negatives sides. On the one hand, the traditional system is with paper, the people have to write the name of the candidate, who they want to have. But the citicens could vote for the wrong candidate, maybe they forget the name. And so they fixed the problem. They have to mark the name of the candidate. The problem with the old system is not fixed, because of the old people with poor eyesight can not see the name on the paper. The new voting system on the computer is a good possibility for the old citicens. The easy-to-use technology with an easier way to mark the name. The problem with the names is fixed but the handeling with the computer isn´t easy for the old people. The technology will used every day and the old people have to immigrate in the new technology worl. But the technology isn´t safe for errors. The result of the errors could be lost votings. The new voting system with the technology is better and faster with the votes but it´s very expensive to buy it. And you have to find a place for the technology. All in all bothe systems, the traditional and the new have some problems. In summary, the traditional system is cheaper and for the old people maybe easier to vote, when the names of the candidates are good to see. The way with the technolgy is very expensive, and to fix a problem could take a long time. The biggest problem with the technology is the error, a mistake in the systems. The last point is the handeling with the techn ology for the old people because they don´t need the technology and so they don´t use it.
