The text is about the reasons, why computerized voting is much better, than the traditional voting at all. In contrast to that the listening part has the opinion that computerized voting is can make as much mistakes as the traditional voting, sometimes even more than that. But how do them argue? In the text is written that the traditional voting has a long list with candidates with really small letters. So the people often vote for the wrong candidate because they acually can't read it. Another Problem is that this lists will be count by persons. This will not only take a long time, but also the counter easy can take mistakes. The computerized voting has big letters, so it is easy to look at it. It also count by the computers, which is really fast and not really complicated. On the other side the listening part said that it is maybe not really complicated to vote with computers for people, who often work with them. But for people, who have no computers, it is really complicated. The computers also can make mistakes. For example when they hacked or have an errror or something like tihs, thy can make big mistales, much bigger than human counting.
