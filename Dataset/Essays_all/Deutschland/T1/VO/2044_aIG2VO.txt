Summary "Voting"

The text "Voting" is about the voting system in the USA and how it could be better.
First of all, the speaker says that the current voting system is better then with computers. Thats because of the people who don't know how to work with them may give their vote the wrong canditate. In opposite of that, the author writes in the text that the ballots may have more problems, because they are big and had a whole bunch of canditates names, so it's difficult to see for people where they have to make their cross.
It also says in the text, that humans could make mistakes while they read all the ballots, and this mistake is often difficult to find, so it's better to use computer.
On the other hand the speaker says, computer are also programmed by human, and if they make a mistake it would be much bigger.
At this point the text shows, that computer are also used for banking transactions, so it wouldn't be that much of a risk like humans.
All in all, the text and the speech are at different positions.
