The women in the "Chevalier" says, she wouldn't let computers "control" the election. She said, that there will be mistakes too, because the computers are programmed bye human and human make mistakes. Also she gives the point, that people who don't work with computers every day or not usually could probably make mistakes and vote wrong. Also, she said if human programmed these election computers, they could lead to false elections, because the human could maybe have their own opninion and changed the computers programming for their own buisness, or they could change a big amount of votes because of a small programming mistake. The text says, the election computers would be a positive change, because voters with bad eyesight would be abled to choose their right candidate too. It also said, that there are many important systems the government trusts, for example bank systems. In the speech, she said that these arguments are invalid, because these bank systems where full of mistakes and had a long time to be improved. The election systems would be used just every two years and therefore, it would be hard to correct the mistakes.
