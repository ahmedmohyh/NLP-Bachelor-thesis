Computerized voting machines can have a negative influence on the election.For people who are using computers in their everyday life, it seems like a very good and modern way to give their votes.But for people who do not use computers very often, or haven't ever used them, it can be a big problem. If they don't know how to use them, this can be a reason for a wrong vote. Another point is, that also the computer can have an error, and not only human error can be a problem, as the computers are buildt by humans. In the text, it says that there is a high risk of wrong votes with traditional voting, because humans easily do mistakes when they vote, influenced by different things like for example poor eyesight. But also with computerized voting machines there can be mistakes. Especially with counting out the votes.Of course humans can do mistakes when they count out the votes themselves, but it's only a few votes. When the computer do mistakes, it is a dramatically mistake that influences the whole election.
