The text and the speech just given show two contrasting positions towards traditional and modern voting systems.
The author of the speech thinks, while using modern technologie for our voting system seems to be very easy, it actually bares a lot of dangers. 
Her first argument is, that computers are only that much easier to use for people who are used to it. She even goes as far to say, that people who can not effort computers and other electronic devices might be that scared of not being able to use technologie properly, that they might not even vote anymore. This contrasts the opinion of the author of the text, who thinks that modern is pretty easy to use. Being even able to zoom in for example would solve a lot of problems for with bad eyesight. 
The speeches author also says, that technologie also does not always work flawlessly, and while a human counting the votes could only maybe miss a few ballots, computers could just easily exidently errase thousands of votes without having a safety copy. This way, especially in close elections, huge problems could accure. While the author of the text says that computers would make less mistakes couting the votes.
Finally the speeches author expressesl, that machines were also only designed by humans. That would be, why they could never be flawless either.
