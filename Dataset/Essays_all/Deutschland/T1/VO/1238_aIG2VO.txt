The text and the presentation tells something about the voting systems in the United states. Some people are against the traditional voting system, where people vote one paper, they want that votes goes by computers.
The text said that computer are a good and quickly. One argument of the text is, that people, who can´t read verry well, cause they have a poor eyesight, makes mistakes, when they take the mark by the wrong person. The  Also you must often count up the votes one by one, 
which is much easilier one the computer.
         The woman in the presentation means in contrast to this, that computers makes mistakes to, which have more dramatic results as mistakes, who done by humans. The computerprograms, which use every day can controlled better as a programm that will use once a year. Also it gives uncorrect taken marks in am computervoting, for example when  people miss a mark. At the end of a vote, when the votes count up a computer miss countes and they don`t have any influence of the vote.
At the end you can say that both way to vote have they negative and positive sides, like miss countes and incorrect marks. The woman in the presentation is against voting by the computer and the text means that the traditional voting isn´t good.
