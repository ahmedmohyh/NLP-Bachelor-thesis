There are many people who don't like the voting system in the USA. Some people say it's better to have a new system, which includes computers. Others say that the old voting system is still better than a new one. The text and the lecture gave us information about both system and arguments for one or the other.

The the critics, who want a new system, say that it's the human who makes mistakes. With the officials miscounting the ballots, everything has to be recounted. And even the voters make mistakes. It can be hard for them to find the correct name on the ballot, and it's even harder if you have a poor eyesight.
To avoid mistakes, the critics want computers. They are easy to use, and even people with a poor eyesight can find the names easier. They will also remove the human error when it comes to counting. 

But there are people, who still want the old voting system. In their opinion, a lot of people can't afford a computer and/or aren't used to the new technology. They could refuse from voting, because of their fear to make something wrong. They also say that computers make mistakes too. Human wrote the program of the computers, and those programs could include errors.. The mistakes that the computer could make then would be worse than the ones made by the people. A recount would be impossible. And even though the supporters of the new system say that we can trust the system, as we already do in daily life, they still didn't think about the fact that we use those programs daily and not just once or twice a year.

The text gives us information about the new voting system. It shows us the advantages of it and the disadvantages of the old system. The lecture shows us the opposite side. It mainly talks about the disadvantages of the computers and about the advantages of the old system.
