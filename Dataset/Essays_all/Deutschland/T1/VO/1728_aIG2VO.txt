There are mistakes occuring in the system of american voting; first of all, it is given that not everyone is able to vote because of their helth- given conditions; for example, people can not see perfectly, so they accidently mark the wrong name.
Also, it is common that humans make mistakes copunting the votes per hand. Making these could be ignored by using another technique; instead of counting them per hand, computers should do that excersis, people say. People do make mistakes, so these could be avoided by letting computers do their job. Especiallly in important decisions like voting, it is important to get true and exact results. People could simply miss a voice, count it twice or do other mistakes. 
Now, some say that computers are more relayable than humans. They are more exact, don`t have sensitive values or feelings, opinions or other aspects that could affect a incorrect voting result.

On the other hand, experts critizise the "new way"; they think, computers could even make bigger mistakes. Those are worse, they say.
Because computers are programmed by humans, they could have errors aswell. If technique is as exact as we think, they critizise.
What would happen if there was a bad error occuring in the counting system of computers? The voices wouldn`t be counted correctly and the result was even less true and exact than if humans did the work by hand. 

The text does not agree with the arguments the lady speaking in the record, gives. The ones are against that voting voices should be counted by hand and the others agree with the opinion, this task sould be done b ymachines. 
Which way is more correct and relayable, the both sides don`t agree on.
