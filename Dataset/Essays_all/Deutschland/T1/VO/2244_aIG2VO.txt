Comparing the current voting system of the U.S.A to an computerized voting system, tthe computerized one at first seems to be much better: no miscounts, better structured, easier to use and much faster to see the final results. But some people are critisising that it might come to bugs in the program because of scripting errors which would be way more fatal than a the miscount made by officials. Another point against the computerized voting system would be that especially older people who are not used to use computers do feel more confident using a piece of paper and a pen when they go vote. Coming back to eventually existing bugs there is another point which should be said: Using the argument that computerized systems work very well, for example for banking does not automatically count for all computerized systems because banking systems are used every day and bugs are found and removed pretty quick.
