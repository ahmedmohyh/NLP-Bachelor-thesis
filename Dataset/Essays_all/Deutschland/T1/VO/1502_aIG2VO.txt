Many critics doubt that a computerised voting would make the inaccurated counting of votes better. The first reason why they think that is that people who don't use computers on a regular basis could fear them and because of that they could stop voting. That would lead to even less people voting for candidates and the percentage would shrink emensely. Other critics say that this wouldn't matter because at the moment many people accidentally vote for the wrong people because of poor eyesight. Because this problem could be fixed with computers there would be less votes but more right votes so it wouldn't make a difference. People with bad eyesight could magnify the names of the candidates for easier viewing. 
Another argument critics who are against computerised voting have is that computers are programmed by humans. Of course many votes are lost because at the moment the people have to count up the votes one by one but with computers these problems would be far more serious. Because of one little fault in the program thousands of votes could be miscounted or removed and thats far more serious than a few ballots who could get lost.
Another point is that the system wouldn't be used on a daily basis so there could be far more faults in the program when the system is only used once in about two years than when governments use computer programs everyday.
