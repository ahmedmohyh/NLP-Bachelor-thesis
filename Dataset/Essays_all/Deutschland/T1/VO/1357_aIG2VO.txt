In the speach the woman said that a computerized voting is impossible. She agreed with  the point that nowdays the computer use is verry high but she said that you can not go out of the point that everybody has the knowledge of useing a computer. So they can also make mistakes or tmark the wrong name they did not wanted to mark. Another reason was that this computer voting is made by humans and humans can make mistakes by working this computer voting program out.
In the text it is said that people with poor eyesight could mark the wrong name but in the speach it is said that it could give some people which dose not know how to use a computer. In the text it is said that by counting the votes of the ballot ,like the old current voting systems, there are human who could error by counting these votes. So it is much more easier and better when the computer just count these votes qickly and automatically. In the speach it is said that it could give a program mistake because these programs are made by human so you can not be save that everything on this computerized voting is correctly. Like in current votes they are maybe ten mistakes but when you have a computerprogrammistake every votes are wrong !
