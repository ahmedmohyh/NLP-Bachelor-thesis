Voting in America

The biggest conflict on whether the way of voting in America needs to be approved or not, is the use of tecnologie.
The author of the text, speaking for the critics of the old American voting systhem, wants voting to be computerzised, because computers are more trustworthy sice humans can miscount the votes and also that it is ineffective because it takes a long time to count each individual vote. The woman presenting the speak on the other hand thinks that since computer programms are desingned by humans even bigger mistakes can be made, which can be even worse since there ist no way to recount the votes. Furthermore she ist critizising that not every American has a computer and knows how to use it. While the author of the text thinks that the voting sheets are misleading and cause people with bad eyesight to vote for the wrong candidate, the women who presented the speech is sure of the fact that tecnologie is even harder to handle ecpesially for older people. She agrees with the author in the point that tecnologie is a big part of the new generation but that it had to improve first to be where it is as of now. She does not think that America is ready to computerzise voting since there still is a fear of tecnologie.
