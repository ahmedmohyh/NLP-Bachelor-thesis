The spoken text is about computerized voting and its dangers. It starts with saying that computerized voting is only easier for people who are used to technology, so there will be still be difficulties and not everybody will get along with it. According to the text the goal ist to make it easier to use for everyone, which is not possible, since you always got a group that will cause problems.
Another reason for computerizing the votes is that humans are known for making errors and people hope to be able to avoid misscounts by using computers to count the votes instead of humans. The spoken text on the other hand reminds computers are just programms, programmed by humans. The worst mistake a human could make is missing out some ballots, but if a computer gets it wrong it will have far more consequences. 
And Last, it is said to give technology a try and that it has worked before on important things like banking transactings but according to the other text votes have too much influence and are not made often enough to be able to improve the system. And improvising is the most important to avoid those named dangers.
