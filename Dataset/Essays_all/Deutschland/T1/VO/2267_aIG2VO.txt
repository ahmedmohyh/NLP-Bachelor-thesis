The texts are about the voting system of the United States, and the question if the traditional way is better than using computers for voting. In the heared text there is critizesed that for people, which do not use computers every day, it would be difficult to use them for voting. Furthermore the computers are programmed by humans so there  can be human mistakes and when there is an error thousands of votes can be destroyed. But in the written text it is said that the traditional voting system has many disadvantages, too.  So the names of the candidates are all on a large sheet of paper and the voters have to make a small mark next to there prefered candidate. But that can be difficult for people with poor  eyesight and they can accidently vote for an other candidate. In this text the "computerway" is prefered, because while counting the votes there can not be human mistakes and people can touch the candidate`s name on a screen easily.
