In the presentation were a lot of arguments for the computerized way to vote but also many questions about it. 
They said, that the computer system made by humans so humans can help, if the system doenst work. In the text they said that too and if we had the old vote system and the humans makes mistakes by counting the votes it takes a long time to start new. 
Another argument was, that some people can't handle with computers and so they can't handle the new system and make mistakes. In the text they said, that the old way to vote also bring mistakes with it, because some people can't see the right box, where they want to mark so they took the wrong name.
