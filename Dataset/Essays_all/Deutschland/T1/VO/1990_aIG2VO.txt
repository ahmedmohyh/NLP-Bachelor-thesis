Many people are thinking that the voting system in the United States is not as efficient as it should. For that reason a lot of people are thinking that computers will make a better job, but also a lot of people are thinking that they won't.
On usual voting sheets are a lot of names and the voters has to find the right name they wanted to vote for. But if those people has bad eyes they could put their cross on on the wrong place. A computer based system could be easier for them, cause they would just have to touch the screen and they would make their vote and they could make the names larger on a computer than on a paper.
But in common the people with the bad eyes are older. Maybe they will not understand how to work with computers. It won't be easy for them to make their voting and in this case it could come to a wrong voting too.
Humans make mistakes. And this is a big problem on the voting day, cause normal people have to count the votes for the different candidates and they could make mistakes, so that the voting could be wrong. Computers won't make those mistakes cause they will just count the votes they recieve and the will not read     wrong. But computers are programmed by humans and if humans make mistakes also programmers will make mistakes, cause they are humans too. If they put a mistake in the voting programm, not only one vote will be misscounted. If there is a mistake thousands will be misscounted.
The people who are for the computer programm would say that people trust computer programms every day, for example in banking transactions, so give them a try, but those programms are different. The biggest difference is that they are used daily so that a miskate will be recognised faster. The voting is olny one time in two years, so the mistakes won't be recognised so often. And the voting programm will cause more wrong votings than normal humans counting the paper sheets by hand.
