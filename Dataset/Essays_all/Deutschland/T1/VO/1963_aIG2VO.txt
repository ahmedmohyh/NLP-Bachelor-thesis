The listening part was about the use of computerized voting. That sounds very nice but it is only an option for people who are used to an computer. Not everybody will vote on an online program. Some because they are afraid of tecnologc. 
This computerized voting is an option to let the voting not take so much time and there might not be so much faults in counting because it is a machine. But actually computer are programed by humans and they do mistakes. 
Another argument is, that computers are used every day and they vere improved all the time. They got better and better, but voting sytems are only needed one or two times in one year so they might have stil some mistakes because they are not improved enough. 
In the text is said that computerized voting would be better, because some people who have poor eyesight can not read the ballot with all names on it. The computerized voting has an easy-to-use-touch-screen for easier voting. It is also said that with the old voting system it is realy heavy to count all the votes by humans and with this computerized voting this is done quickly and automatically.
