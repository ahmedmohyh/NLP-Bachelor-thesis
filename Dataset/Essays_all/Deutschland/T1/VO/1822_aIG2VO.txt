There is one voiting every two years in the US, but the voting system is in some point pretty inefficent. Now is the question, if it would be better to use computers to vote for the candidates. There are a few pro arguments and con arguments. 
First of all there is the fact that everyone needs a computer to vote or the knowledge about using a computer. Now we can see the first problem. Not everyone can effort to buy a computer. Thus not everyone can handle a computer.
Furthermore there could be an error in the system and if that happens there will be no way to recount the vote. 
On the other hand it takes a lot of time to count every sheet of paper, also there could be the problem that people with poor eyesight could mark wrong names for candidate. It is not so easy to read the marks right, because they are pretty small and so many. It could easily happen to be wrong in counting.
Even more important is the fact that voting on paper can be recounted all the time. So as you can see there are two different ways of seeing this idea.
The main part of the presentation was that computer would be the better option. 
We should trust the system, because so many people already use online banking and that is even more dangereous.
