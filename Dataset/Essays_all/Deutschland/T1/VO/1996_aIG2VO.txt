Most of the critic says that they want the old traditional system back. They think that the voting system in the US is inefficient and the traditonal system renews the US with their own way to read the vots for the candidates.

But the other side of the Opinion thinks about the traitionnal replacing system and definetly critices it. The majority could vote for the wrong candidate it says , and when the humans has something with his or her eyes like he can not the see anything clear or the letters are to small popn the paper so he or she has problems to mark the right one which he or she want to vote. 
They want computer voting because they think that it is erfficient and easier to mark the right vote for the canidate.
The disagree arguments of that part are a kind of the same in the argument befor. The people how plan the voting casting have fear thet the computer has a kind of error so he could destroys the vots as well. 
Another point is that people how don't know how to take the computer in a right way could get problems and don't know the right way. So maybe if they think whta is that kind of technology and why it is used to vote candidates for the politic way.
