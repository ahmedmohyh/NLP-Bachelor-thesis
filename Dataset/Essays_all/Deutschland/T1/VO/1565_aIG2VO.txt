Now I wan`t to name the differences between the text and the audition.
The topic is about different voting systems in the United States. It`s clear, that there are different opinions about these systems.
In the first system you have to make a mark on a paper. Someone say that this is problematic because it needs much time to go through thousand of ballots and it isn`t good for the environement because of all the paper.
In the other system you have to make a mark in a computer. This is more easily for the "Auswertung", but there are problems with cheating or hacking them.
In conclusion there are different systems with good and negative points and because of this there are different opinions about the named systems.
The text says the the one system is better and the audition says the other one is better.

(I have problems by understanding the audition, because it`s too loud in the class)
