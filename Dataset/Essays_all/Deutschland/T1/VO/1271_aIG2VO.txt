Computerized Votings would be easier for people with poor eyesight, but it would be harder for people who aren't afford to computers. And humans are supposed to make errors, but computer will also make errors. If the voting gets deleted, or the computer misses to count some votes, it's impossible to do a recount and they have to make the voting again, because the votes won't get saved somewhere else, even the Computer System could be damaged and wouldn't count the votes at the voting. And gouvernments and individuals don't trust computerized voting systems, but they're using it for sensible messages and bank transactions and those are very important, maybe more important then a Voting. And why should the Voting like its today get computerized? People have many years of experience at doing this and it is getting better at every single voting.
