Voting

Today, november the nineth, 2016 at ten o' clock the gouverment is going to anounce the new president of the United States of Amerika. Donald Trump. But how is it possible that he won the election? Might there be a miscount like in 2000? And if so, how to improve the system? Many questions on this important day, which was 26 years ago the most happy day for a lot of german inhabitants.

The speach, we just listend to, talked about a computerrise voting instead of the old election system, the USA use since almost 250 years. One of the most important disadvantages of a computerrise voting is that not everybody has the possibility to use a computer. Many inhabitants of the USA can't afford a computer or don't know how to use them. Futhermore some people are affraid of using a computer. 
But the text talks about the human mistakes, which could be make while counting the votes. For example many people have poor eyesight and vote for the wrong candidate by an accident. It says, that only a computerrise voting could solve the probleme of miscounting. Moreover it is much quicker. 
The probleme, which the speach tell us about, is that computers are made by humans, thus the human mistakes stay. Also an error means thousands of miscounds, which couldn't be removed.  
Moreover the election in the USA just take place every second year. For this special event we could use the old election system and count the votes without a computer, also if there is the posibility of a miscounting. Everything is better than a computer system that is to risky.
