In the listening part the argument that in traditional voting voters can make mistakes and vote for the wrong candidate from the text was picked up and she said that people who don't use or own computers can be afraid of the computerized voting and don't vote at all or they could also make a mistake while voting because they don't know how to use the computer used for voting.
Also the point from the text that people can make mistakes counting the votes was picked up and the woman who spoke said that the programs used for counting the votes are also just made by human which means that they can also have flaws and if a computer has an error while counting votes maybe thousands of votes will be lost because their is no physical vote. If a computer program has an error you can't just recount.
She also touched the point that we trust the computer technology in the banking transactions and said that those are programs which are used every day and it took a while till they where as good and had no flaws as they are today. Voting programs meanwhile would only be used maximum twice a year which means that they would't be as realible as the banking programs are because they cannot be tested as frequently as the banking programs are.
