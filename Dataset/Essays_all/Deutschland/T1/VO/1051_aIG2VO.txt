The presentation informs about the disadvantages that can accure by using computers in a vote.
 It may look simple for people who can work with computers but the people who are not good with this technology will be in trouble. If a problem accured in the system the consequences would influence the voting result a lot. And because of the fact that those systems were designed by humans, mistakes can naturally happen. The improvement is hard - systems like these, were not been used that often, especially voting systems.
This argumentation builds a contrast to the text before.
A lot of disadvantages would be prevented if there would not be the traditional way anymore. 
Mistakes while counting vote by vote are possible without newest technology. A modern computer system does not make any mistakes and the result would be 100% correct. People with bad eyesight would have an advantage too - the new system would make it way more easiely to give the vote for the candidate you really want. To cross the wrong box not on purpose would not be a mistake that can happen anymore. Those advantages would contribute to a vote without any mistakes.
Both sides have their arguments that may have advantage and disadvantages.
