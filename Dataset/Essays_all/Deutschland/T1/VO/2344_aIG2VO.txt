The woman talked about how save the voting systems in the United States are. The votings means the vote and the counting of it, make on a computer are as save as the person would do the vote him-/herself and the counting of the vote would make a person too. There are problems at both sides, mostly the counting because people sometimes forget some papers but the computer is not so exact with the vote and make mistakes. She thinks that the systems on the computers are  not good enough. She sees the problem in the program of it and other systems like the counting of money in banks are used dayly so they really need a good system. 
The text says somethink different. This person thinks, that people make more mistakes than a program of a computer would do.
