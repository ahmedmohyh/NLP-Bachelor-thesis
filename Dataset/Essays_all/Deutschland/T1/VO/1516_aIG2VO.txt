In the folowing essay it should summerise which points the text and the speech explain.
Voting a president or another politician is always  a difficult topic, but how should we vote with computers or with ballots, as it's usual. The text is against voting with ballots, the speech is against voting with the computer.
Humans can make mistakes and could miss a few votes. Also it is much work to count all the votes in every state. For the people who vote, especially people who haven't the best eyes it is very difficult to mark the right candidate in the whole list, if they're many candidates. On the other hand, to mark one candidate it easier for all people, especially if they don't handle with computers in their daily life. And a few votes in every state for the president vote, for example, is not important for the whole election. 
Computers could make it easier to mark the right candidate. But if the computer has an error it can make 1000 of votes wrong or the computer could miss them. Also it is difficult to make a program, which make no mistakes, because you have to test it often and an election is not so often. For older people it is also difficult to handle this computer, because they might haven't seen a computer in their whole life.
