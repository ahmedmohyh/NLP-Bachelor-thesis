The listening was about the advantages and disadvantages for the use of computerized voting systems. The text says that many people have problems by making a small mark next to the name because poor eyeseeing poeple cant read the large sheet correctly.  So people can change how big the things are written on the computer so they wouldn´t mark for the wrong candidate. We know from the listening that not everybody knows how to use a computer and not everybody can affort a computer. So people who use a computer daily know how computers work but other poeple might have problems with the voting. Humans make mistakes. That was said in the listening and in the text. In the text there is the question if the computer voting is really trustworthy. We got some infomation about that topic in the listening. One fact is that humans programm the computers, so there can be mistakes in the computersystems too. And that would be a much bigger problem because we have many more incorrect votings if hunderts of poeple vote with a computer with errors in the system than we have when some poeple mark the wrong candidate.  But one advantage for computerized voting doesn´t last that long and is most likely to be correct, that was said in both sources.
