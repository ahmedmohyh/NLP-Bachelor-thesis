There are traditionally sometimes problems with counting the votes of the election in the United States. So the question is, whether you should computerize the election. But that would only makes it easyer to vote for people with the knowledge of computers. People without the knowledge could have fears to vote on a computer and could stop voting. Computer could also have an error and if they do a mistake the problem would be way much bigger because if they miscount the votes it is not just about like ten votes it coukd be about a thousand of votes. And it needs time to have a perfect computer system and it has to be tried several times befor it could be used. In the U.S. there is an election every two years so it is not possible to try this new system very often.
But the old voting system is very inefficient too. There are inaccurate coutings of votes and some people vote accidentally for the wrong candidat because for example of poor eyesight. So the question is whether you should have the traditionally voting system with some mistakes of the counting and some accidentally wrong votes or you should have a new system with computers which could have way bigger errors in counting and people woh have fears to vote.
