The woman speaking is against changing the the traditional voting system to a computerized one. She says that it may be helpfull and easy to use for people used to a computer but may be hard for people that are not used to them and that this would scare them away from voting. So not everybody would vote even when their votes are important because there are canditates with the same amount of supporters and when they are left away the other candite may win. The new technology for voting would have an easy-to-use touch screen. The voters would only have to touch the name on the list and could not miss it like in the old system with the ballot where esspecially people with bad eyesight have problems. They would get help on the screen because they can magnify the name on the screen for better viewing which is something that can not be done on the ballot. The woman against this new system says that there will still be mistakes because computers are human made and when there is a problem in the programm many votes, she says up to 1000, can get lost and this is way worse than som human mistakes done in the voting itself and in the vote-counting. The old ballot system would only have some few mistakes and would not be as serious as the computer mistake. She says that it would be impossible to re-do the voting when it is done on a computer. When a mistake is made in the human counting process there has to be a long and expensive recount. Computers would remove the problem of human mistakes which opposes the idea of the speach. We are already trusting the technology everyday in important things like banking transactions or to communicate highly sensitive information. In contrast to this is said in the speech that this technology got developed over many years and we use them everyday. Voting technology would be new everytime it is used because the votings are only every two years maximum because some states do not vote that often.
