In the speech is said that pheople who dont are used to use computers could accidentaly vote for he wrong candidate. In the text is sad this happens also in the traditional voting system because the ballots are small and people with bad  eyes can accidantaly mark the wrong candidate. In the speech is also said that people who are afraid of computers wont go vote anymore. A computer doesnt remaovve the possibility of a human error because they are programmed by humans. A mistake in the programm can cause that thousands of votes can get deleted, whch makes a recounting of the votes impossible. The text says that a recount of the votes by humans is very expensive. According to the speech computersystems have o be optimised over years, but this is not possible for a voting programm because tey arent used very often. In text is said that tha chances of making a mistake in the old system are very high because there are so many ballots. Because of the magnification funktion the computersystem is better for people with bad eyes.
