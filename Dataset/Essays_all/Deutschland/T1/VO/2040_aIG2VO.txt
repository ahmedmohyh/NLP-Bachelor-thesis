In the lecture is said that the computerized voting system may cause more problems than people things. The argument from the text that a technical system will prevent accidently voting for the wrong candidate is a critical point in the lecturers eyes. She sais that only people who are known to computers and technical stuff will know how to use a computerized voting system, people who don't will have major problems with such a way to vote. The fear of miscountings is also a thing why the government and many people want to have a more modern, technical way to vote.But as it's said in the lecture, a computerized system is also installed by humans, and if people think that the offices will make counting mistakes while counting the votes, they should also be aware that people can also make a mistake while creating a voting software. And a software can also crash, which would cause a bigger problem than a miscounting. Because the problem with computerized systems is, if they stop working, fewer things can be done than when a person forgets to count a few vote.
