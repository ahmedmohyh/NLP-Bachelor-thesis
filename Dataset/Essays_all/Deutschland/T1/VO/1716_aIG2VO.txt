The voting systems in the United States of America is full of mistakes and iaccuracy. The old way is to let human count the votes one by one. Nowdays computer systems can do their jobs. But the main question is. Can we fully trust these computer systems in important votings like the election of the president of america? This is also a topic in the news right now. On state wants to recount the votes, beacues they think the system has been tricked. The dont want Donald Trump to be president.

Counting every vote by humans costs a lot of time and brings mistakes. To count all thousands of ballots by a human being must make mistakes. Also people with a poor eyesight can have problems to set their mark at the right place on the large ballot with all the candidates. The letters are often very small and it is easy to jump into the wrong line. On a touch screen it is easy to mark the right one, because you can zoom in and can be for sure, if you marked your favorite candidate. When it comes to counting in todays world computer systems are used. Some people say they are safe and we can trust them, because they are used daily in banks and other. The technic should deternemite human errors, but can we fully trust them? In elections like Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton many critics will easily say the system was tricked or even hacked. So are these machines really better then the human being? They would give you less work, but maybe they make more mistakes or it is able to cheat very easily? The discussion about this topic would take a long time and maybe never and.

The best way would to do both. If we really want to know the true answer we need to trust the human and the machine. we should better check twice to be for sure. And sometimes its not only the machine that is tricked.
