Every democracy is based on elections. Through elections people are able to represent their political views and not being a fulltime politician. Elections in small groups as a class or sport team is simple, but for presidential elections, when more than 200 million people are going to vote, can cause problems. A solution could be a computer based vote, which the text and the audio refers to. I'm going to summarizes those and compare them to each other in the following text.

The text states that computerized voting can make elections way more efficient than they are right now. 
One example is that a ballot is often a mess and it's hard to find the right canidate on the ballot. Sometimes the voters might even make mistakes, by electing the wrong candidate because of that. Computers could make that easier for them. 
Also, humans have to count every ballot one by one which is a lot of work, which could be made more efficient by using computers.
In the end the text reffers to the use of technology in almost everything we do, even in top secret government affairs. So there shouldn't be a a fear of using technollogy in elections.

On the other hand, there might be a problem that people aren't used to computers and aren't able to vote or will be afraid to vote because of that.
In addition, the computerized vote will be programmed by humans, so there is still a possibillity of human error, but this time it is way worse. The audio states that humans might forget a few ballots or miscount them, but if the technollogy is programmed wrong it could mean a miscount of millions of votes.
In the end the audio reffered to the use of computers in other areas. The problem is that bank computers are used daily and had problems in the beginnign too, but an presidantial election is only every four years, so there is no much testing of the technology for that one event. It would be fatal if that would go wrong.
