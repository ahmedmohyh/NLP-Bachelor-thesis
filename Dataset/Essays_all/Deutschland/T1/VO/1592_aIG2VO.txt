The main opinion of the speach`s autho is that computerized votings have many negative aspects and could have fatal consequences: Firstly, there are some people who do not have a computer and do not know how to use one, especially old people for whom the voting would be a huge obstacle. The text gives a completely different argument, it says that especially for old people a computerized system would be a blessing because they could see it better and it is better structured.
Another argument given in the speach are the mistakes that computers could make. The consequences of an error in the voting, for example caused by a defect computer, could be fatal. Again, the text says something different, it says that humans make mistakes which leads to miscounts. Sometimes these stay undetected which is bad and if they are detected there is an expensive recount.
Furthermore the technical items can be manipulated. All in one the woman speaking says that computerized voting systems can not be fully trusted.
The text gives this as a negative aspect too but also says that we use technology every day and have to give the possibility of computerized voting systems at least a thought.
