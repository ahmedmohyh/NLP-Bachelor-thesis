The first text is about the inefficiency of the human-lead voting system used in the USA.
It states that the votes were counted inaccurately and inefficiently. Also, it says that a human error couldn't be avoided and there would somehow occur a mistake. The author suggests computerized voting system as a solution for improved accuracy and less confusion. Older people who have eyesight problems were, according to the text, not able to really understand the system. The ballot wouldn't be large enough for people to get a necessary overview and rather confusing. Errors in counting and wrong votes could lead to problems and should be replaced by computerized voting systems.
On the other hand, the women in the audio doubts the accuracy of a computerized sytem. She states that even though people are used to use computers on the daily, for banking transactions or communication, some weren't able to use the specific voting system because of the lacking knowledge about technology.
The fear of technology would discourage some citizens to vote. Also, she says that a computer system could be manipulated easily and thus shouldn't be relied upon. A system error could cause even more wrong votes than a human mistake.
Finally she says that the valuable information shouldn't be messed around with and should be treated highly sensitive, which was provided by a human voting system.
