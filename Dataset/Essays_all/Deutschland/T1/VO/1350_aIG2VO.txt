The information given by the text are favoring computerized voting. In the text they give the arguments, that people with poor eyesight can mark the wrong candidate. With computers they only need to touch the name on the computer and they can also change the size of the names for an easier voting process.

On the other hand, the speech points out, that people, who don't know how to use computers, can have a hard time. For someone who uses computers everyday, it's not that big of a deal, but for someone who isn't using technology can even stop them from going to vote,

The old voting system has a huge flaw, how the sheet says. It does rely to much on humans counting, which leaves room for human errors. This leads to errors in the final numbers of votes and could decide some elections. If a human error is detected, everything needs to be recounted, which is a huge waste of time.

The woman's opinion on errors by humans is, that also programs can have errors, because the code is written by humans. And if one error accurs, not only one computer is affected but everyone. This is far more impactful, than some small ones by humans.

The last argument from the paper states, that banking transactions already are done with computers and they don't make mistakes. This is why the argument, that computers are too risky is just a bad one.

The woman's opinion about why banking transactions work, is because they had alot of time to adjust them and they get used everyday. Elections only are held every few years, which doesn't give enough information to fix these mistakes and make computers efficient in votings.
