The speech is about the voting system in USA, and now i will summerize the arguments and show the differences to the text.
To start of, the speeker wants to hold the traditional voting system. Her argument is that the faults in a programm is almost more bad than a fault in the traditional voting system. Additionally she questions what is about the people, who don't want or can use the computer, because they can't be part of the election in this voting system.
The text is about the same topic, but his argumetation is pro-computerized voting. Another contrast to the speech is that the traditional voting system is full of mistakes and inefficient. Furthermore the humans make more mistakes than computers and with the new voting system the election would be quickly. 
Finally the speech arguments on the base of the text and tries to destroy it.
