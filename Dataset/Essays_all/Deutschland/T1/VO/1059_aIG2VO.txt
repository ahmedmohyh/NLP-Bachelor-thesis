Actuel, after the voting of the new U. S. präsident Donald Trump, there is a big discussion about the voting system in the USA. Critics of the traditional system with people, counting the containings on the "ballot" may say that the persons who are allowed to count the votings kann make mistakes but the risk when using computerized counting systems are much havier because computers can take out much more votings by an error than an person who forgot one name on the ballot. another problem when using the computers for the voting ist that big parts of the population have problemes with the small letters on a computer or coud get in trouble with the whole new system or the computer technology. 

In comparison with the text we see that the text is more on the side in favour of the new counting system with the computer technology. The text explains that its easy to use an computer with an touch screen where the voter just has to tap the name of his or her candidat. There we see the first different fact between the text and the präsentation. The text also see the aspect of the costs. an electronic way of voting can be much cheaper when the technical base exist. On the other hand the text dont see any danger of cumputer errors. To that theme the text told the reader that politics allways trust the computer technology that they use every day making banking transactions or communicate with other politics about sensitive informations.
