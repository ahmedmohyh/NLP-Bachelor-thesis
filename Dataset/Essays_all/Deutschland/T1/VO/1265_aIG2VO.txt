People who oppose the computerized voting system, see a disadvantage for people, who do not often use computers, as they might have trouble using it in the right way, said argument is also the reason why those people do not believe, that folks with poor eysight are being helped, if there is the possibility of amplifying the size of a text, as certain people just do not know how to do it . This would lead to people eventually choosing a candidate they did not want to vote or to certain people not voting altogether, because of the feear of technology. Futhermore it is believed, that a computer error is worse than a human error, as a human can only miscount a couple of votes, whilst a technological error is often based on an error in a programme, which could lead to thousands of votes being misscounted. People who are for the computerized voting system often happen to regard the usual voting system as inefficient, as they do not see why some people happen to not be able to navigate a simple computer programme to, for example, amplify the size of a text. Those are the same people who believe, that the counting of votes by computers is more efficient, because computer errors admittebly occur, but not as often as human errors, so that the number of misscounted votes by a human outweights the number of misscounted votes by a computer.
