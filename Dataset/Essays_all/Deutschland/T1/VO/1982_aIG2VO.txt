The voting system in the United States
Some people say that the voting system in the United States is very old schooled and should be changed. 
Because of mistakes and inaccurate counting of votes some think, a computerized voting system is a better idea. For example the elderly or people with poor eyesight in general, aren't able to vote for the candidate they want to vote for. In the United States voters have to find the names of the candidate they chose inbetween many other names. Each and every voting ballot has to be counted and it often happens, that the counters make mistakes and they have to make a long and expensive recount. As we use computer technology for banking transactions and other important things why not for voting? 
Computerized voting isn't easy for people who aren't used to using a computer. Although technology ran very far the last years you can't expect from everyone to have a computer or a smartphone. If an error appears in the computer programme it's much harder and leads to be impossible to make a recount than with the old- schooled system. To continue, computerized voting also can't be fully trusted. 
In the United States there are votes every two years. That isn't very much and the system can't be really developed through that amount of time.
To sum up, both ways of voting have their pros and cons, which have to be thought about very good. But sometimes you have to change things that have been the same for a long time and give new ideas a try.
