In the audio they said that computerized voting could be a problem for old people who are not used to work or use computers and also for poor people who can not even buy a computer. So if there would be a computerized voting system actually a big amount of people would not be able to participate at the votings. In the text they mentioned that with old voting systems they rely on people to count the votes which turns into many mistakes and recounts. But computers can also make mistakes and if they do we wouldn`t even notice that. The main message from the text was that the old voting system is inefficent. It might be true that it takes longer but it coulkd also be a good idea to not let the computers do everything for us and instead rely on our strenghts. The argument that people with poor eyesight can easily make the cross in the wrong spot is also not very strong because then we are just suppose to make better voting sheets and the problem is solved.
