The voting systems are something, which is everytime important and so it gives critics to the the old voting systems. 

In the old voting system, a lot of people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate, because they have to find the right name on a large paper to make a small mark next to it. This isn´t easy for everybody, because some people with an poor eyesight often mark the wrong name. Besides the old voting systems
 aren´t good to count, because officials must count it many times to make sure, that they´re right. So they say, that computer systems are better for the voting, but then the old people or people, who don´t do a lot with technology, have problems with it and mark the wrong name too. Besides it could happen, that a few computer systems have an error, so you must vote again and there is the fact, that the programms are made by humans and humans make mistakes, but this shouldn´t happen and so you can´t trust this programms.

At all the computer system must to be improved and until this it´s better to vote with the old voting system, because everybody understands it and knows how it works.
