The main part of the speach was that Human error could appear too in a computer because it was programmed by Humans who can make mistakes. If a error would happen you could not recount it because it was all saved on a PC and if this has an error the Data would probably be lost. Another main part of the speach was that most of the old people are not used to deal with computers and could be confused by the new expirience and click the wrong thing. Also she mentioned that the systems didn't work flawlessly at the beginning at the banks, why would they work now.
The arguments don't match with the text in the following points. In the text it was mentioned that we rely on computers every day so they would work perfectly but in the speach she said that computers didn't work so perfect at the beginning so why would they now be doing it. Also in the text was mentioned that a Human error could appear while counting and computers wouldn't do that but if you trust the speach you know that Human error can also appear in computers because they are programmed by Humans. You can also manipulate computer systems so the result would be manipulated just like with the traditional system.
