The text above is for voting with computer systems and the presentation which I heard is against voting with computer systems.
One argument of the presentation is that there could be trouble in using the computer systems because not everyone is able to work with computers. Another argument of the presentation is the possibilty of human error because of problems of the computer programms, which have to make by humans. The text above is for voting with computer systems because it says that the voting systems are inefficient often has mistakes because of human error. Also voting with computer systems would make the voting easier because if there are mistakes of counting the votes a recount has take to place, which is long and expensive.
