In the text is sayed, that it´s very fast given, that people make wrong votes on their voting pages, because they must have to search the name on a large sheet  of the paper with many names and people who can´t see so much they make the mark at the wrong person because they can´t realy read it. The next problem is, that people who check out the votes often must have to count them one by one, because the pc systems are to old and than they can´t read it sucessfully. The new voting machines have an easy touch system and so it´s very fast that they tap the wrong person and a good thing with pcs is, that the pcs count the votes by their selfs and no person must count them one by one. In the speach is sayed, that pcs are the best methode for votings, because they make no mistakes and people havent got a big work with it and they rate, that somebody makes a mistake while counting isn´t the problem anymore.
