There are many problems with the voting system in the USA. One problem is that not all people can handle a computer so they can cast a wrong vote in the text you can see that the author thinks people makes more count mistakes then a computer but  noboady knows if a computer counts the votes better then a human because the humans programmed the computer. The question is : do computers really do a better job then humas who programmed them? In Addition you can say that one computer error can make the whole vote uncomplead because more then thousend votes can  be deleated. In the tex it says that some people with eyeproblems maybe can´t read the names on the list, but is that better on a computer? The names on the computer aren´t written bigger. A last point is that one problem from the text says that you have a very long list if you become a paper you have first to search your name. On a computer it is not better you have to search your favourite name, too.

All in all you can say that it is not better to vote on a computer then to vote on a list with names.
