During the audience I recondnize that there are not only positive points and in the writing part they don´t tell anything about those problems.
For example she worries about what would happend, if there are people how can´t handle withe the computersm, for example old people. This would be more difficult than the regular/old voting system. She also mentionted, how often you are going to vote for sombody (what is really important). An other point, which is in the text but not in the audience, is that in the old system there was a large piece of paper and it takes a very long time to find the name of the person you want to vote for.
But in some points they agree with each other, for example both see the positiv aspect that it smore easily to count the votes by a computer. In this way its nearly impossible to have some counting mistakes, wihch are in the old voting system very easy to make. And that with the new voting system there isn´t the risc taht somebody cheadted during the counting so that the person ,they´d like to win, win.
