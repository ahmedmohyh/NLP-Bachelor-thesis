One aspect is that the computers are not more trustworthy than the humans, because the human beings invited them. When the people miss some ballots it has not a huge impact on the election. But if there is a mistake on the computer system, it could be possible that thousand of ballots are missing. That would be a big problem when you refer it to the election. Another point is that many people cannot afford things like a computer or they do not know how to use it. So the possibility to make a mistake, e.g. vote for the wrong candidate, is higher. 
The text says that a computerized voting would be better than the traditional voting. The coumputer sytem has not the problem to make mistakes by counting the ballots. But the people who has to count it by hand would make many mistakes. But the audience meant that the computer system could make mistakes too, because it is made by human beings. And if there is a mistake in the system it is a bigger problem, because the impacts are way bigger. The text shows that especially old people coul vote for the wrong candidate, because of their eyesight. This refers to the aspect of the audience that it could happen too when you vote on your computer. Soem people do not really know how to use it, so they coul vote for the wrong candidate too. On the ballots they can mark the name, so they know, which person the do not want to vote for.
