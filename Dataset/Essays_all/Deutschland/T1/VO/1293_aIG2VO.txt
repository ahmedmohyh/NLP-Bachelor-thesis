The voting system is computer based and not easy to do for everyone except those who are used to it, because there are many computer unknowen for example older people how arent able to use a computer as anyone else. There are many possible things that could happen to manipulate the vote for example a mistake in the programm could lead to thousands of wrong answers. The computer based voting sytem is way easier to use when it comes to the countation of the results and its easier to trick or erase an answer. The more technological voting system is way more efficient but many people still say that they dont trust it and its use. So they dont want it to become the nationwide voting system.
