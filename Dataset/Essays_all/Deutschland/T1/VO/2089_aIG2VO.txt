In the text and in the presentation they discuss about voting with computers or paper. In the text they are against the normal voting with papers. For example old People, which can't see much, could vote for the wrong person, because on a paper are so much names and maybe they can't read it right. 
They said, computers are easy to use, people can find the right name to vote and it should be not a problem, because today computersystems like that use everybody.
Computers are more helpfully to make not so many mistakes, because if they have normale papers to vote, maybe they will forget some.
But in the presentation it seems like they are the opposite. 
They asked, what is about the people which don't use the computer every day, who can't handle it.
They trust computer and the technology, but what happend, when the computersystem get haked or something like this:
and the voting is only once and they want to use a system like people use every day. 
But on the other side they can handle it better, because today, the most of the people can handle a computer. Its easyer to read and easyer to handle.
The only touch the candidat's name and if its wrong, they can deleted it and touch the right name again.
And for example governments use computersystems with important information too, so it should be safe to use it.
