Today many votings are made with complicated votes where the people who should vote for another person have to circel in one name of the person they would vote on a big piece of paper. May some people who are not able to see as good as many other people circle the wrong name either if they would vote for someone else but they vote wrong because they could not see enough. The new technology allows a less complicated voting with the new technology of computers. You can vote your favourite (maybe) politician by touch on the name you would like to vote to on a big touchscreen from the computer. Another problem on the older voting history is that all the votes have to be count together by hand and if there is any error because of an wrong count they have to count all the votes from one again and have to start from the beginning. But even if humans make mistakes by counting wrong also the computers may make some mistakes because they are used by humans too. The new technology with computer system is good and easy to understand for people who know how tu use them but what about older people who are not even teached how computers have to be used? In the text they say that the new technology voting with computers are much better than the old votings where you have to vote by circlying the name of the person you would vote on a piece of paper. But as I heard the Listening-part the new method of computer voting is as good as the old one where you have to circel it because even with a computer you can make mistakes because of human who count wrong on computer or without them.
