While the article is in favour of using computerised voting systems in the US,the lecture states critic concerning the use of modern technology. Firstly, it says many Americans would not use computers on a regular basis, so a computerised voting system would be too complicated for them. The article however says that computerised voting machines were quite easy to use and the voters had a much better oversight. Additionally, there could not be any human error and a computer would not make mistakes. On the other hand, the lecture points out that even in computer programs there can be mistakes, because these programs are written by humans, and a fault in the computer program may be much more fatal. This ploblem is enhanced by the fact that unlike in the old voting system, there is no sheet of paper containing the vote, so data can be lost much easier. 
The article raises the argument that people trust many important issues to computer programs and these nearly never make any mistakes. But the lecture states that these important programs are used daily and have been checked many times, so mistakes would be highly unlikely, while there are natiowide votes every two years only, so the program is tested much less often. 
All in all, the lecture opposes the opinion of the article, that computerised voting systems would be much more efficient.
