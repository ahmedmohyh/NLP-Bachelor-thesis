The text is about the problems the US has with the voting system during the election. Traditionally they use paper sheets with a long list of the names of the candidates. Because of that a lot people chose the wrong name for example if they cannot see good enough and also the people who count the votes often count it wrong so they have to count it again. Critics of this system now want to invent a computerized voting system with touch screens that would make it easier for everyone to see  and tick the candidates of the list. Also the computer has no human errors so it won`t fail to count the votes. These critics also mention that people all over the world trust computers in there daily life so why shouldn`t they also in the election. 
The woman in the video is complaining about that new voting system. She claims that it is not, as said in the text, an easy way for everyone, because old people or people who are not used to an computer can hardly vote or don`t vote at all because they are afraid of making a mistake. Also the computer systems are programmed by humans what doesn`t make them more relieable than a human. If there`s an error, not only one but thousands of votes will be miscounted and it is impossible to recount them as it is on a paper sheet. The computersystems that we use every day, for example in banking transactions, needed a long time to get trustworthy and to function right. Nowadays they only function accurately because we use them every day and we`ve learned from the faults we made in the times these technologies were invented, while the systems that would be used for the election would have more problems because it would not be used often enough.
