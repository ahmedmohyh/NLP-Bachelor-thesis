Today, the efficience of election systems is often discused. The traditional election system is critiziced for being inaccurate, because mistakes when officials count thousands of votes can't be prohibited. Futhermore computer programms are already used in many cases, where they have to work with sensitive data, without people worrying about mistakes. As well for some people the visibility of the names on the ballot may not be good enough. Thats something opponents say could be easier with computerized voting technology, because could change the size of the text for a better viewing. But computerized election technologys have problems as well. Many people who do not have contact with computers each day may not know how to use them an because of that they will have problems in taking part in they election. Finally computer programms are written by people, which might be a risk, because they could programm the computers wrong on purpose to manipulate the election secretly.
