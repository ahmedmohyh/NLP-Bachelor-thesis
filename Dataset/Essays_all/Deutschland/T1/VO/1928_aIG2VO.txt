The presentation was on the topic of different voting systems just as the given text but when it comes to an opinion the two of them differentiate because instead of praising a computerized voting system the presentation shows its problems and the reasons to stay with the traditional voting system.
At the beginning, the women giving the presentation agrees with the text concerning the problems of traditional voting. She reveals the contradiction in claiming that every human makes mistakes and having confidence in a computer system programmed by humans. Furthermore, errors during this process can lead to way more difficult problems, for example, instead of a few votes miscounted by humans in the traditional system such a mistake can lead to thousands of miscounted or even ereased votes. In addition to that, with a computerized system a recount becomes impossible. Moreover, in the presentation you can see the differentiation between the complex computer systems that are part of our everyday life and a voting system which isn't used daily but just for elections. Therefore, it is claimed that it will be hard to improve this computerized voting system. 
Finally, you can say that the text and the presentation may be about the same topic and both see problems in the traditional voting system but these are already the only similarities. The presentation agrees with the problems named in the text but comes to another conclusion.
