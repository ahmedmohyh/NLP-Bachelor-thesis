According to the speech, a PC-based voting system is only useful for people who know how to use a computer. Others may be afraid of using them because they don't know how. The text just says that voting on computers is better, because there are no errors caused by humans (for example wrong counting). 
Also, the software the voting computers use could also have bugs in the software code, which was made by humans. These problems inside the software can cause bigger damage than just counting errors that humans make, which the text describes.
While the text says that such PC-systems are used everywhere to deal with important information and therefore also could be used for voting, the speech says that these systems (i.e. online banking) are used everday and are updated all the time. This is not what voting systems are. They are only used once in a very long time, and if something goes wrong, it's a bigger problem.
Overall, the audio counters the text, with mainly the argument that errors in the code of the software (bugs) can result in bigger damage, unlike wrong counting and similar things that humans can do.
