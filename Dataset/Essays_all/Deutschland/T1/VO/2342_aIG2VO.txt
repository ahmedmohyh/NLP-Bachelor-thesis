The topic theme is the voting sythem in the USA.
The votins system is often criticised as being inefficient and having a lot of mistakes.
The text tells us, that the using computer would be the better way to count the votes. One of the texts arguments is, the human counting workers can easily make mistakes while counting. The contra argument of the audio is, that computers are also programed by humans and they got to be proofed for a very long time, which isn´t that easy, because they only vote once in two years and if the computers make a mistake, it would be even worst than a few forgotten votes by counting them. A technical mistakes could accidently delete a few thousands of votes and change the hole election.
Another argument is, that people with bad eyes often accidently vote the wrong candidate, because they can´t see their names, because they are written very tiny. the fitting contra argument is, that a lot of people don´t know how to use a computer and that this wouldbe even worst for por and old people than not being able to see the names without glasses.
