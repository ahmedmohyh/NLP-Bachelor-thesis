The text gives negative points for the old, traditional voting system in the USA. For this system they use a large piece of paper with many small written names. So it's easy to accidentally mark the wrong person. In the old system they also need to count every single ballot which are thousands of sheets. So counting mistakes are easy to make and if that happens there has to be an expensive recount to get the right result. On the other side there is the computerized voting system which brings also problems. In the audio they say that this system is very difficult to understand for people who don't know how to use a computer because they are elderly people or people who just don't use the computer every day. Another point is that this voting system is not used very often, so there could be errors in the computer program and those errors could lead to major losses of the votes.
