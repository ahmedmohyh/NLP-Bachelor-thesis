The contrast between the given text and the speach is that the text is absolutely against the traditional way of voting and the woman in the speach is absoulutely for the old ways of voting.
The author of the speach says that the new ways of voting are only better for those who are used to technology. Those who don´t have any knowledge about the new technology have big problems and there´s the risk that they could decide to stop with voting, because they find it too complicated. The text describes the other point of view; when the voters make a small mark on a large piece of paper they can easily make a mark behind the wrong cancicate, because of their bad eyesight. Computers can manage this with an easy touch screen function. In the speach it says that you can´t trust computers as much as humans, because the computer can easily make a misscount and the complete voting is wrong. The text analyzes this in a different way; people make mistakes and people aren´t trustable, especially when they have to count so many voting results.
At all, both texts are easy to understand.
