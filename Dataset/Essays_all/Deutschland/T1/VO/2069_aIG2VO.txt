Many people discus whether the voting system that is used in the United States now should change. The traditonal systems should be replaced with a computerized voting system. The people who are for the change of voting system think that it would be more save to vote on a computer than on a normal paper. Human beings are making mistakes and this could not happen so easy with computers. Also less people would vote for the wrong people only because their eyes are to bad to read the paper. On the other side, many people think that the United States should not change their voting system. Using computers would be great for people who are working with computers or spending time with it in their free time. But for those how do not like to use computers or those who are not able to use them voting with computers would be a reason for not going to vote. Also it would not be save to use computers because the vote is just every two years and it would be horrible if the computers would not work. These computerized voting systems would be made by human and that means that a computer could never be saver or cleverer than human being.
