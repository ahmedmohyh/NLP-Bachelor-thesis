It's currently a controverse topic which voting systems work most reliably -- human counters or technology. In the following, I will compare two different piont of views of that issue. 
In the audio, the woman warns us about the use of computers managing the votation counts. Her first argument is that there are actually people who are not used to technology, which could lead to an inability to use such vote systems corrcectly. People might also mistrust the ability of technological systems to substitute the traditional one.
In addition, she points out the missing flawlessness of such systems. In the speaker's opinion, computer-based mistakes can even be far more severe than those caused by humans. In the article, however, it says that with traditional systems, the risk of accidentally ticking a candidate you did not intend to choose is higher, e.g. because of eye problems or because voters do not find the candidate on the sheet.
In the end, it is not worthy in the woman's opinion to investigate in the improvement of technological counting systems since elections only take place every two years. This differs from the central idea of the article: According to it, you should at least "give [the technological vote counting system] a thought".
