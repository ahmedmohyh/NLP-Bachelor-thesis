In the audio I just heard, the speaker was clearly against the use of computers in the voting system. Her opinion was based on the thaught that people who can not afford computers might be discouraged to vote, due to their lack of computer. In general the speaker spoke of the fear of technology. She also stated the possibility of human errors in programming . The text also states human errors as a problem, but in the traditional voting system, because humans are countig the ballots one by one and mistakes might be easily made. The author also states that computers are used in many fields, so why shouldn't they be used in voting as well. On the other hand the audio says, that they are used on a daily basis but are only relaible because they were perfected in their use due to their often time use. Voting does only happen every 2 years so the programs can not be perfected that easily, the speaker said. The text says, that the traditional ballots are difficult to use, because people might be making wrong choices by acident, because they can not read the ballot right, computer screens would be easier to handle and especially people with eye-sight problems would have an easier time voting, so less wrong choices would be made. The audio states nothing on that field.
