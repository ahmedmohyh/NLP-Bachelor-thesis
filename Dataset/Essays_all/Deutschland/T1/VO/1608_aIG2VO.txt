I just read a text about the voting system in the United States and after that I heard a text about the same theme. In the following essay I will summarize the arguments for and against the current voting system in the United States. At the moment in the USA you have to mark the name of your candidate on a sheet of paper. Afterwords people will counte the votes by hand. In the presentation by a woman, you could hear that there are some negatives aspects about using programmed voting machines in the future. Computer systems may be better for young people but what about older people who don't know how to work with technologie? They could get in trouble while voting and this would definitly be a problem. On the other hand, old people may have eyeproblems and it would be easier for them to just click in a display than searching one name between many on a paper - they could easly mark the wrong name. One positive aspect of programmed machines could be that there wouldn't be any human errors anymore while couting, so the text I read. But computers are programmed by human and what if there happens an error while programming? One thousand of votes could be uncounted and destroy a whole election day, so the lady in the listening exercise.
