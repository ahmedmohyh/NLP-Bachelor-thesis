In the reading part it is said that the system of voting in the United States is inefficent and often lead to inaccurate counting of the votes. So the main problem are the Miscounts. Especcially in in close votes it´s damaging. The critics will go from the traditional voting into a computerized voting. A voting on a touchscreen to cast a vote and for easier viewing mainly for older voters who´s eyesight is poor. Another promlem of the voting system nowadays seems to be in the relly heavy work of counters. The counters also makes mistakes and errors. Comutersystems will be automatically and remove the possibility of human error. The reading part said against some people who say it´s to risky that banking systems also work with this technonlogie and everything works well. 

The listening part is against the comuterized voting. They have to trust everyday in the system of computer and a voting is only every second year so the United states must be able to motivate counters to make their work as well as computers do. Otherwise they have to develop a system which works well.

In contrast they both say there´s something to change, but they want to change different things. Want to work with human and want to work with computers.
