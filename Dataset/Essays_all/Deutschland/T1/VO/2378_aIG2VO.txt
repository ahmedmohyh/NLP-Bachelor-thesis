In this essay which I have heard, there is the main theme "The computer voting". As in the written essay you couldn´t hear arguments about the traditional voting system. For some people the computer voting is very comfortable but for many humans this can be a big problem. 
If you don´t use a computer in your daily life you don´t know what to do with it. So there is an argument for the tradiotional voting system. Also the program on the computer is made by humans so there can be mistakes in it. If there are a lot of mistakes in the program, the votes can´t be counted and so the whole counting of votes is a failure. When this happens then all people have to vote again so there is a lot of time which is lost. But programs and computers are e.g.  used in the banking area so there have to be a little security that they are safed. So the thinking is that you can use a program with no bad meaning in the computer voting.

Generally the to essays don´t have to many differences because there are a lot of arguments which support the computer voting and some which hate it. In the written essay there are arguments for the tradiotional voting too.
