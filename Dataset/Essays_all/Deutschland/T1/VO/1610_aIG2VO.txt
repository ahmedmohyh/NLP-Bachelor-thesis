In the previous presentation a person used arguments that are against a voting system based on technology. The person said, that people, who aren't used to computers or who aren't able to afford one, might have trouble voting and even be discouraged to vote at all. In the exhibit of the text though, it says that voting through computers would be easier because the chances of people voting the wrong candidate are lower. Besides that it also contains information about how humans often make mistakes while couting the votes, but the presentation gave a good example that computers are also programmed by humans and that those mistakes can be far more severe than humans counting the votes by hand. In the presentation it is also being said, that even though we trust computer technology with banking, voting through computers would be a different thing. Banking is used daily through technology, but voting happens rarely, so it would take a long time to trust other technologies, because we don't use them regularly.
