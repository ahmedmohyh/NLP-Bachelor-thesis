Traditional voting systems have problems but the computer systems for votings have porblems, too. In the text it says that  in the traditional voting system people vote for the wrong candidate because they mark the wrong name. But this could although happend in the computerized voting system if you touch the wrong name on the screen. 

If people are not attached with the new technologie it is hard for them to understand how it works. It doesn`t matter if the voting machine is easy to use. And if human counts wrong they only miss a few ballots but if the computer is error or makes a mistake they are more than thousand ballot that are going to be lost. The computer might be faster but the humans are more correct. 

The computer systems for voting are not so good as the daily used programs for example for banking. You only need them all teo years so they make more mistakes than we think.
