The speach is a direct counter to the text.
In the text it is written, that people with bad eyesight could easily mark a wrong name. The speach counters by saying, that people who aren't used to computers or are afraid of them could also easily cast a missvote. The speach also gives a counter to the point, that humans can make mistakes when counting votes and computers don't. The speach say, that computers are also programmed by humans and could also have mistakes, wich would lead to over thousands of failed votes instead of just a fev. The speach also counters the conclusion of the text. In the speach it's said that the complex systems that the text mentioned was perfected day by day. They wasn't perfect to begin with and election is only every four years.
So the speach doesn't deny the mistakes of the old votingsystem but conters out all off the arguments for the new system, that was given by the text.
