There are arguments against and for the current voting system and the traditionally voting system.
In the text there are many arguments against the taditional voting system. One major problem is that the voters could mark the wrong name, because the sheet of paper with the names is very long. Thus the voting on paper should be replaced with the voting system on computer. But this voting technic is difficult for people who do not use a computer, especially older voters have got problems with the new technologie. 
On the one hand there are sometimes counting mistakes because humans make mistakes when they have to count thousand of votings and it is very expensive to count again, on the other hand also computers could make mistakes and when there is an error in the computersystem it is mabye not possible to count all the votes again.
