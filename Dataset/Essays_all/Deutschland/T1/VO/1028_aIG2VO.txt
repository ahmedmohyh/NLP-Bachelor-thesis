Elections are a pretty big deal and they are of course very important, so it is bad if mistakes happen. The text deals with the issue, of humans making mistakes, while counting the votes or voting for the wrong person, due to bad eye sight. The solution to these problems is a computer based voting system, that counts the votes flawlessly, aswell as making it sure, that a person votes for their real choice, as you can magnify the candidates names, to be able to read them more easily. But there are of course some people, that are scared of this new system making mistakes, because technology can fail aswell, as humans can. But the text secures, that this system will be as reliable as the technology used for banking or communication issues. 
But the presentation opposes all of this. It says, that if a person is not used to computers, it will have a hard time finding out, how to use this system. Maybe these people wouldn't even vot in the first place, so they don't have to deal with the modern technique. Furthermore the presentation talks about the problems this system might cause, if some one (humans make mistakes) misprograms it. That could cause far more difficulies, than a human miscounting the votes on a few ballots. And even if we use thecnique like this every day and heavily rely on it, the fact that we use it so often made this technique mor advanced, then they were, when they were brand new. By solving problems, the users had, the technology evolved. But a votingsystem, that will only be used twice a year would need far too much time to find the problems within its' programming and solve them. And in the end none of the problems with the regular votingsystem got solved. 
The presentation opposes the text and counters its arguments toatally.
