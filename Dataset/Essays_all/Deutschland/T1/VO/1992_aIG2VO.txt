Summary Voting

There are two different voting systems the traditional voting system, which is currently used by United states and the computerized voting machines, which might replace the traditional system in the future. The traditional voting system has two major problem so has the computerized system. Firstly I'll summerize the key arguments for and against the traditional system, secondly for the computerized system. 
The traditional voting system has two major problems. The inacurrate counting done by humans, which happens because everyone miscounts sometimes and voting for the wrong candidate accidently.The first problem can seriously damage the election, especially if it is a close contest and the second problem happens because the voter has to put a small mark next to the name of the candidate with a poor eyesight or just by accident you easily put the mark behind the wrong name.
The computerized system has similar problems but also ideas to improve the system. One of the major problems is that not everyone can effort a computer or uses it on a regular bases so they can't take part in the voting because the don't have the essential device. The other problem is that the computerized system is programed by humans to so human program human errors. Those errors might be far more damaging than a few miscounts done in the traditional system if for example thousants of counts get removed and they can't get recounted. Both systems have similar problems.
