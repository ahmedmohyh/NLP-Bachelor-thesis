Is it better to use a computer to vote during elections or is the use of real persons couting the votes better?
After reading the text which was given and after listening to the audio text, it is possible to see two sides of the medal.
The text explains, that the system of election in the United States of America is not up to date. People often get confused by those endless papers during to election. often they dont find the candidate they want to vote for and often they also make their x at the wrong place. The text cleary wants to vote with computers in the future. They say, that the voters find their candidates easyer and that this takes less time. Also it should´n happen that offen, that they take their x at the wrong place. Another important point is, that a computer system couts more exact than a human could and is way faster in counting. They proof this with the online banking, which is running good in the US.
The adio presentation I´ve listened to is against election with a Computer system. They say, that people who havent got experience with a PC can´t elect, because tey are not afford to it. They also say, that you can easily touch wrong a vote for a person, you didn´t wanted to vote for. They also ask if computers will be more correct than people counting the votes? It is mentioned, that computers are invented by people, and people do make mistakes, so why can´t a computer do so? After thinking about the computer systems for online bandking and thire first faulst, the conclusion ist, that  with all the mistakes by counting, real persons are better than a computer system for the american election.
