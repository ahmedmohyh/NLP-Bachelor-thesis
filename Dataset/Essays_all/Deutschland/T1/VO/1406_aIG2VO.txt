The voting in the USA is diffrent then in Germany and Europe. They have theire own rules to vote somebody. There are some problems with the voting, for example how to vote...some of them have to vote with a computer. Normaly you think that this is a good idea, but it's not.
The text will show the arguments against the voting with a computer.

Many people are voting and there are espechely old people. But their is the first problem, old people aren't using a computer all day and it's more dificult for them than for other people, cause they can mark easily the wrong person. For young people it's a little bit more easy and they are a generation of technology.
Another argument is that computers can make many mistakes to count the votings and it's hard to trust a computer than a person.
But to count the votings is faster than to count each vote as a person.
