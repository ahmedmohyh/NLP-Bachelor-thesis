To use computers for voting in the USA is on the first view a good thing, but when you think more about it, there are a lot of problems.
Most of the people use a computer, it's the new technology, but there are also people who can't handle with it. Some are maybe afraid of this technology, so they wouldn't go to the elections anymore if they know they have to use a computer for it. 
Some people may be have bad eyes so it's difficult for them to vote on a normal election paper because they have to concentrate and vote maybe for the wrong candidate. But when these people are also afraid of computers and the technology, it's not good to take computerized voting machines for election papers because they just wouldn't elect.
When people count the election papers they could do mistakes, that's a normal thing of being a human, but on the other side are computers also programmed from humans, and when this humans do a mistake while programming, thousands of people have a problem because the elections would be misscounted.
Some people think through this computerized elections the nation would trust the technology more, but when the called mistake while programming happens, it would be lead to it, that all the people who use every day in work or at home a computer wouldn't trust it anymore.
