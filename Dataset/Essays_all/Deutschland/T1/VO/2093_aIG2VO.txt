The technik for voting in the UK is a problematik. Many people say that the old voting system make to much misscountings because normal people count the votes. The new technik want that the voting were made with a computerized system.
In the last years more and more people get unhappy with the old voting system. The say that the people vote for the wrong person because of eye difficulties or the made a note in the wrong line. This is why the want to have a new form for voting.They want to have computerized voting systems. You can change the size of the letters and it is faster to count the votes. By the old form the people count the votes and you need a long time for it but what happend when the coumputer have an error? All the notes are delected . By the old form you can`t delected notes and it is only in a 2 years rhythem. So the people only must count only in two years once a time. The computerized sytem can also make wrong votes . IN addition to that old people or people who don`t use computers don`t know how to do it.
All toghether it isn`t clear what is better for them you have in both sytems pro`s and con`s. The people in the UK must say what they want.
