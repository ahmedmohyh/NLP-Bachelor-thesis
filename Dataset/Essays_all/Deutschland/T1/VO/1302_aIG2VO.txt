The text wants the old votingsystem to be replaced by a new computerized one.
The speech critizises this new system. There are many people who doesn't work with a computer very often. For them it's more complicated to vote computerized. They could vote wrong by accident if they touch anything and doesn't know what they are doing. In the text the opposite of this problem is named. The text on the sheet is often very small so that they can't read the name of the candidate correctly because their eyes aren't the best.  
But computers are easy to use because we use them everyday at work says the text.That is right but the programs we use had been improved many times before they worked so good. And we recognized the mistakes fast because we work with this programs every day. 
The programs for computerized elections we only use every few years. So it would take a long time to improve these programs so that they work correctly.
In this time there could be many mistakes by counting the votes and that would be fatal. The text names humans who do the mistakes by counting the votes. The speech has the same opinion. But in this is also said that computer programs make mistakes because they are made by humans. 
We would need along time to develope confidence with a new voting system but the mistakes that  could happen in the meanwhile make this change too risky is said in the speech.
