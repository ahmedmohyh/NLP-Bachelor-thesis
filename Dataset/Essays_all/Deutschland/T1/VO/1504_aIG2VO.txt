In the speech it says that humans make many mistakes and you can find this in the text too. They say that they make mistakes counting the votes or that the voters make mistakes as they cannot read the tiny letters. Then in the text it says that computers can avoid human mistakes but the woman said that computers are programmed by humans so they make mistakes too. She said that these errors will be terrible because a men only forgets around ten votes and if they recognize the mistake they just count again but a computer forgets about thousands of votes when he has been programmed in a wrong way. Additionally it is not possible for humans to check the outcome as a computerized programm does not collect physical voting sheets. Like in the text she said that men trust computers on a daily basis but that is the point to her. She said that the voting computers are only used every two years so mistakes do not happen that often that people would check the machines. All in all both sources are sceptical but the speech was more than the text was as the text is obviously pro computerized voting even though it may be dangerous too.
