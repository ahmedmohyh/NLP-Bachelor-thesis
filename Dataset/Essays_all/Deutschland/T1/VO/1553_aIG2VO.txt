Votings have always been a hotly debated topic. Even if they are a standard in modern countries, there are still voices saying that votings must be modernized. In the heard speech, a woman gives arguments against the modernisation of the current voting system in the USA.
The woman states that computerized voting is not enough improved and still not accurate enough for letting comuters do the work of voting officials. In contrast to this, critics say that the current voting system easily leads to human error because officials need to count many records one by one.
Another argument is that computerized voting is no physical voting and due to this fact would lead to misunderstandig, misuse and lower voting rates.
Finally, the woman brings forward that there are too many votings in the US to give out computers to every household. Federal elections are every second year and in some states there are elections twice a year. With so many elections it would be impossible to hand out computers and the costs would be too high.
