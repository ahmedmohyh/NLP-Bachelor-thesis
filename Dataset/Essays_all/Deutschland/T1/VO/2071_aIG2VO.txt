The voting system in the United States is only used once in two years, but critics say that it is inefficient and inaccurate. The votes are counted by humans, which leads to different problems. First of all, the papersheet where the names of the canidates are listed is very little and people with poor eyesight, but not only them, everybody, has problems with the small marks. This leads to mistakes and accidentally marking the wrong candidate.The second problem is, that the people which are counting all of the thousands votes, can make mistakes easily. It is almost inevitable, because the duration of the process is so long. Sometimes, the mistakes aren't even noticed, but when they are, they lead to a very long and extremly expensive recount. Humans make mistakes, that's normal, they aren't machines. But critics say that it would be much safer and easier to computerize the voting. On the one hand, voting with computers would be quicker and mistake free. But on the other hand, it is very risky to rely such an important process on modern technologie, because it is able to be manipulated and not completly safe . Against that speaks, that computers are already used in banking transactions, which also contain very sensitive information. Maybe the Unites States should just give it a try!
