There are some differences between the text and the audio. The text must have been written by someone who likes to act with computers and the audio by someone who is maybe older or doesn't work with computers often or all day long.
The author of the text says that you can not trust people. He says a human error is easier there than a computer error but the guy who spoke the audio just said that the computers were build by humans so there can be an error or mistakes like humans are doing them. 
So the main opinion of the text author is that the computers are better for voting and counting votes because if humans vote by their self they have to find their candidate and they have to tick him/her right on the sheets. The guy from the audio has got the opposite opinion that the computers can do as many mistakes as the humans. So humans can count the votes and vote by them self they don't need any help.
But both say it's really important to count the votes right because they just vote every two years nationaly. So if someone gets senat president or something like that they can change a lot in two years so it's important to elect the right ones and to count the votes right for having a nice and harmonic atmosphere in the countries or as well just in the states.
