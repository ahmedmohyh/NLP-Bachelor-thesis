Some people started critizing the acctual voting system. Here are some fittin information and arguments about it. 
The today's voting system is quite old-fashioned. You face a peace of paper and you need to take your time to find the right place to tick the name you want to choose. Next it is hard and inefficent to recount all votes. If you have problems with your eyes it will be a big barrier for you to vote the candidate you want. Moreover it is a great risk you need to take in case it happens that miscounts appears. Mentioable is that you can fake this counting system pretty easily. It is much easier in comparison to evaluate with a computer. You can find your name you want to vote very fast and after you vote it gets automaticly counted by the system. You do not need people for this. 
On the other hand it is not really better option with pc's. If you are not used to pc's you have big problems while you vote. You might acctually vote the wrong one or do not even take part of the elaction because you are afraid of tecnology. In case there is a error or one small mistake in the program it will effect heavily. As a result you need might not even know that something went wrong so you just voted the wrong person. To add it is very expensive to buy enough computers if you only go to elections twice a year.
