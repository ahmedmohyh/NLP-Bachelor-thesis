The hearing presentation was about the voting system in the US. It was taking point on the text. Many people nowerderdays can handle computers and are used to using them. It is easy for them to use it in voting. But if computers replace the paper, many people would have trouble to vote because they can´t handle it. It is also hard or not necassary for some of them to afford the computer for voting when they only need it twice a year. The next generation wants to have the voting done with computers, because it is easyer to avoid human errors. This doesnt make sense because humans made the systems of the computers so they can have errors too, which are way more difficult to fix again or maybe not replacable. Thousands of votes can be lost and not be replaced again. This would be a very big lost which would not be good for the society. The computers get more and more improved with better systems. Because the system used before was not good enough. So if an errror occurs and the system wasn´t good enough to solve the problem, this is a big problem. Humans can count the papers again but  the computer can´t because the votings are lost!
