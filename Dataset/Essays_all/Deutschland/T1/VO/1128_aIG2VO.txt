The presentation shows us the statement of computerized votings. The lady say, that there are many problems if you vote with a computer. One argument of her is, that some people can`t use a computer or have fear to use it. But the text say, that people with a poor eyesight (l.5) can see the names of the candidates easier. The text also is based on the argument, that it is too much work for people to count the votes and it´s pretty much faster to work with a computer than counting every vote alone. But nearly that is the probleme, the lady is showing. If the computer is doing faults, votes of million people are missed and can`t be rebuild. If the people count the votes and they`re doing faults they can count again.
Another big problem, the lady is showing us is, that this system of voting is used only once maybe twice in two years, so you can`t trust it, like systems of bankings which are used daily. All in one there is the human error against the computer error.
