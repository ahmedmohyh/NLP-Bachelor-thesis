The audio and the text are dealing with the american election system, while the text is for a new voting system which is based on a computer programm and the speaker in the audio will keep the old system.
 The main argument of the audio is that many people can't afford a computer to take part in the elections. Also older people even don't know how to interact with computers. For this people it won't be able to take part in the elections. This argument is completly different to the text which ist saying that older people wil have advantages by using a computer, it's easy to use and even people with eyesight problems can vote properly. This is huge difference between these two sources following the audio many people will have problems with computers but following the text many people will benefit from that. Another argument against the voting system is that peoply counting the votes can make mistakes and count a vote wrong but computer programs are build by humans too and if there is a mistake the computer programm for the election it can easily be that thousands of votes are deleted and can't be be part in the election. The text just says that computer programms are safe and won't do mistakes, in fact they are used in the daily banking transactions and even in the communication of highly sensitive information. Towards this argument the audion gives the point that these programms we are using daily and for important things are developed over many years and had in the beginning mistakes which are now solved. But a new voting system based on a computer programm will have in the beginning problems and in fact elections do not take place every day it will take years to make a election computer programm without problems or mistakes. 
All in all the two sources have highly differences like the view of the benefits of computers for older people.
