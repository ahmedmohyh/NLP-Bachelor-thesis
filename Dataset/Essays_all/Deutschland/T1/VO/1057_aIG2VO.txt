The text as well as the audio show me two opinions, about the election system in the USA the text criticises that the old voting system is not reliable anymore becaus especially older poeple, which might have poor eyesight could vote for the wrong person by accident. This could be easyer if there would be a voting system by touchscreen. Also it would be alot faster to count, because computerprogramms could do this in a few minutes or an hour maybe, whilst human mostly need many hours or even some days to finally count. Another advantage would be, that human counting mistakes would be prevented if computer would count the votes, so that the voting overall would get more save.

The Audio´s opinen is the exact oposite of the one the text has given me, it says that older citizen might stop voting because the don´t know or like the digitilisation. As well the talking person is assuming that there would be an option to make human mistakes. If the programms might have a problem with there configuration this might cause even bigger problems, than just some counting mistakes. Antother problem would be that, if there should be a problem with the programm it might happen that a recounting is impossible, so that the people would have to vote twice just because of a problem in the system. Ore that some vote would just dissapear and cause a different ending.
