The strugle of the US election is shown in this text and also in the speech. People are strugeling with the way of voting, because there are two ways. First of all there is the traditional voting where you mark the wanted candidate on a paper. But then there are also computer votings, which can be done at home by people therselves. 
In both sources it says that computers are not too good for voting in such huge contest, like the president election. Many things can go wrong when the voting is just done with the computer, because older people may don´t even have a computer and don´t want to use one. Computers can´t be trusted, because mistakes that human make can also be found in computers.
 So first of all computers can be hacked, so the computer may not mark the right candidate or the computer just shuts down and so all the votes are gone. I guess traditional voting is much better than computer voting, because there are so many bad things about technic voting. Humans do make mistakes that´s not the question, but once or twice per year is not so much, so people can do it. It´s better for everyone and can´t be manipulated so easily. Also the counting of those votings is not too much to do, if they only need to do it once every year for the US election and twice a year for local elections.
