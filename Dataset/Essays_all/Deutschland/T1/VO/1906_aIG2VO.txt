The following text is about the voting system and if the state should change from traditional voting to computerised voting systems.
One of the problems with the traditional voting system is that not everyone can read the names perfectly cause they are printed really small and it is also hard for people with poor eyesight so they can easily mark the wrong candidate and the officials who have to count can make some mistakes.
But is the new computer voting system much better than the old or traditional system? Maybe I is easy for someone who is working with a computer daily but people they do not will get soe trouble by voting with a computer. The system have to be improoved to get nationwide. It can be to complicated for older people to work with the technology voting system. It will not be the problem if there are one or two vote less the it normaly be and the people wont count that wrong that one candidate wins with one vote ahead with the reason that they counted wrong. 
All in all the computerised voting technollogy is at the moment not better than the traditional voting system, because it may have to high computer education level for the people they never use computers in their freetime but otherwise it can make it is easier to tick the right name and do not vote accedently for an other candidate you would never vote for. The computer vote system may be something for the future but to use it nationwide it needs a big improovement.
