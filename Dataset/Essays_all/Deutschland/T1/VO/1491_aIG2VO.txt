In the text and in the speech "voting" the mistakes during votes are discussed and the andvantages and disagvantages of voting on a piece of paper and voting with a computer are named. At first it is said that current vonting systems were inaccurate and would often lead to inaccurate counting of votes. The problem that some people maybe vote the wrong person because they ticked the wrong point on the paper would probably be caused by poor eye sight so especially old people might have a problem with this. Other mistakes at voting on a piece of paper would appear during the counting. The votes were counted "one by one " so humans would maybe make mistakes after a few sheets. So some people would rather do a computer voting but there were also some disadvantages.Even if computer voting would be easier for many people there were also some (for example old people) who were not able to use a computer correctly. This would also cause mistakes that influenced the vote. Some people would think that computers would not make mistakes but they were also programmed by humans and if they made a mistake during the programming it could fake thousands of votes. Making a mistake during counting the votes from the paper could only fake some votes. So the general question would be: How is it possible to vote without making a mitake during voting and counting.
