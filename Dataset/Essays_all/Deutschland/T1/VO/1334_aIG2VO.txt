Donald Trump, the new president of the United States said a lot of times, even before he was elected, that he would fight against a victory of his concurrent, Hillary Clinton, because there are discounted votes in some states. Is another voting system a good idea? Here, I will give a short summary about the text and the presentation.
In the actual voting system, there are a lot of officials, who "often count up the votes one by one" (l.8). They record every vote, but what, if they make mistakes? If they are loosing votes? Many people are saying, that computer votes could make an election much more easier with computer votes, people, who have problems with their eyes, and mark the wrong name on a sheet of paper, could easily select the name on a screen. But what is with the people, who have fear to use a computer, the older generations?
We can not be sure, that computers awre making a better job as the officials, who are counting the votes. If they are loosing one vote... Well, mistakes happen... But what, if a computer is wrong programmized and looses thousands of votes? then you have to start the whole election again.
