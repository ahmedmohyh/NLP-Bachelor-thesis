Should voting in the United States only made by computers? 
Always more people critizize the current voting system in the United States. they found the old methode, voting by papers, very inefficient. One point for that is the wrong counting about how much votes each candidate has. Humans make often mistakes by that and by computers it would be much more safer they said but is this real?
Another point against the old paper voting is that people with bad eyesight could easily make mistakes by choosig their candidate. On a computer screen it should be easier for them to read. 
But is this all true?
Computers are also made by humans, this is a point that some people forget. So imagine one human programms a computer wrong then thousand of votes get lost or something. Or what is with the people who can´t relate with a computer, like older people?
We had a big trust in computers but is this so good? Often we forget that computers are machines which are programmed by humans and not by other machines, they also make mistakes and that is the point which critics often forget.
