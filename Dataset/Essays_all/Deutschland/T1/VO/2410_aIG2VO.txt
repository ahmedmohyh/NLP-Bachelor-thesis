There have always been problems with the voting system because a lot of votes were miscounted and it is also hard for the people to understand the ballot. You can accidentally mark the wrong canidate because the ballot is complicated to read.
 So that is why there is a computer system which should be easier to use for the people. But is that really true? Nowdays there are many people that use technology but there is also a majority that doesn't know how to handle and work with the technologies. The system should be better because it coveres the mistakes that humans make by the written ballots. But the computer system is also made by humans and having an error in a system is much more dangerous than anything else. The voting is only once every two years so it is also hard to develop trust in the computer systems.
Beside all this facts i just said there can also be positive aspects about having a computerized voting machine. For example the computer systems have an easy-to-use touch-screen which helps you to find the canidate you want to vote easily. In addition to that it is easier for the machine to deal with counting all the votes because they don't make many mistakes and it goes by really quick.
We use technolgy everyday for even important transactions so why shouldn't
