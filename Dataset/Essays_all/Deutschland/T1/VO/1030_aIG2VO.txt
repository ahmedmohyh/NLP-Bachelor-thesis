The arguments of the speaker discribe the issues of the voting system in the US and analyse if computer systems will make it better.

On the one hand computers usually doesn't make counting mistakes like humans, as well said in the text. On the one hand compuer systems aren't cheap and for people who aren't familiar with computers voting could be very complicated. In the text the price isn't named.
Besides the speaker doesn't agree with the text in the point of mistakes. The speaker name the problem that computers are programmed by humans at that it could be a serious problem if there is an error because many votes could be miscounted and lost. The text has an different oppinion according to that point because it says that sensitive information is transfered every day with computers and that there wouldn't be hudge mistakes.
Finally the speaker criticises that voting computer systems couldn't be tested much because election is only once in two years. Because of this small period of time programm errors couldn't be detected easy and therefore more mistakes would happen.

To draw a conclusion the speaker disagree with the text in cause of safety issues, handling problems and price arguments. The text is only considering the positive arguments of a digital voting system but the speaker talks either of the positive and negative effects.
