The voting system in the U.S.A. has many problems, becuase sometimes the people can´t understand the way of voting or an error occured while countings.The main problem is, that the U.S.A. have an inefficient voting system, there are many problems, which are difficult to solve.
In the text are many points about the voting systems and their problems. The first point is that the current voting system is inefficient, because it´s possible, that the counting system counts wrong, so the voting is not right, because some of the votes are not at their place, where they have to be.
With the old voting system appeared some problems aswell, so it needed to be replaced. This is a point against the voting system, which is in the speach aswell. A good way to vote is to use a computer, so you have a digital voting system, but there are problems aswell, because "the new generation" has the knowledge with the digital systems, but the "older generation" is not that trained in using digital systems. So a new easy way of digital voting has been introduced, you only have to click on the name of the politician, the the vote goes straight to the list of countings. This way is also much easier to count the votes, but there can also appear miscounts by an error in the system.
