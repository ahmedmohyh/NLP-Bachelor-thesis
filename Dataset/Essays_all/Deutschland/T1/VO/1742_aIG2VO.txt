The following essay deals with the debate that old voting systems are not efficient and have to be replaced by more efficient computer voting systems. 

The first and most important thing is, that people do mistakes. Officials have to count every single vote and it possible that people could count wrong, miss something unintentionally. The elections ald votes are very important for every country. The government gets choosed by the voters and if the votes are not counted right, many problems can follow. These voting systems have to be reliable and without any mistakes. 
Therefore the computer technique is more efficient. The programmes are reliable and cannot cause any problems. Uncountable things run with computers. Banking systems, science experiments and counts of numbers that are bigger than we can imagine are getting calculated without any mistakes and problems. So it is not impossible that computers make mistakes because the programming is used everywhere and it is simple. And if there is a problem it is easy to detect it and easy to correct it aswell. 
The only problem with the use of computers is that not everybody has got computers and not everybody can handle them. But even for this problem there is a solution. People that have issues with computers, can visit libraries or "Einrichtungen" that are specially made for votings. There the people can get help and get along with the electronic voting system.
