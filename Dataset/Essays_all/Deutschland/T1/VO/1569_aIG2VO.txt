The text tells us about the voting in the United States. She tells us that the traditional voting is often not so good,because many people vote the wrong candidates. Critics say in the text that the voting systems are often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. Voters have to find the names of candidates on papers,and they have to make a mark behind this name of candidate,that they want to vote. This is a very old system and makes that people with poor eyesight mark the wrong candidate. So now it gives computer votings,who should make the old problems better. But she tells us that it gives with the computer voting new problems. The old generation of us don´t know about computer technology and don´t know how to work with it. The text tells us that the computerized voting machines have an easy-to-use-touch-screen technology. The technology makes it easier to vote,voters can even have the computer  magnify the name for easier viewing. In the other way she tells us that the old generation cannot work with this technology. One positiv point of the computer voting is, that the officials don´t make much mistakes by counting the votes. In traditional votes the officials have to count up the votes one by one. Since they have to deal with thousands of ballots. This get easier for the officials with this computer technology. The old generation must learn this technology and its not so difficult.
