In the critical view of computerized voting it is one point that it can make it easy to vote out. But some people do not know something about the computer and how they are working. An other argument was that computer programms are from humans and humans can make mistakes. In the following of it people and computers can make mistakes and miss ballots also when they would use in the daily life but the voting in the US ist only every four years and not everybody fully trust in it. The text shows an other point of view about this topic. In it computerizing voting is an good system for the new voting systems for an election. They say it is safer with computers and without humans but in the "voice text" they have not especially the same meaning. In the text they tell that it would be easier when the voters only have to touch the name of his or her favorite elector but when people can not make the mark at the right place then maybe they can not touch the right name, too. The text says that it is really hard to count the votes for humans and it would be easier for a computer to do this work. The last point of the text is that something think it is too risky to have a computer for such a big task but when the use ist for banking transactions, why not for sensitive information? The other point of view is that the computer can have a defekt and may make a mistake but also humans can make mistakes. This is the important question of this topic. Human or Computer?
