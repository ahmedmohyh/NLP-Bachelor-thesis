Both texts critizes voting systems. The first text is about the system in the USA, which is still the traditional system. It is said that the traditional system is inefficient because there are some major problems. First there is a high possibility for the population to vote for the wrong candidate because it is hard to find and mark the wright name. The votes are counted by humans which leads to the next big problem. People can do mistakes and count a wrong number which would have the effect to recount again. This is very expensive  
in the text it is wanted to be replaced by a more modern computerized system. 
In comparhison to that, the second text critizises the computerized system for elections. It may be just an advantage for people who are used to computers, but the problem is that even in our modern society there are still many people who do not know how to handle a computer. With the computerized system there is still the possibility to make a wrong vote, but the first text says there is a higher chance with the traditional system. Furthermore is with a computerized sytem a higher risk for making more serious mistakes by counting the votes, because the programmes are developed by humans, who can always make mistakes. In addition the programmes are not very often tested because there is an election just every two years and that makes it more difficult to find the mistakes.
