The text, I just read, and the audio message, I heard, treat the subject of voting systems, which may be better computerized. The text gives information about an inefficient voting system in the US, that often leads to mistakes made by human. It is said that computers may be a better alternative to avoid problems like a wrong signed ballot because of for example people with poor eyesight who are not able to mark the right name. With the help of computers voters may easier vote the right person and also the counting of votes may be easier and safer. Human mistakes may not happen anymore and aditionally the past showed us that complicate systems like banking transactions are computerized aswell, but anyway criticers say the system could be too risky The audio messagemore brings up this negative side of using computers instead of the traditional voting systems. There may be people who are not used to technique and that may lead to trouble or even the fact that these people are not able to vote anymore. Also the aspect that human mistakes may be avoided by computers is not right because humans invented the programmes and even the computer that are not without mistakes aswell. A computer may also lead to bigger mistakes, for example thousands of votes can be miscounted in comparison to one person who miscounts only one vote. The fact that the voting computer systems have to be improved is another problem. Voting in the US only happens once in every two years so there is nearly no opportunity of testing how the system works and this may lead to errors because devoloping a programme needs time and a testing phase.
