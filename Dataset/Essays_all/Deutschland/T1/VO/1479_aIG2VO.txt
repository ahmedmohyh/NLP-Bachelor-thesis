One of the given arguments out of the presentation was that not all people are used to computers so people could easily vote for the wrong person by using touch. So it's not right to think that everybody could vote more easily and better just by using computers because there are more things that play a role than the easier viewing.
Another argument that was told about is that a virus could get on the computer and destroy a part or even the whole system. That is how votes could be removed or count for the wrong person. That's something that could never happen in the traditional way of voting. Generally the text is right when it says that a counting of the voted would be quicker by using a computer than count them one by one from people, who definitly would make mistkes while that. But a virus on the comuterized system would destroy this idea of countig votes easily and quick.
The presentation and the text also told about other functial computerized systems that handle with special information like this of a bank. The difference to a system like this is that it is used every day so people had enough time to develop it perfectly. At the beginning of this bank-systems there were a lot of mistakes which were fixed by the time. So a comparison between this both computerized systems isn't a good argument by the text.
