The text and the audio is about the topic voting system in the United States. 
In the text it says that the current voiting system has many negativ points. The first one is that some people vote for the wrong person, because they can`t see the names on the sheet. If the USA will vote with an computerized voting system this won´t be a problem. But the voice on the audio says that people who 
don´t have any experiences with computers will probably vote the wrong candidate or even can´t vote anyone. 
Another argumemt for the computerized voting system, which stands in the text, is that it takes a long time to count all the votes of the country. With the new system this will make a computer automatically and is done very quickly.
An argument which is named in the text and the audio is that many people don´t trust the internet and wouldn´t vote on an online platform. But everybody use the internet and named their banking transactions.
