Is it a opportunity to vote online? There are many aspects for and against it.The woman in the speach has the opinion that voting online on a computer has many problems. For young people who work with computers anyway it seems to be easy but older people can not be expected to understand this technology  perfectly. In the text it says that you have to rely on the people that count the votes. It´s nearly impossible to count all of them without any fault. But with computers you might have the same problem. They are getting programmed by humans, too. It could also come to an error and all the data would even be lost. Another point against the conservative way of voting is that it can be accidentally voted for the wrong person. You have to look for your candidate on a large sheet of paper. If you are not concentrated or your eyes are weak you could mark the wrong person. The text shares the opinion that this would be easier  when technical items would be used.
