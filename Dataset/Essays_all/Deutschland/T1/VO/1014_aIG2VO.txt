In the following text I am going to show what the text says about voting systems and show the differences to the speech I listened to.  

The text claims that there are big problems in the traditional voting system because of the size of the sheets and the number of candidates which causes that  people vote for the wrong candidate. Besides it can easily happen that the persons who count up the votes make mistakes. This problem could be solved by using more modern computer systems. But using a voting technology is also a risky step.
 In the speech they talk about trouble in using computers because there are many people who do not use or have a computer and that`s why do not know how to use it for voting. As human beings invented computer programs there could be problems and mistakes in counting up the votes by computers too. The connection between the text and the speech are the difficulties in the voting system.

 Finally you could say that they show different opinions about this topic but both show advantages and disadvantages of the two opportunities.
