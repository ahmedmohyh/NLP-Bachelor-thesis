In the listening part, they say that computervotes aren't that good as they seem. Thats the totally difference to them reading text, in witch they like to give the computervote a try.
An argument from the listening text ist, that not every person can work with computers. The young and middle aged comunity can work with it, but what about the older ones? Some of them have a fear of tecnologie and don't want to work with it, especially to vote with such a sistem. This problem isn#t mentioned in the writen text.
In the writen text, they write about the chance to eccidentally vote the wrong candidate and that it wouldn't be a problem with computers. But the other text sees the difficult there, that the change to vote the wrong candidate gets bigger with computervotes, not without.
The problem with miscounted or wrongcounted, they see different too. The writen text says, that the chance to count votes wrong will go down, if everything is doing by computers. But the other text says, that the computers are programmed by humans and that is the problem. What if they programmed it wrong and tousands of votes get lost? That would be a big problem.
Obviously, it isn't like a banking transaction witch is done every day. Voting processes aren't that much often, so they can't look if it works that soon. And when it goes wrong, they must programm anouther sistem to do the voting proces again.

All in all, both texts have very diffenrent views to computervotes. One of them would give it a try, the other not.
