The arguments from the woman are against the idea of a computerized voting system. In the text where told the pros from computerized voting and in the speech are the cons. One arguments in the speech was, that computer made also fails and that they are even more worse than the misstakes from humans. The woman said that if a human count a vote wrong it is just one single count, but if the computersystem failed it is possible that the computer misscount thousand of votes. An other argument was, that we could not know that the computers work without any problems. She said that the fact that humans make some fails is right, but computers are made from humans. So it is very possible that computers do not work better than humans. The last argument she named is that people whitout any experiance with computers maybe have problems to use the computerized voting system. 
But in the text are the arguments, that computerized voting is more accurate than the voting from humans, because humans have to count the votes one by one which means that the voting system right now is inefficient.
