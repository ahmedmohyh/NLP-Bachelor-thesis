Computarized voting would be a lot easier, but only for the people who are used to using a computer. For older people who don´t know how a computer works it´s not a good way to vote because they could vote for the wrong candidate easily. In the text the opposite is named, older people could vote the wrong candidate on the current voting system because of a bad eyesight. Another contra for the computarized voting is that even though they are computers, their made by human and as we all know that humans can make mistakes, it wouldn´t be safe that computarized voting would be without any errors. In the text it´s described that only human could do problems on the current voting system because it´s impossible to not do a mistake while counting, but a computer system doesn´t do any mistakes. In the listening , they say that it´s not safe to trust a computer which could do mistakes just like a human could so we shouldn´t trust something like a this in such an important thing. The text says something different, we should give it a try.
