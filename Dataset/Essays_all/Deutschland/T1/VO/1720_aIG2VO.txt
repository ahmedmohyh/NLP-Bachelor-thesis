The speech and the text deals both with the voting system in the USA.The text basically mentioned the bad points of the old voting systems. The first point deals with the accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. This wrong vote could happen because there are many candidates on a big list on the paper. And when you have a poor eyesight it could happen that you underline the wrong president. But theres also a voting machine with a touchscreen technology. This way of voting is new and easier for the people who vote.  A nother problem is mentioned in the text. This problem deals with the old way to count the votes. The votes were count from humans one by one. This is very hard because they must be very consintrated the hole time other way you will make mistakes and the vote for the new president could be wrong. The text says that  new computersystems are better because they removed the human error.
All in all the text says that the old voting system is not good and the new computer systems are better. It could happen that there were errors aswell but many people use complex computer systems every day and big firms use them aswell. 
I can not say something to the audiospeech because there were technical defects and I can not hear what the woman says.
