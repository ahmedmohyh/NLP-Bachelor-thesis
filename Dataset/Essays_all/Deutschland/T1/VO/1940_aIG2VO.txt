The speaker talks about people who dont use computers on a regular basis, who may be discouraged from voting or they are not able to do that because of their lack of technical knowledge. This argument could be from the 90´s. In todays computerized community almost everyone knows how to deal with a computer or in this case a touchscreen. I mean what could be easier? Also there would of course still be humans you could ask for help.
The woman also talked about how mistakes in a computer sytem would be worse than human errors, but in a computerized voting system you could easily track where the error occured. When humans do the counting it will likely not even be noticed. Because of the problems in the voting system many people think their vote wouldnt count anyway because of which lots of citizens do not vote at all. A computerized voting system would save a lot of time, tax money and exhausting ballot counting.  
Also the speaker said you shouldnt trust computers completely, probably she is one of those people she talked about earlier, who cant handle technology. The politicians dont give the computerized voting system a thought even if in other aspects of our daily life we completely trust the computers.
