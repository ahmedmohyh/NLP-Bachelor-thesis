In both texts deal with the American voting sytem witch is quiet old. They discuss wich voting system would be better the computerrsied or the old and tradtional with papers.

It is criticised that it is inefficient because it takes so much time and that you can miss the right sheed is also said as a problem. Also the votes will be counted one by one from humans and humans can make mistakes and these mistakes can change an election and when people vote they search for the name of their candidate and then they have to make a small mark next to the name where especially older people can miss the right box and vote for another candidate. But the only other solution would be that the election will be fully computerrised and would that change the problems?
One argument for the computerrised voting system would be that people does not have to count the votes one by one the computers will count them emideatly and no human can have an influens on the election. But for people who have not been used a computer in their hole life it is a masure problem to vote. For example they could missclick and vote for another candidate. Also Computers have been programmed by humans and humas are not perfect so if something went wrong during programming the computers it would mean that thousends of vote would be wrong and the election has to be done again and this is not just anoying it cost millions of dollars. Also computer can be hacked by other humans who want to change the election so another presidant will be elected. Some even pay much money for this.

All in all both of these voting systems have some arguments for and against but both are not the real solutioin for the problem.
