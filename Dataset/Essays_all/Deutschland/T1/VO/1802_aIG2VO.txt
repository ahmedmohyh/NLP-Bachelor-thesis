Some critics say that the current voting systems in the USA are inefficient and lead to an inaccurate counting of the votes. They want to replace the traditional system with a more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting system. In the current system, you have to mark the name of the candidate on a large sheet of paper. People with bad eyesight can easily mark the wrong candidate. But when you use a computerized system, all you have to do is to touch the name on the screen. Furthermore the screen of the computer is bigger and better to see. But some people do not want this computerized system. There is always the possibility of an error, because those computers are only used once in every four years. Also the votes can be discounted, so you have to count them again. In the traditional system, officials have to count and record the votes one by one. Since there are more than over thousands of ballots, it is almost impossible for them to not make mistakes. When they encounter an error, a long recount has to take place. Computerized systems remove the possibility of an human error, since the counting is done quickly by the computers. But since the computers are made by humans, there is always a small chance of an system crash. Some people do not trust these systems, but they trust them in their normal life to, for example in the communication or for banking transactions.
