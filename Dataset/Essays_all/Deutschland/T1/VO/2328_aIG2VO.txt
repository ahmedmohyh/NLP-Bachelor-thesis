The Critics are showing some Problems of the current voting system and the traditional voting system.
Some people want to vote on a Computer but its not easy for every person to vote on a Computer because not everone has a Computer. It may give some problems with the Computer and people will probably vote the wrong person on the Computer because they tip on the wrong, maybe this problem is with the traditional voting system too. The Computer or the Computer System can have an error and everyone has to vote a second time. And its not so often that the USA has to vote, it is just once every 2 years in the USA. And they can not trust the person on thee Computer that they vote for their own and allow. At home everyone can sign with your information and vote someone or a group of person will vote. But at the other side everyone can do banking and everything else on their Computer and the most people are useing Computer technology. The current voting systems will be better for voters with poor eyesight. In the old voting system you should have person who count the votes. The Vote will be easy and quickly on the Computer.
