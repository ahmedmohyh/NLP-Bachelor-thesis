At the listened monologue of an old woman was said that computerized systems of elections are better than the traditional systems of the US. It's easy to change the small mark. She also said that we have to trust the computer programmes because computers are used heavily daily and it is a kind of part in our own life. Also she talked about the risk that a computer error should delete every of thousand votes and that could be a catastrophe but in general we have to trust the modern methode to vote. 
In comparing to the text it is to say that there are almost the same explainations in between to the listened monologue. The old voting systems are rely heavily on people to count the votes because you have to count every single votes and that is hard work going through every ballot and recording the vote. Computerized systems are often more simple because you can easily change your mark specially if you have a poor eyesight it is such a positive argument to give a vote at your computer. Technology is used worldwide by hard and we only have to trust them also if computer systems can have errors and it seems to be a little risky to trust them but in general governments even do banking transactions as well as in the communication of highly sensitive information. Finally there is to say that the traditional way to vote get older and older and the way to vote at your computer is such the modern and easy way which should used by every person which is allowed to vote in the US.
