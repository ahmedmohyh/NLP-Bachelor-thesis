In the presentation the woman gave arguments against the idea of a new voting system with the help of computers, which are the total opposite of the arguments in the text above.
The first argument against computers is about the people itself: Computerised voting would be easy to use for people who use computers daily, but we shouldn't forget about the people who do not have a daily contact with technology. This point is the opposite of the argument against the current voting system of the USA. 
There it's said that the computerized voting system would be aesier to use, because people with a bad eye-sight are no longer worse treated.
Another argument against voting with computers is the fact, that we can be sure, that the computers won't fail or make less mistakes that real people.
Even if the counters of the ballots can fail, it's not that heavy. If they do a miscount it's only a single mistakes. But if a computer system fails, this would be way more seriou and would contain a bigger damage and an impossible recount.
The other partie's argument against this position is the heavy counting of the ballots one by one. With this system it's clear that mistakes will happen and a detected error would be the cause of a long and expensive recount.
They also say, that our society trust computer programs already in a lot of things, for example in banking transactions. So when we trust the computers do deal well with our money, why not also with our votes?
The against-computers-party gives the following argument against this position: The got the opinion, that this votings system with computers isn't that improved how it should be. Daily used system are well tested, but voting happens highest twince a year. So they see this fact as the reason, that voting systems won't be able to transmit the information of the people surely, without making less mistakes that the counting people.
