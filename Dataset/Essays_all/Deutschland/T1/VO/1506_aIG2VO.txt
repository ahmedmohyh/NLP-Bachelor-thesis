A lot critizisen are against traditional voting. I am going to compare a text about voting and a präsentation in the following text.
Both examples are a disscusion about traditional voting or votig with a computer and bothe has a pro and contra side. The text means that traditional voting is innefficient because a human counting is not exact and needs a long time and a lot of monney in case of a recount. And there are a lot people who cant see verry good, so maby they make the cross by a candidate the wont vote for. The comuter votig has just pro arguments on sides of the text. The computer counts the vots exactly and make no mistakes. The audio voice said that there are a lot old people in the United States who cant worke with computers. So theay arent abel to vote.
All in all both examples for voting traditional do not say that one voting methode is better than the other. The just named the pro and contras for each voting methode.
