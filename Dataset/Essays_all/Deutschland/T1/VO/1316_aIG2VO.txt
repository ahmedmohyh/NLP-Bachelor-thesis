Some people, who are against the current voting system in the USA, want a new voting system. The traditional voting system is inefficient and miscounts can especially damage the election so the people want to replace the older system with a more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting system.
But computerprograms are as good as the human who writes the program so there could be many errors in this new system or criminals could hack into the program to manipulate it. A computerized voting system is not save enought because there is perhaps one voting in two years so the people who write the program have not enought experience to make a good and safe program.
