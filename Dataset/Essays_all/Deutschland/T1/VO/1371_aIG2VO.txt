The text and the woman say that the traditional voting system is not good enough anymore. They introduce both methods which can be used. In the text the whole system of the U.S election is bad, human error is the biggest problem. The ballots are not useable anymore because people who can't see as good as others have a problem to mark the candidate who they want, these ballots are just to small. However these text shows how good computer voting is, it can be used everywhere and every time. It's easy and computers would not make mistakes. We just need to trust them as we do in other things like bank transactions.
However the woman didn't see it as good as the text, she is also against the traditional system because they don't fit to the society anymore but computers are also not perfect. Maybe it's easy to handle computers when you do a lot with them but when you don't use them or just sometimes it's not as easy as it seems for others. Human error ist a problem for both, the text and the woman, but the woman also says that when a person make a mistakes just a few ballots get lost, when a mistake is in the computer system of the election thounds of voices get lost. We trust computers everyday and we also use them everyday but it doesn't matter if we don't trust them we can't use them in as voting system. 
So both of them are not sure if they think the traditional voting system is better or a new one with computers. They have the same argumenst but also say something for ist and something against it. However in the text the computer system seems to better and more efficient, the woman don't say it out loud but she seems to have more trust in the tradional system.
