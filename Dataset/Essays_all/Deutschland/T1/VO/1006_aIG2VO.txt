The following text deals with the theme voting.
The text says that the voting system in the United States are inefficient and they have to deal with a lot of problems. For example a probleme is that people often mark the worg candidate if they have problems with their eyes. The votings are counted by people and because of that a lot of ballots are wrong. If a person has to count out ballots the whole day they often can exedantilly count the wrong candidate and then there are missballots. The missballots are going to infect the voting and the next president.

The speach also says that there are many problems about the voting system and they think that a voting with computers can be more trusted.
Computers help people in life and make their lifes more simple. But these people who do not have a computer or don't trust them would be afraid of a voting system with computers. Also computers make mistakes and if a computer removes the ballots are away and if people count the ballots it's only possible that they miss some ballots. 

The text and the speach both deal with voting and with the problems. 
They discuss different problems but they have the same ending. They say that it would be better to do the voting with technology because computers show that they can be trustworthy and they proof that every day. An other reason is that the voting isn#t every year so tha computers would only be used for the voting and they rest the other time. That make them more efficient.
