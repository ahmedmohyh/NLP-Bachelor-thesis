In the presentation they said that there are some problems with the computer counting systems. Not eyery person uses a computer and every day, so they will get many technology problems with these systems. And the counting systems are also programmed by humans, so they could count it like the old system. There are often miscounted votes at these systems and you can't trust them for hundred percent.

The text has a different point of view an it says that you can easily mark a wrong name on a sheet of paper and it should be easier to do the voting on a computer, because they have an easy-to-use touch-screen technology. It is a really big problem to use the old systems with a sheet of paper. The votes can be identified much easier with a computer voting system. Another point is that the computer voting systems are very quick and correct in their votings. The computer systems are also in banking transactions each day, so you can say that these systems are completely trustful and you can use it also in points like voting. 

All in all the presentation is against these new computerized systems and the text wants these systems.
