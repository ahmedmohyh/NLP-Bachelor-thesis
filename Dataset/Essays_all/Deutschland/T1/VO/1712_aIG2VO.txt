The speaker´s opinion is, that there are many people, that are used to computer systems, but on the other side there are many who can´t have computers. Those people might be scared of voting because the new system is too deficult and technological for them. In the text, there is said that a computarized system would make the voting progress much easier. It would minimize mistakes made by humans, because computers rarely make mistakes. The speakers opinion on that is, that computers also make mistakes because the are made by humans. Those mistakes would be far more dangerous because a recount wouldn´t be possible. That would eliminate thousands of votes. She says that technology in everyday-life just works so well, because they have been used for a long time and have been improved over and over again. This is not possible with the voting systems, because they are just used once in two years. In the text it is said, that humans make far more mistakes, so the system is very inefficent because of high recount costs and the inaccuracy. The author at least wants to give the computerized system a try. 

Overall, the speaker and the author of the text disagree in many points. The speakers thinks, that computer´s mistakes are way too dangerous and people    won´t vote because they´re scared while the authors says that computers are very accurate and eliminate mistakes.
