The information being used are both about voting systems. But they include different opinions: While the text says that it can be dangerous to trust humans counting the votes because they can easily make mistakes and it is much more easier to vote at a computer the woman giving the speech states the following opinion: Even if people are sure going to make mistakes in every election it can be even more risky to use computers for elections. First of all, there are still many people who do not have any experience with this kind of technology. They might be scared of voting on the internet and some of them might do not even have a computer or just do not use it. Furthermore, even if humans make mistakes counting the votes computers can also make mistakes which can be even bigger. So according to the speaker you can say that it might be not excellent to let humans counting the votes but it is definitely worse having computers doing this work. Because after all computers can not be fully trusted.
