Both, the recording and the text, criticize the voting system in the US. But they have different opinions.
In the recording it is said that there must be changend something, but it is not necessary to use computers for the elections.
People use computers for many things and some are very used to computers, but there are people who don't know what to do with these modern technical things or who don't like them. For these peoples it could be difficult to vote - either they don't know how to do it or they don't want to vote on a computer.
Another point is that when an computer error happens it is possible that thousands of votes can't be counted. that is much worse than one or two votes aren't counted because of human falts.
Furthermore the computers need to be updated and updated very often. To do this it needs very much time.
The article says it the other way around.
If people who want to vote get a paper with so many names or if thy have poor eyesight it is difficult to vote for the right candidate. With a computer system it could be much more easier for them. Those systems count the votes automatically and fast so that errors are less possible.
