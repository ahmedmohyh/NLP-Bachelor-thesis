There are many opinions whether the voting system should be changed into a computerized voting system or continue like it was until now.
An argument against the old voting system, in which the voters have to mark the candidate`s name they´re voting for on a big sheet of names, is that there could be some mistakes by the voters with poor eyesight or by the officials who have to count all the votes and could miss some ballots or not read it correctly. This also takes a lot of the time, which wouldn´t, if there were a changeing into the computerized system. Also the risk of the mistakes within the voting or counting the votes wouldn´t be that big. But also there can be a mistake in the system which would interfere in the results too, because it wouldn´t probably be detected. Another argument against the computerized voting system is that it wouldn´t be easy for people who aren´t used to computers. Also some people say that it wouldn´t be worth it changeing the voting system because there aren´t that much ellections so that the officials wouldn´t have to spend there time that often on counting votes but others want to give that new system a try.
