First it was very difficult to understand the text which was given by the women because the headphones doesn´t work as well, so it´s only possible to repet the arguments of the text.

To begin with the first argument, critics say that people with poor eyesight can vote for the wrong candidate, because it´s too difficult for them to see the exactly position of the field they have to tick. A possible allternative can be a computer technic where the voters have only to touch on a screen. Against this arument is the fact that computers doesn´t work always as far as and as reliable as they should have, so maybe an error can influence a election.
Another argument critics come up with when they have to present theis opinion to this theme is that the officals often have to count to votes on-by-one so it´s not unusal that there can be mistakes. Regarding to that it´s also possible to count the votes by computers to remove this weekness.
To define the last piont, there is no garranty that the goverments use the votes and don´t delete them after counting, so it´s maybe possible that they know with individual votes which candidate.
