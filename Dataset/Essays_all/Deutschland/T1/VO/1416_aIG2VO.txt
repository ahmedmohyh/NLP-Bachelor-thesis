The Text and the speak is about voting. Excetly about voting in form of papers or Computers. The speak is holding against counting with computers. One of the first arguments which are given is that not everyone is able to handle a computer. So some people especially the old or poor ones who don´t grow up with a computer or who can´t buy a computer because they have no money won´t go voting just because they are angry to use a computer. If they go, they need help and that need time so other people who wanted to vote have to wait and maybe they go home because they have no time to wait or they just nt to. Or there is a long long time to wait for everyone. And this would be another reason to stay at Home and don´t get voting. 
In the text the arguments are against voting with papers because people with bad eyes maybe can´t see exactly for which one they vote. And then they vote someone they don´t want to. 
Another argument named in the text is that there can happen mistakes during count the ballots. The ones who count them have to do this over a long time and  maybe after four hours they aren´t so concendraded like in the beginning or hey just count a few paper wrong. With that maybe the wrong person wins. 
That can´t happen with computers. They count the votes quickly and right.
