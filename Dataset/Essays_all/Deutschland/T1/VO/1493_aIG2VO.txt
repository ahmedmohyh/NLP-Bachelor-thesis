There are always some risks when it comes to voting. However, the current voting systems of the US seem to be really inefficient. 
Due to the fact that the United states mostly rely on people when it comes to counting the votes inaccurate counting and the possible damage following are the consequences.
But the risk of the voters to accidently mark a different name on the ballot is a problem too as it´s described as a large sheet of paper with many small written names of the candidates.
Therefore critics think computerized voting could be a better option.
But are computers more reliable?
First of all the using a computer to vote may only attract people that are used to working with one.
It could scare away the people that dont regularly use modern technology like that or cause more accidents due to the lack of knowledge about using a computer.
Second computers are programed by people which means it isn´t error-proof either and if there is an accident caused by a computer it´s even more dramatic than human fail as the saved results would be gone permanently.
