The woman gave a speech about the topic of improving elections in the US. The text and her presentation are about the use of computers to reduce human beings' faults. In the text it says that computers are a chance to reduce human's mistakes rapidely. It is critized that the long paper lists have the risk to elect a wrong candidat because of poor eyesight and therefore choosing the wrong candidat . A choice by computer would reduce this risk. But in this point the woman doesn't agree with the text statement. She is of the opinion that people who avoid using the computer in their daily lives are disadvantaged and can make mistakes as well because of not getting along with the technique. 
Another argument that she does not confirm is that counting the votes by hand is inefficient and is associated with mistakes. She is concerned that wrong programmes make much bigger problems with counting the votes because they are used so rarely in contrast to daily uses like  banking transactions which could be improved over a long time. 
Only a few mistakes by hand are much more acceptable.
