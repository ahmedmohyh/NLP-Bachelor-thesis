"Voting" 
The Voters aren´t the same opinnion wich vote system is better than the other. Becaus every system has his good and bad pionts while the voting. 
The current voting which is uesed in the United States isn´t reallay accurate while counting the votes. And this is the part what makes the current voting inefficient.
The traditional voting is also not very right and correct in part of the numer oft votes. In this voting many people even old voters can´t see the name of ther favorite Canidate and vote for the fals Canidate. Because the the ballot with the names is very small and theire are many different names on it.
The new computer voting is for some voters the best part becaus they can choose their Canidates easily and can click the right mark to vote for this person.
But in this voting old mebers also can´t vote correctly while their can´t handel a new and modern computer or laptop. In such parts vote helpers can help the old persons to vote the right person.
But also at computer voting can mistakes will be done in connection with the counting of votes
