The presentation opposes counting votes using computers, because there are doubts that computers will make the unefficient old voting systems any better.
It is said that people not using computers on a daily basis will have problems because of missing experience in using them, and because of their "fear of technology", in contrast to the people with bad eyesight mentioned in the text. The text which the presentation comments on says that currently the votes are counted by humans, which can cause many miscounts and therefore wrong results, however the presentation states that the programs, which will be used to count the votes, are written by humans and cannot be flawless aswell. As a result, the outcome could be even worse than it may be now, as one cannot really see what a computer is doing, and recounting the votes would be impossible, too. It is also said that these mentioned programs will need time to be improved until they are reliable, because they are not used as often as for example banking technology, which would be another reason to rather stick with the current system.
