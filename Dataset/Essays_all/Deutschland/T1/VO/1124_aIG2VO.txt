Voting with a computer program can cause big trouble, especially when the program has an error or simply doesn't work. Miscounting some voting sheets isn't as fatal as a whole program, that doesn't work correctly. But voting programs would be made by humans as well so they can have an error too, that makes the system miscounting voices. The text says that miscounting is a problem because human can easiely make errors while counting. So the text wants to use more computer programs for counting voices but they don't think of errors, that happen while programming a system.
Another point in the speech is that banking systems are very well for banking because it is very accurate in how it has to work. But systems or programs for voting might not be as accurate as they think because the banking systems needed a long time until they were perfect and the same problem/evolution might be necessary for the voting programs. The text doesn't show that the banking systems had to improve a lot they say that they should implement voting technology because they use systems for banking and some other things.
In the speech she says that it would be hard to improve the voting programs because it is only used every two years. The text doesn't say anything about problems like time to improve the program.
