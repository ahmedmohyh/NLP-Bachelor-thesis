First of all the both have information about the way of voting in the United States.

Firstly they have the argument that a person could easily vote for the wrong candidate.
But the text give the information that the person can vote wrong, because the can not read it well on the display of the computer.
The other said that some people can not use a computer very well so they might choose the wrong person.
Furthermore both say that you can not trust computer easily, because if the computers have an error, thousands of votes could be deleted and also the programms for the computer are made by people and they can do mistakes too.

Finally both have the argument that the current voting system in the USA is inefficient and it should be changed.
