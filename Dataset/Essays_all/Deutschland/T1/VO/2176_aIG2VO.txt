Based on a presentation and a text about the voting system in the United States I am going to discuss whether the traditional voting system with papers counted by humans should be renewed by a computerized voting system.
The text and the presentation both face the problems that the traditional system has. People with poor sight might mark the wrong candidate and the officials counting the votes might do mistakes too. The presentation goes on, that there might be problems in the computer system because of human error in the beginning and a mistake in the system might lead to a complete miscount. However the text does not agree, because it says that people are relying on computers everyday. The presentation explains that the systems,we are using everyday were  not perfect when they were first used. Furthermore the presentation says, there are still people who are not able to use a computer and they would easily mark the wrong name, because they simply do not know how to use it. Nevertheless both sources agree that the traditional voting system does not lead to an accurate counting of votes, therefore the text would like to change it into an computerized system while the presentation would like it to stay in the traditional way.
