To explain the differnet opinions about the voting system in the US, it would be helpful to first focus on one side. There are two differnet opinios. The first one is that the old system shouldn't exist anymore and instead of it there should be an computerized system. On one hand the computerized system seems to be the better one because of the easier viewing of the candidated names, especially for older people. The old system, where the votes are counted by human, is discribed as inefficient because of the misscounts and also because of people who coudn't see anything on a piece of paper. So the old system seems to be heavily to count. 
On the other hand the old system is the favorite and the computerized system is explained as impossible to use for votings. It's because the computerized systems is just good for people who are used to use computers, for example people who use them each day for work. For people who don't use computers that much or who never use them it would be complicated and they wouldn't manage to vote their candidate. Also with the old system it could be that there are for example fifty misscounts but the computer could stop working and there could be more than thousands of misscounts. A recount would be impossible. 
All in all they describe the computeried system as to risky and the old system as there would be to many misscounts.
