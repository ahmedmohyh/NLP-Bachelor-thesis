In the presentation they said that not all people are used to work with computers, especially old people, so they might not understand how voting on the computer works and could misunderstand it, so that they accidently vote for the wrong person. But in contrast to this the text explains, that old people who can't see anymore that good, have problems to read the sheet with the names or can't see where they make their mark, so the touch-screen-technology for voting might be better, because they can magnify the names of the candidates and  read the names easier on the screen. 
Furthermore the presentation makes clear, that there could be errors in the program, what causes that maybe thousend of votes are miscounted. Such an error can't happen with human counting of votes. However the text express, that even humans can make mistakes when they count the votes, because if they have to count thousend of votes, there's no way, that they missed a vote or count it wrong, so this can lead to inaccurate counting of votes, what can manipulate the election, especially dramatic when both candidates are almost on the same level. 
Another point to mention why the counting of votes by humans is better, is that there are not many elections, not more than two in a year for every state, so this system will not be used a lot and there could be more mistakes and errors in it, because they didn't try it often. The system has to be very trustful, when they use it to count the votings of the election. They say the system is not ready to use and currently to risky. 
The text has another opinion, because they say, that governments and politicians use a lot of computer systems for accuratew baking transactions and so on and it workes perfectly so why not use it for
