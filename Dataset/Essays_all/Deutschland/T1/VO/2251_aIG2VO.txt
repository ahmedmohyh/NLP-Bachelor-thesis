The writing "Voting" ia about the voting systems used by the United States. Critics say, that they want to use a new form of voting. they mean the traditional vote is often not right, because the people who count the votes often make mistakes. So with a computer voting it will be easier to count the ballots. Also it is easier for old people to vote, because sometimes the writing on the vote sheets is so little that they can not read so they maybe vote for the wrong person. So they thinks it is more efficient to use computers. But the other critics from the speech think the opposide. They mean the traditional way to vote is better, because when the computer does not work or has an error, nobody can vote so the election has to get new. And it is wright that the people who count the votes sometimes miss one or they count not completly wright, but this is pretty better as the whole election gets to be new only by an error. So the using of computers to vote has advantages and disadvantages.
