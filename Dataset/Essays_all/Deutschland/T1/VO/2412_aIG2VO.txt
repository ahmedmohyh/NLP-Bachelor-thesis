The above text implies the problem that the voting system in the United States is not efficient and inaccurate due to two problems that may happpen during the voting process. One problem is that especially people with bad eyesight can easily mark the wrong vote without noticing and the other one is that the people who count the votes can make mistakes due to the large amount of votes they have to count. These human errors can be avoided if a computer system is used. 
The person in the audio clip has a contradictory opinion on computer systems to count the votes. They do not agree with the argument that it can help not casting the vote for another person that is not wanted to vote for. A computer for voting may be easy to use for younger people who can afford technological things such as a computer or who use them on a daily basis, but for people who are not used to that kind of technology the process of voting on a computer could be confusing and they could easily vote for someone they do not want as well. 
Another major point the person in the audio does not agree with is the argument that there will not be any mistakes made because human error is avoided. Unlike the writer of the text they think that a computer can make mistakes as well that could be an even larger problem than just forgetting to count a few votes like a human would. The danger of human error is still possible because a computer system is made by humans so there can be mistakes made. They also think that the fact that other computer systems are used in other important processes as well can not be implied in this issue. Those computer systems are used on a daily basis and more heavily, so they have been improved over years unlike the voting computer systems because the would only be used twice a year.
Therefor the person in the audio clip does not agree with the text because in their opinion a computer system can not be trusted.
