The voting system which we use now is strongly criticise but would it realy be better if the voting system will be renewed by computers?
People criticise that the atuall voting system is to complex because of the are to manny possibiltys to vote and becaue of humens make mistaks maby the wrong person will be voted bcause the peoplr how vote or how cond the votes are making misstaks.
There solution is that computers should be used by the elections to help the people to tick the right person or to cound the votes.
They say that were will hatten less misstakes bcause they use an "easy-to-use touch-screen technology" and so the people will get no more problems.
But there are also people how are against this new technology the say that people how are not use technology would have problems with this new sytem. Also there would be no controll be possible if a computer counds the voters. And computers could also make misstaks because computer are beeing programmed by humens how could also make misstakes.
So all in all it is a good idea to make the voting system easyer but they have to find an solution of the problems the new technology has but if they do this they would make it better.
