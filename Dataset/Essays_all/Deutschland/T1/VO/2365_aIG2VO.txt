Both statements are about voting systems. There are two options, the old one with a sheet of paper and the new one with a computer. The woman with the speech was against the new option. She said that there could be problems with people who dont use computers so often. Also she said that there could be mistakes in the computer program and this would be a more important problem than the option that human make mistakes. Because when human make mistakes than there are a few wrong counted votes but when a computer system is wrong there could be thousands of wrong counted votes. The article has another opinion. It says that it would be easier to vote with computers because it is often hard to find the name of the person you want to vote for  on a sheet of paper. In the article is nothing said about the option that the computer could make mistakes. It only says that human make mistakes and that governments and individuals still uses computer technology for important things, for example banking transactions.
