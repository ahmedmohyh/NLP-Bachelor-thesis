The woman in the recording talked about the negative aspects of a computerized voting system.

First, she argued that people who do not use computers regularly might have trouble operating the computerized systems because they are just not used to it and might be scared off by the technology. This is opposed by a point mentioned in the text where it was said that some people might accidently cast the wrong vote because it is so easy to lose track of where you are on the ballot or because they have poor eyesight.
Then she mentioned that, like the text also argued, people make mistakes. But as opposed to the text by that she does not mean the people counting the votes but the people programming the computer, which she says can lead to way more massive errors during the counting of votes, such as a lot of votes getting misplaced or even lost. She also counters the point that we have been using computerized systems for things like banking for years by saying that these systems have been improved every day for since their implementation but the voting systems would only be used every four years.
