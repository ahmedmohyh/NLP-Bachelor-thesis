Firstly, the presentation said that computer systems are only efficient to people who are used to computers because others may have problems concerning how to use them.  In the text though it is mentioned that computer systems are a good solution e.g. for people with poor eyesight.  The recording makes the listener think that it is normal for humans to make mistakes and even computer systems can be installed wrongly because they are made by humans. Moreover, it would be a lot easier to recount the ballots because they will still exist. If there would be an error in the computer system, it would be impossible to recount the votes because in the worst case all the information is deleted and the vote is manipulated and the effort to redo the vote would be enormous.  The text in comparison makes you think that it is too much effort to recount all the ballots if humans make mistakes, what they are most likely to do and computer systems are a much easier way to count the votes. On top of that, the texts explains that computer systems are trustworthy even for banking transitions. Furthermore, the speaker does not think that the comparison between systems for banking transitions and votes is appropriate because the technology for the banking accounts have been improved and updated since the beginning and they are used daily.  Computer systems for votes though have not been invented and therefore will most likely include mistakes and this is not nessessary because votes only happen every two years national in the United States.
