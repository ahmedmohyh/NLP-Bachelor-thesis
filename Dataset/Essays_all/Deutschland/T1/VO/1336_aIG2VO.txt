Voting

In the following essay I´m going to summarize the presentation and show the difference betweent presentation and the text. 

The pspeech is about the contras of a computerized voting system. The women sees that a human error is possible in the tradtional voting system, like it is described in the text, but she thinks that in a computerized system it is also possible, becuase the computerprogram for the voting is made by humans. So it could be that there is a mistake in this program, and if there is a mistake, that what follows would be harder than the human errror in the counting of the votes in the tradition system, because in the computerized system the system can count 1000 or more votes wrong. While in the text it is said that in the computerized system isn´t any possibility of a human error. 

A fault of the system is also more possible because this voting system wouldn´t be used often. She agrees that computerized systems are used for banking and that it is good, but these systems are used every day. So the faults aren´t there anymore. But if yoou use a system only once in two years it takes long time until you fund all of the system. 

Also she agrees with the part that people with poor eye-sight can mistakes while voting. But with the computerized system can also happen mistakes,she thinks, because there are lots of person who aren´t used to computers, so they can make mistakes while voting, just because they don´t know how a computer functionate.
