The voting system in the US have in some points promlems because of the people and the technologie.
In traditional voting the persons have to choose a name on a large sheet and there are many names on it. It could be that the persons choose the wrong candidate, because they couldn't read the name of their favourite candidate and in result they choose the wrong person. 
So the humans improve the voting system and make it easier for the new generation. But the old generation often don't use computers or can't work with that.
It isn't easy for them. 
The problem don't came only from the side of the voters. It could also came from the other side, the technologie. 
We made the computer and it could be a error inside of the system. Often during the voting they could have no connection more to the system and the voting could be faked.
All in all the voting system could be improved in some ways. It could be easier for the people who don't know how to use the computer.
