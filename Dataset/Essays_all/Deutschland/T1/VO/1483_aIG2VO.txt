In the presentation about "computer voting" in the US, a woman explains the disadvantages of this type of voting in comparision to the "old-voting-system". She explains that the people with the knowlegde about computer have it much easier to vote, because they can use the computer correctly and don't make big errors. In this case, the woman is the same opinion as the essay "Voting". It might be better for a guy with a poor eyesight, but what is about the people who can't use a computer? she tells the listener that they can destroy the whole voting, because they understood the voting wrong or in another way. This is much problematically than a counter of the votes makes one little error.
