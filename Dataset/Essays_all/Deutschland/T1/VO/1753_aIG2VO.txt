Some people in the US. agree that the modern way of voting is better than the current one with papers, beacuse it`s more relyable and the computers don`t make mistakes on counting the votes. But in the listening part we heard that there are also many critics on the modern way with the technology. 
The main problen they see is, that my older people do not know how to use a computer and they are scared of this modern technology, so with this way of voting they would not even go to vote. Also there are people who do not have a computer or do not  even know how to deal with it and how to vote for the right person. This is as riscy to vote for the wrong person as the paper voting sheet, where you have to look fot the right person and tick its name. 
Of course people can make mistakes by counting up the votes, because often there are thousands of voting papers. But on the other side, computers are made by humans. The technologys are set by people, and electronics often make mistakes. And if the people make mistakes by counting than it`s just some votes more or less, but if a computer has an arror, the whole programm will break down and thousands of votes will get lost. This would cause a much more drastic and bigger problem, so they think it is more easier to leave the system like it is .
