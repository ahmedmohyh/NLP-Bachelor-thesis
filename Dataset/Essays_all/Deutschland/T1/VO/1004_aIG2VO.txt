The following text "Voting" summarizes the voting system in the US. 
It is easier to use a computerized voting system because people who haven't got the best eyes so they can't see all. They have a problem to find the right name of the candidate and then they make a mistake with their vote. With computers the people can see in a better way because the page is larger. 
The technology of the computers are easy, so the people who vote, haven't got any problems with the system. 
Older systems are heavily and it is difficult to count all the votes. Therefore it needs a long time to count up the votes one by one. People have to help for counting but it can take hours till the election is finish. 
The computer could count itself and nobody has to count the papers. So it isn't diffcult and for the voters it is simpla too. 
But don't forgot that the computerized vote symstens are of humans. So there is always a chance that the voters vote the wrong candidate but that could be other reasons. 
It is risk to use computerized symstens at a vote because it could be that the computers have complications and that 's a problem. An other argument for the computers at a vote can be that the governments and other people use computers the whole time as the banks. They use it for banking an so on. 
So it is difficult to have an opinion waht voting is better ans also easier.
