in the text they say it´s inefficient to use a current voting system and it´s often lead to the inaccurate of votes.Otherwise in the presentation i´ve listen to they say it´s easier to use the computer to vote but only when you use the computer often so you know how to use them.so when you don´t use a computer often you could be trouble with it.the same in these two is that it´s easier to see them or the viewing is easier at the computer so here it´s more difficullt tovote for the wrong person  .another same point is that humans who must count the votes by the traditional system could make miskates when they have to count up every vote.so it´s easier to count them whit the coumputer which automatically counting the votes.antother aspect from the presentation i´ve heard is that also the computer could make mitakes beacuase the computer is from humans too.these are the most aspects from the text and the presentation about the two votings systems.
