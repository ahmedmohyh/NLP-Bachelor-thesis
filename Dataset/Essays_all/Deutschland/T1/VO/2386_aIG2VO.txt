The speaker spoke about the voting system and the different ways of counting the votes in the USA. It was said that the used system counting the votes one for one by humans ist about to be replaced by computer technology. But People who aren`t used to computers might vote compleatly wrong. But the same is said in the text for people with poor eyesight. Also computers were made by humans , they are not as unmistakable as we think. The text in contrast says we trust those systems in our everyday life- why not during elections? In the speakers opinion, the errors caused by humans whom are not used to computers will cause far more trouble than few wrong counted votings in one area. The text agrees in point to the work people have counting every single vote. But there are votes on paper, not destroyable by a wrong fingertip. If all those might get lost, you will have to repeat the whole election in the USA. So theres a conflict between using the traditional system or technology. Normal human mistakes versus not foreseeable technology errors. The text supports the computers, while the speaker prefers the traditional system.
