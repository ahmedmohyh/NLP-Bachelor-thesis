What is the best way to vote? The hightech method by computers or the old-fashioned method by paper? There are always advantages and disadvantages. Let's start with the voting by computers. It is a lot easier to vote witth a computer by just clicking on a buttet and being done. People who have problems with their eyes have a higher chance to really vote for the person who they want to vote for. They can zoom in and they don't have a proplem with small letters on a paper. Also another advantage is the time to count the vote. If an actual person counts each ballot by itself it takes such a long time. In this case a computer would do that job in seconds. But what happens if there is an error in the system of the computer? Thousands of voting can dissapear or just delete. This couldn't happen if someone is counting them by hand. Every person can make mistakes for sure but these aren't as heavy as a computer makes them. A person can miss some vote or counts a few votes wrong like putting a vote to the wrong candidate. But that isn't as bad as a whole mistake in a system.
But we all have to remember that some people simply don't want to vote on computers because of trust issues even if they're using online banking. 

Finally you can say there are always pros and cons and that sometimes computers are better and sometimes the counting by hands with an actual person.
