In the audio the woman said that the traditional voting have problems and the new modern voting with computer technology is a lot better. But there can be also problems because some people might have porblems with the computer because of the fear of new technology. But in America they vote not very often maybe two times the year, so she said computer voting is completely trustfull. About the isscounts the woman said that its more easier to count them with the computer voting than with the traditional system. The text say the same. Miscounts can be damaging if an election i closely contestetes. The text showa problems of the old voting system too. One problem is the inaccurance with voting by a paper because people with poor eyesight might not be able to choose the right candidate on the paper. With the computer touch system its a lot easier to pick the rght one. The second problems the text shows is that its heavier to count the votes with the old system because one person has to count all the ballots and that takes a loit of time. The computer in contrast does all the counting alone. The text and the audio both say that the computer voting is new but we are able to trust them. Because in our modern world computer technology is used by everyone everyday for example by governemnets or banks. The computer voting system is new and maybe some people will have problems with it but in general its better and easier for everyone.
