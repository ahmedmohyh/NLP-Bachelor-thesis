The arguments of the text are that for example people who can´t see very well could vote for the wrong person while you would only choose a name on a touchscreen if there were computer systems. There is a similar argument on the other side that says that people who aren´t used to tecnology could also make mistakes choosing a person. 
While the one side thinks that the votes need to be counted more acurrately because human errors can make big diffrences the other side makes clear that there can be heavy mistakes in the programm or computer errors that could cause very expensive repairing or maybe a new election, too. Thousends of votes could get lost if there accure such big mistakes in programms. but why wouldn´t people trust voting systems on computers while they do online banking or send top secret information without giving a thought to what could happen?
You can clearly see that the text and speech are "opponents" arguing for opposites. The text would like some innovations for the voting systems while the woman who gave th speech seemed to mistrust the computer systems and rather accept the small mistakes done at counting votes.
