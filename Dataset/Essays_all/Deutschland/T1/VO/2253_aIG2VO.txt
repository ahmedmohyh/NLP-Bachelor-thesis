The text says that there are many problems with the traditional voting system, which can be fixed by a new computer voting system. In the traditonal system you have to pick one name on a large sheet of paper and people with eyesight problems could easily make mistakes. There could be also some mistakes made by those who have to count the votes. They have to go through every sheet on by one and this can lead to inaccurate counting. Also we are already using computersystems for banking and communication so we could use it for voting too. In the speech it is said that it is true that there are problems with the traditional counting system but with a new computer voting system there will be many more problems. For people who do not have computer knowledge it will be hard to use the computersystem because they do not know how to use it. And its not sure if a computer system would be better than the traditional system because they are written by humans and humans can makes mistakes. And if there is a mistake in this computer system it will lead to thousands of incorrect votings. The argument that we are already trust in computer systems every day to accurate in banking is not fully true. Those computersystems are used every day not like voting. When those computersystems were used for the first time there were many problems but those problems were fixed over the time. When there is a problem with the system on the votingday it would creat massiv damage.
