When a voting was made about the major or something like that, then the votes must be count. The Problem is how? When a computer count them the human with less eyesight can see more from the counting and a human error would not be there, said the text. But the woman is against it, she said that already computer are the problem because they are built by human and when they do not do what there are built for, many votes would get lost. Also the traditional system is not the right for the counting. Then there the people could choose the wronge candidate because of a less eyepower, so that the voting would be incorrect and when they count the vote many votes can lost or not count right. But the women said, when the humans count the vote there could be an wrong counting but then only one or two and not thousand like by the computer. So the text and the women are not for the same counting system.
