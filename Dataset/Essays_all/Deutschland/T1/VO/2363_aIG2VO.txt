Problems with voting during our technology time.
In the audio data it said that the voting by new machines is not good. People do mistakes and these machines to count the votes can have mistakes, beacause they are made my human. Also often there is no storrage for all the nation wide given votes. So when there is a speculation of a mistake. You can not look into a list of all the voting data in the computers. Also some people who don't have a computer at home or who are old and just not good with technology may don't know how to use the machines while giving their vote.
In the given text it says that the traditional voting is not good and should be replaced by the modern one. In this text it sayy that there are even bigger problems in the traditional, because the votes are counted by people and they can do a lot of mistakes. Against that is the women from the audio how says that humans produce the mistakes by the modern voting way too. Also the traditional one is slow and has the plus that you can recount and the modern one is fast but you can't recount.
The test gives information that old people can not read and see the names of the candidates beacause the traditional paper is small, so all the names are written really little. On the modern computer voting machines you can even click on the names and theyy show them bigger so even people with bad eyesight can vote for the person they want to.
I hope that you now have enough information to figur out which voting system you like the best.
