In the Text the US voting system is critizised. The main point is, that the system is highly inefficient, because votes can be counted wrong or people could vote for the wrong candidate by accident, if they have poor eyesight or are confused by the large list of names on the ballot. The idea is to make a computerized voting, so the counting of votes can not be messed up. Also it would save time because the votes do not have to be counted by hand one by another, but the computer or voting machine will do it automatically. Another point is, that computers do not make mistakes which is completely normal, when humans handle with thousands of ballots. The argument, that using computers is too risky, the text answeres with the point, that in governments banks etc. computers have been used for years and work "perfectly accurate".

The answer to this text is, that computers should not be used, because they can make mistakes as well, because they are programmed by humans and when there is an error with the computer system, it can make a huge difference. if maybe thousands of votes are counted wrong or get lost. When there are mistakes by counting by hand, the effect is very small and may be not importand. Furthermore some people, who e.g can not afford a computer or do not want to use one are not used to computers and it is very hard for them to deal with that when voting. Also it could discourage them to vote, because of the unknown. The risk of using is actually there although computers in e.g. banking are working. But they are used nearly everyday and were improved over the years. Voting machines would be used only once in 4 years and have to work perfectly accurate from the beginning.
