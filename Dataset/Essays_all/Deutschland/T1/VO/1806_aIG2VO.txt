The text "Voting" deals with the opinion of Critics, who think that current voting systems aren't really efficient because they often lead to mistakes while counting.

One possible solution could be to replace the current system with more efficient and faster computerized voting systems. In todays world most people trust in computer technology, for example in banking transactions. Furthermore it would be easier for people with poor eyesight to use computerized voting machines because a voter only needs to touch the candidate's name and the name of the candidate can even be magnified by the computer for better viewing, so they don't vote for the wrong candidate.
