In the presentation the benefits and risks of a computerized voting system were described.The woman who spoke about the voting systems had the argument that people who are used to working with computers will have it easier to vote,while people who aren´t used to working with computers might have difficulties.The womans next point was to explain,how computers are machines crafted by humans and were improved over time.In other words both the old voting system and the computerized voting system have implemented human error.For instance the designed program to count and summarize the votes on each candidate may:crash,mix up some numbers or could not even function properly(not counting every vote).On the other hand the current voting system (as described in the text) has a higher probability of human error,by either the voter ticking the wrong box or the person responsible for counting the votes, could make mistakes.Not to mention how time consuming the current voting system is with so many people having to count each and every vote within the 52 states individualy.However the main difference the between the text and the speech is that in the text a computerized voting system is described as more efficient and accurate,however it bears a lot of risks and the audio speech tries to explain how both systems are not ideal and can lead to problems.
