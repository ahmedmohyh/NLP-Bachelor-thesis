The audition about voting mentioned many negative statements about the computerisation of voting, while the written article shows the more positive sides of it. 
One critic about voting with computers is, that there are many people who are not really used to the new technologies and who maybe don't really know, how to use them. Especially the old citicens maybe won't come to vote anymore, because they are in fear of computers in generall. All people should be wanting to vote and no one should be held from voting, just because of the way he has to do it.
Against this the article tells the reader that the voting system used today is making way to much mistakes by using computers to vote, it would be much easyer, faster and without mistakes to count all the votes.
As a statement against this it is said, that the programs used in the computers is also just written by humans and if the programm code contains just a small mistake, the whole counting of the votes could go wrong. The problems that this would cause would be too big to allow the usage of computers.
