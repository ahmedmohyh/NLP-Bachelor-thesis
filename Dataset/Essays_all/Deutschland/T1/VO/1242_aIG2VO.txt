The presentation held by a critic of the computerized voting system argumented against the introduction of the system. She said that not everbody has a PC and therefore not everybody could participate in computerized votes. Furthermore she said that the argument: the officials must count every ballot by hand and that would lead inevitably to errors is irrelavant because computers are also programmed by human beings who could also make errors. These errors would be far more fatal because there would be a counting error on every ballot analyzed by that PC, what could be avoided by manual counting through people.
It is also said that these systems would be unsafe and could be hacked easily what would make elections completely unnessary but you must think on other areas where computer systems are used in common examples given: online-banking or transmission of sensitive data. With this in mind the argument that the systems are unsafe and should therefore not be used is as false as you don't want to make any online transactions anymore. The argument that especially elders could use magnifying techniques to ease the reading of the candidates names given in the text is not mentioned by the woman who gave the presentation at all.
