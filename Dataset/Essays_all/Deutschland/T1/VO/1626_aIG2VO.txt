The speech is about computer rised votings and their good and bad side. 
One problem with computer rised votings is that older people or people, who are not so much into computers often have problems with the system and the technology. So it is possible that they get in trouble, for example with choosing the right name. This is the same problem people with poor eyesight have when they get a large paper with lots of names. Sometimes they mark the wrong name. 
The next argument against computer rised votings is that computers are programmed by humans, which means that they can´t be so much better than humans. For example it is possible that one computer has an error, which automatically leads to hundreds or thousands of miscounts. In addition votings are highly sensitiv and private information and it is very risky to put all of them on one computer system. People, who are really into computers are able to hack the system without by trouble and get the information. 
On the other hand it is also an easy job to steal the papers of the old voting system and to manipulate those. 
So both systems have their problems, but it is easier to controll the old system than to controll a computer.
