The text and the reading are about the the voting system in the United States.

The voting-process is still a very complicated thing for many americans. The Lists are too long and the gaps between each canidate too which results in many miscounts in the end of the voting. This could also have big influences on the vote if for example the election is closely contestet. Also the votes are calculated by humans and since humans life they make mistakes. So there is the idea of closing the manuell voting and write computersystems for the voting-process because many people think that they are more effizient than humans. But there are some arguments against an automatic voting-system: At first the programs we use today needed a long period of development to earn the trustness they have today. A further argument against is that the older generations and the people who do not spend so much time in front of the computer may will have many problems with the digital systems and options. One big problem too in the United States is that the persons who vote for a special votingman, want him to vote an other canidate and so their personal vote won´t be added. 

My personal opinion about this topic is, that the manuell voting weren´t that bad in the past and that computersystems are sometimes more ineffizient than real humans. I think they should change the voting letter first so that it is more easier for the older generations and the people wo have to calculate the votes.
