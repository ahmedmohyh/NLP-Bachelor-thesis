In the speech about the different ways of voting , we are told that voting on the computer isn't always as easy as it sounds. Most people might think, that using a computer isn't difficult at all, but some people, for example the ones that can't afford a computer aren't used to it. For these people computervoting is a lot more difficult than the traditional way. So even though a lot of people make mistakes on the traditional voting sheet and accidentaly vote for the wrong candidate, because of the many names that are listed on the sheet, the same amount of people would make mistakes when they vote on the computer, just because they don't know how to use it. The traditional way of voting is inefficient , because it takes a very long time for humans to count all the votesn and it's likely for them to make mistakes when they're counting, for the computer in the other hand it's quite easy und quickly done. On the other hand the mistakes, that humans make only affect their own vote, but if the computer has an error a lot of votes can be deleted.

Computers also didn't always work as reliable as today, that's why especially the old part of the society maybe wouldn't trust the computer voting .
