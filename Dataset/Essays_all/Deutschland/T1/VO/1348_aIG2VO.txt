Today the President of the United States of Amerika is elected. But next to the discussion about the candidates,  the discussion abou the voting system is interesting and important too. 
the voting system splits up in two ways, the old way collecting the votes on paper paper and the new way to take the votes on computer. 
Both groups have a hard discussion and own views on the Vote system.
The group which applys to the vote on acomputer says, that it is more easyer to vote on a computer than stick crosses on paper. Especially for people with problems on eyes this system is better. They are able to read the names on the list on a computer better than on a small pice of paper. 
Anothe Pro argument for the computer vote is, that the computers count the votes better than humans. Humans are able to fail counting thousand of different votes for different candidates. If there were mistakes a long way of recounting takes action.

The Pro paper group say that Computer could not be 100 percent safe too, because they were programmized by human too. If the Compuers has a problem 1000 of votes could count for the other candidates or get lost This risc is bigger than the regular count by well educated people. 
Another point is that the vote on Computer could be very difficult for people, which do not use the computer regular. They can not take the right candidate or fail at trying this.  

In the end if anybody says the computer is too risc to count votes, every day billions of dollar were send on the internet by Computers .This technology is very safe.
