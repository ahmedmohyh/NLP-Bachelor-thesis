The text says that the american voting system is inefficient and outdated. People, for example, often vote for the wrong candidate by accident because the ballots contain many Names and are hard dechipher and to understand. A computerized vote would be simpler and have help, a magnifiying option for people with bad eyesight for example. But voting on Computers can scare people who arent familiar with this relatively new technology. They often times dont know how Computers work or dont have acces to one. This Fear of Technology would lead to even less voters.
The next point in the text is, that because humans count the votes the system is prone to errors. computerized Systems would count fast and reliably leaving no space for errors. However the programms wich are used to count votes are created by humans. And one small error in the software could account for thousands of missvotes wich would be way worse. 
The last point of the text is that some people say implementing computer voting is too risky, but they trust the banks and their goverment computers with their highly sensitive data. the problem with that however is that, the goverment and bank systems took a long time to create and they didnt work flawlessly at first either. They only be trusted because they went trough years of testing, making them as reliable as they are today. Creating a new digital voting System from ground that works well, up would take time. But elections only happen twice a year leaving almost no time for testing.
