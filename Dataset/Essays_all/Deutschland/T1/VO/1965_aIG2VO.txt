Voting today is a very discussed theme in the whole word. Traditional and computerized voting have both mistakes and you can´t trust them for 100%.
If you say that the people who are dealing with the ballots in the tradiotional way can make mistakes while they are counting then you have to think about that the computers are programms which are made by humans too. Technology is used every day while banking and buying things on the internet  so you take trust in them every day but twice a year not? 
An important argument is that people which are not dealing with computers every day , for Example old people, have problems with the computerized system but then there is also to say that people who can´t look very good will have problems to make their mark on the right place because the ballots are very little.
The most important argument is that when the people who are dealing with the ballots make a mistake then just a few ballots are missed but when the computer program makes a mistake then thousand of votings are missed and then the whole voting was for nothing because you can´t repair it so like that the votes will be the same like before.
Both of the voting systems have behaviors but also problems so voting will be always a theme which is discussed because there won´t be a way which combines the traditional and the computerized system. In that case everybody has to decide for themself if they want to be a part of the poltics but to have also the risk that their vote won´t be like they wanted it to be.
