The woman was talking about the votingsystem in the United States. She said that if the traditional system is going to be replaced by a comuter system there will be lots of points against it. For people that are good in using technoligy it will be better but what about the people ho are not used to deal with a computer. Also a computersystem can have errors because a human made it. When there will be an error there will be thousands of votes that are miscounted. That would be so bad for the voting an the voting has to take place again.
In text it says that the traditional votingsystem is really bad and that a new touch computersystem would be much better fourthermore for the old peole who are bad in reading little lines like they are on the traditional sheets. It would be a more efficient system for the United States.
It says that it often happens that people vote the wrong candidate becouse of the small lines and the little cross they have to make next to the name of the candidate. So it would end as a wrong voting and maybe the wrong candidate wins.
And also it is really hard to count the votes by hand so it would be much better if that would do the technoligy. 
The woman from the speech thinks that a computersystem made by humans can also have errors and it would end really bad if this would happen. All in all the text and the speech are not having the same opinion about replacing the traditional system with a more modern touch-computersystem.
The writer from the text would really prefer a replacing and to give it a chance but the woman is not interested in having a new system because there would be more errors and other bad things in her opinion.
