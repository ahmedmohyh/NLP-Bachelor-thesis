The voting is a very specific topic in the United States. Every voting system is risky. So in the United States they began to search for an new plan to organise a very save voting with no errors. 
Now I will start with an essay about the voting system now in the US and about the speculation of a new voting system.
It is an complecated topic but we can say that the voting system now is not really save and not efficient. The humans had to count the ballots one by one and thats a really big problem, because if there is an error they have to start again and again. Additionally there is a second problem: You easily can manipulate the counter, so he changes the number of the votes. 
The United States just think about any other system. They think about a technology voting systme ,so they replace the the traditional voting system with computers. The computes got the positive point ,that it get not really fast any error. 
In the text the computerized system is very good presented but in the audio you can realize the problems ,which a coputerized system brings into the election.
The first problem ist that the computer system could break down and then it is like an error of a human. But there is another really important point: It is very risky to count the votes on a computer ,because thze computers are very easy to hack. And when a computer system is hacked by an maipulater you have no chance to correct the voting. And when its nationwide you got the problem that every one could hack this system.
That are the main differences between the text and the audio.
