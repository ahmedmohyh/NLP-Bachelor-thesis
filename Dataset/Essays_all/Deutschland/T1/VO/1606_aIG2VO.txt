Some critics on the voting system want a computer voting system in the United States, but is this system really trustworthy?
On one hand there are people, who can't use a computer. They don't know how to handle it and maybe they also make mistakes, for example voting for the wrong person. Technology always brings problems with it and not everyone is able to deal with a computer. In the text it says, that people with poor eyesight make mistakes by marking the right name. But than these people also have problems by voting with a computer. Also when people say, it's easy to handle it: for some it's not.There will be people that want to vote, but have problems with it because they don't know how and don't trust their vote on the computer that it really arrives there. So it's better to vote without a computer system and just make a mark.
Also there's a problem with counting the votes. In the text it says, that when a human count the votes, they make a few mistakes and maybe miss a few ballots. But that's the worst that can happen. When you count votes with a computer, there are worst problems like deleting them all. So it's better to spend much time by counting them than doing big mistakes in the voting system. It's too risky and could bring other problems with it like doing the voting again.
