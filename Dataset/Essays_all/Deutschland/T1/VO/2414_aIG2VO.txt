According to the woman holding the little speech, the computerized voting system only works better for persons who are used to using technology. Many elder persons would get in trouble when they tried to vote on a computer. Even if all persons could deal better with the eletronical voting system you can not say that this variante is much better or safer than the traditional voting system.   Surprisingly the text says the exact opposite about the voting system. It says that  the traditional system leads to an "inaccurate counting of votes", because many people would accidentally mark the wrong candidate. This would be caused by the big amount of possible choices on the large sheet of paper. An easy touch screen system would be the option that would lead to the best possible counting of votes and everythinmg would be easier. 
The text also says that computerized systems would remove the possibility of human mistakes. The problem with this is that the computers are controlled by humans. So mistakes by humans can still cause a lost of some votes.Like we heard in the presentation there is also a huge difference between human mistakes  and mistakes by the computer sxstem. A human mistake would only lead to a loss of a very low amount of votes while the mistake by the computer would cause a loss of thousands of votes.
Both systems have their difficulties and you have to wait until the computer system really works without any problems. Until that point opf time in the future the traditional system will make it's job.
