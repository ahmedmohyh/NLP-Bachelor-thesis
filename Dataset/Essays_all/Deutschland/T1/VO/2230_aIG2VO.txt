The text above seems to be part of some kind of speech dealing with the propability to develope a new voting system or rather to exchange the current voting system against one that is supposed to be faster and more accurate. The speech heard after that generally deals with disadvantages of the voting system if it would be based on computerized mechanisms reffering to counting the votes and similar tasks. 
The first thing, which states some kind of disadvantage, that got mentioned in the second speech is that it could lead to severe issues if the current voting system were to be replaced because people who are exemplary not used to computers or solely cannot afford one of these would be at a disadvantage there. The first speech seems to have been held before the one that was heard second because of what i take for being the truth the first one does not state any point which could counter against the previous argument. After that it is stated that it is,under any circumstances, not guaranteed that the computers are not going to make any mistakes counting the various votes because computers are man-made and people make mistakes. This stands in vast contrast to one argument mentioned in the first speech, which is saying that it is unavoidable for humanbeings to make no mistakes. The second speech takes on that point and counters with saying that humanbeings obviusly make mistakes and that everybody knows it but the mistakes humanbeings make referring to the voting system are not severe. In comparison with that it could be absolutely fatal to fully depend on the computers counting the votes because of the aspect mentioned before. Furthermore it is supposed to be problematic having no physical trace of ballots which means that mistakes once done can hardly be removed and corrected. In addition to that the computers are in contrast to humanbeings rather easy to influence which means that they can be hacked  easily.
