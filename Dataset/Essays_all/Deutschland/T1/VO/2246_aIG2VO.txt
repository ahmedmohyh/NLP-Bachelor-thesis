In the text we heard is say, that it is easy to use the computer for any votings for people, who are good with copmuter. But for people, who do not use often the computer can be make many mistakes beacause they do not know how to use it. And the prgrams of the computer voting is made by people and they can be make mistakes by making the programs so the election can be wrong.
In this text say said, that people can make mistakes too because maybe any people with poor eyesight can mark the wrong person because they do not see the person they want to vote for. The ballot are maybe as bad as the voting with the computer because it costs much when people make mistakes by couting the votes and they have to do it again. It says that the computer can counting more easy the votes as people do it.
The two texts have their differents because the one says that to vote with the computer is easier and the other one says that do vote with paper (ballot) is better than with the computer.
