the speech was about how bad computers can be. they said that many people dont have a computer and they dont know how to use them so when they vote they can easily vote the wrong man or woman. they stands for the old system because its taht what everybody knows and the most voters are old people who havent worked with a computer yet so say fail at the voting when they work with the computer for the first time. the biggest thing aginst was the fear for a computer error because when the computer system get an error over 10000 votings are gone. The Statement of the speech is all against the text. the text is for the new voting system with computers because its faster and safer than humans and the touch system makes it easier to vote and dont vote the wrong candidate. at the old system to many fails can be made for example when you have to count the votes it cost to much time and to many fails. Both sites have good arguments and the text and the speech its like two president candidates vote for each other the two have nothing the same they work against each other.
