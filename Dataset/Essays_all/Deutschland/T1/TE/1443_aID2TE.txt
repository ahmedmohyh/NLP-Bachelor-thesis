A lot of teachers aks themselves if the ability to relate well with students is more important that an exellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
There are some argument for and against this statement. The first argument against is that a teacher has to teach. Teachers get payed for teaching and teaching don't mean that you have so be like "best buddys" with the students. Also it happends very often that if the teacher is to kind because he cares a lot if the students like him or not, the students don't have respect and do what they want. That makes the atmosphere impossible for teaching and learning. But on the other hand a teacher has to be kind, because if the students like him they maybe will have more fun at this lessons. Also its better to have a trusting relationship with the teacher, because if you have problems and you don't know who to tell or with who you should talk abou that, that can help you a lot. Students are also more open and not so shy when they know that the teacher is willing to help them and cares about them. 
I think that it is very important to have both things, the ability to relate well with students and the excellent knowledge of the subject. Because thats the only way to teach the students the subject and give them a good education but thats also the way that they can learn (from the teacher) how to be a good, kind and friedly person. In my view that the only way to make the world more educatend and filled with better people.
