The question what a good teacher is, is deffently a very hard one to answer.
Lets first try to figure out what is more important: relate well with student, or teaching the excellent knwoledge.

If a teacher can realte well to most of his students, for them it is much easier to follow, to understand an even to have some fun in class. The students should not be afraid of asking a question or an exam. Also for the teacher class is much more relaxed and enjoy able when he can realte well to his students.
On the other hand school would not be useful if children would not learn something. Thats what they are here for. In the end of school you can not just say you had a bad teacher and everybody will understand. The last and biggest exams are equal for every student, unlikely what teacher they had. Also if a the students can not be taught excellent knowledge the have to do it on their own. Some childrens do not have well educated parents they can ask, or not the money for extra lessons, so for them it is even harder. This means more work and less freetime. It is very frustrating to not being able to follow class or to not understand anything and the student will start thinking it is their fault. 

In my opinion both points are important for a good teacher. In the class one to maybe four it is more important for students to have fun. At this early time it is not a problem if they do not understand something. At this time they first have to learn to work with other kids and to behave well. Later, exspecialy in class 10 to 12 (or 13) it is more important to learn and to understand, because at the end of the A levels students have to write some big and very impotant exams. Maybe a school day is hard if the teacher is not nice, but this does not matter when you passed the exams and are out of school. Like I said in the beginning the exams of the A levels are for everybody the same.
