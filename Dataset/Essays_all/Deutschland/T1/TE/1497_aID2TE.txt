It is difficult to find a direct solution about this topic. A good behaviour with students and a sympatic way of teaching is good to build up a private social friendship with the teacher. But isn´t also important to learn right and effectial? To learn for the life and to know how to use grammar and to imponate people with your second language? 
I think so. A teacher who isn´t able to teach us excellent the English language isn´t the right one to be a teacher. 
"A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than a excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.", I disagree. 
It must be annoying in the lessons when a discussion about the daily topic starts and students have more knowledge than the teacher. They have the exercise to translate their knowledge about grammar, the english way of life maybe or the tipes of writing in the english language and poetic history to his students.

But the teacher has to be a partner to speek too. Problems with other teachers, students or topics are the main topics. 
Critical is that the vote doesn´t say which teacher are meant. I wrote down the main stuff teacher, like english, math, history or france. Trust-teacher have to relate in the best way they can but also sport or art teacher do not have to realte bad with studentds. To agree or disagree with the statement is connected with type of teacher. 

In my way of thinking I disagree with it because a teacher has to have an excellent knowledge about the subject being taught. But I agree when students with problems have to trust them.

In my opinion is it very difficult to wright down a significant solution because it depence on the topic the teacher is teaching.
