The following essay is about the theme, whether teacher´s ability or the excellent knowledge is more important for students.
In my opinion the exellent knowledge of the subject isn´t as important as the teacher´s ability, because the human aspect is more important than the knowledge. It is more important to understand the students. Through this the students are happier and also more motivated, because they like their teacher. If the teacher has just the excellent knowledge of the subject, they know very much about their subject, but maybe they can´t handle with the student, because the teacher hasn´t skills to handle with other humans. Furthermore the teacher can´t work well with the students, because he can´t give them his knowledge in a good way. In this situation the students are also not really happy, because they have no fun, while they learn they new knowledge skills. 
But on the other hand the knowledge is important as well, because the student´s need correct information. So the teacher should has at least the correct information to give the students a good opportunity to get good grades. 
All in all I think the teacher should be both, on the one hand he need the ability to relate well with students but on the other hand he should have at least correct information about his subject and also a good knowledge about his subject. 
In my opinion a good teacher should has a good middle between both aspects, because both are important aspects to teach the students well. So I think the perfect teacher has a good or excellent knowledge of the subject and also a ability to relate well with students, whether they are two completely different skills.
