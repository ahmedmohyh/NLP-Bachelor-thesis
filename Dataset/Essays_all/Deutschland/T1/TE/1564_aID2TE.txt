I think the teacher's ability to relate good with his students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught. I agree with this statement, because from the teacher's side and the students side it is very important to understand the other. The teacher must be good with his students to teach them sucessful and to quote them with fair grades. The teacher must know his students, because sometimes one student is very bad at one theme. When the teacher doesn't know him very well, he can't understand the student. Teacher and students must be have empathy. When they don't know eachother, they can't understand the situation from them.

A negative point of view is, that it is very difficult for teacher to understand every single student in his class. Every teacher doesn't have only one class to teach. The teacher must know everything about everybody of his students. And this is hard to handle. For example there is one student, who has psychological problems with family members or friends and then they got a awful grade and begin to cry. For the teacher it is tricky to understand the students life and to understand this person.

Therefore it is very it is more important, that a teacher's ability to relate well with his students is than excellent knowledge of the subject is taught.
The teacher can to this an can handle this, because they decide to be a techer. This is their job to teach students very well and to decide how and why they are they bad at this subject.
