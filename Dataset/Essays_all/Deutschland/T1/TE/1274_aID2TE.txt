I Think that its more imortant that the teacher is able to relate with the students well than his or her knowledge of the subject he/she taughts.
 
In my point of view its very important for the teacher that the has enough knowledge to teach the students well. If he doesn't, it is not very helpful for the students to be taught by a person like that. It wouldn't make sence. The kids/ students wouldn't learn enough or even nothing so they could easily stay home.  
So to conclude you can say that it's very important that the teaching teacher has enough Knowledge.

But on the other point of view it doesn't make sence if a teacher hasn't the ability to relate welll with the students. A teacher who can't deal with students or kids is not able to teach well. In this point it is the same if he or she has the knowledge or even not. I think in this case you can't decide for one statement.

You have to have knowledge if you wnat to teach students but you have to have the ability to relate well with them too. 

So to take Bezug to the question i would say that I disagree with the statement.
