Teacher. This is one of the most ipmortant professions in our world. Every human must be educated for the leeving in the present time. But every teacher must know good, that he does. He must give knowledge for the schoolboys and schoolgirls, because after the school education everybody will study and make the job, that he or she likes. But in the school time every child and teenager will be as identifical person.And teachers must help them.
The teachers abilities to relate well with students is important, becose every student must feel respect to the teacher, and be very well to him.They must feel, that the docent is not bad man,he want to teach them. But in this time the teacher must have good knowledge in his job. He must good know that he is doing, that knowledge can he give students. He must be able and well for them. The human can know something very good, but he can not tell this good, that everybody can understand this.
For example. i had in the 5th grade the teacher, who could make me clear some answeares. She was very well to person, who has interests for the lessons. But in the lessons she can not tell us the subjects, that he did must to tell us. She can not relate with students. She was young und did not has still experience. And i did think, thas this profession as theaher is not her profession. 
But earlier i had still a theacher, who can good to relate with students, but do not have good knowledge of the subjects. Every schoolboy and schoolgirl needs this knowledge. Everybody want to undestand and know, that he learns. And the theacher must good know, that about he tells.
So, in conclusion i want to say, thas balance between excellent knoledge of the subjects and  teacher,s ability to relate with student must be. The docent must teach, and he must know how he this doing and what he is knowing. Good knowledge and good
