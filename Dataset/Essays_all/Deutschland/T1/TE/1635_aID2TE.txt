Some students have problems in school, because their teacher is not friendly and only wants to do his job by teaching the topics very strict, but is this the wright way or is the teachers ability to relate well with his students more important?

 I disagree with the statement , but i would not say a good relation between students and theacher is not important. The main exercise of a teacher is teaching their students. A good relation to their old teacher will not help the students later is their life. If the teacher teach his subject in an exellent way, the students will have the chance to learn everyting they have to know and will not play games ore something like that to support the relation with the teacher. But on the other hand, the students do not learn so much, if their teacher only tell him everything they have to know. The students learn maybe more, if the teacher is friendly and explains eveything in detail, that everyone can understand the topic. The problem is, that it takes much time to explain everything in detail and then the teacher maybe can not teach every topic in the semester, because he spent so much time for one topic, that everyone understood now.


To summerize everything i would say, that excellent teaching is more important than a good relation between teacher and their students.
