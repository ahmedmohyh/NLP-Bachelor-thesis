With the statement '' A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught." i don't agree totally, because in my opinion knowledge of the subject that is thaught is an important factor to teach student's. When you don't know what informations the students need about a subject and because of that can't give the informations to them, the students won't lear anything. In that case it does not care if you relate well with the students, because they wont learn by relating well with them. Also they will study more when they are a kind of afraid of you as teacher because they dont' want to be threated by you and get blamed in front of the whole class. 
At the other side it won't be good if, throught you have the best knowledge in the subject, you can't relate with the students at all, because if they dont like you as your teacher they also dont like the subject you teach and they wouldn't find it interisting anymore, based on they ever did. There is also a danger that the students won't understand your explanations if you don't relate well with them.
So at the end i have to say, that if you have only the ability to relate well with studens or only have an excellent knowledge about the subject you teach the students won't lear the stuff as good as possible.In my opinion a teacher needs a mix of both. He have to relate well with students, have a good or excellent knowledge of the subject and also he have to explain well. When he can't explain somthing but by himself knows what the answere is and relates also good with the students, they still won't have the knowledge they need to get a good mark in their exam.
In that case i disagree with the statement at the beginning
