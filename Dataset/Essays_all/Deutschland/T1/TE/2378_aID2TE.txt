I don´t disagree but I also don´t agree with the statement "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.", because the sentence is not choosen very well. 
 
In class there are a lot of specific kinds of students who are very different in learning, listening and speaking. So the teacher don´t reach them all with his good relationship. In general I don´t think that you can say it to all students that  they have a good relationship to the teacher although the teacher can´t teach very well. At many students it is better to teach well and than there´s a good relationship to the students. In opposite some students like the teacher if he doesn´t do good lessons because they don´t have to learn many times. Some other students like both, e.g. bad knowledge of the subject and a good relationship to the teacher. But another kind of students think about the future if they have learned enough for university and so on. The consequence is that they don´t like the teacher because of non excellent kind of lessons. 
If you change the parts of the sentence into "The excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is more  important than a teacher´s ability to relate well with students.", it comes nearer to my opinion. But it isn´t very perfect than because you can write this things in on sentence. The teacher´s relationship to the students is built on the excellent knowledge and the excellent knowledge is built ond the teacher´s relationsiph to the students. 
There are some kind of  teacher´s who have excellent knowledge of his subject and there is a part who has a little bit less knowledge. 
Finally it is important how the teacher and the students think about each other and at the end they have an meaning if they love or hate each other.
