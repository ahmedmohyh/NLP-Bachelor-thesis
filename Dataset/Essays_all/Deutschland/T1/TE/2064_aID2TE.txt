It is known that many people, often old ones, say that the school of today isn`t the one of gone times. Earlier, when they went to school, teachers were there to deciplinate the students and to teach the students. Today sometimes it is more importent to have, as a teacher, a good relation to your students than to know everything about your subject. But what is the better way for stundents to learn something? Teachers who know every single fact about theire subject, but can`t understand the students and because of that can`t help them with everything or teachers with a good relationship to theire students, so they understand them, but without the knwing of each detail of their subject?
Defenetly it is very important for teachers to understand their students well and to have a good relation, because with that the students are more motivated and often can understand complicated facts better, because the teacher can "feel" the students.
But I wouldn`t say that that`s the most important aspect. A teacher who has the best relation to his students, who understand them, but hasn`t the optimal knowledge of his subject can`t be a really good teacher, becaus students go to school for learning, not for have fun with their teacher, because they have the best relationship to him. If they learn maybe wrong or not all important facts, it isn`t important how good theire relationship to the teacher was.
In my opinion, the most important fact for teachers is, that they have the best knowledge of their subject, because that`s the reason why students go to school, to learn things. But it is also important, that teachers find their best way to teach those facts to their students, because if the teacher doesn`t understand why his students don`t understand his tought facts, students can`t learn anything. But that`s not the most important aspect, the most important aspect is, that the teacher know his subject exactly.
