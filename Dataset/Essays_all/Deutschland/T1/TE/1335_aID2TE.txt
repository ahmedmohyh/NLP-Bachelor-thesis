In the following text we would discuss the statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.".

It's very improtant that the students are respecting you. When they are not respecting you then the teacher has a very hard job whith teaching the students. The students would be loud every lesson with this teacher in school. Besides the can't learn the important stuff in school. This is a very big disadvantage for the students. Finally the parents of the students would say that the teacher is the problem and not the students. But for the teacher it's also a disadvantage when the students don't learn the important stuff. When the principal get to know that the students can't learn something with this teacher then the teacher would lost his job as a teacher. It's hard to get respect from students. That means it's important that teachers have a good ability to relate with students.

Otherwise it's also important that the teachers have an excellent knowledge of the subject the would teaching. Without an excellent knowledge the students havn't got any chance to learn something with this teacher. And without an chance to learn something they would get problems when they are wirting their exams. Also it's difficult for the students when they get a new teacher and this teacher thinks that the students learned the most important things. A teacher without an excellent knowledge is a big disvantage for the students. But also this teacher would get problems when he is searching for a job because which school would have an teacher without an excellent knowledge? For both sides it's an disadvantage.

Finally I think an teacher with an excellent knowledge about the subject he would teach is more important than an teacher who has a very good ability to relate well with students. A tacher without an excellent knowledge is a big disadvantage for the students.
