In the following text I am going to mention some arguments for and against the statement 'A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.'. An argument for the statement is that if a teacher is too good in a topic he often tries to explain it in a language that is hard to understand for people who do not really know the topic. But if a teacher can not really explain the topic because he does not know it either it is also hard to understand. But if the whole situation in the class is better there is not so much pressure on the students. The problem with this is that some students do not learn for a test because they understand the tasks during the lessons and do not think that there may be more difficult tasks in a test. And if this topic is important for a mark in theier graduation it probably is hard to get a good mark. And students who understand the topic do not go to the lessons becaus it is boring for them. In my oppinion it is important to have a good conection between a teacher and his or her students but if it is too good the topic or the lesson can not be taught very good. I think you can not really say that it is more important that the teacher has the ability to relate well with the students than an excellent knowledge of the subject. Both things are important for good lessons.
