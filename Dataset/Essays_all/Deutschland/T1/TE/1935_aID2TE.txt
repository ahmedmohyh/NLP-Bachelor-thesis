What defines a good teacher? His ability to relate well with students or an exellent knowledge of the subject? 
In my opinion a teacher's excellent knowledge of the subject being thought is way more important than his or her ability to relate well with students. Only being able to relate well with students will maybe cause good grades but the students won't learn everything they could have known and would not be prepared good enough for university. But that's the reason they are going to school, right?  Of course a teacher should get along well with his students so that the students enjoy going to school and enjoy learning because this will affect their grades in a postive way.  Yes, probably the students will learn something but they would'nt be well educated. They would'nt be educated good in enough in contrast to other students who will have a better chance then to get accepted at an university. This will be the students who will get a better payed job later and who will be more succesfull. Furthermore I think that students always can find a way to get along well with the teacher. So even though the teacher is maybe not nice to them they will hopefully earn new knowledge anyway. 
So all in all I think a teacher first of all has to have an excellent knowledge and if he also has the ability to relate well with his students that's great.
