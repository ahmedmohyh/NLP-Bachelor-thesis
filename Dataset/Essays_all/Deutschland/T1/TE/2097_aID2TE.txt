On schools there are usually different types of teachers. Some of them try to taught their subject with an excellent knowledge, the others think it's more important to have a good relation to their students. But which 
First you can say that the students can better learn with a good atmosphere and this is only possible when they have a good relation to their teachers. Think of straight teachers the students don't like, there can't be a good atmosphere because the students don't feel good.

It's easier for students to learn when they have a good relation to their teachers because they don't be afraid of asking them when they don't understand something. By the way it's also for the teachers easier to taught their subject when their ability is well with their students.
Finally I can say that a good realtion between teachers and students is very important for a good lesson.
