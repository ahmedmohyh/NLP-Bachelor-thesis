In the following text I am going to show arguments for and against the statement "A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught".

Nowadays it is often spoken about the teachers, their abilities and of course their sympathy. About one teacher there are a lot of different opinions and it also depends on the age of the pupils, their abilities in the specific subject and also if the children think that they´re liked by the teacher or not. Besides it is sometimes said that it is the fault of the teacher if the child doesn´t have good marks in this subject. 
That the ability to relate well with students is important clearly shows the behaviour of the students toward their teachers. It can also be  claimed that you listen with more attention to your teacher if you have got a good relation with him. This fact is important for learning in school and having good marks.
But if the teacher doesn´t know well about his subject it will be a border for students too. If there are always pupils who improve the teacher because he says wrong things it will cause problems in the relation with the children and they won´t understand the topic. 

In my opinion it strongly depends on the knowledge of the teachers how they relate with students. It isn´t only an ability but also a thing that the teachers should follow their whole time in that they work as teachers.
