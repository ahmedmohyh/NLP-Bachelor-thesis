I disagree with statement, that the ability of teachers to relate well with students is more important than excellent knwoledge of the subject being taught. In my opinion, the two named aspects have the same importance for being a good and qualified teacher, but the ability to relate well with students is looked at more critical.
Generally, all teachers know their subject really well, but less teachers can relate well with students. I think there are unfortunately lots of people who are getting teachers just because they know their subject well and the perspective and stability of a teacher is very good. That concludes teachers who are unable to teach very well with a good relation to the students.
A teacher won´t be recommended as a good teacher when he has just one one of the named aspects. Less or more a teacher have to be able to teach the students a bright amount and corecct knowledge. A teacher who knows his subject really well and is also interested in it, but has problems with presenting or relating with pupils will have issues. A teacher who is able to teach and relate to pupils but hasn´t enough knowledge in his subject will have issues too. There are just clearly more teacher who have problems in relating with students than with the knowledge of the subject.
A good balance between two of the aspects is the only way to be a qualified teacher. Without the knowledge in the subject you don´t have anything to teach, but when you can´t relate with students you cant teach them understandable.
