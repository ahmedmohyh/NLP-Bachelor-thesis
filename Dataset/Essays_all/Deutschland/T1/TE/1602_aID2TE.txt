The topic of the essay is if the aim of a teacher should be a good relationship between him and his students or if it should be to teach them as much as he can. I think that a teacher has to take care of his students, because he should be a person the students trust in if they've got trouble with their parents or friends. So a good relationship is very important to have a good atmosphere in the class and good-learning students, because they can't focus on the lessons if they've got other big problems. Furthermore, studies have proved that students learn much better when they like the teacher. So these are the positive arguments for the importance of a good relationship. A negative is, for example, that teachers are paid for teaching the students and to give them an excellent knowledge, so that should be the only thing they should focus on. Another argument for the importance of a good knowledge is, that the students have to be well-prepared for studying or whatever they want to do in the future, and a good knowledge and experience in the way how to learn correctly is absolutely necessary for that. In my opinion, the job of a teacher is to prepare their students for the future as much and good as he can, that's what they are paid for, and that's the reason why  a lesson shouldn't be used for therapys. But if a student has got problems at home or in school, he should know that he can trust the teacher, and that the teacher can maybe help him. Otherwise, he can't stay concentrated if there is no one who could help him. So. a teacher should be there for his students, if they need someone to talk to and also prepare them for life, that's why I think that both things have to be important for a good teacher.
