The question `is the teachers ability to relate with the students more importnant than execellent knowledge of the subject ?´ is very interesting, because there are a few different arguements you can talk.
First of all if a teacher doesn´t has the best qualifications in his subject and he is teaching a class which has to be prepared for there final exams than he wouldn´t the best choice however he is related with the class because because he can´t teach them the things that they need for there final exam for example in maths then the won´t pass these test and this would be horrible for the stundents and the teacher.
But i also think if the class and the teacher are having a very good realtionship, if the students would say that their teacher is like a friend to them, then i think that this good relationship has one big advantage that the students will understand way more because `a friend´ is explaining them for example how they should solve a task. Also if the teacher is like a friend to the students they will probably invest more of their time learning for for the subject or invest more time learning for test because they don´t want that a friend is going to be frustrated. 
I think that these arguments for both sides are equalinzing themselves so it`s hard teo tell which typ of teacher would fit for a different typ of class.
But think that good relationsships between a class and a teacher a way more important i lower classes like 6th or 7th grade because the hast qualification to make a very effective lesson and  the studenst are going to learn about the basics they need to pass the final exams. Also they are going to learn and thats the most important thing , how to learn. And with this knowledge or abillity there won t be a problem for them in higher grades like 10th grade beacause they know how to learn and good realtionship won t be needed anymore. So then it is more effevtive to a very good qualified teacher and then the studends are going to be prepared very well for there final exams.
