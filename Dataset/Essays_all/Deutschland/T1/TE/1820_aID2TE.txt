There are people saying that a teacher`s ability to relate with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
This is a thing being discussed hardly in schools. 
On the one hand there is a point of view being told often that a good communication level between a teacher and his/her students is very important. With having a nice Communciation level when speaking with the teacher it is much easier to learn and understand things better. Also this is what makes the students paying more attention on the subject.
On the other hand it is also very important to have a teacher who has a very good knowledge of the subject being taught. For the students is not possible to learn the right way when having a teacher who just concentrates on relating well with students and has a very bad knowledge of his subject. 
But having a "cool" teacher is better than having a "bad" teacher. This is the way students often think and it is not wrong to think things like that.
The way a teacher is teaching the subject is important on whether the students concentrate well and get good grades or they do not concentrate that much on the subject and get bad grades. Teachers would probably say the students have to decide on their own to work well or not but the motivation of a student begins with having a good teacher. This is why most of the students are discussing this topic.
Having a "cool" teacher is important to understand the subject being taught. 
Furthermore the point with having good knowledge I told before is also really important. If you have a teacher relating well with the students he/she also has to have a good knowledge of the subject being taught to teach it in a good and understandable way.
Because of that I would say a mix between having a good "relationship" to the students and knowing the subject well is the best way to get the most attention by the students in a subject. This would a good way for both - the teacher and his/her students.
