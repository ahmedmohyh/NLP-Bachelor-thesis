The statement 'A teachers ability to relate well with students is more important than the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught' is a very difficult one and in the following I am going to analyse it. First of all it is very important that the atmosphere of the class is positive and there is no misunderstanding between the teacher and his students. But it is also useless for a student, if he is really good friends with his teacher and the teacher does not know much about the subject he is supposed to teach. They still have to pass on correct information about the topic or subject, otherwise the students are not going to learn anything. So if there is no basic knowledge of the teacher, there is nothing to pass on to the students. On the other hand, if the teacher cannot teach very well and dislikes the student, or the other way around, it will not be easy to pass on his knowledge. Also it is very important to be good at teaching. Just because you are intelligent, does not mean you can pass on your knowledge well to others, who do not understand the topic you are talking about. The main point about teaching is communication and many students have a different way of learning, So not everyone will learn best if a person stands in front of them and talks about it, some learn better when they read a book or practice what they want to learn. It is important to talk about the abilities of the students and find out how they learn best. Only that way, the students will have the best chance to receive the knowledge and benefit from it.
I do not fully agree with this statement. Of course it is important that the student-teacher-relationship is good and on a friendly base, but actually knowing what to teach is at least as important. In my opinion though, it is the communication that is most important. If the teacher cannot communicate with his students, all of his knowledge or kindness is useless, because it will not help the student.
