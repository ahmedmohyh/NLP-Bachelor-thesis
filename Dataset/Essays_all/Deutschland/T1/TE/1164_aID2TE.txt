The teacher's ability to relate well with students is important and maybe even more important than excellent knowledge of the subject.
First, it should be mensioned that a teacher won't teach well if his knowledge is too bad. Then the students can communicate well with their teacher but they don't learn and understand the thematic because the teacher's knowledge is not good enough. 
Furthermore, how should a teacher explain something he doesn't really understand? Maybe all students like their teacher but the explanations of the teacher is too complex and not simple enough for understanding it well. Then it may be better to have a teacher who has an excellent knowledge of the subject but who's not that good at communicating and relating well with students. 
On the other hand, because of the teacher's ability to relate well with the students the learning-atmosphere gets better. The students can concentrate better and they learn more. If the atmosphere is bad the students won't be motivated and learn less well.
Next and most important, the students can learn much better. The teacher understands the problems of the students and can solve them because he's empathetic and can relate well with students. Plus most of the content being taught are basics and not highly specific. So it's not important that the teacher is perfect at every single specific point. 
In my opinion it's more important that the teacher can communicate and relate well with students because then the students can learn much better and the motivation increases. Plus specific knowledge in a thematic isn't necessary for teaching at school.
