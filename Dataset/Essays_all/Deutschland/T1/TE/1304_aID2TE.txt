I disagree with the statement above. In the following I will explain my opinion.
 I think it is more important, that a teacher knows, what he or she is teaching their students. That is the reason, why students are going to school and not for having a nice chat with the teacher. For me, as a student, it is really important, that the teacher knows, what he is talking about and that I can ask him specific questions to the topic. So for that he has to be good in explaining things. I mean, what is it worth, when a teacher is so friendly and nice to you, when he doesn't know anything what he's talking about. 
He has to take his job serious and be an authority person for us. Because his knowledge also decides about our future. If we don't learn anything in his lessons, we will have a big disadvantage in our future career and we might have problems with our next teachers at university for example. 
That's why I think it is very important, that a teacher is qualified and has an excellent knowledge about the subject. 
Nevertheless I would like to say, that it is still good, if you have a good relation with your teacher, but it isn't the main thing you shoud focus on. And it shouldn't be the teacher's neither. Because in your future career your applied knowledge and qualifications count, not your relation to your teacher. That's why I disagree to the statement.
