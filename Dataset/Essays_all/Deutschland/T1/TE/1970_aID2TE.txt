Is the relation between teachers and stundents more important than the knowledge of the teacher? Many people, mostly parents of students, think about this question. There are arguments for both sides, so there's not a clear answer.
On the one hand, a good relation between the teacher and the students can have a good impact on the learning process of the students. If the teacher is nice to the students and the stundents are nice to the teacher it is easier for both sides to work properly. 
But what if the teacher lacks of specific knowledge? In this case, the students would have a big disadvantage. If they don't get teached about the topics in detail, they can't do good in tests. Even if the teacher would make the tests as easy as possible for the students, they will at least have the disadvantage in their final exams at the end of their school career. Also they couldn't compete with students from other schools, for example when they're applying at universities. 
Another argument for the relation between stundents and teachers is self-confidence of the students. If they don't have to be "afraid" of the teacher, maybe beacause he's very strict or often gets angry, they can get better grades.
But, only the good knowledge doesn't help the students. Especially when they are younger, the need a certain relation to the teacher. 
In my opinion, there must be a good combination of specific knowledge and the relation between students and teachers. Of course the teacher needs enough knowledge to teach the students what they need to know. But the psychological effect of a good relation can have a strong impact on the successfull work and learning process. Also my own experience shows how important a good relation can be, especially in a subject which is not that easy.
