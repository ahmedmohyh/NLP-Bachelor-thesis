Teching is not easy. It includes many difficultis. For exampel at School teachers have to teach about difficult subjects like DNA. But the question is: How do the studens get it better? If the teacher has an insane amount of knowledge about the subject or if he has less knowledge but he knows how to teache it in an good way?
The atwantage that the first teacher has is that he is well in relating to the students. He probebly will have a quit good lern athmothpher. The studens will listen closly and are intrestet in the subject. Because off that the remember every word he sayed. In that lessen the stundents have lerned much and had a much fun lerning.
Now the other lesson startes. The stundes sitt down and start to listen to the teacher. He has an insane good knowlege about his subject. But after a wile of listening every stundent stops listening because the teacher wants to tell them every detail he knows. The stunden her will rember almust nothig of the subject. But why dont they remember noting? Becaus it was just boring. The students had abolutly no fun. They wher bord and maby even frustrated because the were not abel to understand and follow the train of thaughts of the teacher.
If you ask me I am convinced of the teacher that is tellinig less about the subject but ist abel to ge the students atention. Because the students will have learned much more after the first lesson!
