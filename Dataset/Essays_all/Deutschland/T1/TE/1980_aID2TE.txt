Today, many students have problems in school because of the teachers, explaining subjects in a very difficult way. A lot of teachers use difficult languge which is specific to the topic, so a lot of students get the problem that they don´t understand the topic because they can´t handle the "university explanaitions". 
So the question comes up, if it´s so much important that teachers have excellent knowledge about their subjects or if it´s actually better if they have a good connection to the students, so everyone gets well with the topics.

Firstly, it is very bad if the teachers have no knowledge about their topic or even less knowledge than the students have, because in that case nobody would learn something at school. 
Furthermore, without excellent knowledge in a subject, teachers won´t be that respected in school because they don´t are on a higher level than the pupils are. What follows is, that the pupils won´t be open enough to learn something from them, because they think the teachers don´t actually know anything better than they do.
On the other hand, it is also very bad, if the teachers have too much information but can´t bring it to their pupils minds. In that case nobody would learn anything either.
Moreover, if the teachers only use specific language which is related to the topic, lots of students won´t get along with their lessons because they don´t get what the teachers try to explain.

All in all, I think that an excellent knowledge about a topic isn´t that important as to have a good relation to the students because students will learn more in classes with a teacher who is open minded and talented in explaining difficult subjects. But there is also the needing of a knowledge which doesn´t have to be perfect but which has to be better than normal peoples´ knowledge is because otherwise pupils would ask themselves why they have to go to school, if the teachers don´t know anything better than they or for example their parents do.
