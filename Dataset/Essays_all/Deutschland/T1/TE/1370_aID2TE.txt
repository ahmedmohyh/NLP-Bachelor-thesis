Sometimes there are teachers, that have a really good relation with students, but not an excellent knowledge of the subject, which they teach. The statement says, that the teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 
One argument is, that the stundents are feeling more comfortable in school when the teacher is nice to them. Maybe because of that, they have fun and want to learn even more and that is very good for their education. Further the grades of the students would be better, due to the fact that they are more interested in the subject that they get taught from a teacher that they have a good relation to. That is good for the future, because with good grades you have better chances in the future.
But there are also arguments against the statement. The sense of school is that the students get to know as much as possible. And when the teacher isn't able to teach them all facts about his or her subject, the students are getting not as clever as they could be with a teacher with the best knowledge. The school's aim is, to teach the students for the future job and for life. If they are things in education missing, maybe they are getting problems in the university or later in their life. 
My personal opinion is, that it is more important for a teacher to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, because it shpould be the aim of teaching and school to give the students the best knowledge as they can get. Even though Iwould say, the best way is to make both possible. A perfect teacher is someone with a good ability to relate well with students and also an excellent knowledge about the subject.
