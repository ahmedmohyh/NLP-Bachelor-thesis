In the following text i will explain my opinion to the given statement. To the relationship between teacher and student I think that it is important, to get along with each other. But in general I think that it is important to be friendly to everyone this could be teachers, pupils, friend, people etc. I think relate well with students makes the lesson more comfortabel and also it's easier to follow the lesson and to focus on what the teachers says. But I don't think that the relationship between people or students and teacher should influence the grade, which the will pupil get. I do think, that when a pupil never listens wgat the teacher says and the teacher don't like him because of that and the pupil gets a worse grade, it's okay. But getting a nice grade just because you are nice to the teacher althoug you never listen, I think it's unfair. On the other hand I think that it is possilbe to follow the teacher and the lesson without having a good relationship between class and teacher. It is because the most important in school is to learn something and to find out what is the best for you and your future. So I think the most important is the excellent knowlegdge of the subject because this is why you go to school. Although it is more comfortable to get along with each other very well this isn't what you should focus on. So just be friendly should be enough to have a nice lesson and to still focus on what is important.
