In this essay I'm going to elaborate, whether it's more important for teachers to connect with their students, than having lots of knowledge of a certain subject. 
Every topic, that is taught in school can be interesting for some students and rather boring for others. That's why it's the teachers duty to make it as interesting as it can be. 
This can be difficult in most subjects and every student has their own strenghts and weaknesses. If the teacher isn't able to connect and relate well with the students and therefore doesn't know what those strenghts and weaknesses are, it will be more complicated to get the students attention. 
Some might say that knowledge is the only thing that matters and if you know a lot about a certain topic it will be interesting no matter what, but in my opinion that's very untrue, although a few students might disagree with me. When the teacher understands the students and is able to tell how to make a class interesting it doesn't matter what the topic is. 
But it's not just important when it comes to the subject that is being taught but also on a personal level. Of course there's no need to get too personal but if you like the teacher and if you feel like, when something is wrong you were able to talk to them, I think you will be more willing to pay attention in class. 
With regard to the statements above, for me personally it is more important for teachers to care about their students and relate well with them, than having lots of knowledge about a certain subject. Of course, the teacher should have knowledge about the topic too but if he isn't able to relate to the students they won't be interested in listening to him and all his knowlegde.
