Is the teacher's ability to relate well with students more important than excellent knowledge of the subject beíng taught? 
A teacher has to know much obout hin subject otherwise nobody would respect him. For example: A student got a question, therefor the teacher had to have backgroundinformation. If he don't know more about the things the students have to learn, the students wont accept the teacher.
However, only a teacher who can handle with students is a teacher. The students will respect the teacher if he is interested in his students. And the students would like the subject and learn automatically, because they are 'voluntary' in this lesson. For example: A teacher is just telling things about his subject and don't act with the students, nobody would voluntary listen to him, but if the would handle withe the students and do things while the lessons they like, they are interested. And when somebody ist interested in something he can learn everything voluntary about a subject. 
I think the statement is not completly right, because both things are much important. If a teacher use both, the students will love him. He would not just know much about his subject, he also would know how to handle with his students and how to teach them.
