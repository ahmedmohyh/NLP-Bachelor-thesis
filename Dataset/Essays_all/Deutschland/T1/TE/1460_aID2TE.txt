A teacher can only teach things he knows well but he or she has to tell it the students on the right way. If the teacher is sitting in front of the class and is talking the whole lesson about one thing, the students do not listen to him or it seems that they are listening but they do not. It is bad too, if the teacher is doing interresting lessons but he or she doesn't know the things he or she is talking about. Maybe he or she is talking about false things or only rubbish. He or she can only transfer the knowledge he or she has and not only the books, he or she is using in his lessons. In these situations the teacher can not be a good teacher because he or she can not trasfer the knowledge that the students need. If the teacher know his subjects well and can transfer the knowledge on a interresting way the students listen and working with the teacher. Important are homeworks too. They are a part of the way the teacher teaches the students. If the teacher give many homework every lesson the students aren't happy about it and the teacher and they start to make other things in the lessons.  
I agree with a part of the statement. A teacher has to know his subjects if not he or she could not transfer knowledge but he has to transfer the knowledge in a interresting way to get the attantion of the students.
