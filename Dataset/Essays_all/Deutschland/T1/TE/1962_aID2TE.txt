Going to school means not only to learn things you will maybe need for your life, it also means that you have to learn how to interact with people. But what is more important? To learn things or to learn how to interact. It's a very important question, that could have an impact on teachers education. In the following I am going to comment on the statement, that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught by this teacher.

First you have to say, that it is very important that a teacher knows what he is doing. There is no way in hell that a teacher could prepare students for exams in a subject where the teacher does not know anything. So it is important, that a teacher has a clou of what he is doing. There has to be fundamental and precisly knowledge about the subject he or she is teaching. But of course a good teacher has to interact with the students as well. School is a place where you learn to interact with people too. So does a teacher has to relate well with students? Yes and no: Yes because there has to be a feeling of fairness and understanding to create a good learning atmosphere; no because teachers do not have to bother with problems of the students. And both is important. A good atmosphere to learn and study and a good knowledge to study from as well. 

In my opinion it's the golden middle we are looking for. A good teacher has to know what he is doing and has to get along with the students well. But in fact the school is the place where you have to achieve more and more knowledge and for this process you need teachers who know precisly what they're doing. How to learn the structure of small cells with a teacher who doesn't even understand what the body is build of? It does not help that this teacher solves everybodys problems, does it?
