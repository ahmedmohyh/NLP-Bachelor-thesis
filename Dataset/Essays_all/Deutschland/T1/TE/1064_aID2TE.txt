A goog teacher is sombody who isn´t just an expert in his subjects. On the one hand he has to know everything about the topics he teach. He has to know what he is talking about and should able to explain it good enough that the students can understand and lern the stuff for writing good exams and classtest. The things he is telling his stuidents hve to be correctly of course.
On the other hand he has to train his students in characteristics too because teacher is a padagogic job. As a teacher you are working with childreen not with adults, who ever knows what to do and what to say in which situation. For example when one student is mobbed by two classmates, the teacher have to help him and teach the mobbing students why it isn´t okay or right. Also the teacher have to teach his students that blacks are like whites, normal human and they may not discriminate them because they are black.
If he can´t cooperate with diffecult students, he also isn´t a good teacher. There are teachers who just work with the ones that want to lern and want to know all about this subject. But the exercise of teachers is to help those students which aren´t interrested in lerning about the actual topic too. Also to find out what is the reason why they don´t want to lern. If a teacher want to make his job well, he has to know about the social backround of his students and has to find out if there a problems at home maybe with the parents.
A nother point is that if the teacher is also a friend for his students, they are more interrestes in lerning and they show more engagement in this subject.

In my oppinion the statement "A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." is correct. Its important to be an expert but more to cooperate well with his students.
