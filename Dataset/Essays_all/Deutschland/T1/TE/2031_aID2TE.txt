I think it's important for teachers to have a good knowledge of what they are teaching. A teachers whose  student's homework it is to look up basic information about the topic because the teacher doesn't know them, isn't really respected. There is also the danger that the teacher is unsure and that he teaches wrong things and that would confuse tehe students.
On the other hand, it's important to have a good relation to the students that to have perfect knowlege and to know everything because only then the teachers can do interesting lessons. It is easier for the students to like subjects which are teached by a respected and nice teacher as well than by one who don't care about the disagreements or how they cone along with the exercise.
In the same way the students will get better marks with nice teachers and the lessons are more fun than a boring 'know-it-all'
So, all in one, I represent the opinion that teachers should have an idea of what they're teaching but that it is more important to have a good way of teaching and to prevent that everyone understands the topic than to have extremly intelligent techer who know every useless detail of the subject.
