My opinion is that a great ability to relate well with students is also important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. To have the knowledge is important because than you can finish the school good. But the relation between students and teachers is important too, because some students do nothing in the school because they dont like the teacher and that is not good. Some students can be very good, but they haven't fun at this so they don't do something or only things that is not good in the schhol . But I think the relation between teacher and students won't be so good because some stundents think the teacher is like a friend and they don't have respect. But when the teacher is very strenght the students don't have fun at this and they are without respect and bad in school so they don't finish the school good.
The teacher they only want to have the knowledge haven't a idea how the students are really in the school they only consentrate on the knowledge but not how they feel with the whole situation in the school. When the teachers are too friendly to the kids a good atmosphere isn't there so they didn't learn to much and the school is not important for them. For example at a classtrip the teacher must be cool and forget the school things. 

And the End my opinion is that the teachers must be friendly and strenght with school stuff, but I think when the teachers only want to know the knowledge the students don't have fun in this lesson and the students will be bad in the school.
