When I am thinking about my lessons at school and the different teachers I already had there are many differents between the lessons and the way we are teached and how much we learn.

I think the best lessons are those were we get taught by a teacher who loves his subject but also is able to make his studenst to love it or at least not to hate it. Therefor it is very important that the teacher likes what he does but also is able to work well with children or youth.  
A teacher who just taught vocabularys, grammatik and formal things is in my opinion not a good one because so the lessons will get boring soon. That is one reason why students do not want to learn anymore and write bad exams.
When teachers now how to teach their students so that they learn the "boring things" like grammatik on the one hand but on the other hand also get interested in the subject and have fun doing it, the results of exams or oral exams will be much better.
The exercise for teachers is to give their studenst a routine so they will have it much easier to learn difficult things. But there has to be a good balance between front-lessons and fun lessons, just learning grammatik and watching movies or documentaries, solve mathematic problems and playing games.

At the end I have to say that I defenitely think that it is much more important that teachers are able to make well balanced lessons, have a good relation with their studenst, that they take time to analyse why some of them have problems in class or with the subject and know how to motivate them every single day again, than a teachers ability to have an exact knowledge of their subject. Of course both things are important for beeing a good teacher but for me the first is more important. The challenge teachers have is difficult but they do it for a good reason.
