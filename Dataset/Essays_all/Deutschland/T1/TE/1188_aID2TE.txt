The qusetion that a good relationship with students is more important than a good knowlege in the subject that´s taught is important to talk abuot.

To relate well with your students is very important for a teacher because when the students like you they will probaply pay more attantion to your lesson.
In the other case as a teacher you must have a good knowledge about the subject you´re teaching because this is the main reason that you are abel to teach something about your subject. so as a student I would love to have a teacher I relate well with but he or she must have a perfect knowledge about the subject that´s being taught to. But it also depends on the subject thats being taught how good the exact knowledge has to be, for example as a mathsteacher you must know a lot about your subject and as a germanteacher you must have a general knowledge about the subject and for this spacific topick you are teaching in the moment you yust have to know the most important things to teach the students. It also depend on the kind of school you´re teaching at. In some schools like Gesamtschule in germany it´s more important for a teacher to relate well with your students because you have to include them into school and at a Gymnasium the students are abel to do more things on their own so the teacher can focus on the subject.

So at my point of view a good relationship of teachers to their students is important but a good knowledge in the subject they are teaching even more.
