In my opinion it is difficult to say if the statement " A  teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught " is correct or not. I think it is important that the teacher has a very good knowledge of the subject because than the students can learn more . When a teacher do not really know what he is talking about a student will be very confused and he will be disrespectful to the teacher because he don´t know what he speaks about. The teavher have to show the students that he is interesting in his own subject. And i think when a teacher is interesting end engaged the students will respect him and they will like him. And then the ability to relate well with students is right there. So i think these both things are conneted togehter. When a teacher has knowledge about his subject and shows interesting things in class the students will like him and respect him so the ability is well. Both things are really important for a good realtion between stundents and teachers. The teacher is the (Vorbild) for the students so he have to be respectfull and interesting in his own buisness but he also have to look up for the students and he have to show them that they have to be interested too. In my opinion we can not say if the statement is right or wrong because both things are important and conneted together so both is iqually.
