The statement "A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught." is about the teacher's ability how to handle with students. But is it really so important for the teacher to relate well with students or should a teacher only play a typical "teacher's role"  to let his students be successful? In the following essay we are going to see it whether it is important for a teacher to relate well with his students or not.

On the one side is a teacher who has a good relation to the students is more popular than a teacher who has not. The students like the teacher and his subject which he is teaching. The students are more free to ask any question when they do not understand anything concerning the subject. Furthermore the students can ask for help if the have any problem e.g. with other teachers. Because of the good relation students and teachers can understand each other better.

But on the other side a teacher, who has a too frank relation to the students, cannot go through the subjects' stuff, because the students would not take it seriously, what the teacher says, so the students are out of the teachers' contol. He also cannot answer very difficult questions which are asked by the students, because the teacher has not an excellent knowledge of his subject. Furthermore the students, who wants to learn something, are disturbed by the other annoying students.

All in all a teacher has to be a good teacher  who understands his students, but he has to be a little bit strict, so the students have a limit.
