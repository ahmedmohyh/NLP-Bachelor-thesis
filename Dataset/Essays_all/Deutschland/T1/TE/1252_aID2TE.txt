A teacher's ability to relate well with students is very important to have a good feeling in the class. It's better because the students are more listening to the teacher and they are working with him. But the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is very important too, because this knowledge is needed for the classtest and they are important to have good grades. It's also not good when the teacher is too fixed on the excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, because this would be too boring for the students and when it is too boring the students would not cooperate with the teacher. They wouldn't listen what he says and would do other more interesting things like writig or drawing things on papers and talking about other things which are more interesting for them. The problem is that to much is not healthy for the lesson and the relationship of the teacher and the students, but not enough isn't good for the school marks and they are important for the life after school. I disagree with this statement, because I think that the chances and the life after school is more important than the feeling in class. The life after school is longer and it's the real life where you have better chances to survive when you have good marks in school. The best thing would be, to find a middle of both ways, because it would be the best way to teach while the class is
