The statement is about knowledge and the ability to relate. The question is which of both is more important for a teacher.

On the one hand it is very important as a teacher to have good knowledge of the subject which is being taught because without a fine knowledge the studends will not really learn about the important things. 
But on the other hand it is important too that the teacher is able to interact well with the students because otherways there isn´t the ability to learn impoirtant things too.
Anyway a teacher should be able to teach teh subject well and he has to understand what it is about on his self because when he can´t understand it the studends will not either.
But there arre important arguments for a good interaction too for example when a teacher is good in his subject and understand everything but he can nto interact with his studens because his social engagement isn´t that good learning will be very hard too.
Even when the sstudents arn´t easy too it is important for a teacher to be calm and try to get over this situation in an easy and friendly way. for example a teacher who teaches english knows the language very well and is able to interact with english speaking people bu to his students he can´t explain how and why to use grammar in different ways and when you have to use it. 
Maybe for himself he gets along with it but the students have no chance to learn it well and speak the language without making huge mistakes.

To sum it up a teacher should know well what he is talking about and what the subject he is teaching is about but he also have to interacct in a good way with his students too because otherways they can´t learn. In my opinion you should really think about your social engagement before becoming a teacher because only knowledge can´t help you in some situations. 
So I support the statement but not completly because a huge knowledge isn´t enough and just interaction isn´t too.
