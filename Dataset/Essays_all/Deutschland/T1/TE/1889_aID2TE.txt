On the statement are different arguments to show and after that you can make up your mind. 
I got arguments for  both sites. But you have to make a difference between to typse of subjects: one groupe are the languages and the other group implicates all the other subjects.
I will start with the subjects: If you got a teatcher who can relay to nearly everything in the languague he teaches, than can you learn a lot from him even when he is not that good in teaching the grama.
But if you got an teacher in one of the other subjects who relay in your mother languague very good, it is not that good for you to learn anything about that subject. When you get a new teacher, because the school decided that they will change it like every two or three years, than you got a much bigger problem because the new teacher think you can all the staff and have it in your mind, at least when you want to do your a-level, which is countrie wide you got the problem and do not get out of it. For examble in mathematics is the teacher wrighting anything on the board, but he can not explain it, than you got the problem becaus you have to hope that one of the other students understand it and can explain it in his own words. If not the teacher would repeat the same sentence all the time and you do not get it in your mind.

In my opinion is the statement in terms of the languagues right, because you can leran a lot of the ability to relate from the teacher, but when you see the statement in terms of the other subjects I would dissagree the statement, because a teacher who can not explain his knowlague is not competent.
