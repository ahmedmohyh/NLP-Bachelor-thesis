In my opininon both is important because if you only talk with your students as if they are your mates but the whole year they have not learnd anything, it is not the right way to teach. But also the otherway round is not the best idea because if you and your students does not like each other the lessons are no fun for either of you. Because if you maybe are so unfriendly to your students that they are afraid to raise thier hands to say something in the lesson. And this is whorse for the whole class because no one is able to tell any questins if they understood something wrong. For the teacher it means bad resultes in the test which is bad for him. It is always more fun to get something tought by a person which is friendly to you, understands and respects you. So having a good ability to relate with studnets is just a bit more important than to have an excellent knowledge. But if you have the both it is the perfect mix,
Also if your a young not complet eduacted teacher a good relatioin can help and motivates you to get a better and better teacher. For example if your going to have your last exam to become a fully eduacted teacher and a lot of other people are watching your lesson. A good relation between you and your students can help you a lot, because they know your situation and try thier best to help you with for example a good oral performance in your lesson.

For me a good ability to have a good relation with students is more important than to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
Because as said above your are sometimes afraid to raise your hand and to maybe say something wrong, which is normally ok and also important for learning  but you get bullied by your teacher is not good for you and your grades.
In my opinion it is also so much more fun to learn and go to school if is have a lesson with a teacher that is friendly and has a good relation to us as students.
You even lermn more and easier than the otherway around.
