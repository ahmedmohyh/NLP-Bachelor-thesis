The statement,that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important that excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is a statement,isn't  true in my oppinion.I didn't agree with this statement because the knowledge of the subject is absolutelly more important for the teacher and everyone of them had to learn everything about the language at the university.
To relate well with the students is also a really important thing,because every student knows how it is,when you didn't relate with a teacher.There are theese teachers,they're giving bad grades just because they not relate with the student.
I think it's not good to handle with bad grades just because they don't relate.In the university they've learnd it at another way,teachers learn to be social to everyone and thats also a thing they should bring to the stundents very well.
The excellent knowledge about the subject is really important and the students should learn as much as the teacher could bring to the students.
Not every student,but some students are not interestet if they relate with the teacher or not,this students are just wanting a good grade and not a ralationship with the teacher.
I peronally think both things are important for the students and also for the teachers,but the subjectknowledge is a bit more important and the teachers should bring mostly all the stuff from the universtity in the class,but in a way that the students undestand everything.
