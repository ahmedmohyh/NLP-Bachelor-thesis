"A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught"

In our modern world is comunication very important. Even in school, if you dont like the teacher, you will never have any motivation to do your homework or other stuff for the subject.If you like the teacher, you will have better grades, because you do more for school and not because the teacher treat you better. 
Nethertheless its important for you, even if you hate your teacher, to have good grades. Not many students know , what they are doing after school, if they work or study.And in the most cases are the grades important for reaching the goals. Nobody asks after school, if you don't liked your teacher in school, or why you have so bad marks. Maybe you have a good mark in the subject, but you have no idea from the content, cause the teacher didn't have the knowledge of the subject. And you think you are good in the theme ,because you had a good mark in school. So you are going to study, on the college you realise that you don't have any ideas. 
I think it's important that the teacher relate well with the students, but if they haven't andy knowledge of the subject is not so good.
It's more important to teach the subject right, than have fun with students. They will have it easier in life, if the teacher teach them right.
