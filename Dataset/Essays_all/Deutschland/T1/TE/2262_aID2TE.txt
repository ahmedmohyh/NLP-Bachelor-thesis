In the following text, I will write  about the statment " A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaugt", if i will agree with these or not.

First I can say if the Teachers only wants that the ability will be good to the student and they do not think so much of the knowledge of the students, they do not get so good marks, because of the knowledge and they maybe have problems with the congrulations. And this might be a problem for the future of the students, then if you have a bad or no congrulation you will get difficult a job or something else. Also some people are not interesting in, what the other peolpe feel or do, so they think only about hisself or herself. 
On the other hand, if the teacher will relate bad with the students, they are shy and do not want to say something in class, so they also get bad marks and the stundens finds after congrulation also difficult a job. Antoher point for the statement is, that the students learn one important thing for the future, how to deal with athoer persons. This will be really important, because some peolpe do not learn it at there home from the parents. This will be good for the stundents character and also for the future to get a job and so on.

To put it into nuitshell, I can say that the teachers ability is not more important than the knowledge of the students, but the knowledge is also not more important than the teacher´s ability. So there must be a balance between the knowledge and the ability, then both are really important for the student in the future and in class, because if only one aspect will be important the stundents might be have problems in the future.
