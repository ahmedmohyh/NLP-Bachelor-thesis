In the following essay I will discuss the statement that a teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 

In my opinion it is important that the students respect their teacher and that they have the possibility to talk to their teacher whenever they have a problem in school or a private problem in their families because many children do not have a family member or a friend to talk to. The teacher can be a person they go to when they need somebody who they can trust. 

But you should not forget that a teacher does not replace a friend or a parent, his job is it to teach. I think that an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is more important than a good relationship between the teacher and his students. A school is a place where you should learn something. The things that you learn in school are relevant for your future and this is why it is so important that the information you learn are alwalys correct. If a teacher does not have an excellent knowledge of a subject, it is possible that he teaches the students something wrong. It is also possible that the teacher is not able to answer the questions of the students and this would be a problem because a teacher should have the knowledge for answering all the questions of students.

 But you have to mention that a good relationship between a teacher and his students can improve the effort to learn something because you are more willing to listen to a person that you like. 

All in all I can say that I disagree with the statement. A teacher´s ability to relate well with students is important but an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught has priority because a school is a place where students should receive correct answers and where all their questions can be answered.
