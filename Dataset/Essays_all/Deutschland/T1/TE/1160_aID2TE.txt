I think that it`s very important, that teachers relate well with students because it is very important for the students that the teacher get´s to no his or her problems in understanding a task or a specific exercise. But never the less it is also very important that the teachers have exellent knowledge of the subject too and the things that they are saying because otherwise also the students realise that the teacher either has no clu what he or her is talking about, or gets frustraded because he or her ain`t understanding anything, due to difficult explanations and specific unknown expressions.
Therefor you can not really say either or in this case because it is as useless for the students if tghe teacher has the ability to relate well with students if he has not a good knowledge of what he is supposed to teach, and the other way around it is the same. In life we often have deal with extrem situations and often realise that it is not one side we need to look at but both sides, for example it is noit the right solution in the case of drinking water to just drink less than one glas a day and on the other hand it is at bad for your body if u drink more than ten liters a day. 
Coming back to our topic it is also important to mention that if students maybe even have fun in class and enjoy the lessons they are also more likely to learn something and are more interessted in what the teacher tells them. So it is very important that teachers do not just make simple question and ansver lessons but more games of trips to show the students where those informastion they get to know in school effect their life. 
By consequence it is more important that the teacher can relate well with the students although he also should not be completly unknown, what I actually do not expect from a person which wants to be a teacher one day. In the end I would say that in my opinion it would be the best solution if the teacher can handle both skills pretty good than handling one skills extremly good but the other one not.
