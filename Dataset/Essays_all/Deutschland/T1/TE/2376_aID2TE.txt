A teacher must have  both of this aspects because when a teacher just have one of them he cant be a good teacher. To relate well with students is important because you must be as a teacher just like a friend to a student but a teacher must be to all studenst the same because if he like one student more than another
then it will be unfair because the teacher give than probably this student a better mark then other studenst who maybe are better than this student who the teacher like more than them. But this is not a the only problem if the teacher is just well with the students and doesnt have knowledge about the subject than it will be very hard for him to teach the students because he have not the knowlege that he need to teach the students the subject that they have with the teacher. And a Person cant be a teacher if he or she doesnt the knowledge that he or she need. If a teacher just have an excellent knowledge and cant relate well with the students than the students will hate him because he probably will be very hard at the lessons and give bad marks if the student are not so smart than the others and the students will become bad marks to if they doesnt do or know the things that the teacher want to.I think that a teacher must have both of the aspects because a teacher must be realte nice with his students and have an excellent knowlegde to help his students with their problems. But when a teacher have just one of the expects he wont be a good teacher because he cant give the students the informations that they need or want to know or if he is not just like a good friend and is hard to the students all students will hate him.
