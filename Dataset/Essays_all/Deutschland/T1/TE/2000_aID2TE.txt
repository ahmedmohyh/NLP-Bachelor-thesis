Thinking about the question whether a good relationship between teacher and student or an exellent knowledge about the subjekt is better to learn, I am coming to the conclusion that your better in a subject when you have a good relationship to your teacher. If the lesson is to easy and relaxed some pupil coud think, that the specific subject is very easy and you do not have to learn something for it. But than they will be surprised in the exams when they get bad grades. That is the reason why the teacher should teach the subject so that the pupil will get an exellent knowledge. Because if you have the perfect knowledge in a subject you will gett exellent grades and you will habe better chances afer school to become a job.
But a good relationship between pupil and teacher makes it easyer to learn for the pupil. There is a better atmosphere in class because there will not be any pupils who give the teacher contra. Everybody would love to go to this subject and would like to learn for it. So that they would write good exams. In addition to that the teacher has more chances to help the pupil woh have problems. The good relationship will make the pupil talking about there problems and the teacher could help. Another point is that as a pupil you are more interested in a subjekt when it makes fun to learn it. So mabey they will be interested to do extra work. All in all the good relationship between pupil and teacher is better than the exellent knowledge in a subject because the pupil will be more interested in a subject that makes fun.
