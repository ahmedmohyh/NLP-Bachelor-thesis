On one side it is important that the teacher an the students have a good connection to eachother. In school the students should not have panic or be afraid from his teacher. A better atmosphere is given for studnets an teacher. Also the students an the teacher have more fun, if they like eachother and the teacher sometimes tells them other things than the boring school stuff. They can learn from this too, than if they relate well in class, it is more easy to find friends in their future ans they learn how thea have to be in the public.
But on the other side it is important for the future to know the things the teacher have to teach you about the subject. You write tests and exams about the stuff from the school lessons, including the A- levels, so it is important that the teacher give you the knowlede you need. Maybe you later need this knowledge in University or it is important for your life. An other point is that, the theme of the lessons in one subject sometimes are important for other subjects too, than in the end all subjects are related to the others. 
All 9in all, I disagree with the statement, because I think an excellent knowledge of the subject is more important than relate well to the students. The knowledge is relevant for your own future, for your own life. Later in life nobody are interested in connecting well to your past teacher. All what is important later is, do you have learn the stuff or not. Of course it is also important to create a friendly atmosphere, but not more important than have a good knowledge.
