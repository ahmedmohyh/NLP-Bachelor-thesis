The statement, which is given, is about the lessons with the students. I agree, that a good relationship to the stundents is very important because the student are in this case more concentrate to follow the lessons. But with a teacher they don't like, they won't like his or her lessons although he or she do a great job. Now I must disagree, that it is so important that the teacher has a excellent knowledge of the subject, but this is important to because the students must lern something and can't have just fun in class. When I must chose which is more important, a good relationship to the students or a perfect knowledge of the subject, I will chose the relationship to the students. I see it in our class, when we didn't like a teacher, although he or she is very good, we have more bad marks, then with a teacher, who is not excellet in his job, but is relate well with us as class. 
In the end I agree with the statement, that the teacher must have a good relationship with his or her students than have a perfect knowledge about the subject which he or she is teaching.
I think to make jokes and have fun with the class, it would help to get this good relationship with students. Then the know that he or she isn't the kind of teacher who is just do his work and than leave. He or she must become a friend of the class.
