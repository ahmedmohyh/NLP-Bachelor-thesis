In my opninion it's important to find the middle of this. A student feels more save and understanding when the teacher are well with you. You could ask question all the time and you are sure the the teacher wants to help you. As a techer it's important to have this abillity. But a good teacher has got both. He has to exellent knowledge of the subject. For the students it's easier to understand and to followe them when a teacher take time for them and help them.
I think both are important but, when you've got a techer who has got the abillity he are well with students but not an exellent knowledge of the subject , this teacher in the middle is nice and import for youre future, but when you get this teacher before you're final exam. It's better when you've got a teacher who has got a nice knowledge of his subject. The best way to be a nice teacher is when you find a middle of both abilities. 
 And it's different when a student are intristing and good in the subject or he it's not one of the best. When you be good in the subject, it's better when you have got a teacher who has got an exellent knwoledge of his subject. But when you aren't so good in the subject. It's better when you have got a teacher who is well with you and takes time for you.
