Too strict teachers are always a thing students complain about. But is it more important for the teacher to understand the students or is it rather that they have to be taught raw knowledge? In the following text I will comment on this thesis and unravel its pros and cons.

The first thing one stumbles across, when searching for an answer, is that if the teacher can relate with students the taught topic will be easier to understand. If the teacher uses situations from everyday life to explain complex topics, e.g. using billiard to explain quantum physics, it will a lot easier to understand, than when the teacher uses terms he would use when talking to a professor.
Also, if the teacher uses adequate jokes the students like or just understands the students problem, for example making clear that a topic is hard to understand, so the students don't feel like they can't do anything. Doing that will achieve that the students will rather like the teacher, which leads to better performance of thee in class.

On the other hand, if the teachers rules are too loose, it may happen that the students don't take class seriously enough, so they won't learn anything. If the teacher constantly chats with his students about unrelated topics initially there is no knowledge being taught.

Concluding you can say that you have to make a compromise between these two extremes: You can not teach raw knowledge but also cannot just chat with your stundents. Inbetween, thats the solution for effective teaching.
