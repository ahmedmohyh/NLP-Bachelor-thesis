It is a fact that a student says more if he is in a good relation to the teacher.
The work of a teacher is not easy today, a teacher has to talk in front of a hole class everyday.
If the students do not like the teacher, they show it with noises.
The loudly noises of students are extremely bad for someone, who wants to present his knowledge to others.
But it is not just bad for the teacher, it is very bad for the students too, especially for that who wants to learn something in school.
So if the students are not in a good relation with the teacher, they will see it in their grades, which will be a big part of the future for everyone.
It is a big disadventage for both parties if they work against instead together.
Another point is if there is a very clew teacher with a lot of knowledge and experience, but the students do not want to hear a hole lesson about the boring knowledge, they are learning nothing.
So it is way better to have a teacher who has the skill to communicate well with students and maybe not so much knowldege like another.
To sum it all up, I have to agree with the given statement: A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
If a teacher relate well with students, they will relate well with him.
