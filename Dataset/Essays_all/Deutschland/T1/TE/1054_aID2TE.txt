The question is it more important to have a good knowledge of the subject or have a relation to his students is not easy to answere so i am going to make a list of pro and contra arguments. And later i want to tell you my own oppinion.

For first you can say that the relation of a techer to is class is very important because if students for example are afraid of a teacher they wouldnt lern as well as they do with a teacher they do not have problems with. Also a teacher need to spend time with his class to conclude intern or other problems. That would not be easy if the teacher does not relate good to his studants. But just have a good relation to his students does not mean that you are a good teacher. If you have an excellent knowledge of your subject you have more obtions to describe something tha some single students could not understand in the first way. As well you can go on in lesson very fast and youre students have the chance to finish school with better knowledgees as other students.

For me a good teacher should have a good knowledge of his subject and a good relation to his students too. But if i need to choose one of these possibilities i would decide to the excellent knowledge. I chose that because a teacher should be there to prefer studenst for "working-life" and not to be thair daddy or mommy. Problems you can have youre hole life but in school youre just once and that is the preperation fo have a normal life.
