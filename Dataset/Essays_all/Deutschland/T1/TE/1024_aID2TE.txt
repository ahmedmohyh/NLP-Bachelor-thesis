At todays schools the relationship between the teacher and the students has changed. In the past there was the subject the one thing that connected the two parties with each other and there were basically no communication on a private basis like the knowledge was in important and not how you might reach out to the students. So how does someone create a lesson so that everyone is interested in what is taught and is able and willing to follow? 

First of all there has to be an interest not just in the subject but also in the students interests. For example if you know that the class you are teaching maths in, is a class who loves to do sports you can create the excercieses in a way that it connects with their interests and they won´t see maths like a torture. Sometimes it´s not the teacher they hate it´s simply the subject which makes it more difficult for the teaching person to create an interest in that subject.  So if the teacher is  able to create a relationship between them and the students it´s easier for everyone to have a good time at school and make it as much enjoyable as possible.
But this isn´t t only the a teacher schould concentrate on. They job is it still to teach the students, bring knowledge to them and prepare them for the future. If the teacher knows what they want to teach it´s easier to concentrate on the students so it shouldn´t be a problem to anyone. Of course it´s not just the teachers jobs to make it interesting for everyone, there has to be coorparation between students and teachers and both have to accept and respect the other one. 

All in all my opinion on this quote is that there should be a balance between a teacher´s ability to reach out to the students and the specific knowledge that is being taught it will make the work of everyone much easier and the opportunity to abolish the fears of a specific subject like maths. There is no chance to loose
