I think if a teacher can relate as well with the students then the teacher can the subject being taught better as the teacher can't rekate with his students.
Also I would say if a teacher is totally ignored or don't care about the students then they have no fun to learn this subject. 
They lose their motivation on this. I think it is both important.
 A teacher have to excellent knowledge of the subject being taught, but he have to has also a good relationship with his students.
Also I have to say that not everyone can taught. It gives so much people who will be a teacher but they can not do it because they have not the right confident and maybe they are not social that they can communicate with students as well.
 I think you have to find the right balance on these two facts and I think it is difficult to find the right balance on this. But I think if the communicate is not good then the students are mostly in this subject not good too. 
On the other side if a teacher is to much communicated with his students then they are not finally direct by the subject. It would be to much communicate about the weather or the last weekend. This is not so good for right learning for the subject.
Finally you can say that it is not only important to relate well with students but it is not only important to excellent knowledge of the subject being taught too. It is the balance between the both facts. 
This is important: to have a good relationship with the students and you have to teach so good that the students understand and learn mostly all of this subject. I think then you have win on this job and then the job might be funny.
