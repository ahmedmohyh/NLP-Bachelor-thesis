School is getting harder every year. The gouverment is reducing the years you have to be in the school to get your A-Levels. But this is very uneffective. The students have to work more to learn the stuff, because they were stolen by one year. If you have to sit in school with a teacher, that you really do not like, it can be very hard to follow the lessons. If you cant follow the lessons, it is really hard to understand the stuff, that is important for your homework or for your classtests. When your teacher does not like you, it can be very hard to get a good grade in his or her subject. Even if the teacher is a doctor of science and knows very well about his subject, it can be very hard to follow his lessons if he can't handle with persons. He could also have to high expectations of the students. It can also be unefficient to work with a teacher, that is very polite, but knows nothing about their subject. Even if the lessons are funny or you can follow the lessons really good, a teacher can only teach his students something that he is understanding by himself. 

In my hole schoollife I met many teachers. Some of them were really incompetent and I learned nothing from them. Then I met really strict teachers, that knew very much about their subject, but it was really hard to listen to what they were saying.  I think, that the best way to teach a subject is the mix of the teachers ability and knowledge.
