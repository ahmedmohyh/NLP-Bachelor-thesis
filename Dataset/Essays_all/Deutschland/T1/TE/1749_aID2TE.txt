In the following text I´ll write about my point of view of the statement on the top.

In my opinion it´s very important, that a teacher behaves powerful and somtimes also funny and treats the students well, because the more the students can identify with their theacher, the more fun they have in class and the more they can learn in a subject. For example a student who isn´t really active and doesn´t say much in class might have a better self confidence and also better results in school, if his or her teacher has the ability to relate well with students. 

Otherwise it´s also really important, that a teacher knows a lot about the subject he teaches in. If a teacher doesn´t have a good knowledge about his subjects, he´s not a good teacher in my opinion, because it´s his quest to teach the students in a good way and in the end the students have to have a better knowledge than before a lesson. A teacher who doesn´t know much about his subject is a bad teacher for me, because I want to learn something in school and it doesn´t make scence to have a teacher who knows less facts of the subject beingt

That is why I disagree with the statement, that ``a teachers ability to relate well is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being thaught´´. Both aspects are important for a teacher to teach students in a right way. So a teacher has to have a good relationchip to his students and also an excellent knowledge about the subject he teaches in to be a good teacher in my opinion.
