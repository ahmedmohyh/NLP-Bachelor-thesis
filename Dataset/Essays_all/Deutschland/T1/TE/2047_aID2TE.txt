First of all it is important to be able to combine both skills. In my opinion the best case of a teacher can handle students very way and relate with them in a familiar way, but he has to have the excellent knowledge as well. Otherwise he can maybe improve the behavior of the students, but whats even more important he cannot make them smarter and i think that is the reason why we are all sitting here in school. So for me  there are no two opinoins in this case.
 A good argument for agreeing with that statement is that a teacher who does not like the students at all cannot let them learn with fun. And when the students have no fun in the whole learning stuff they will not learn as hard as if they had fun. That is a case where it is more important to have the ability to relate. When a teacher has that he can improve the learn behavior of a student to make him even smarter and that leads also to a self learning session by the student for his own.
 A point against that is accutally that it is not important who goog you are in thinks like understanding the student when do not have the knowledge, because what do you want to teach him? Exactly there is nothing to teach! That is why you are better able to do both thinks and work in both ways as a teacher
 So know we have talked about having the one ability, but not the other. Lets come back to the task. What is more important? And i think that is not an easy question at all which has only one answer
. But there are some mean teachers out there who maybe has the perfect konwledge but they are mean teachers, so they are not able to transfer their knowledge with the students. You will not learn anything when the teacher cannot relate with you in any ways. Weighing pros and cons, i come to the conclusion that it is even more important to handle the studenst well then to have the exact knowledge. But there is a small border betwenn those thinks. So for me it is always better to combine both parts in one teacher/person.
