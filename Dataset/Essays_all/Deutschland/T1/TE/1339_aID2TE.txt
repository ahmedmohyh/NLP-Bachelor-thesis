I disagree with the statement that a teacher´s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 
One reason is that the teacher has to know what he want to teach for the children. The students go to school to learn and not to have fun with the teacher or anything else. Basicly the school lessons should not be boring, but the students should have fun to learn something in every subject. If a teacher doesn´t work well, for example he always does plays with the students, the students don´t learn much for their life in future.
Otherwise the students and the teacher should have a good relation.
