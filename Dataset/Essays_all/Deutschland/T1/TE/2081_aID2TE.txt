A year ago a nice teacher had to leave our school. Everyone liked him, because he had an open ear for everyone and doesn't looked at your grades. In cause of that I think the statement is right, because you're better at school when you like your teachers and can ask them for help. 
It's not that difficult to say something in class and you're not that shy. You know the teacher isn't mad at you, if your answer isn't right. 
When I don't like a teacher, I don't want to be in class. I just want to go home and in cause of that I do nothing in these lessons and get bad grades.
Another argument for this statement is, that when the teacher likes and knows you, he can help in some situations and you can be concentrated on your work.
For example you get a bad grade in math and the teacher knows you're better, he can help you and you don't have this stress and can concentrate on other subjects and lessons. 
You can also be good in school and activ in lessons, but you don't know everything perfectly about this subject. You're in school for learning these things and don't have to know them all.
Finally I would say that you have to do your best, it's not important if you like your teachers or not. But it's easier if you like them and they like you.
