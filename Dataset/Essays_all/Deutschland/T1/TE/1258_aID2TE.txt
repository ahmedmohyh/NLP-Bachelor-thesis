On this point I have to answer the question if I agree or disagree to the statement that it's more important to have a teacher that have the ability to relate well with students than have the knowledge of the subject being taught. This question have many points I would agree and disagree.

One positive point to have a teacher who is able to be like a friend to his students is that it would be easier to ask him questions when you don't have to be afraid of asking some stupid ones because you feel safe in his class. You also could have more fun in class. But this point also have the negative effect, that if he hadn't a clue of his subject he couldn't answer the questions of the students and this wouldn't be so funny anymore because they wouldn't be able to learn something. One other positive effect is that you could be able to make some extra good marks because maybe he thinks if he give the stundents bad marks he wouldn't be longer accepted and loose the ability to be friends with the students. On the other side this positive effect could also be negative because it's impossible to have a class full of good marks and he would loose his ability to be a teacher if someone would find out. It's also a bad situation if the teacher would be friends with his class but doesn't be able to teach them right because at the end of the last schoolyear they don't know anything and could fail at their last exam to get graduated. This negative aspect would also fit at examples like a class test. Students who are best friends with his teacher with his knowledge of nothing aren't able to learn new things.

So in my opinion I would disagree of the statement and would prefer to have a teacher I can learn stuff for my exams but also have a well-good relate to. So I think it would be better to have a teacher with excellent knowledge of his subject but also is friendly and accepted by his students.
