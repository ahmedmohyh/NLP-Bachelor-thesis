Every student wants a teacher thats friendly, easy-going and you can get along with well. Many students prefer the fun than the niveau of learning. But is ist rerally more important to get along with a teacher than to learn something?
 It`s said we are learning for our lifes. So the  teacher should just give us the possibilities and the support. Students are not supposed to get along very well with their teachers. On the other side, we are able to listen more carefully when there is an interesting person standing in front of the class. The may not need the perfect knowledge when they can make a subject interesting in their own way. For example, a geographie teacher that has studied half of his life but never seen the world- what can he tell the students. He might have more theory knowledge in comparison to the world-travelling teacher. But the second one can make the students listen by telling them his experiences or showing photos. Of course, you can say that a "good " teacher should be able to teach his stuff in a way which is catching and changing. So the students can ask questions and having the feeling they really learned something. A teachers ambition in my eyes should always be that the students after leaving classes are at least a bit more wise. I think you can`t put the relationship over the learned stuff. I also think a teacher can be a trustful person if you need one. Some more than others, of course. There are teachers they don`t care in their students behaviour, they think their job ist teaching and judging and so they do. So after all, the relationship is not to be pushed higher than it is.
