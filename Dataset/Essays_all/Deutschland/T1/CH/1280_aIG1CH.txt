The text about the Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798 is a rather critical text about his life, instead the listening points out that he described things the right way. Chevalier was a rather controversial figure. Tho he wrote a memoir, people, like the ones who wrote the text, think he is lying and that he  described things not like the reality. The text says that Chevalier wasn't rich, wether the listening says that he was wealthy, having things that are expensive but that he just needed to sell things to have cash. To that Chevalier de Seingalt was, as the text points out, not honest with the accuracy of the conversations with the author Voltair. As the text says: "However, critics complain that the memoir cannot possibly capture these conversations accurately, because it was written many years after the conversations occured.". The listening however says that Chevalier wrote everything they said down right after Voltair and Chevalier ended their conversations. So it could be that everything is correct. The listening states that after Chevalier flew from prison the ceiling needed to be repaired and that he didn't had as high politically friends as his inmates, which could not be the case if the text was right saying that Chevalier just had politically well-connected friends in Venice who got him out of prison. So basically the listening is right because it states more facts that are actually good and could be true.
