Many critics say, that Chavalier de Seingalt often lied about things in his memoires, because he wanted to make his life seem more interesting. He met many famous people through his lieftime and now his memoires are an important source for european society in the eighteenth century. When he spent time in Switzerland, he wrote down that he spent much money on partys, but people question why he had to borrow money for that. But some people say, that he had to borrow some money first, because he had to pay earlier and wait for his money first. He also wrote down a talk with Voltaire and people ask themselves how he can be sure about so many passages what they talked about. That's all what he could remember from the chat and he also made some notes, so it's not as impossible as it seems like to wrote everything down, other people say. And when people talk about his escape from the prison and it just could be possible that he got out of it, because of his good connections, other people say that's a lie. Many prisoners had even better connections than him and they couldn't broke out. Exactly after he got out of the prison, his cell got rebuild, why that should be done, when there was no problem with, for example, the ceiling and the roof?
