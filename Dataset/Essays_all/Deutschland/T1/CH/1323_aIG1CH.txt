Chevalier de Seigalt who lived in 1725 to 1798 were became a valuable historical source about the European society in the 18th century. In the time where he lived in Switzerland he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. But that doesn't mean that he was poor. In Schwitzerland much money is wasted on parties and gambling. If a person want to have money they had to wait few days to get it, so he borrowed it. Another important thing is that he and the famous writer Voltaire were having conversations. No one knows if this really happend, but it's sure that Chevalier esaped from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy with a piece of metal to climbing through the roof. Maybe powerful friends helped him at his escape, but it isn't sure because other esaped prisioner had more powerful friends and they escaped by thereselves.
