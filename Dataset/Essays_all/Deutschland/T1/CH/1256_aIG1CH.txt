The text " Chevalier" it is told about a man and he write a long memoir recouting about his life and his adventure. He meet many famous people like a king or famous writer. His memoir is a valuable historical text about the European society. Many critics sais that he distorted or invented many events in the memoir. Chevalier live in Switzerland and he is avery wealthy. He spend a great deal of money on parties or gambling. Many critics said thar he is rich man and then he should not to spend money.  Critics are skeptical about the conversations, because it is write many years after the conversation between  him and the famous writer Voltair. In his story the Chevalier said that he make a hole in the ceiling and climb through the roof. 
The other story it is told about the prison and it is really hard  get free there. And the Chevalier says that he was make hole in the ceiling and to get free. I think it is not so right to get free, because there are manys overseers and they are controle this. Many persons try it to get free, but it is not easy and it is wrong to do this
