The memoir of the Chevalier is considered to be inaccurate about some points. In the following text I'm going to show you three examples which can be considered incorrect but have been given possible reasons to still be accurate.
While living in Switzerland, the Chevalier was wealthy, but evidence about him borrowing money from merchants has been surfaced. This could be explained by, while spending all of his money on parties and gambling, him borrowing some in order to keep going, because he had to wait until he'd get his next load of money. This wouldn't be considered poor, but rather as consuming too much money in a short period of time.
He once also talked to the famous writer Voltaire. Critics say, he wouldn't have been able to recite accurately what they said. But it has been proven the Chevalier wrote down notes about his life. He could have used these notes to write down what he remembered from his conversation with Voltair.
The last passage people are unsure about is his escape from a prison in Venice. While critics say he had a lot of politically well-connected friends, the Chevalier wrote he escaped through the roof. There were some people in jail which had even mightier friends but didn't escape. But records have shown the roof of the room the Chevalier was in while in jail, had to be repaired shortly after he escaped. Also bribery is unlikely to have happened.
