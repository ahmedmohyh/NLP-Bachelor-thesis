The discourse hold to the subject of the Chevalier de Seingalt started with a defending statement, that no memoir can be completely correct.
The first examination concerning the accuracy was about his wealth and the act of borrowing money. It was said that changing the belongings into money could take too much time and since he was gambling regularly, he needed to borrow money to use it in this exact moment. Him borrowing money is no proof of not being wealthy, as it is said in the text.
The next point dealt with his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. In the discourse we could learn that the Chevalier made notes of these conversations the night after, which he kept for a long time. So it is more likely to be accurate since he did not wrote it down years after in his memoir, which contradicts with the text explaining remembering something that happened long ago can not be exact.
The last argument for the accuracy was about his prison escape in Venice, Italy. The explanation from the text that bribery was more likely the cause of his escape was corrected by the discourse saying that other prisoners with more powerful friends did not escape so how could the Chevalier? The escape through the cell's ceiling is not as unlikely to have happened, since the ceiling already needed to be repaired. His memoirs did not just contain this account because it was enjoyable to read, but because it seems to be the truth.
