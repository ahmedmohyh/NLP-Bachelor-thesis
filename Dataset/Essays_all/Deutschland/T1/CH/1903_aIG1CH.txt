My Essay will be about the critical aspects of the memoirs of Chevalier de Saigalt. 
In the text on the top its said that Cheavaliers spented a lot of money for making parties and gambling, he could do this becaus he earned the money from a Swiss mercant. The critical opinion is that he never needed the money, there he has been already rich as he earned some more. The audible text told us, it didn't happend exactly like this. Of course he wasn't poor, as he earndes the money, but he never was that rich before.
The second argument in the text told us they where worried about the accuracy of the conversations between Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire, he has written about, becaus nobody has ever seen them speaking to each other. The critic is espacially about thinking it's not possible to remember phrases Voltaire said correctly. In the text we listend the woman said Chevalier has written nots for himself after every party.
The thrid text argument is about his escape from the prison in Venice, by using a piece of metal. The audible text told us the prison have to be repared after his escape from there. The critic is about this escaping like this is better to read and its not like ,,my powerful friends helped me to leave from there standing like a man''. The women in the audible text told us Chevalier never had powerful friends, who could help him escaping.
