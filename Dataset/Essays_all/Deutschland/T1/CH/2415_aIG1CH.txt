I did read a story of the Chevalier and and he wrote his whole life and adventures down .This man earned a historical European society in the eighteenth century. He lived a wrong life because his life wasn´t that interesting as it seemed even if he threw some glamorous parties. The Chevalier borrowed much money. But if he was really rich why should he borrow money ? And that points makes the Critics wondering about him.
The Chevalier was in a jail and he could escape it with a peice of metal. And the jailers bribed him because he had a number of politically friends in Venice and they offered a bribe
