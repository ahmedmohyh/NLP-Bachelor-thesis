The presentation is about the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt. The person who holds the presentation says, that it actually isn't possible to have a totally correct memoir. But there's no doubt that this memoir is related to the actual happenings. 
The arguments are divided into three, the first one says, that the Chevalier can't be poor because he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling while he is in Switzerland. Furthermore he waits for more money and during the wait he borrows money from others. That means that he cannot be called poor. 
Second argument is that he keeps the conversation he has in mind and is able to get access of these conversations in the exact way it was held, what cannot be possible, because over the years the memories fade. 
The third and last point is that he escaped from prison in Venice, Italy by using a piece of metal, what first of all sounds kind of unconvincing. Whatever, fact is that after his escape the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired, so his memoir in this point had to be someway true. 
In conclusion the presentation does not only critic the memoir of the Chevalier but also reflects about if the stories he tells can be true. He sure does imagine and adds certain details but in some way they are still related to the truth as far as you can say.
