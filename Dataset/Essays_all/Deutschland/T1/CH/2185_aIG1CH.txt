The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote his memoir near the end of the 18th century and they are now used as a historical source.
Regarding the accuracy of his memoir, a controversial discussion rised. The three main aspects, which are getting questioned are the wealth of the Chevalier while he was in Swiss, as well as the memory about a conversation with Voltaire and the breathtaking escape from a prision in Venice.
Qustioning the self claimed wealth in Swiss critics argue, that there is historical evedence of him borrowing money from a merchant. Aggainst that other historicans say, that the mentioned money was most likely in the form of property and converting property into money could take a few days. He could have neded money during this time.
The Chevalier also wrote down his momories of an conversation with Voltaire, which clearly met at some point, but at the point where he wrote his momoir this layed years behind, eventrogh he could have made notes and referred to them.
The legendary prision escape is most likely the most questioned story of the Chevalier. He claimed to escaped by scratching an hole in the roof and escaping over the roof. While critics are thinking, that porwerfull friends of him offering a bribe, other are beliving him because of the fact, that other persons, which much more influence didn't managed to escape.
