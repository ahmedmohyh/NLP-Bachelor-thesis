There were three main aspects.
First, in the text the author says that the Chevalier wasn't rich while he was living in Switzerland. But the person in the listening comprehension said that he was wealthy. The Chevalier had to borrow money because he has to wait until he gets his money for his assets. He needed this money for example to spend it on parties and gambling.  
The second point was that you can't know specific phrases of a conversation which took place a few years ago. But you know and it's proofed that he kept notes after this conversation with Voltaire. So when he was writing his memoir he could use his notes. 
Last but not least, the author of the text doubts that the Chevalier escaped of the prison by making a hole in the ceiling of the roof. He thinks that the Chevalier used his influence and his important friends in Venice to get free. But that's probably not true. Other prisoners had much more politically important friends than the Chevalier did. Plus there are notes of the government that the ceiling had to be repaired after the Chevalier escaped.
