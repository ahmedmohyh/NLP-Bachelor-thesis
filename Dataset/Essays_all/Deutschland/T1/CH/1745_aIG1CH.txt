In the text they say that Chevalier didnt´t need to borrow money if he had been very rich but the woman says that he had to borrow money because he had to wait until he get the money from selling stuff in Switzerland.
The woman says also like the same in the text, that he made his life more exciting and glamorous in his memoir than it really was.
That´s why a lot of people think, that he didn´t escaped from prison without help from his politically well-conected friends in Venice, but the woman said that the police had said that they had to repair the prison because of Chevalier. 
Moreover there was said that many people don´t doubt that the Chevalier and Voltaire really met and conversed, because Chevalier has written it many years after the conversation occurred and he couldn´t know exactly which word Voltaire said and that´s what the woman says too.
