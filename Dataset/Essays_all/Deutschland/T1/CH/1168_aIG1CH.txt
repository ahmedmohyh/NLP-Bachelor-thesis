In the following sentences I analyse the arguments of the text about Chevalier.
Chevalier was a rich person, who made a lot of exciting thiong, like parties and grambling. about his historical memoir are  alot of critics. one critism is that his life seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was. There is also more critic for him. then another popint is that he don't have such an exiting escape from the prison of venice. Of course, for the reading it's interesting but it isn't true. True is that he have a number of politically well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. Futhermore the meeting with him and the famous writer Voltaire can't be true, because it was written many years after the converstation. 
In the audio it was different. THere it was said, that it was true and generally he was better positioniated as in the text.
