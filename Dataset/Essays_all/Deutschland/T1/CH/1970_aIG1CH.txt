Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life, which lead to controversal discussions about the accuracy of it.
In his memoir he claims that he has been very wealthy and that he lived in Switzerland for a while. He also spent a lot of money in giving partys and having fun. The reason why many critics doubt this is that he borrowed money from other people, what wouldn't have been necessary if he really had that much money. Also the quotes of a conversation between him and the writer Voltaire are doubted, because the conversation was years ago. 
The escape from a prison in Venice is also a questionable point. While Chevalier claimed to have escaped from the prison on his own, critics think that he was helped by jailers. Because he and his friends had good political connections in Italy, it is more likely that they offered a bribe to free him.
In the end it's still not answered, if or what Chevalier invented in his memoir.
