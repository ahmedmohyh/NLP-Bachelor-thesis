In the presentation and also in the text there are some facts about the Chavalier de Seingalt who lived from 1725-1798, but there are some different facts said about the life of him.
For example in the presentation there was said, that he escaped from a prison in Venice because of his good connections and in the text there´s described, that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbed over the roof. 
Also different is, that in the text there is written, that the Chavalier hadn´t got much money, but in the pesentation is said, that he wasn´t poor. He just wanted he spend his money to buy things he like a lot to live a life with passion.
Another difference between the text and the presentation is, how the Chabalier wrote his long memoir. The text describes, that he wrote it towards the end of the life to recount his life and adventures and in the presentation there´s the information given, that he wrote down his thoughts and imaginations of nearly every day in his life.
