The text and the speech has got serveral arguments about the life of the "Chavalier". 
Firstly in the speech was said, that he isn't rich and he borrows money from a rich person. The first argument is wrong, because he was rich this time. So he didn 't need to borrow any money from a rich person. The next argument is about the escape in Venice. So he was in the prison and escape but he hadn't have so much politically friends than other prisoners. Also it is unclear, how he can escape from the prison. The text said, that it is such a story that he escape the prison only with a knife.
