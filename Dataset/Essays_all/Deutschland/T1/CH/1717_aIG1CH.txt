The presentation includes arguments supporting the version of the memoir of Chevalier compared to the critics against the memoir that are mentioned in the text. For example, Chevalier was not poor in Switzerland at time but had to borrow money because of another reason. He had a lot of money but spent that immediatly with partys so to get along until he made money again, he borrowed it which does not mean that he was poor. 
Another point according to the presentation is that Chevalier was able to write down the exact phrases of the conversations betwenn him and Voltaire. Even if his memoir was written many years after that, he wrote down notes after every conversation and used that for the memoir, which is proofed by many people that have seen him using them while writing it.
Also it is questioned his escape from the prison in the text, critics say that instead of making a hole in the ceiling and escaping through the roof he used his political contacts to get out of prison. But in the presentation there are arguments that support Chevalier´s version of the story: First, there were other people that had even better friends in the politics and did not escape and second, the day after he escaped, the ceiling had to be repared. 
So all in all the presentation trys to proof Chevalier´s memoir with arguments against the critics.
