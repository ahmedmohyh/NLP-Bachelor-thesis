The Chevalier is a famous person who wrote a memoir. In this memoir he wrote down his whole life and all his adventures he had made in his life. The controversial thing is, that his storys are so unbeleavable that nobody beleaves what he wrote. 
Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725-1798 and was a rich man from Switzerland and for many people in his century was his memoir a great source of people and events of the 18th century. But a lot of people say that the Chavalier wrote a lot of fictional storys in his memoir. 
For example he wrote, that he escaped from an italian prison in Venice. He wrote that he had a peace of iron and he diged a hole in the roof of his cell. He wrote that he had a number of politically well-connected friends, who helped him. But many people say that that could not be because many other prisinors had much more politically well-connected friends and they came not out of this prison.
So in conclusion you can say, that the Chevalier was very creative at wroting his memoirs. Nobody can really say what is wrong or right in his memoirs.
