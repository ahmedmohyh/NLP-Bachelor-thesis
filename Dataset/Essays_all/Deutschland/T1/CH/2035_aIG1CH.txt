The Chavevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life for what he used notes of conservations with Voltaire e.g . Critics say he he would have used unreal facts in his project, things which never happened like he had written to make his stories more interesting and exciting. So critics comment that it can not be  true that he could write full phrases of some conservations like the one with Voltaire in his memoir or the fact that he was a wealthy man but had to borrow money from others, but in fact he was wealthy, he spent his money mainly for festivals so there came a time he had to borrow some money.After his escape from the italian prison in Venice his prison room had to be renewed but anyway critics do not believe he could have escaped by only using a "piece of metal".
Anyway if the storeis are totally real or not, there will alway be critics an believers of his masterpiece, the important fact is that his work became a historical source.
