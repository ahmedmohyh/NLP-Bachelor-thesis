The speech was about some contoversial details in the Chevalier's memoirs. The text mentions many points he had written which are not very likely that they happened the way he told. But the speech gives us the reasons why it has to be happended exactly the way he said. The first argument is that borrowing money does not mean that somebody is poor, beacause it is mentioned that the Chevalier had to gain money first and during the time the money is not there, he had to borrow some. So they are convinced that though some critics say it different the Chevalier was not poor.
The next point is the critical conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. No one doubts that the conversation really took place, but there are doubts that the conversation did not took place how the Chevalier wrote it into his memoirs. But the speaker states that it was really how it is written down, because she says that the Chevalier made notes in the exact evening the conversation occured, so his memories had been clear.Then he kept this notes and many years later  he refers to the notes, so there are no lies about this in his memoir.
Last but not least the speaker refers to his escape from the prison in Venice. She gives two arguments. Firstl in the prison where people with more powerful friends and no one but the Chevalier had the chance to escape. Secondly his room had to be repaired afte he escaped. And she says that there would have been no need to repair it if he did not escaped the way he told.  
In my opinion there are still doubts. The speech could not convince me, that everything happened the way he told. So I am still a critic, but maybe there is a little bit more truth in his memoirs, than the worst critics think, but I do not believe that everything makes sense.
