The speech about the 'Chevalier' is a rather positive opinion on the Chevaliers life and his memoir and gives an differnt point of view compared to the text anout the Chevalier. The speech was devided into three parts and introduced by an positive resume about some of his achievements.
The theme of the first part was his money problems and debts. It was said, that he did not have problems with money and that he borrowed money, while waiting that his invested money arrived. The second part was about his conersations with Voltaire, that he wrote down in his memoir. Some people say, that the dialogue in his memoir is false, because he wrote it down only years after it happened. But in the speech it was prooven as wrong, because the Chevaer had a diary where he documented his life. And the final part of the speech was about his breakout out of prison. It was said that the Chevalier did not escape out of prison with help frm the outside, but that he escaped by himself. The arguments for that statement were, that he did not have that influencial contacts on the outside and that he ecaped by himself, because they had repair the seeling and that is the way he got out.
