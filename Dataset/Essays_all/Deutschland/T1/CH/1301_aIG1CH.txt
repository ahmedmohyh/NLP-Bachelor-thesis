Both the text and the listening excercise talked about he great adventures of the Chavalier de Seingalt, however they picture the accuracy of his life in different lights. While the text highly doubts the events discribed by Seingalt, the women in the listening excercise suggesed that they might had happend just the way he discribed them in his memoirs. Both texts talked about three events. Seingalts wealth in Swizerland, his conversations with Volteire and his escape from prison. 
While the author of the text states that he questions the wealth of Seingalt, because he had borrowed money from a marchand, the woman had the opinoin that even if he had borrowed money, he cirtanly wasn't poor. Concering the meeting with Voltaire, both belive they had met, but the author thinks the conversations written in the memoirs are invented, while the woman thinks Seingalt used notes to memorise the conversation, with which he could later accuratly write them down. The last event they talked about, the escape from jail, was also differently viewed by the two. In the opinion of the author, he completly lied about escaping, thinking he had simply prided his way out. The woman on the other hand pointed out that many other inmates where far more wealthy than Seingalt, and couldn't bride themselves out of prison. So how would Seingalt be able to ? She also explained that researchers had discovered that the celling of Seingalts cell had been repaired right after the event of his suposed escape accured. This incidated that he really had escaped. 
To conclude, while the author doubts the accuracy and the events in Chevalier de Seingalts memoirs, the woman from the listening excercise is cirtain that he did tell the truth and none of his storys are invented.
