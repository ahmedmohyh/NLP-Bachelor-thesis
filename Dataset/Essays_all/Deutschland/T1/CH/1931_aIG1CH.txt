The text and the short presentation about the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) have both similarities and differences. 

Firstly, there is a mixture of a difference and and similarity. The text says that the Chevalier was described by himself a very rich man. Critics argue that he needed to borrow money. As a consequence, he couldn´t be a rich man. In the presentation is said that the Chevalier was rich, too. In contrast to the text, the presenter says that the man sold property to get rich. On the one hand, it is a similaritiy because it is said in both texts that he was rich. It is only distinguished that the way of getting rich is different.

Secondly, the way he escaped out of the prison in Venice is described differently. The texts says he did it by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbed out the roof. The presenter explains it in another way: The sealing in the prison room of the Chevalier was reapaired. Therefore, he uses the chance to escape. 

To sum up, the stories of the Chevalier which are told by the text and the audio presentation are roughly the same. The differences you can find in details of the stories, e.g. the little difference in the way of escaping from prison.
