The presentation was about Chevalier and his memoir and was telling in three parts with three arguments.
The first part was about Chevalier and his life. This part included all of the informations about which was written in the text, but not the dates he lives.
The second part was about Chevalier living in Switzerland and spending a lot of money there on parties and gambling, but he isn't poor or something like that, because Switzerland is a very well-being country and to be poor there isn't the same like by us or somewhere else.
And the last part was about Chevalier's escape from a notorious prison in Venice. He escaped the prison but the other people who were in the prison didn't escaped.
So all in all the text and the presentation had a lot same things included, but if you want to get more informations about Chevalier and his complete life, in my opinion it is better to read the text
