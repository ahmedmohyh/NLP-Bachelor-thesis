The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life. In that memoir are written down expreiences which he had made. For example that he was living in Switzerland. In that time he was very rich and spent much money for paries and gambling. The explanation of the woman speaking says that he borrows money just because of the loss which he made through the spending for parties and gambling. One the other hand the text displays the fact that he had to borrow money as a sign for a even not really rich Chevalier, because if he was rich, he would not have needed to borrow money.
Further the woman says that the Chevalier ande the writer Voltaire met and converse, but the text shows an argument against it. It says that critics came up with the statement that it is impossible to remember exact phrases from a conversation for many years. The memoir was written many years later. But the woman says that he made notes after experienced something new or after something imporeant happend. So it makes sense, that he just wrote his notes, which he made after the conversation with voltaire down in his memoir many years later. The last experience mentioned in the text ist the escape from the Venetian prison. The woman said, that it is written down in a document that the seeling in his room was repaired. Why should the seeling got repaired when he had not escaped? The text says that he wasn't able to do this, because of his jailers.
