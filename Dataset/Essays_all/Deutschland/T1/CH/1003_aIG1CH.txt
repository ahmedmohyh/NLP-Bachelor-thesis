The text is about  a man, who was a writer. A Chevalier.
He wrote about his adventures. So he bacame famous and met other famous people like kings or other writers. But not all of his stories were real.... 
He invented some histories to get the attention of other people. Also he wrote down his journal and some conversations. This conversations were written the same way like they were spoken. That is why some critical people think that it is not possible. You can not remember every word or every sentence somebody said 3 years ago, or maybe more. The critical also think that this conversation has not happend. So the Chevalier just worte this story with the knowledge that this conversation hasn´t happen.
So he got attention and got money for his books where he wrote the histories. He went to Switzerland, where he spent a great deal of money on parties and gambling. But what was strange is, that he asked somebody for some money. That is strange because actually he was a rich and wealthy man who does not have to ask somebody for money. 
The Chevalier had to go to prison in Italy. But he escaped. He used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof.
