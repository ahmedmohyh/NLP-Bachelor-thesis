The teacher in the listening part just telled a few parts of the text. She don't telled that the Chevalier had a lot of political contacts like kings and writers. In the eighteents century, it was a big help, if the people had such contacts. So i think, that the Chevalier could escape with the help of the prison workers, like the "teacher" said. Because their were a lot of people who could escape by just using a "piece of metal". The fact, that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed him free is more understandable, because the Chevalier was rich and had a lot of good contacts. That's a point, which the "teacher" doees not telled her pupil. So she forgot the hole part with the escape of the Chevalier and just telled the part with the "bribe" of the jailers. She telled about the conversation of the Chevalier and Voltaire, but not telled, that there are critics about the conversation. So she not telled, that the memoir of the Chevalier was more exciting and glamorous then ihis life really was. So in my opinion, she forgot a lot of details about the live and the critics about him.
