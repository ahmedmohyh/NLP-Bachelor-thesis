The lecture and the text dissagree in almost every point here´s how:

The lecture starts off by calling the Chevalier a reliable source, in contrary to the text which questions his reliability quite a bit.
First they mention his supposed wealth and how the fact that he borrowed a fair amount of money doesn´t necessarily mean that he had to be poor, infact, it is argued that the Chevalier posessed wealth in the form of assets which took a certain time to be sold, and in that timeframe the Chevalier would have had to borrow money in order to finance his life of extensive parties and gambling.
Regarding his conversations with Voltaire it is mentioned that the Chevalier took notes each night after he had conversed with Voltaire in order to not have to rely on his memorie as the text states, furthermore it is mentioned how, many other sources prove that he indeed consulted his notes often whilst writing his memoir.
As a last point the lecturant talks about his supposed prison escape which according to the text was just simple bribery, the lecture nullifys this argument by saying how there where way more powerfull people in the prison with him, but how those powerfull people were never able to bribe their way out of the prison.
In addition it is mentioned that, after the Chevalier left the prison, the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired and it´s asked why they would´ve have to repair his ceiling if he just simply bribed his way out.

All in all it still isn´t clear who´s right and who´s wrong, but from the get go it seems like the text left out some facts in order to seems more convincing.
