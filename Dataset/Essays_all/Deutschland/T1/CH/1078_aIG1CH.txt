The chevalier de Seinegalt - Was he really a controversial person in the european history?
On the one hand yes he was controversial person. Becouse he met some many people importent people for example kings and autors(ll.2). That makes him to a great souce in european history. I'd like to add to this point that he has seen a lot of differnd countrys first he  live a long time in Switzerland. Secondy he went to Venice(Italy). There he was is prison but he escaped climbing out of his roof. On the other Hand he makes his money with great deal but that doesn't mean that he doesn't need to to lend some money. But that allso doesn't mean that he was poor(ll.5-7).
Last but not least his escape out of the 
italian persion
