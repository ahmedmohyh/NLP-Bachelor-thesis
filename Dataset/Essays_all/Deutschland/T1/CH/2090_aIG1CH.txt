The Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798.
There are many critics about the story, because in the text stand other things about the switzerland than I listened. The text critisied the story of the Chavelier in many things.
He tells that he borrows money but he is actually rich. And in Switzland you have another system for many than the Chevalier told.
I heard he had powerfull friends, but in the text is a critic with his friend Voltaire. 
Also the information about his life is anotherone. In the text stand he was´t a rich man until he met many famous people. He lie about his money, because he tried to make his life semms more glamorous but actually he was a normal man. 

The women told many things about the money in Switzeland. Many people got rich and nobody needes to borrow something.
