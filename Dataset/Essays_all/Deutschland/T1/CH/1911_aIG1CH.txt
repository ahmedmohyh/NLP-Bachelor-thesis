In the following text I write about the Chevaliers memoir about his life in which he tells us about his passing life with knowing famous peaple and beeing arrested in jail.
The Chevalier de Seingalt was writing about his life including his adventures. His memoirs are the roots of the European society now a days. He met sertant peaple like Voltaire which he records as well in his memoirs. His lifestyle in switzerland was it to make huge partys where he leaves all of his money. If the Chevalier do not have money he borrowed something. He did not have a bad position in life. He was arrested in jail in Venice, Italy. Here he should have connections to other mates which are arrested too. But it is not like he discribed it. He did not have that kind of connectin to other mates in their. The story with the peace of metal is not right because why should the ceiling should be repaired for this. This confirmed a Coverment document. He told us that he was writing out of his mind also since some years and that he made his memoirs a little bit intresting to read.
