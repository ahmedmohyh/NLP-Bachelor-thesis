Both sources are about the same events happining to Chevalier de Seingalt but they're having different oppinions to the events.

First the text says that he wrote his memoirs far more exciting than they really were and that it would be all over the top but the audio report means that no memoir can be totally right because it's one person's expresion.
Then the text thinks that Chevalier was lying about being rich. The audio version explains it with the earlier standards: Since he was traveling he always had all his money with him and so he borought same until his money arrived. 
The next different was in him meeting an important person and talking about that person many years later saying it was exacly like that but no one would be able to remember something like that so clearly, so the audio respond with him taking notes after the meeting, it would be easy to recall it all so clearly and it was states that he did take notes back then.
The last point was about his escape out of prison. Chevalier wrote that he made a hole into the wall with a little piece of metal. The text says that it would be unrealistic and that one of his important friends got him out of prison but he audio argues that there were other prisoners with far more important friend who didn't got out. A more important argument would be that documents about the prison were found saying they had to repare the prison's cell after he got out. So why would they have to repare it, wouldn't there be a big hole?

If it's true or not we won't know, we can just argue about.
