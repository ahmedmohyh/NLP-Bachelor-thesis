The Chevalier wrote a memoir about his life and it's a reliable historical resource about "European society in the eighteenth century" (l.2-3). 
Many things in this memoirs are heavily critizised. The first example is the money he borrowed from a merchand in Switzerland. Critical voices say that's why he couldn't be as rich as he wrote he was but there is a simple explanation for that: When he ran out of cash he had to sell a few things and while he waited for this money he had to borrow a little bit money from the merchand.
The second example are the passages he wrote about his conversations with the writer Voltaire. Critizisers say it can't be all true what he recorded because he wrote the memoir years after his conversations with Voltaire. There is also a simple explanation for it. The Chevalier took notes each night after the conversation with Voltaire. He used these notes while writing his memoir.
The third example is about how he escaped from prison in Venice. Critics say it only sounds adventurous in his memoir and in reality he didn't escaped because he made a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal but jailers helped him to get out. But there are old government notes that say they had to repair the ceiling from Chevaliers cell and why would they repair a ceiling if there wasn't a hole?
