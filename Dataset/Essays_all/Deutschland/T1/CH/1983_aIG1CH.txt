In the text about the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) they critizice a lot about his long memoir, which deals with his life and adventures. Was it real? Could that happen? There are three arguments which they critizice. But in the listening-part they disagree with the critic in the text. 

In the text the Chevalier is called poor because "(...) (he) borrowed (...) sums of money from a Swiss merchant" (l.6). The author don't think that he really was rich. But the woman in the listening-part said that only because he borrowed money, he wasn't poor.
