The text and the audio was about Chevalier de Seingalt and his long memoir.
He lived from  1725 to 1798  and in his memoire he told stories out of his life . In the memoire he told that he lived in Switzerland and hadn´t a lots of money and he borrowed it from a Swiss merchant because he needed it to pay the parties and gambling.
But his story with the money has critics because they are thinking that the Chevalier de Seingalt was very rich. In the audio it was also said that the Chevalier wans´t a poor man.
The second story is the conversation with Voltaire. In his memoire he told that he met Voltaire and tallked to him. But also in this case the Chevalier has a lots of critics beacause no one believed that he met him years before he started the writing of the memoire. And so it´s impossible so tell exactly told phrases in the memoire from the conversation. This was also mentioned in the audio.
The last story was about his life in prision in Venice. He mentioned that he escaped it with a piece of metal but critics have the opinion thatb his political friends offered a bribe.The audio also told that their was a hole in his jailroom but it was only a little one and it was repaired. So he was escaped by is political friends and he wasn´t his own hero.
To summerize the text and audio have shown the story the Chevalier has written and the opinion of the side from the critics.
