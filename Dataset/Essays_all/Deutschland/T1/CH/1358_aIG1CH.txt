The following information I got out of 2 sources of reading and listening.

The Chevalier de Seingalt was a man out of 18th century who wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventure. Many people say he fakes his writing to make his life seem more exciting and glamorous than it really was. Chevalier seems to be very wealthy and rich, but it was said that he borrows very much, so which man borrows money if he´s rich? An explanation about that is that he sold very much and doesn´t get his money back early enough. Because of that he borrows money to have it earlier. 

There is also a doubt about the accuracy of the conversations that the Chevalier records in the memoir between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. It´s probably right that they meet each other, but critic complain that the memoir cannot possibly capture these conversations accurately, because it was written many years after the conversations occured. 

There could be also an incorrect phrase in relation to his prison escape. He says that he escaped by himseld making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics say that he got help by his well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a bribe. 

In the end there are many doubts about the life of Chevalier de Seingalt, but what we know is that he lived.
