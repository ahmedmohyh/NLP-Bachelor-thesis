This essay is about the accuracy of the memoir from Chevalier de Seingehalt (1725-1798).
The critics say, that not all from his memoir are true.
One point is, that it seems like that he was really rich and he have spent a lot of money in Switzerlannd. But in the Memoir the author writes he was so poor, he had to borrow money. 
On the other hand, he lose a lot of money in switzerland, because he was living a very expensiv life there with partys and all that stuff.
An other point is, that he met Voltaire and had a great Conersavation with him.
The critcs doubt that, because Chevalier was keeping many years his notis from Voltaire and after many years he wrote it in his memoir down.
The last story that critker doubt is the story of the escape from the prison ,,Venice´´ in Italy.
In the original memoir is written, that he have escape only with a piedce of metal to make a hole and then just walking outside.
Critcs say the hilirous story is not true, because he had friends in the prison who helped him.
On the other side, no own of his friends was that powerfull to help him to escape.
