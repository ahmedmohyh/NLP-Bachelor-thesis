There are some controversial views concerning the life of the Chevalier de Seingalt. On the one hand the listening part describes the memoir of the Chevalier as historical correct while it is described as a fictional and exciting novel in the text.
 In the listening part it is said that the Chevalier was a very wealthy man.
The need of borrowing money from a merchant in Switzerland is because he waited for money from the bank and not explainable due to poorness.
Furthermore the listening part explaines that the Chevalier took notes of his conversations with Voltaire in order to write them down many years later.
However, there is a contrast to the text which says that Voltaire and the Chevalier eventually met but it does not say that the Chevalier took notes of these conversations which is the reason for the incorrectnes of these written conversation.
Third in the listening part is said that there is some evidence for the prisonbreak of the Chevalier in venice which proofs that he escaped and was not sent free like it is mentioned in the text: There are written textin italy  that explaine a break of the ceilinbg!
