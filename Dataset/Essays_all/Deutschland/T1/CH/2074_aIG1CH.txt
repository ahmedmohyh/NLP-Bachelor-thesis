 Chevaliers memoir is telling you many things, wich can not be proofed and so are very critical. Chevalier described his life better than it actually seem to be. He described it as an adventurous and exiting life. For example wrote Cheavlier that he has spoeken to Voltaire, but that cant be proofed or can be find anywhere. He is also telling you that that he has traveled a lot. So once in a time in Swiss he was very wealthy and rich, but that also can't be proofed. The are people who are saying that a furthertime Chevalier has had to borrow money, but that didn't make him poor either. That was mantioned in a Speach about the author. But in the Text it actually says that he was somehow poor. Another aspect ist that Cheavlier has escaped an prison in Italy, Venice, which no one ever has before, He was the first and only person who seem to get that. Chevalier is seeming to have written many things in hin memoir, which are maybe not true. Everyone ist telling you somehow the same about him and he is very critisised. So maybe it's true, that Chevalier has written some things, which didn't happen or happen, but in a whole different way that he was saying. Like it seems to be very unreal to escape a prison in Italy, which no one has ever had before.
