In the text about the 'Chevalier' and in the audio are some differences and I would like to point some of these out. As it is said in the text, the Chevalier was very wealthy while he lived in Switzerland and that he would not have to borrow money. But in contrast the audio said that he sometimes had to borrow money because he always spent his money and there were times when he had to wait a few days to get new money. Another aspect is that the audio sais that he had a pretty accurate memory and that he took some time to write down his memory of his conversations in journals every night but the critics say that it was written many years after the conversations occured and that's why it's not possible to capture these conversations accurately. Another point is his esape from the prison he was in. The best evidence in the audio was that the ceiling had to be repared soon after his escape but the text says the he only wrote it down because it would make reading the story more enjoyable.
