The first point is, that woman says that his memoir is a valuable historical source. She disagrees with the critics. She also has a lot of facts which prove that the Chevalier´s memoirs are pretty accurate.
The first point that the critics doubt is, that the Chevalier was rich. They say if he really was rich, he would not have had to borrow money from people. In fact, he was just selling things which took a few days, so he had to borrow money while he was not earning anything because not everything was sold yet.
The second point the critics disagree with is, that the Chevalier could never remember all the conversations with Voltaire, so he could not have written them down like this in his memoire if they were real. The woman on the other hand, states that after all his conversations with Voltaire, the Chevalier wrote everything down he remembered of the conversation, at the same evening. He used this writings to get the conversations into his memoire.
The third and last point the critics doubt, is the part where the Chevalier escaped the prison in Venice, only using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Critics say that he just invented that, and that he got out of prison because he had a lot of powerful political friends in Venice who helped him by offering a bribe. In fact, there were many other prisioners which had a lot of powerful friends as well and still could not get out of the prison. Also, there are reports that say that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired after he escaped the prison.
