In the presentation was said that the Chevalier de Seingalt wasn't poor even though he had to borrow money while he was in Italy. He had to do this, because he was waiting for his money which took time to arrive. In the text is written that he wasn't rich, because he had to borrow considerable sums of money. So these two arguments stand against each other. 
It was also said that the Chevalier took notes while he was visiting important people or directly after adventures. In the text is written that critics are skeptikal about the fact that the Chevalier had so many adventures and conversations with important persons, e.g. politicians, kings and writers. They say that he wrote everything better than it was to make his memoir more interesting for others. For example they don't believe that he remembered many sentences from a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire. But in the presentation was said that the Chevalier took notes from the converstion and also wrote many sentences down. Many other people could proof that he took notes while he was alive.
In the text the critics say that the Chevalier probably didn't flee from the prison in Italy by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. They say that he might have been let free by his jailers because he had many mighty and influencing friends outside the prison. But in the presentation was said that many others in the prison hab friends that are more influencing and they weren't let free by the prisoners. Also the roof of the prison cell where the Chevalier was in had to be repaired after his escape. So this is another sign for his escape through the roof.
