In the following text iam going to sum up the arguments which prove, that the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt was a true story.
First of all the fact that he lied about being rich just because of boworring money from Switzerland. It is possible that he actually has been rich but then spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. So he lost his money and needed more, which he obviously boworred from Switzerland.
Secondly the doubts of him remembering the whole conversation with Voltaire. 
Critics think it couldnt be possible, that he was able to write everything down, whereas some other people think he could have taken notes and written all the conversation down even with certain quotes some years later.
Last but not least the question if he really escaped from the Venetian prison. Although one could ask how he could have escaped, there are documents which prove that he truly escaped from jail by himself.
In conclusion we can see that actually the critism of the text loses his power by comparing it with the presentation.
