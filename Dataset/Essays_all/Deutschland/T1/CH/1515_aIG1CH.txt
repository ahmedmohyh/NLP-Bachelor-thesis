Many of the points made by the critics in the text are stated as wrong in the lecture of the listening part. 

The first point was the money borrowed in Switzerland by Chevalier from a merchant. Critics say, that this is a proof, that the Chevalier de Seingalt wasn`t as rich as told in his memoir. But in the lecture it is said, that the money he earned during his time in switzerland was in fact very plenty but sometimes he needed time to convince his bank to give it to him. So in this periods of time, when he needed cash, he borrowed money from the merchant.

The second event, stated as inaccurate by critics, are the conversations with Voltaire, which are described in the memoir. Critics say, that it would be impossible for Chevalier to remember the conversations this detailed, because he wrote the memoir several years later. Other people, for example people, who knew Chevalier while he lived, said, that he wrote down the conversations, he had with Voltaire, right the evening after they took place. He kept this notes and used them for his memoir.

The third evidence is Chevaliers escape from the prison in Venice. Critics state, that it would be more likely, that he was freed by friends of him, who had a high influence. But otherwise it is proofed, that there were many other prisoners, who had even mightier friends than Chevalier, and they didn`t managed to escape. Another argument for the accuraty of Chevalier`s memoir is the fact, that there were papers from the gouverment of Venice, that ordered to repair the ceiling of the cell, Chavelier was locked in. In the lecture its said, that there wouldn´t been a use in repairing the ceiling,if Chavelier didn`t escaped through it, as he stated in his memoir.
