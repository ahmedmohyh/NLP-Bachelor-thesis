Essay: Chevalier

The report presented facts that could prove the events taking place in Chevalier's memoirs. The speaker explained that just because Chevalier borrowed money from a Swiss merchant, doesn't mean he wasn't rich, but that it sometimes took time for the money he earned to arrive, making it necessary for him to borrow money to continue his lushious lifestyle, later paying it back. Even though Chevalier wrote his memoirs at the end of his life, it is known that he regulary wrote in journals about events that took place or conversations he had, which he kept for many years, making it possible to use the notes to retell his conversations with Voltaire accurately. Chevalier lying about his prison escape is also unlikely because many of his influential friends had tried bribing the law but failed and his detailed explanation of how he escaped by making a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal can be proven by a report the Venetian government made about a ceiling in the prison needing to be repaired. 
The report argumented in controversy to the text, that all in all Chevalier's memoirs are a pretty accurate source when it comes to historical events during his lifetime.
