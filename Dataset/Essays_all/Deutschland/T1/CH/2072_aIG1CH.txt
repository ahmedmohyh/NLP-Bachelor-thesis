They are sure that the Chevalier add actions in his memoir to make his life more interesting for other people, so he get more famous.
The Chevalier wrote about his life in Switzerland. For example he wrote that he had borrowed money and he also wrote that he was a rich man, but some people are critical with this, because a rich man doesn´t have to borrow money from others. Well, it´s not the only thing people are critical with, because some conversations or details are written years later after they happened. Another entry, when the Chevalier wrote he escaped from prison, is hard to believe for many people, because the details aren´t real enough to believe. The critics questioned if the Chevalier wrote the memoir to wrote down his memories or just wrote the history because he wanted to become a famous man.
