In the audio they said the Chevalier wrote everything down what he remember.  The text tells us, that after he met famous people, his memoir has become a valuable historical source about European society in eighteens century. So it couldn´t be true that he wrote everything down because it was a valuable historical source.
From the audio I also remember that he was waiting to get money, to make cash. In the text is telled that critics says that the Chevalier nevr had been very rich because than he would not have needed to borrow money.
