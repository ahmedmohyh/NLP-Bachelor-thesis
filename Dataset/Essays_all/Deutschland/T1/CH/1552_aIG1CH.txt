Chevalier de Seingalt's memoirs are hardly critisized by some history experts. Are they reliable?
In the text there is given that Chevalier described himself as rich and was known for his great parties and gambling. But the fact that days before he needed to borrow a lot of money gives up some questions about his luxurious life. In the audio you can hear that the fact that Chevalier borrowed money doesn't mean he was poor. There is also a quite big possibility that he borrowed the money because his success wasn't yet converted into money. That process needed some time.
Another critic is the fact that Chevalier described a conversation between him and Voltaire, a well known author. But the conversation seemed to be very unprecise and in some points more imagined than real. But in the same passage of the text there is also given that he wrote the conversation years after the real meeting with Voltaire so he simply didn't remember all details. This argument against the critic is also given in the audio.
The last point which is given in the text is about the prison escape of Chevalier. In his memoirs he describes that he used a piece of metal and destroyed the ceiling to break out. But sources say he had best contacts who would have helped him to leave the prison. But in the audio you can hear that there where other prisoners who had better contacts and even with them they didn't manage to break out. Also a source deals with the fact that some days after Chevalier's escape a ceiling in that prison needed to be repaired. This fact would be another agree on the adventure of Chevalier.
