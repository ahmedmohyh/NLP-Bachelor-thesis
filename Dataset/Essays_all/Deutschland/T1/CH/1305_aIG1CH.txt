It has often been discussed, wether or not the memoires of Chevalier de Seingalt have really happened like how described them they did or if he has just made them up. People who call him controversial, often name three things: wether he really was wealthy in Switzerland, his conversations with Voltaire and his escape from the prison in Venice. 
Firstly, the person in the presentation points out, that Chevalier has spent his money on many parties or else. She explains the fact, that he borrowed money by other people, with that, that he simply had to wait for this money to arrive, which lead him to be in need for money in a small period of time. For her, this doesn't mean that he was poor, just because his money hadn't arrived yet. 
Secondly, she talks about his conversations with Voltaire, where it is questioned, wether it is possible for Chevalier to remember the exact dialogue that happened some years ago, as he did in his memoires. The simple explanation for that is, that he wrote down every detail of their conversation at the exact same day into his journal, which he took use of while writing his memoires. Other people, people who met Chevalier, have also said that it was true, that he always carried a journal with him. 
The last point, his escape from the prison, where people say, that he has just bibed people to free him, because he knew people with a big influence, is, in her opinion, not true, because there have been people with way more power than Chevaliers' friends, who have not escaped. Additionally, it is written in the venician documents, that they hat to repair the ceiling in Chevaliers' cell after his escape, which wouldn't be the case, if he really didn't escape by climbing through the roof.
