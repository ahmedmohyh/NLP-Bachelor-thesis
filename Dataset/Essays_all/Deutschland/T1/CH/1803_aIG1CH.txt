The following essay deals with Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798), who wrote a  often discussed memoir about his adventures. 

His memoir is often used as a historical source, but some people are not sure about its  accuracy. In his memoir Chevalier de Seingadt writes about the conversations between himself and the famous wwriter Voltaire. But he wrote these conversations down after a few years. Critics wonder about how he possibly could be able to rember the excact conversation after years. The audibile gives an answer to that. They claim that Seingaldt took notes right after every conversation, so he could easily rember them for many years.

 Another part of the memoir ,that is often discussed , is his escape from a prison in Venice, Italy. He claimed that he used a piece of metal to make a hole in thee ceiling and climed through the roof. Critics believe that his jailers were corrupt and simply took money from him. Again, the audible gives evidence, that this story might have happendt like Seingalt explained it. The cealing in the prision actually needed to be repaired by the old venician government.

All in all, there are many profs for and against the accuracy of the memoir.
