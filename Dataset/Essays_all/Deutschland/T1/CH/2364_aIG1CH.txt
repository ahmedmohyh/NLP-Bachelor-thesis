Chevalier de Seaingalt was the writer of his own memoirs whitch most people think they are fake and he had invented some events to make his life more exciting. Many people say he wasn't as rich he claimed and his escape from the venician prison wasn't an actuall escape. There also are some critics who say his meeting with the writer Voltair went the way Chevalier wrote down in his memoir. 
Many Chevalier supporters have answers to the critics questions: Chevalier did borrow some money from a swiss merchant but it does'nt mean he was a poure. The nobility at his time spent too much money for parties and gambling. It was usual to borrow money till the payback.
Chevaliers famous escape from the venician prison is also true. He wrote that he had digged a whole in the prisons ceilling with a piece of metal. It seems to be  invented and critics claim Chevalier had powerful friends who helped him to bribe the jailers. But there were many other prisoners with more powerful friends than he had, and they didn't escape. The prisons ceilling had to be repaired as soon as he escaped the prison.Not everything from Chevaliers memoirs was invented.
