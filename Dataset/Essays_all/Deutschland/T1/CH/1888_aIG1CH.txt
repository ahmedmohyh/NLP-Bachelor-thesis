The Speaker of the audio gives a quite different point of view on the story of the Chevalier de Seingalt then critics do. She said for example, that he wrote anything down how he had remembered it. She doesn`t raise doubts about this even if crtics say that it must be quite impossible to remember certain sentences from a conversation years after she took place. What could also mean that he was confused toward the end of his life. She also said that they had to repair the roof after he escaped from the Prison in Venice. On that point the speaker is agreeing to critics of the Chevalier. That could not have happend when he escaped quite the way he said he did. So the Chevalier may have met many important historical figures and also wrote about them, but it is not clear if he was mentally health during the time in which we wrote his memoir. The speaker in the audio has no clear position towards the critics on one hand she s speaking against the critics opinion and on the other hand she said that they are maybe right.
