They say that his memoir is really a reliable source and that the Chevalier took notes in every situation of his life to have every detail in written form. The text says that it is totally clear that he lied in his text. It is impossible to have a exciting and glamorous memoir with only the truth. He invented some other details which not happen in reality. It was said that he was rich and he had a big wealth and that it is normal to borrow money from others. That doesn't show how poor he was, it was just the problem that he has to sell some things to get money and that's the only reason why he had to borrow money. In his memoir he wrote that he was rich and in the text it says that it is not normal to borrow money when you are rich. When he was able to deal with a lot of money at parties why was he in need to borrow money. It does not seem normal to do this. It was also said that he kept notes for many years, to collect enough information for his memoir. Some friends or family saw him very often while he took some notes or think about what could be important for his memoir. The text says that the conversations can not be detailed or written correctly. he took notes over years and could not be able to remind every single detail. The last thing which was said is that he was in prison where he wanted to flee. They said they had to repair the ceiling because he tried to climb through the roof after he made a big whole in the ceiling with a piece of metal. In the text they just mentioned that it is a funny story and that the Chevalier invented this to have readers who enjoyed reading his memoir.
