Chevalier de Seingalt, a quite normal man, wrote  at the end of his life a memoir about his life and of all the adventures he had. Through his life he met a lot of kings and writers and other famous people. A lot of people argue wether you should believe every story included in the memoir.  
The first story, which a lot of people argue about is that while he was living in Switzerland he borrowed a lot of money from people in Switzerland, even though he was a very wealthy person. But just because he had to borrow money doesn't mean that he was poor. Some people argue that he only had to ask for money because it took alonger time to receive the money when he was in Switzerland, because he often threw parties and other things.
Another story which some people argue about are the conversations between himself and the famous writer Voltaire. A lot of critics say that it is not possibly that Chevalier still knows so many details of their conversations eventhough they have happened a while ago. But Chevalier argued againt that. He said that he wrote everything of their conversations in a journal everytime they talked. He kept that journal a secret for a long time.
The last story a lot of people are criptical about is that he freeed himself from a prison in Venice, Italy. He says that he freed himself with no help of others. He said he made a hole into the roof with a piece of metal and after that he climbed through the roof. The critics say that he had help of people which worked in the prison. Those helped him because he had many politically important friends. And again Chevalier has an argument against that. He claims that in the prison were people much more important than him and noone helped them to escape. Also there is proof that the roof had a big hole, which the owner of the prison had to remove.
In the end I think not every story of Chevalier story is true, and even if they're not it is fun to see how creative this man was.
