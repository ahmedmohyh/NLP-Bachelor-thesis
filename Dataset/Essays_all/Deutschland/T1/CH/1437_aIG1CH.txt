In the text "Chevalier" was written that the Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798, wrote a long memoir about his life and adventures.(l.1)
The same were repeated in the audience about him.
The Chevalier spends a lot of money in partys and things like that, but in the text were said that he wouldnt borrow money. (l.7)
At the last part of the text, critics point out that it is impossible to remember exact phrases from extended conversations accurately (ll.13-14).
He didnt wrote everything down after years, he wrote everything down after a short time. So its another context to the written text.
