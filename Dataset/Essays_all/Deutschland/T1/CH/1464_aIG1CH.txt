In the text are many critics about the truth of the memoir the Chevalier made. The first point is that the Chevalier was not as wealthy as he wrote about himself, because he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. An other point is that the Critics do not belive that the chevalier really met the famous writer Voltaire. The last point is that the Critics think that the Chevalier lied about his escape from prison. The presantation has an argument against the first point. The presenter tells that the Chevalier did  not borrow the money cause he is not as wealthy as he told in his memoir. The presenter thinks that the Chevalier needed to borrow money cause he did not got his money back from gambling instead. The presenter had an argument against the third point too. He thinks tht the the Chevalier did not escaped because of his good conections, because there were other prisoners with better conections and they did not escape.
