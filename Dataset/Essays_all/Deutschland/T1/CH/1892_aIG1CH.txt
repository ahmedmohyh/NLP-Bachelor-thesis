Both texts, the one I've heard and the one I've read, told about the Chavelier, a historical person who wrote a long memoir about his life, in which he claimes to have met a lot of famous and important people like kings or writers. 
But there are some Critics who say, that not everything in his memoir is true. These were talked about in the first text. In the second text there were arguments from Critics who say the memoir is actually true. Here is an example: in the first text they don't believe the Chavelier that he escaped from a prison in Venice by using a piece of metal to break the ceiling. They say his powerful friends helped him to escape.
In the second text they do believe him. They say there were other prisoners with much more powerful friends, so why didn't those escape with the help of their friends? And then there's the ceiling: it had to be repared shortly after the escape from the chavelier, so his story about breaking the ceiling really makes sense!
An other argument the Critics in the first text use is his time in switzerland, where he borrowed a lot of money, even if he sayed he was very rich in his memoir. But again the writers of the second text believe him. They say he needed to borrow this money to get rich! (I'm not sure with this, I wrote my notes while they talked about this)
So they claim the Chaveliers' memoir to be an important historical scource, even if some critics do not believe him.
