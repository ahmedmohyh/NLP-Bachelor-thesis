In the text there are many critics on Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir. The first thing critics complain about is the fact that Chevalier wrote about very great wealth he had and about big parties he made. But it is known that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. Critics say he had not need to borrow money if he had this wealth.
The woman who held the presentaion says that parties like they were in Chevalier's memoir were very expensive so it is ok that he borrowed money. In her opinion he just had to borrow money because he waited on his new money to come. So this means he had the wealth and the money and just need the money sometimes when he waited for his own.
Also critics say that the quotations, Chevalier gives, of conversations years before are not reliable beacuse noone can remember the exact phrases. The opposition says that Chevalier always made notes after conversation likes this and that it is known he used such notes to write his memoir. Every quotation is from his notes so it is all real.
The third thing critics say is that the breakout Chevalier describes is not realistic. The woman says in her presentation that in this prison there were prisoners with some friends with even more influence and they did not come free. Also, and this is a fact, the prison had to repair the ceiling after Chevalier's breakout so there had to be some damage. This could be a hint that his "daring escape" makes enjoyable reading but it is also a real story.
