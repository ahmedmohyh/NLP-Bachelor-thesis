Chavalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798, was a controversial figure, as many speculate, that he has invented many adventures in his memoir of his life and adventures, which is now a valuable historical source about European society of the 18th century.
Looking at the fact, that people claim he just invented his conversations with voltaire, it is delivered, that he sat down after every conversation and wrote the things he remembered down in a journal as exactly as he could. He used this journal while writing about the conversations in his memoir, so he could not have just invented them.
As well as the fact, that it is claimed if he really was rich whilest living in Switzerland, as he borrowed, but he just borrowed it for the time until he was paid, so he could continue partying.
Also, it is speculated if he really escaped through the ceiling as he had many 'politcally well-connected friends' in Venice and he could have just taken advantage of a jailer's bribe. But it is delivered, that shortly after his escape the ceiling of his former cell had to be repaired, so there is no better explanation to that than the fact that he escaped the way he said he did.
