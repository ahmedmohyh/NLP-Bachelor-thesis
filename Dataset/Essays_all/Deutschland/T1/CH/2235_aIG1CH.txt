Chevalier de Seingalt is a man living from 1725 til 1798. He wrotes a memoir concluding his life and adventures, which becomes a valuable historical source about the European society in the eigteenth century. 
There are many cirtics about what Chevalier wrote into his memoir, because on the one side he tells about big partys and and a great deal of money, but on the other side he must borrow money from a Swiss merchant. 
Another argument was that the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire does not based on facts, because nobody knows about a met between these two and Chevalier brings the conversation after many years into words. So he could forget important facts or image something that was not there, beacause nnobody could remember word by word what another person say to them.
The last argument was that the escape Chevalier's out of the notorious prison in Venice, Italy, is very unimagenable, because a lot other people with more influence were in these prison and could not escape.
