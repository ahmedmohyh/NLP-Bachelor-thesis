Chevalier was a controversial figure. He meet famous people, after that his memoir has become a valuable historical sourch about European society in the eighteen century. He lives in Switzerland and there he spent a deal of money on parties and gambling. If he hat really been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money. Memoir cannot possibly capture these conversation accurately, complain critics.
