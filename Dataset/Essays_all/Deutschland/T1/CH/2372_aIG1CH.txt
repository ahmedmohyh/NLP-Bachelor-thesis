Chevalier de Seingalt has wrote his memoir, but there are some things what are critical.  He was in Switzerland, were he showed his rich. But he must borrow money from a Swiss machant. Chevalier has met Valtoire, but for this it doesn´t gives material what it can show, that this was right. Chevalier had wrote the memoir many years later. So teh accurately in wrong.  An other thing is, that he broke out of a prison, with no help. alot of people say,that he bribed the jailers, but this can not right. Chevalier don´t have many friends, than other prisioners.
