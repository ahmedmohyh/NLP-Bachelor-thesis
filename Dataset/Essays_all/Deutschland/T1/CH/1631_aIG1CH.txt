In the listening part and the text about the memoirs from Chevalier, who was born in 1725 und died in 1798, were many information about the accuracy of his memoirs. Chevalier seemed to be a important person because he had known many important persons, for example king or writers. But the listening part was controversial to the reading part. In the listening part the narrator said, that Chevalier spend a lot of money in partys and gambling while he lived in Switzerland. But sometimes he had to wait for his money to reach him and that's why he needed to borrow money a few times. The text said, that he didn't had the money he spended and due to that he had to borrow money from rich friends. Another point of his memoirs are his late night conversations with the writer Voltaire. The narratow pointed out, that Chevalier wrote down the conversations between him and Voltaire in the night, right after they had talked. The information from the text say something controversial, critics are pretty sure that Chevalier wrote down the conversations years after he talked to each other.
To sum up what I understand, I want to point out that the text seems to be a bit more critcal with the accuracy of Chevaliers memoirs than the narrator from the listening part was.
