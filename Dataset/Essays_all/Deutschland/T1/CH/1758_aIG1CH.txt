The difference between the text and the presentation is, that they are talking about the same topic in different ways. The text is more critical while the information during the presentation are not exact and do just lead to more questions. The text says that the Chevalier was a kind of a liar and that his life was not as glamorous as everyone thought it was. But in the presentation the Chevalier is protected and their are arguments who support and defend him again and again the whole time. None of the above is sure about his money and how it sounds he was not either. The text is also not sure about the relation between Voltaire and the Chevalier and if they had really met, while the information in the presentation only says that he wrote down notes from a conversation he had with Voltaire fo his memoir. But the most critical situation is the question, how he came out of the prison in Italy. Because in the text they think he had good relations in Venice, so they helped him out what would not be fair. In the presentation we hear that the government said that they had to repair his prison so he would have escaped illegally on his own. The narrator believes this and trusts her information. So the text is not sure about anything and very critical, while the woman just presents the information she has and knows and does not asked questions.
