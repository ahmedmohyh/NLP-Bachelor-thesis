The text is about Chevalier who wrote down some memoirs about his life. This life seemed very adventurous and glamorous. He met famous people like kings and other writers, but it's said that none of those memoirs are the truth, because he changed it a bit so he was depicted as a wealthy, rich man with an glamorous life. He spent a lot of money on parties, what means that he was known as wealthy man, but when he ran out of money he has to borrow some from a Swiss merchant. It's said that if he had really been very rich, he would not have needed to borrow money. That means that he was poor and changed that in his memoirs. In his memoirs it's said that he also had a conversation with a writer named Volitaire. Critics also said that this is also not the truth and also changed. In the last part of the text it's said that he was in jail in Italy. He escaped and said in his memoirs he broke out of the jail. Critics said that he had good connection to rich people in venice who could have brided to free him.
In the audience log all is a contra to the critic's statement. 
He was borrowing money, because he needs this money until he got his own money. In case of the conservation he wrote down what he remembered of the conversation night with Volitaire. In the last point he got out of jail not because of good connections. There where other prisoners who had much better connections and influence than Chevalier had and weren't able to get free for a cost. 
Those two are pro and cons for Chevalier writing memoirs about the truth or not.
