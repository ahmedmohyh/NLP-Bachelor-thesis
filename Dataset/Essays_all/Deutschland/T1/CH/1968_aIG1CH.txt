In the audio file the speaking person criticizes the opinion of many critics, that Chevalier lied in his memoirs and invented things to make his life seem more adventurous and fancier. 
Some critics claim that if Chevalier really had been rich, he wouldn't have had to ask the Swiss merchant for a loan. The speaker said he had have to because as a businessman you didn't always have money either and had to wait for it. During these times, you sometimes need to borrow money in order to maintain your usual lifestyle, such as gambling and partying, which Chevalier did.
Also, it is stated in the text that the conversations between the popular writer Voltaire and Chevalier weren't real, for he could never have remembered them that exactly over the time. In the audio file it says that Chevalier didn't write them for the first time in his memoir, but he had written them down the days they happened without publishing them.
Furthermore, the text reads that Chevalier hadn't escaped from prisonv through the ceiling the way he claimed to in his memoir, but the jailers had been told to set him free. The speaker said that the jail ceiling needed to be repaired after Chevalier left, so it couldn't be a lie.
