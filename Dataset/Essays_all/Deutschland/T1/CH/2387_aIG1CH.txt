The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1758, is nowadays a valuable historical source about the European society in the eighteenth century but some of the conflicts written in his memoir are now hardly critisized. First of all, the text says that Chevalier probably wasn´t rich because he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant, but Chevalier also could have waited for his earned money to arrive him. A good merchant would have to spend money first to get money back to become wealthy. So he probably needed money because he just spend a lot. 
Some critics don´t think Chevalier could write down the exactly phrases of his conservation with the famous writer Voltaire but well known sources say Chevalier wrote a lot of notes and kept them so he could write mostly correct conversations. Whether Chevalier really escaped the Venetian prison is also critisized. Some say that he paid his jailers to set him free, but reliable sources say that the ceiling of his cell had to be replaced after he had escaped. So the critics about the memoir of Chevalier are probably incorrect and the information of the memoir mostly reliable and trustwhorthy.
