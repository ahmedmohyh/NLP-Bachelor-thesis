The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir about his life and his adventures. In his life he met famous people, for example kings and writers. But also he must live with critic from other people. His memoir become a historical source about the European society in eighteenth century. The life of him seems very exciting and glamorous. But it was the opposite. It was said that he live in Switzerland and spent alot of money. So the Chevalier had been very rich. 
The people,who critics him, are skeptical about the conversations with famous people and writers. Because of that many people said,that the memoir isnt real and cannot possible. You can see it,because the memoir is written many years later after the conversations. Many years later it is impossible to remember the conversations and phrases of the famous people. The criticers also mean, that the claiming to the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make an hole in the ceiling und climbing through the roof isnt real.
