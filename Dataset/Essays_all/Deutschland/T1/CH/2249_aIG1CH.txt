In both parts- the text and the speech- are points about Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798. The text says that he visites many parties and events to make his live exiting and interresting, but the speech does not say anything about it.

Also Chevalier wrote his escape from a notorious prison in Venice, he escapes  by using metal to make a hole in the roof.

The first is that he spend much money on parties in Switzerland, but then he made a big deal. The secound one is that Chevalier had a conversation with Voltaire and after thid conversatuin he wrote down everything he rememberd, later again the used Voltaire`s phrases to write his memoir.
