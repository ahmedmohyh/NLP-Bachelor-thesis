In the following text I am goi ng to compare the statements from the text and the ones from the audio speech about the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798).
As I mentioned above both sources are about Chevalier de Seingalt who was a controversial figure and who wrote memoirs about his life. These memoirs have become a valuable source about Eurpean society in the 18th century. But, and here is the point that is also doubt in the speech, people started thinking about these memoirs not being completely true. So Seingalt might have just written thing a little bit different than they really were back during that time. In the text they mention that it is obvious that he made events seem more exciting than they really were.

It is for sure that especially the people in Switzerland spent a lot of time and money on gambling and parties back then, that is mentioned in both sources. But the fact if he was poor or rich at the point when he had to borrow money is not based on the same opinion. The speaker in the audio speech says that he for sure borrowed money, but that was because he had to wait for his money that he just made out of merchant deals and other things. So he basically was not poor - he just needed money during that time he was awaiting his own money. This is one point they are discussing about.
Another fact that they doubt in the speech is that he really escaped as it is being told. In his memoirs it says that he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. But, and that is what the speaker is saying, why did they have to repair the ceiling? It is said that they did so, but why would they have to do so, if he really escaped as it is being told.

As people can see there are a lot of points about the life and especially the memoirs of Seingalt you can discuss or argue about because they are not clear or just not trustworthy how they are being told to us today.
