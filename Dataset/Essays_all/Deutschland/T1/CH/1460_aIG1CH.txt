Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a long memoir about his life but a memoir could not be correct. The memoir is used as a historical source, in which he wrote all important thinks he could remember. Chevalier de Seingalt had paid a lot of money for partys and things like that. He wasn't a poor person but in the text is said that he had to borrow considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant. Critics point out that he can't wrote the exact conversations between him and other important people e. g. Voltaire. They didn't met but here it's said that they met and critics don't beleve that. He can only write things he remember. Some parts of the memoir couldn't be happend as he wrote it for example his escape from the Venetian prison. He had a lot of friends which have well-connections in Venice, they had help him out of the prison.
