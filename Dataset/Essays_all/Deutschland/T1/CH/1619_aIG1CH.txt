The Chevalier de Seingalt truly had an advantourus life, at least from how he describes it in his memoir, but some critics claim just those stories to be false, or at least inaccurate. 
In the text for example, their are critics about him borrowing money in switzerland, even though he claimed to be rich. But just because he is rich doesn't mean he doesn't need a loan, especially if he is spending a lot of money on parties and gambling. In the presentation, they argued that in order to borrow money from someone, you need to have some assets that you can show the merchant in order to get a credit, which means that the Chevalier at least must have had some kind of assets.

Another account from Chevalier's memoir, that he escaped from a prison in Venice by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling, and leaving through the roof, is very questionable. Especially because the Chevalier had some high-ranked officials as friends there, that could have helped him escape. Again, the presentation had some arguments that would support the Chevalier's claim to have escaped in that movie-like fashion. Some official documents that were found in Venice, are proof that just shortly after his escape the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired. That is a quite strong support for his claim.

Last but not least, there is criticism about how he should be able to remember the whole conversation he once had with famous writer Voltaire, even though his memoir had been written many years later. But there is also a counter-claim for that. Chevalier's friends reportedly say that he took notes every evening, with pieces of conversation he could still remember. And he kept all those notes for years, until eventually writing his memoir.
