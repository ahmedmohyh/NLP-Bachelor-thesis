The Chevalier de Seingalt who lived from 1725 to 1798 and who met many famous people like kings and famous writers wrote a memoir. In the presentation that I heard there were named many points which are the same like in the text. Critics have raised about the truth of the memoir. He invented some facts about his life to let it sound interesting. These points are also named int he speech
For example: He wrote that he lived in switzerland and often visited parties and gamblings. He also recorded a conversation between him and the writer Voltaire. He wrote down everything he remembered which is really criticised because it is impossible to write down every single sentence. 
He also has written that he escaped from a prison in Venice in Italy. These points also were given in the presentation
Many readers claimed that fact because they think that he invented all the facts to let his memoir sound very interesting and special. And that sounded not good in the ears of the criticers.
He used - like its given in the text - an metal to climb through  the roof. Criticers say that he had some politically friends in Venice who offered him the escape. That was also named in the speech.
He said that he was rich but he needed to borrow money that really sounds strange in the ears of the cricticers.
These aspects are named in the text and also are given in the speech I listened to.
