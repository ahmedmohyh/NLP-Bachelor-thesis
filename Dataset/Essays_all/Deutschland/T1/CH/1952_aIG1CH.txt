In his book the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote about the adventures, which happend in his life. Critics are not agree with some of his storys: In the book Chevalier said he met famous people and gets very rich by spending money in parties in Switzerland. The critics are not agree with this statement. Later 
in the book he said  that he have to borrow money but why he have to borrow money when he was famous and rich?
Thats one of a few aspects that maybe aren't right.
Another statement is his prison escape: In his book he wrote about a piece of metal which he used to make a hole into the celling. Critics are convinced that this isn't right. Chevalier got help from his jailers to become free.
