In the folloing text I write something to Chevalier de Seingalt.
He was born 1725 and he died 1798. He was an interessting peolple, because he wrote a very long memorie about his life. But in his memory every was more interessting and glamorous than it's really was. But it's also a very important memorie for european and for the society, because he met kings and writer. Some critics say that the memorie are not good. for example he wrote that he borrow money from a swiss merchant, but the critics say that he was very rich so he doesn't must borrow money.
Finally I think Chevalier de seingalt is very important for europeans history, because with his memorie we find very interesting thing abute important people in european out. But we never find out what is real from his memorie and what is wrong.
