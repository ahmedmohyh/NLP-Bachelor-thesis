The woman in the recording is trying to arguee against the critics of the Cheavalier de Seingalt in three points.
The first point is that critics are saying he can not be rich beacause he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. But the woman in the recording was saying that it is normal to wait for money from the merchant because he was spending a lot to have a lot of partys and to do gambling.
The secound point is that the Chevalier was not talking with Voltaire because his memoir about the conversation was written many years after the coversation. On the other hand the woman said that the Chevalier was only writting down everything he remembered about the conversation.
The last point is that critics say that his escape out of the Venetian prison by using a piece of metal to make a hole is fake. They think that his politically well- connected friends helped him to get out. The woman said that it is possible that he was making a hole because there are documents about a repair of his ceiling and this repair was after he escaped.
