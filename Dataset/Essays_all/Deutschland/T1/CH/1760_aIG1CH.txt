The Chevalier is a person who had some very controversial stories. For example when the Chevalier lived in Switzerland, he spent much money on parties and gambling because he was very rich but then he borrowed much money from a merchant. Critics mean that this can't be real because when you are rich you don't have to borrow money. But he only did that because he had to wait for his money to come to Switzerland and he didnt want to wait. Critics also say that the conversation between him and Voltaire could not be real because of the long time which had passed after they were written down. But other people say that he just wrote down what remembered of the conversation and that the main information would be given. When the Chevalier escaped from the prison in Italy, he wrote down he did it in a very unusual way and that critics mean that this kind of escape could never be real. Escaping by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling is too unrealistic for them. But prison records show that they had to repair exactly the room where the Chevalier was imprisoned only some time after he escaped. So that can be true aswell.
