The first argument named in the speech is about the fact that the Chevalier claimed in his memoir about beeing very rich during the time in which he lived in Switzerland. The money was spent for parties and gambling, he borrowed it from a Swiss merchant. In the speech they say that this can not be true since he had to borrow money pretty often and had not any money while waiting for it to arrive. In his memoir, it is also reported that the Chevalier met Voltaire but these conversaitons could not get captured because the memoir was written a long time after these conversations. In comparison to that in the speech is said that the Chevalier kept notes of the conversation which means that these notes had to dissapear or the writer of the text was wrong. The last part of the text is about the escape of the Chevalier from his prison cell in Italy. The author of the text also tells the reader what the Chevalier needed to had help of some of his friends. In the speech they disagree with this because a seeling in his room had to be replaced and he did nit take this chance
