Essay Chavalier

The woman talked about the Chavalier (1725-1798) in her presentation and his memoir, which claims to recount his life and adventures. Other as the text did, she is okay, that the Chavalier claims to be a rich man. It is no reason to be poor just because he had to borrow money from a swiss bank. Also she beliefs that he wrote down everything correctly, because he wrote down everything immidatly after a conversation took place and not years after. At the end of her presentation, she points out that it has nothing to do with political range to escape a prison. There were many guys before the Chavalier, who did not made an escape possible even when they had good or better connections then him.

All in all it is to say, that the woman in her speech has another or even the opposite opinion as the writer of the text.
