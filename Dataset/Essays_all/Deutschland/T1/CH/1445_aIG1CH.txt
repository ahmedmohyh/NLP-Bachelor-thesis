In the text it is said that the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote some controversial things in his memoir. Only for making his life to seem more interesing, exiting and glamorius than it was. It is known that he had lived in switzeland and that he lived very wealthy and that he spend a lot of moey for parties und gambling. In the text it is said that it is controvercial that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. But it is simple to explain why he had to borrow money, because of his abouse of spending money on parties etc. he ran out of cash so he had to borrow some. That does not mean that he was poor, it only means that he borrowed some money. Also the relation between the Chevalier and the writer is mentionet in the text, it is said that have never met eachother and it is impossible to write the meoir of somebody you have never met. But they have met each other a long time ago each evening and the writer always writes everything that he had learned imeadiatly in the evening in his book.
It is also a kind of controvercial that he was able to escape from the prison in venice, beauce many more with more influrence have tried and failed.
As he said he escaped by climbing over the roof but it is clear that hir sealing was broken after he escaped. But how could the sealing was broken if he escaped over the roof as he said. So it is not that accruate in both ways...
