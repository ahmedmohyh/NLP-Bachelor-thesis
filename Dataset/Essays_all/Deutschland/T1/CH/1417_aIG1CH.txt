It is questioned wether the memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt are true or just exaggerated to please the reader. The top three questionable topics are his wealth, the accuracy of his conversations with Voltaire and his escape from the venice prison. 
While some say the money he spend on all his partying and gambling was borrowed from a Swiss merchant because he didn't have that much money himself, others say the amount of money he borrowed he did have in assets so he had to sell those first to get the money and while those got sold he borrowed the money to pay for his partying and gambling.
His memoir was written long after his conversation with Voltaire and no one can remember a whole conversation for so long, so it's said that most of it was made up. Although it could have been possible for him to have taken notes on which he based the conversation in his memoirs on.
Escaping a prison through the roof seems like an exciting thing but to some critics unlikely to happen, especially when you have someone to bribe you free, but on the other hand there were other people who knew even more powerfull people and even they could not get bribed free.
