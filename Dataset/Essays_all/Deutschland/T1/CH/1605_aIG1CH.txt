In the presentation I have just listened to the speaker tells the audience her opinion about the Chavalier and she does not agree with the text at all: First she says that the majority of the existing memoirs have been written less accurate than Chevalier's biography and she referred to the examples that are given in the text.
 At first the speaker talks about his financial situation and contradicts to the text. In her eyes Chevalier wasn't poor, he just got money for his property and for the time the new owner haven't paid he had to borrow some money but instead of his poverty that was only his economical strategy to earn money.
 Also Chevalier didn't lie about his meetings and conversations with Voltaire because he had old notes of these conversations in his house that prove that the two men met.
 But the main argument that the speaker presented was his escape from the Italian prison: The author of the text describesChevalier as a man who only escaped because of the influence of his rich and mighty friends. But the speaker contradicts again and gives two main arguments that support her point of view: On the one hand the ceiling of Chevalier's cell had to be repaired after his escape and on the other hand other prisoners whose friends were more powerful and well-known than Chevalier's weren't escaped. These both arguments support the speakers opinion about his time in prison.
