In the presentation were some arguments against the critics of the memoire from the Chevalier.

 The person said that on one side its right that not everything the Chevalier wrote would have been true, but the most things. It is a reliable source.

 She said that for example the Chevalier could not have been able to write everything from his conversations with Voltaire in his memoire, because he just had notes from years ago, which he used te reconstruate the conversations.

 About the critic that the Chevalier was poor during he lived in Switzerland, the person said, that maybe the chevalier just had first to convert his things into money, so he had to wait for the money. She said that waiting for your money isn't the same thing as to be poor. 

There were also a critic, that it was a liar from the Chevalier, that he escaped on his own from a prison in Venice, because we know that he had many powerful friends in Venice, which probably just helped him, to come out. The person said about that, that some of the other inprisoners also had some powerful friends, but they stayed in the prison.

 Also we know, that the ceiling, from the room the Chevalier were in, during his time in the prison, had to be repaired. So why would they had to repair the ceiling, if he just came out of the prison, because he had the help of some friends?
