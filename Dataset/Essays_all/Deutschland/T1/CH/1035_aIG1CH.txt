The controversial figure, Chevalier de Seingalt, experienced lots of adventures and met plenty of famous people, such as writers, kings and philiosophers, thus making him a famous person whose adventures, written down in his memoires, make a good source regarding European life and society in the eighteenth century. However, his experiences in his memoires are to be looked sceptial and critical upon, since there are many aspects about them that couldn't have happened the way he claimed they did.
His adventures include his life in Switzerland, during which he claimed he had been very wealthy and enjoyed his life by gambling and partying. What's contradictory about this story is that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant, which he wouldn't have been in need of if he was as rich as he stated.
Furthermore the Chevalier describes his conversations with the famous French philosopher Voltair. Eventhough it isn't doubted that they did meet, it's highly unlikely that de Seingalt was able to remember the conversatiosn he had with Voltair such a long time after they met.
Another adventure he tells us about was his prison break from the Venetian prison. Critics say it couldn't have happened the way de Seingalt describes it, but according to some sources the ceiling of his prison cell had to be repaired after he supposedly escaped, and since it wouldn't have had to be repaired if he didn't escape using a small metal part, we can believe him in that regard.
