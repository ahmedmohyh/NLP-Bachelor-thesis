In the following text I am going to point out pro and contra agruments for the memoir of Chevalier. 

Chevalier`s memoir was often critizised by others. Reasons for that were some facts and adventures which could not happen in that way. The first example which is given, is that he could not have been a wealthy man, if he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. Resulting from the fact that you have to spend money before you can earn money it is not impossible, that he was rich.
Another argument, was that he wrote down a conervsation between him and another famous person. Everybods knows it is hard to remember each detail of a conversation, but he was a man who wrote down notes afterwards.
The last point was that he escaped from a prison just by using a piece of metal. Might sound unrealistic but after his escape the room had to be repared. Finally we no that each memoir is changed a bit just to make it more interesting.
