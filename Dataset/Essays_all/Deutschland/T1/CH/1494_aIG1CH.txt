The woman said that Chevalier's memoir were pretty accurate. Of course there are always points and details where the authour was not honest. But this is not rare. First of all, it is possible that he borrowed money even though he was riche. The text said that somebody who is rich does not have to borrow money. In Switzerland people spend a lot of money on parties and gambling, so maybe after a party there was no money anymore on his bank account. And while he was waiting for new money from work, he had to borrow some. Many people do this in Switzerland.
Another argument against the accuracy is that he could not remember the exact phrases somebody said to him a few years ago. It is also possible that he remembered special statements said by Voltaire. He was a famous person and if he said something really important, nobody, that is interested in this writer, would forget that. Chevalier also took notes that he used while working on his memoir. 
The story about the prisonescape did not seem to be true. The accuracy of the story how he escaped is very low. Who is that strong that he can make a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal? But after his escape the prison had to repair his ceiling because it was distroyed in some ways. It is rather inaccurate that he bribed his jailer to set him free, because many other prisoners had way better contacts than him and they had not had the chance to escape.
So there are a lot of information that are not mentioned in the text, but they are very important to form a discussion about the accuracy about Chevalier's memoir.
