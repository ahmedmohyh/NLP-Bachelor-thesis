Though some experts really criticese the memoires of Chavelier de Seingalt (1725-1798) there are also experts refusing the arguments of the critics. The reliability of Chavelier's memoires however depends on how waterproof the evidents for his stories are.
For example he mentions being a very wealthy man the years he lived in Switzerland though critics refer to the evidents of him borrowing money from a swiss merchant. The woman in the audible presentation said that he had spent lots of his money so that he had to borrow some money from the swiss merchant because borrowing money is no evidence of being poor.
Some critis say that not one could remember every detail of a conversation dozens of years after it but the woman refers to the notes she said he had made just the night after the conversations with voltaire. By holding this pieces together he was years after it able to remember and to write down what they had been talking about.
There are lots of critics who do not believe in his escape from a jail in venice but the woman in the presentation refused this argument in mentioning an old document from the city of venice that tells us that his room had to been tide up after he had been escaped. She also points out that there even more persons of wealth in the jail who also had friends of wealth but had not been bribed out either.
