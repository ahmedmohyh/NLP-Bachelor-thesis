Chevalier

The first argument the woman told us was that the Chevalier was not poor at all because he had a lot og things he could sell but it took its time to sell these things so he had to borrow money. Furthermore she said that his conversation with Voltaire was pretty accurate for the reason that he wrote it down immidiately after having had this conversation. His friend could approve that this was a fact because the Chevalier always does it like that when he wants to put a conversation in his memoir. The last point was about his prison break and that he escaped by digging a hole with a piece of metal. He did this because he was not able to get bribed free by his politically well-connected friends for the reason that there wer men in the prison with even more well-connected friend who were not able to get bribed free. Another point to approve that was that they had to repair the ceiling of his room after he had escaped. 
These statements are all controversial to what the text tells us because in this text it is mentioned that the Chavelier was poor, his conversation with Voltaire was not written down accurate and he get bribed free by his well-connected friends. So the woman seems to destroy every argument the text mentioned to tell us that the Chavelier invented or distorted his memoir.
