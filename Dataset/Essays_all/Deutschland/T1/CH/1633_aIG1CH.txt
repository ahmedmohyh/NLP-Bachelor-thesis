The given text about the reliability of the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) brings arguments to pass that clearly speak against or at least thoroughly question said reliability of said memoir in certain passages.
It is doubted that his life was as "exciting and glamorous" as the Chevalier described it in his memoir. 
As evidence has now proven, he was not as wealthy living in Switzerland as he always claimed to be, as he had to lend large quantities of money from a Swiss merchant to finance his gambling and the parties.
In the argumentation of the presentation given beforehand, the explanation for this occurance is simply that his kind of wealth did include a longer wait for his money to arrive, so in the mean time he had to borrow money for financial reasons, which he could repay later when his owed money arrived.
However, it is also questionable that his great escape from the Venetian prison actually happened the way the Chevalier later described it; that one of his politically involved friends offered a bribe appears to be more likely an explanation. Countered is this by the presentation's argument that later on, after Chevalier's escape, papers turned up that concluded that a reparation of the ceiling was needed, which indicates that his escape did go as planned, as there would not have been the need for reparation otherwise.
Also, more politically involved prisoners could not bribe their way out, so that he would be able to do it was very unlikely.
The text given also doubted the exaggerations or fake entries in the memoir, as it was written years later. However, this argument is not valid, as the Chevalier himself stated that he wrote down notes about everything he could remember of the day to include in his memoir.
