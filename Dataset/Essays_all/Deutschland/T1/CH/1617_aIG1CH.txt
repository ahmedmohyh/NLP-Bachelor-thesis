In the presentation many arguments were shown that speak against the text. The text says that the Chevalier was poor because he had to borrow money from rich people for example a Swiss merchant. In the presentation it says that the Chevalier de Seingalt could'nt be poor and that he was rich. Eventough he sometimes had no money. They said that it needed time to get the money, but that he was rich. They also said that it is possible for him to know what he talked about with Voltaire. He could have made notices during the conversation with the exact words and sentences. So it is possible to remember the things and rewrite it very accurate. Eventough the text said that it isn't possible to remember it. In the presentation they also mentioned that it is possible that the Chevalier escaped out of the prison out of the ceiling with a piece of metal. Because a little time after that the prison announced that they had to repair the ceiling from one cell and that is a very important fact, but in the text it says that friends of him helped him to escape, because they were also very rich. The presentation argumented that there were people in the prison who were much more rich then he was and nobody helped them. The most important argument from the text was that he wrote such things because he wanted the people to enjoy his book. The presentation is agsinst i
