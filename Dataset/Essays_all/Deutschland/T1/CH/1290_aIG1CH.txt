The text is about the adventures of the Chevalier de Seingalt in this life, who has written a long memoir.
First, the speaker has talked about the parties in Switzerland, the Chevalier spent a lot of money for. She explained, that the Chevalier was poor and had to borrow much money. So it wasn't possible for him to spent a lot of it on big parties. 
After this, the speaker said a few words about the conversations, the Chevalier had with the famous writer Voltaire. Critics said, that the Chevalier has written down the topics of the conversations after many years, but the speaker said, that he has written down all he could remember of the conversations in the night they talked.
The last topic was the escape from a prison in Venice. The speaker said, the prison room where the Chevalier was should be repaired. So it was easy for the Chevalier to escape from the prison.
So in a few points the speaker and critics haven't got the same meaning.
