Chevalier de Seingalt was a man, who wrote a memoir abut his life. He met many famous people and told from all this adventures. Some people say that Seingehalt  lied when he tells about his life and that not all can be true, but in the text it says that there is no doupt he met famous people like Voltaire. But he told his adventures in a exeggerated form.
Also when you come in another land you don´t have got money from the beginning so you have to borrow something, even if you are not poor. Here it says that Seingehalt wasn´t rich and he lied here too because if you are rich you don´t have to borrow something.
When Seingehalt was in prison in Venice he escape from there. First that seems to be very difficult, but when you are in the high society you know many people, who can help you. In his memoir he said that he escape only with the help of a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. In this case he exeggerated too, to make his life more exciting. 
You can say that he told many lies and that is not mention enough in the text even if many people talk about that.
