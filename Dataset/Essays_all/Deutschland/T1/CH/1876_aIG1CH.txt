The text about the  Chevalier de Seingalt who lived from 1725 to 1798, doubts that his great advantures happended the way he wrote it down in his memoir. A woman, who had a speech about the Chevalier explaines why things actually can be possible to have happened the way it is said in the memoir
His first story says that he had been a rich man while living in Switzerland, even though he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. The author of the text thinks, that someone who is in the need of borrowing money can´t have been rich. The woman who talked about the Chevalier thinks about it differently. In her opinion having to lend money because your own hasn´t arrived yet doesn´t mean being poor. 
The second story tells about a conversation the Chevalier had with the famous writer Voltaire some years before he started writing down his memoir. 
Because of the years between the real conversation and the writing of his memoir, the author doubts the accuracy of their exact words. He says that no one doubts they have met but the memoir can´t possibly capture it accuratly. In contrast to that, the woman has a simple explanation which shows that it is possible to write down a conversation from some years ago: she says he must have taken notes after their talk.
