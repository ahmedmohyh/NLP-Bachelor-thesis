The speech explains why the arguments and the criticism in the text are wrong. 

The texts says that the Chevalier had to borrow money because he was poor but that is wrong because it took a few days until he gets new money in Switzerland and he only had to borrow money for the few days until his moneys comes.

Critics also complain that it´s impossible that the Chevalier remembers every single word from him and Voltaire when he wrote his book years ago. In the speech it´s explained that the Chevalier wrote down what they said every night after they conserved and used this to write his book.

At last the text says that the Chevalier didn´t escaped from the Venetian prison without help because it´s more likely that his powerful friends helped him. The speech explains that their were other prisinors with more powerful friends who can´t escape. Also there is a report from the Venetian prison that they had to exchange the ceiling after the Chevalier´s escape. This proofs that his book is right. He used a piece of metal and made a hole in the ceiling.
