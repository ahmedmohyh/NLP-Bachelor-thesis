The Chevalier's memoir can be questioned in some points. Critics pointed out that he couldn't have been as rich as he claimed, since he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. Another point is his conversation with Voltaire to which the Chevalier referres in his memoir. While there is no doubt about their meeting happening at all, it was many years before the memoir was written, so the Chevalier's claims about it's content is questionable. Also to be mentioned are his claims about escaping from the Venetian prison. Critics point out that he was probably just bought out by his powerful friends.

The speaker now answers to these three points. For example she says that, while the Chevalier may have borrowed some Money, that means he had money, after he borrowed it. Therefore, he was able to live a good life with it. About the conversation with Voltaire, she claims that the Chevalier probably just made notes during the meeting, as he was known to do several other times. And to the last point, the Venetian prison, she argues that there were many people with even more powerful allies in there, so it can't be claimed that the Chevalier was just bought out, when all the others weren't. Also, there is evidence that the roof in that prison hat to be repaired at the time the Chevalier escaped. In his memoir he claims to have done exactly that: fleeing through the roof, so history is on his side there, too.
