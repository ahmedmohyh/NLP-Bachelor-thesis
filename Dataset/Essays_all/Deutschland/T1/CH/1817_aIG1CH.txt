The Chevalier has become a valuable source about the eighteenth century, but are all his stories true? 
In the text he is presented as a man that thought of the most of his life events without mentioning the truth. For example he has borrowed a lot of money in switzerland, allthough he claims that he has been wealthy in that time. Sadly I couldn`t understand anything from the audio, so I can just guess, that he has most definitely been presented in a better way. That shows how different historical figures are presented in todays world. In addition it may be possible, that he`s beeing presented in a better way, to make us believe certain aspects of the history, that didn`t really happen. 



                              Today Trump was elected president. LOL ;)
