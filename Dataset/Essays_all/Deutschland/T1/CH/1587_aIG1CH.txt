The chavalier had many critics after writing his memoir. The things he wrote seem to be wrong ore invented.
In his memoir he tells about his time in switzerland where he gave a lot of money for parties and gambling. For this he needed money he did not have, critics say. So he would have borrowed it. The same is said in the text. Then it says, the Chavalier had many notes for giving back the conversations with Voltaire. In the text the critics critizise that he can not remember the phrases so it has to be invented. Also his escape from the prison seems not really believable. Other, more powerful, prisoners did not ever escaped from the prison. So how could he? Also the critics in the text do not believe this story and think that the jailers could be paid. Politically well-connected friends could have helped him with it.
