The text is about the Chevalier the Seingalt, who was a glamorous and exciting figure, because of many famous people, he met. His memoir was an important part of European societyin the eighteenth century.The Chevalier was very rich and wealthy and he spent a lot of money in parties or gambling. But there is a lot of critic, because the Chevalier had to borrow money, maybe because of the debts that he made. An other critical point was the accuracy of conversation between himself and a writer called Voltaire. The memoir is not able to get all these conversations between them, because it was written down many years later. Because of that, some information about the conversation could be changed or they did not know, how to write down the conversation exactly. There is an other critical point that tells about the prision in Venice, where he had to escape , because of making a hole in the ceiling. But the jailers of Chevalier wanted to free him out of the prison, so they make out that the Chevalier had a lot of politically friends in Venice , which could helm them to free him out of the prison.
