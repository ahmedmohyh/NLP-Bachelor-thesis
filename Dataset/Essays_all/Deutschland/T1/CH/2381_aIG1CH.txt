The first controversy the text is talking about is the fact the memoir says the Chevalier was rich, but also had to borrow money. He was wealthy or rich and made big partys, he never would be able to make with borrought money. It just needed some time for his essays to provide money, so he had to borrow some  to be able to live his livestyle untill he gets new money.
    The second controversy of the memoire describes a controversy he had with the famous writer Voltaire. Some critics say its basicly impossible to quote the original words said by Voltaire after such a long time, but in fact he wrote everything he could remember down after they had conversed everytime. People who were close to him confirmed that he wrote everything of a conversation with a famous person down in case he would need them later on.
    The last and most contoversy point is his escape out of an italian prison. The memoire says he used a piece of metall to make a hole in the ceiling and then climbed on the roof to escape. This seems to be a bit unreal for some critics, who also say the Chevalier had some politicly well-connected friends in Venice who could have offered a dribe, but there are some old documents which confirm a hole in the ceiling that had to be repaired. There were also prisoners with way better connections to political life in Venice, but non of them came free using them.
