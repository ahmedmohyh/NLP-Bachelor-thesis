The main difference between the text and the presentation ist that the presentation is very pro the Chevalier and the text doesn´t believe his stories. In the presentation the woman says that the Chevalier would have gained a lot of money in Switzerland. In the text they say that he just borrowed that money. The presentation says that the Chevalier met Voltaire. The text says that critics are sure that nobody could remember exact phrases of a conversation hold many years before. So, the Chevalier has to have imagined those talks to Voltaire. Another point is that he escaped from the prison. Critics are sure that there was no escape adventure. He just became free because of his political connections. The presentation is sure that he really escaped. 
At all, the presentation believes the Chevalier´s memoirs but the text doesn´t.
