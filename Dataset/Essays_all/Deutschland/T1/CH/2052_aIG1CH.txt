The Arguments in the listening part said something about Chevalier de Seingalt who didn`t was so rich like the text is telling about him. He had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant and hadn`t so much friends like in the text. So the audience (Vortrag?) is not only against the text but the good things which the text said about Chevalier are wrong in the opinion of the listening part. Also the audience accepted the critics between the money and Chevaliers life and his parties and the money which he borrows.
