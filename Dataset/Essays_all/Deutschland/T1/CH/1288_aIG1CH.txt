The Chevalier wrote towards the end of his life a questionable memoir, where he claims he threw parties and was wealthy in Switzerland, had accurately conversations with the famous Voltaire and escaped from a prison in Italy. But some people are doubtful against his memoir and say that he was poor in Switzerland and couldn´t throw parties and things like that, they claim, that the Chevalier wanted to make his life exiciting and wrote lies in his memoir. they say that the conversations with Voltaire can´t be accurately, because it was years ago and he didn´t remember correctly, they also say that the Chevalier didn´t escape from prison, but was freed by the jailers. They think that he is a big liar and not to be trusted, but some other people found evidence that they are wrong.
The people in the listening, said that he wasn´t poor, but had to wait for his money, so every time he had to wait for the arrive of his money, he had to borrow a little bit and then return it. So he had money, but just had to wait for it. The incident with Voltaire is also true, they say, because his family saw the Chevalier write every conversation with Voltaire down, so he wouldn´t forget it and that he had these writing by hand when he wrote his memoir. Most of the people    didn´t think that the escape from the prison was a real event, but the people in the listening, proved that they are wrong. They found venician documents from a jailer that said, that not long after the Chevaliers escape, the ceiling had to be repaired, and why would it has to be repaired if he didn´t broke it while fleeing from the prison?
The thing that were said in the listening were the proof that the Chevalier weren´t lying and the text said he was indeed lying. To fully understand the text or the listening you have to know both.
