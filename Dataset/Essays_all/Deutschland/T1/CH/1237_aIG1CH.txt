The first argument which can be heard in the presentation regarding the wealth of the Chevalier, is that the Chevalier was in fact a rich man, but as 
his riches were stored in deposits which were unreachable at the time he was in switzerland, he borrowed some money by a local merchant. This contradicts the assumption of the Chevalier beeing poor. Also, the woman in the presentation brings up the fact that the Chevalier took notes while having conversations 
with Voltaire. While it may be true that exact quotes can not be remembered after years, the text does not deal with the possibility of existing notes. 
Moving on to how the Chevalier could escape venetian custody, it is presented that it is highely likely that the Chevalier broke free, as government texts 
speak of repairing measures in the Chevalier´s cell, shortly after his escape. In addition to that, bribery is very unlikely because other prisoners who had 
even more influential friends than the Chevalier, have not been able to bribe any guards.
