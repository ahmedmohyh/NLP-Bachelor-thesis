First the Critcs said that the Chevalier was poor, because he borrowed money for him self. The Argument in the speech was that he had to exchange his money to earn the money of the Swiss. That trade took some time so he had to borrow sums of money from a Swiss merchant.But that was not because he was poor, he just neede some money until the trade was successfully and he gets his own.The second point was that he cannot capture these conservations with Voltaire accurately, because it was written many yeears after the conversations occurred. The argument against that is that the Chevalier capture that conversation by writing it done.An other point is that the also had a converstion in written form, especially with letters, that is why he could remember so well.The last point of the Critics was the story in the prison. They said that the Chevalier escaped with the help of the other jailers, e.g. they were bribed to free him because he had some politically well-connected friends in Venice how could offered  a bribe. The point in the speech was that the other prisoners had even more politically well-connected friends who could offered a bribe. But they could not escape like the Chevalier did, so the escape by using a piece of metal to make o hole on the ceiling and climbing throug the roof must be true.
