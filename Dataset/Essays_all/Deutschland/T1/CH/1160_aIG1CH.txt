Chevalier de Seingalts memoir is actually pretty reliable, but critics say something else. In his memoir he talks about his life, adventures and all the famous people he met, like kings or famous writers. For example his lifetime in switzerland as the critics claim that Chevalier was not that rich as he says he was in his memoir. They say that he often needed to borrow big sums of money to celebrate all those big partys. But to borrow money doesn`t mean that somebody is poor, spo that is not really an accuarte argument. 
Second of all critics also claim that hois quotes he wrote in his memoir from voltair wouldn`t be real quotes froim voltaire because aftere all those years you can not be able to remember each and every word a person has told you years ago. At this point you need to say that Chevalier used to wrote down what he remembered from the converasations with the famous writer Voltaire  each night before going to bed. Looking at this point it seems possible that he may kept all those quotes and wrote them, down later in his memoir. 
The third big point that critics have also questioned is his escape of a prison in Venice, Italy. `` It makes it more enjoyable reading.`` as they say. But if all this is again not true, why was the same prison in Venice forced to prepair the ceeling of his cell ? Due to this information his memoir seems actuially really reliable.
