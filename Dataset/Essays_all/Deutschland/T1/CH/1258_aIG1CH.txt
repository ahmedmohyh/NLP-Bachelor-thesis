Some people don't believe that his memoire is really like his life has happend. On some points people say that his memoire were full of lies because when he met famous people they were writing about their conversations.
In his memoire the Chevalier has written that he was very wealthy and that he spent a great deal of money for parties and gambling. The text says also that he had to borrow money so that he couldn't have much money on himself. The audio told about other situations like he borrowed money because his money weren't avaible yet. Critics also doubt that the conversations between him and Voltaire weren't written down as they were in reality but also point out that is impossible to remember exact phrases from conersations which were held a long time ago, while the audio said that they could be a lie from the Chevalier because Voltaire were able to write so he has written down the real conversations. 
They also doubt the fact of the Chevalier escape out of the prison in Venice, because it could be a impossible thing to make a hole in the ceiling only with a piece of metal. The text point out that the Chevalier got help from friends who could have offered a bribe so he had a easily way out of prison and that his lie in his memoire were only to make his life more exciting. The audio told about the same thing.
