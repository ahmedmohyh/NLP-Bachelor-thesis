The fact that the Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about every conversation can't capture these conversations is wrong because he wrotes everything in his memoir every night of the conversations he could remember. He lived in Switzerland and was very wealthy but when he was there he had to borrow money first from a merchant because he had to wait for his money to arrive. It is true that the Chevalier spend much money on parties and gambling. Also he was well known and had good connections like to kings and writers. Like the writer Voltaire he talked an also wrote everygthing down he rememberd at the evening in his memoir. The escape of the Chevalier weren't because of politically well-connected friends in Venice the Chevalier escaped but of some friends in prison. 
To sum it up the critics are right but in some facts there are some more information which makes it clearlier.
