First the teacher in the lecture says, that Chevalier was wealthy but didn't had money. He owned things and sold them, but it took time to sell these things, so he borrowed money from a merchant while he was selling something. The text states, that borrowing money from a person is not a sign of wealth but the teacher arguments, that wealth is not defined as owning money, but owning expensive things. Second the teacher argues, that Chevalier used notes to write his memoir, but the text says that the memoir is not correct because he distorted or invented events in order to make his moemoir more interesting to read. Third the teaches says that other prisoners in Venice had more powerful friends but didn't escape and that the ceiling of Chevalier's cell was repaired shortly after he escaped. The text states that he probaly escaped because he had powerful friends, who had paid the jailors, but Chevalier wrote in his memoir that he escaped with a piece of metal that he used to make a hole in the ceiling.
