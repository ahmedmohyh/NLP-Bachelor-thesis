The red text said that it is not clear if the memoire of the Chevalier is accourat and that the Chevaliere invented some things so iot would be more exiting than it was.The text said that he was wealthy in Switzerland but he spent much Money on gambling and parties. The heard text explaind it that you have to have some money to gamble and after ha sold some things he had to wait untill he gets the money for the sold things and to get some money to continue gambling he had to borrow some from a mearchent.Another example the read text gives is the memoire of the conversation between him and Voltaire . He wrote it long time after he met him down and so it is not possible that he could remember every little thing he talked about. The heard text exolains this too. It said that he made some notes tghe evening after he talked with Voltaire and kept these notes and used them to write this passage in his Memoire.The last point of the read text is his short life and his way out of it. The text saiud that it is impossible that he could have got out there alone because e had some very influental friends i n town and they have had to help him. The heard text tells us that the other prissoners had much more influental friends but they did not get out of there and that an old text says that the roof of his cabine had to be repaired, after he got out. So as you see the read text thinks that he is a lyer and the heard text thinks that he tells the trouth.
