In the presentation, the woman points out that most memoirs are pretty acurate and so is also the Chevalier's one, even though there were many people to doubt this, so she tries to prove them wrong.
She tries to explain the fact that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant by mentioning that he indeed was rich, but he also sometimes had to wait for his money to arrive, so that he needed some cash from a merchant to organize his parties and gamblings, but he wasn't poor as some critics stated.
The second point critics had made, namely that it is impossible to be able to write everything out of a conversation down that occurred some years ago, she encounters with reports of some of his friends that he took notices after any of these conversations with Voltaire.
In order to prove the critic about the third episode out of his life wrong, she states on the one hand that some of the other prisoners at that time had more powerful connections that make briberies in their cases seem more likely. On the other hand, she argues with the fact that there are reports that prove the necessity of the reparation of Chevalier's cell's ceiling
