Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) was an valuable historical source in the 18th century for themes of the european society. He mets many famous people and writes down the conversations afterwards in notes down. On the basement of this notes he wrotes an memoir, which recounts his life and adventures.
After he had published his memoir, there were many critizens, which raised doubts about the accurancys of his memoir. They say that he invented many facts to make his life story even more interersting. 
In his memoir Cheavlier de Seingalt is very wealthy and spends a lot of money on parties and gambling. But evidences hat surfaced that he borrowed big sums of money from a Swiss mechant. He also get's critizised for his conservations, because he wrotes them down after many years. Chevalier also escapes from a prison in Venice (Itlay). In his memoir he said, that he breaks out by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the roof of his cell. But it is historical surfaced, that he has a political well-connected friends in venice, which bribed him out of the jail. 

All in all i think, you can surface his memoir in a few points but it's obviously that he invented a few details, to make his life story more interesting.
