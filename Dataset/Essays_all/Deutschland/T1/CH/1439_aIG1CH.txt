In the presentation it is talked about the Chevalier de Seingalt who wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures.
Three main ponits were explained and talked about, as there are some unclear aspects.
 
It is known that the Chevalier was very rich and spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. However, in the presentation it is mentioned that he wasn't broke at all although he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. This is a cause of his duty spending the money for image uses.

Secondly, the Chevalier kept a journal to keep his most impartant memories and thoughts.
He wrote them in a journal which he kept to himself. 

Lastly, he was suspected to being escaped from a notorious prison in Venice. In the presentation it is mentioned that in the prison there were many other prisoners with even more powerful friend and could have esaped rather than the Chevalier. But it is also known that the ceiling needed to be fixed afterwards. This means there is more of a possibility that he escpaed by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling to climb through the roof.
It is more likely that he escaped by himself than others helping him because of the named proof.
