In the lecture about Chevalier de Seingalts the woman talks about Chevaliers memoir and its accuracy.
For example in his memoir he says that he was very wealthy. But its also a common fact, that he spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. Critics claim that evidence has recently surfaced that he also borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. Why would he have to do that if he was as wealthy as he writes he was? But considering the many parties he spent his money on, it was possible that while he was waiting for more money to arrive that he had to borrow some. 
Some critics also say that the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire is not accurate. But sources say Chevalier often consulted notes or his journal while writing and that he wrote down the conversation as accurate as he possibly could.
The last thing that was questioned was Chevaliers escape from a prison in Venice. In his memoir he says he escaped through the ceiling, but many believe that the well-connected friends Chevalier had in Venice ''could have offered a bribe''. In the lecture though, the woman says that the ceiling of the prison needed to be fixed, which would not have been neccesary if Chevaliers story wasn't true.
