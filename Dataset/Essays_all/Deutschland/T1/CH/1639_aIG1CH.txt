Chevalier de Seingalt, was an adventurist ,who made a lot of journeys through Europe in his life between 1725 to 1798.
He wrote a long very detailed memoir about his andventures. But some critics say a lot of the content has been invented by himself.

The text mentions three points,which seem to show,that a lot of the Chevaliers content is invented. At first he claimed to be rich ,but evidence surfaced that he borrowed money.The conclusion is that the couldnt be rich. The audio explains this point by saying that it was a neccesary thing for the Chevalier to borrow money, because his job, where he bought goods and sold them again, requires time. In this time he had no money but he wasnt poor.The second point mentioned was  that his conversation with Voltaire,which is dsecribed very detailed in his memoirs, was written down years later. So he hadnt got the oppurtunity to remember everything. The audio says ,that there is evidence which shows that Chevalier made notes directly after the conversation . So its of course possible for him to remember everything. The last point , mentioned, is about his escape from a Venetian prison. Chevalier claims to have escaped from it . Critics say that it is more likely that they let him go because of his influence in Venice. But an old document shows that Chevaliers cell was renovated directly after he claimed to be escaped.Furthermore there were also more important people with more influence than the Chevalier in this prison. And they hadnt got the oppurtunity to get out of prison by using their influence.This evidence proof that he really escaped from the prison.

The text summarizes the critics about the Chevaliers de Seingalt memoirs. The audio tries to proof the memoirs by showing the critics are wrong and the evidence against the Chevalier can be explained.
