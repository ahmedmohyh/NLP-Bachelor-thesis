The woman talks about the events the Chevalier may have invented. She uses arguments and explains, why some events have to be invented by him.
First, she talks about his time living in Switzerland and the act of borrowing money. The woman talks about his way to spend moneys, for example for parties, so he couldn´t be this poor that he had to borrow money from others.
Next, the woman talks about the conversation Chevalier had with Voltaire. They lived at the same time, so the conversation maybe really took place, but it´s known that it has been many years before he wrote his memoir. He talks about the conversation and captures it accurately. The way he writes make her think, that he invented it or at least added some parts he didn´t remind after many years.
At last, she talks about the part in his memoir, when he talks about the escape from a prison in Venice in Italy. The passage is maybe invented, because there isn´t any note, that the room, where he had to live, was repaired after his escape. In his memoir, he escaped by making a hole in the roof to get outside. As a consequence there havto be a reparation, but nothing ever informs about that.
