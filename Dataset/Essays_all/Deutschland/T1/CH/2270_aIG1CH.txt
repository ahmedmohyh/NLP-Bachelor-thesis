This essay is about the controversial meanings of the memoirs of Chaevalier de Seingalt. He wrote about his life from 1725-1798.
First people says that he said that he was very rich when he lived in switzerland, but nevertheless e mentiond he had to borrow money from a merchant. But this is not because he is not rich. He just had to borrow money when he was waiting for his money. Also critics are skeptikal about the fact that he can remember to every single word he heard years ago, but this could be because he take notes and could remember very well. Last but not least critics claim him to did not tell his escape from prison in Venice right. He just tried to make his escape very exciting for the reader and truly was freed by his rich friends. But other scources are saying that his cell in the prison needed to be repaird after this date and this fact proves that he had no help to escape this prison. Also the facts mentioned from Chevalier are the same like other sources from this age. So you can say it is a releiable historical source and not that exagerregated as the text above saying.
