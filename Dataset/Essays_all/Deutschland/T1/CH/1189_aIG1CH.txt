Both of the sources are about the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt.The Chavalier is an importent historical person as source for the european society. People had been questionig, if he lived the life he wrote down in his memoir or if he added some details to make his life seem more interristing. For example some critics were questionig how he could remeber specific sentences he and Voltair said in a conversation they had a few years ago, which he wrote down in his memoir. But it is shown that he wrote down notes at the end of each day in this time of his life and used them years late when he wrote his memoir. It was also questioned, why he had to borrow money in the time he was in Switzerland, when he was known to be a rich man. But this happend, because in this time you had to sell first to get money. So while he was waiting for his money to arrive he borrowed money. The last question was if he really had to brake a piece out of the ceiling of the prison he had been arrested or if this is only an detail to make his life more interristing. But there are some documents of this prison in Venice that show, that after the escape from Chevalier the ceiling, of the cell he was in, had to be repared. So if he didn´t escaped why should they be repared. All of the questions toward the life and the memoir of Chevalier can be answered by historic sources, who make his memoir a true and importent source of the european society.
