The Text:" Chevalier" is about the Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725-1798 and his memoires, where he wrote about his meetings with several famous people, like Kings and writers, but in the eighteenth century some people doubted the truth of his memoires, which became a valuable historical source, because of three arguments. In the audible text, were Arguments three against the doubts of the truth from the memoires and in the first texts were three arguments, that doubted the accuracy of his memoires. First the woman in the audilble text said: the reason, that the chevalier borrowed money from a swiss merchant doesn´t mean he was poor. He have to sell his proper to gain more money to be still rich in the future, that was a normal way to get rich. Second the argument that the conversations with the famous writer Voltaire can´t be so true in detail, because he wrote the memoires many years later, isn´t good either, because there are several proofs, that he kept writing notes after every day, so he could use them as a help many years later, when he wrote his memoires.The last argument against the truth of his prison escape was, that it is more logic, that his famous friends bribed him free, but they were many other prisoners who had famous friends aswell on nobody helped them, either. Another argument who outlines the truth of his story is that the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired after he left. That could had been, because he broked it, to get free.
