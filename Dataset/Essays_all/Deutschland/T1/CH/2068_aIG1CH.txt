The listening part was a comment on the text. The woman in it has a completely different opinion on the Chavalier than the text does. Therefore she is giving arguments against the text. First she explains that many memoirs are not completely honest, because sometimes you don't really remember that well. She also trys to give some explanation for the doubted fact that the Chavalier had much money when he was in Switzerland. The text said that he had to borrow money for parties an gambling, but in the listening part it was told differently. The Chavalier didn't have no money, it just took a little time until his money arrived at his own hands from gambling. Because of that the memoirs of the Chavalier are a valuable source for a good reason and does not include many wrong information besides some understandable remembering problems.
