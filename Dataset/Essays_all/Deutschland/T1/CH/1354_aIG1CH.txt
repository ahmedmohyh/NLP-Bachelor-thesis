The text above and the presentation have the same topic of the "Chevalier" However, both, the text and the presentation, contradict each other,

The text above and the presentation are about the memoir of the Chevalier, who lived in the 18th century. Critics say that the memoir might be made up in order to make his life more interesting, because there is evidence, which proofs some events otherwise
On the surface, the text and the presentation seems to be the same, since the topic and the points are the same. But when you compare them, there are as contradictory as the memoir itself. Both sources state, that the Chevalier was a very rich man, however, only the text states about his spendings on parties and gambling, which was never mentioned in the presentation. The point remains the same though, there is evidence that he might not have been that rich at all. The text says, that the conversations with Voltaire cannot be written down that exact, because of the time gap between the conversation and the creation of his memoir. But the presentation mentions a conversation with the king, not Voltaire.
Moreover, the way of escape in venice is described different in the presentation than in the text. 

To sum it all up, there are several contradictions between the presentation and the text.
