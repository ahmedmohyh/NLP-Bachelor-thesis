The Chevalier was a men lived in the eighteenths century who wrote down his memoir recounting his life and adventures. This memoirs got a lot of critism because a lot of people say that he distorted or invented many events and storys. But there are some explanations why his memoirs are completely true.

For example he explained that he had a wealthy life an a lot of money while he lived in Switzerland but critics have questioned that lifestyle because he borrowed sums of money from a Swiss merchant. But others say said that he was rich weither he borrowed money because it takes a while to get his own money. 
There are also critics on his story that he met the famous writer Voltaire. The critics said that it isn't possible that the Chevalier could remember the exact phrases of the conversatoin because he wrote his memoirs years after that conversation but this is not really neccessary.
