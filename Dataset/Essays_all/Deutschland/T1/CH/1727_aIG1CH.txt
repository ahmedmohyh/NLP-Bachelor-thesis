The memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt has been critisized a lot in the upper text. The speech compares this text with other informations and explains the reality. The text says that the Chevalier wasn´t as great as he wrote in his memoir. But in the speech there is the fact given, that his memoir is pretty accurate and a reliable source about the European society in the 18th century. Let´s take a look at his wealth for example. The text says that he wasn´t rich at all and that he had to borrow money to organize parties. In the speech you can learn that he wasn´t poor, but he had to wait sometimes for his money to arrive. And wile he was waiting he had to borrow some cash. Also the skeptical view about his relationship to Voltaire isn´t correct. The speech prooves that he wrote down      everything he could remember right after his meetings with Voltaire. The critics also claim Chevaliers story of escaping the prison in venice isn´t true and that he just had politically well-connected friends. But fact is that those friends couldn´t help him out of the situation and there were also some politically stronger people in the prison who could´nt get out. A document also shows that the roof of the prison had to be repaired after Chevalier escaped. The upper text isn´t historically exact and doesn´t show the life of Chevalier de Seingalt correctly and most of the critics are incorrect.
