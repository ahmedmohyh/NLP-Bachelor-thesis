The Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived in the 18th century, wrote a memoir about his life shortly before his death. The memoir is known as a very reliable historic source of Eurpoean society, altough the opinions on the Chevalier are controversial. It is possible to change the truths in a memoir a little bit to make the life it is about seem more exciting and the memoir more readable. 
This is why not everyone believes the facts the Chevalier wrote down about his own life. 

Especially three events he wrote about are discussed. 

First of all, many people don't believe he was as rich as he seemed he was, because while living in Switzerland he borrowed a lot of money from a merchant. Others argue that's not a sign of being poor because the Chevalier spent a lot of money on parties and gambling and before getting money he spent back he had to borrow some. 

The second event in his memoir to argue about is the conversation he had with the famous writer Voltaire. People say the conversations he wrote down can't be true since he wrote the memoir years after he met Voltaire. But many other people believe the conversations are true because the Chevalier also wrote down that after every conversation he had with Voltaire he wrote down notes, which he kept for a long time. He could rely on these notes when he started writing his memoir. 
And the last agrumentable event is that many people don't believe the Chevalier escaped from a prison in Venice on his own. They argue he had many powerful friends who helped him get out of prison. But many other prisoners had even more powerful friends than the Chevalier and none of them escaped from the prison with their help so it must have been his own actions with help him get out. 

Of course not everything in a memoir can be true in every single detail but it's something that can be argued about and no one will ever no the exact truth.
