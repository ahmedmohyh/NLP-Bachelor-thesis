In the speech they said that Chevalier wrote that he was poor in Switzerland. He payed a lot of partys there and also lost a lot of money gambling. But somewhen he has had borrowed it from anybody. And you can only borrow money when you have something by yourself because otherwise people wouldn't get you money. So maybe he wasn't rich but he also wasn't poor. In the text they say that Chevalier claims that he was rich in Switzerland. So that's the opposite of what has been told before.
Chevalier was also in a Venetian prison and escaped from there. In the speech they say that Chevalier hadn't got as much politically friends as the other prisoners so it would have been more possible that these other prisoners escaped and not Chevalier. After he has been escaped they also had to repair the prison he stayed in. In  the text it's told the other way. Here they say that Chevalier claims to have escaped the prison by climbing through the roof of it. The critics think that his politically friends helped him. 
Also in the text they say that the written conversations with Voltaire can't tell the exact things he would have said because it has been written a lot of years after that conversations. But in the speech they claim that Chevalier wrote everything Voltaire has said down in the same nights they've talked.
