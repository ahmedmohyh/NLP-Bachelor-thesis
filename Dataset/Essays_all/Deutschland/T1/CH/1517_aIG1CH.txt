In this essay, I will discuss whether the arguments about the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) are true or not. Well, they say his memoir has become a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. In the presentation, the women said that he gambled a lot in Switzerland and borrowed money from other people, but that does not mean he is a poor man. When he gambled, he most of the time won money, but to win money he had to pay some for playing. Then, when he won a game it would take an amount of days until he would get the money and to keep on playing until he would get his money, he would go and ask people if he could borrow money from them for gambling. Critics have also questioned the memoir's account of the Chevalier's escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. In the presentation, the women talked about a repaired ceiling so the Chevalier could escape the prison. He probably had help from the outside to escape the prison, like workers in the prison that repaired the ceiling for him so he could escape the prison easily. There are a lot of proofs for the memoir to be right and a lot of proofs that some facts could be or are wrong. I would say, the presentation is a really accurate proof for the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt.
