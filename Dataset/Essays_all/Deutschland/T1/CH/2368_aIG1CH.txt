In the following text I will comare the arguments from the hearing part to the text about the Chevalier.

the text tells the reader much about the meaning of the critics from the memoir recounting and the the hearing part tells the much about the good side of the Chevalier.
the first argument, which is different is that the text said he can't be very rich because he needed to borrow money in the Switzerland.On the other hand tells the  first part(the hearing part) he was never getting poor, they explain that in the Switzerland is an other system and you need to spend money and than you have to wait a bit to get it back.
the next discussing argument is that he met the famous writer Voltaire and wrote down their conversation very accurate. the critics say he couldn't remembered that exactly like that
