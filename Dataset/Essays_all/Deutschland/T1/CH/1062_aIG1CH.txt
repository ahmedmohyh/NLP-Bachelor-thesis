The text "Chevalier" is about Chevalier de Seingalt (1725 - 1798) and his by himself written memoir about his life and adventures. 
It states that, beside being a valuable historical source of european history, his memoir were distorted and partly uncorrect. The text uses several examples like Chevaliers life in Switzerland, his prison break or his possible connections to Voltaire. Critics are also named in this text, stating the lack of evidence for Chevaliers adventures and critiszising the accuracy of recorded conversations Chevalier wrote down. 
Although other experts are talking about the impossibility of remembering every point of someones life and conversations exactly. 
The text points out and discusses the mistakes and impossibilities of Chevalier's memoir.
