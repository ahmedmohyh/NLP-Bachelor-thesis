In the lecture the woman made several arguments for the authenticity of the memoirs which are directly related to the arguments that were used by the author of the text to make the opposing point. The first point that both individuals make relates to the time the Chevalier spends in switzerland. In the memoirs he claims to have been very wealthy at that point in his life while historical accounts hint at him having borrowed large sums of money from a local merchant. In the lecture the woman states that though that may be true , but that that doesn`t mean that he wasn`t rich instead he could have had foraign currency that would have been worhless in switzerland. The second point mad by the text is about the authenticity of the chevaliers accounts of his conversations with voltaire because of inaccouracys stemming from memories that were slowly changing ower time. The lecture counters that point with recounts of him instantly recording the conversations on paper after they had them.The last point the lecture and text disagree on his the daring escape of the chevalier from the venitian prison which, according to the text have been greatly exaggerated for entertaiment purposes. The lecture meanwhile claims that the events probaly have actually actually taken place because of evedence of repairs in the chevaliers former cell that would have been pointless when he wouldn`t have damaged his cell during his escape.The argument the author of the text uses concerning his wealth and thus his ability to just bribed himself free is false as far as the lecture is concerned because there have been much more inflluential prisoner in the prison during his time spent there.
