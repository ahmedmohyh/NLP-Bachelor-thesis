In the following i will explain the difference of the memoir from the Chavalier de Seingalt and a Voice speaking about his life.
In his memoir the chevalier is very rich and wealthy and he spends a great deal of money but hes pour of spending money in gambling and partys. Also he was in a Venice prision where he escaped because of his politically well-connected friends which had bribe the jailers to free him. The text says that he is in switzerland but the voice does not tell anything about that. And there are three episods of his memoires wich are including very nice storys but much of them are a lie. Also it is written a long time after the story is happened so many things are lost in his brain and he is telling that parts from his fantasy.
