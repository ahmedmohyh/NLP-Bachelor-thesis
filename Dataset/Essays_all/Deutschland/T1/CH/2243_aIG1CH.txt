The text is criticising the memorie of Chevalier de Seingalt to be not right in some parts. The speech argumes against, the woman states out that while Chevailer lived in Switzerland he wasn´t poor just because he had to borrow money, cause sometimes it takes longer time that the money, but therefore he needs to have a lot of money, that he do not have, because it is known that he had to borrow money sometimes. Next the text says that the conversations with Voltair could not have been like he wrote down, because he wrotes the book years after his conversations and after this long time it can not be that he knowns exactly what he said. Controversial to that in the speech is said, that Chevalier wroted down the conversations directly after they were and just published them later.
