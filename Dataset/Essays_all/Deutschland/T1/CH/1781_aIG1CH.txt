Comparison between the text and the presentation about the memoirs of the Chevalier

It says, that the memoirs of the chevalier are pretty accurate indeed and the following reasons are mentioned. Get a loan of money doens't mean that somebody is poor, the person from the presentation said, you need money to make money. Just because someone gets a loan does not mean that he is poor, he could just gambled with his money. So he could have been pretty wealthy. The conversation with Voltair is also accurate, because he just wrote it down after and it is known, that he used protocolls and reports from his journeys to create his memoirs. He didn't bribe the jailers. Instead he really escaped the way he mentioned, because the Jailers had to repair or rebuilt his prison after he was gone. And why did they have to repair it, if nothing really happend. So this could be an evidence, that he really used a piece of metal to escape from the prison. The presentation counters some critics points about the Chevaliers memoirs. But that does mean, that the Chevalier couldn't have invented some events as well. It is a valuable source the presentation says.
