The presentation about the Chevalier, who lived between 1725 and 1798,  shows some arguments against the critcs about the accuracy of the memoir the Chevalier has written during his life. The first critical point was that the Chevalier didn't had to borrow money because he was really rich and went to parties and gambled when he was in Switzerland. The argument against that point says that he wasn't poor at all but he had to borrow some money because he needed more than he really got for the moment. As second point it had been said that the conversation between Voltaire and him couldn't be accurate because it was written many years later after the conversation. But it has been shown that the conversation was correctly over all. At least but not last some people argue that his prison escape can't be real and he wrote it just to make his memoir more exiting. The prison escape seems also unreal to many people because the Chevalier wrote that he broke the ceiling of his cell with a metal bar and this isn't possible at all. But to that it has been confirmed that they had to fix the ceiling he broke down and the story can be real.
