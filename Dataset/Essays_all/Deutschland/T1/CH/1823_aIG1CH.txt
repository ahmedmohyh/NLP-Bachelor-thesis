In the following I will summarize the heard and read arguments about Chevalier de Seingalt concerning the question whether or not he is a reliable source. The text starts off with the very first argument saying that critics do think that he is not as reliable as thought. He supposedly made his life more interesting to read with great but untrue storys. The text gives here several arguments. The audio on the other hand always gives a contra to the following giving arguments underlining the reliability of Seingalt.
First of all although he might have thrown a lot of partys, the fact that he borrowed a lot of money points to the assumption that he was not that rich after all - I'm not able to say what the audio said about this topic due to problems with my headphones.
Later the text describes that Voltaire and Chevalier indeed have met, but the dialoges he writes in his book are too accurate to be true. Given the fact that he wrote these down several years AFTER these conversations it seems impossible to remember them in that form - the audio on the other hand says that Seingalt did take a lot of notes through these years and conversations meaning it is absolutley possible to remeber these conversations with notes.
At the end the text talks about his escape from prison. It seems more likely that he had bribed a jailer rather than him adventoursly escaping this prison. Obviously a prison break would make a greater story than a bribe. The audio dements this by pointing out that far richer and more influent people did not manage to escape a prison and more importantly belive that a document proves that after his "escape" his door in jail had to be repaired. Why would have they repaired his door if not because of his forceful escape.
All in all both text and audio try to make a stand in the given question: Is he reliable? A question that cannot be fully answerd.
