Chevalier, who lived from 1725-1798, wrote a long memoir about his life and adventure.One criticer makes a comment about his life. In the following part Iám going to explain the differences between the commentator and the editor of the text.
The first point is that the commentator doesn´t agree with that Chevalier makes his life more exciting and glamorous. He was poor and not interested to show a life with glamourous and lot´s of money.
The next point is that Chevalier can´t capture the conversations with Voltaire accurately.  To write something about Voltaire he writes every thing down he knows about Chevalier and it´s also possible to that also after many years.
