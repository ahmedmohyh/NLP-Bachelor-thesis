The Chevalier de Seingalt lived 1725-1798. He had written all the things he could remember in his life. His book become a famous source for historicians, but this source wasn't the best because it seems like he wrote something down that couldn't be possible. His life seems more exciting that it really was. "You can't even remember all the things that happend in your life", said some critics. 1st it looks like a normals source, you get some informations about the life in europe and about the society. You get Informations about kings and queens and about some famous writer like Voltaireor other for this centurie, but there's one thing, that's doesn't really make sence. He wrote about his escape of a jail. He wrote that he just made a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof. So it's seems like an good action movie but it doesn't really fits to his lifestyle. He said that he was very wealthy and had enough money to spend it on partys or some other gambling, but historician found that in other sources that, just borrored money to live that life he wanted. Critics say he made some boring parts of his life more interesting. So they can't really trust him because they can't really decide when he said the truth or when he made his life interesting.
