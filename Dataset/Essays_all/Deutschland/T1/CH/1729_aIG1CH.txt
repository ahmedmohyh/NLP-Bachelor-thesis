In the speech I have just heard, there are some arguments relating to the text above which show that the speaker has a different opinion about the Chevalier than the author of the text and which are given to proof the speakers opinion.
Firstly, it is said that the Chevalier wasn't poor because he was a rich man from selling his property. In the meantime between selling his property and waiting for his money, the Chevalier had to borrow some money, but all in all he although was a rich man, which means that the doubts about his wealth mentioned in the text could be wrong.
Furthermore, the doubts about the accuracy of his converstaions with Voltaire that are recorded in his memoir might be pointless, because in the speech it is said that the Chevalier wrote down everything he could remember of a conversation right after the conversation had ended. Friends and relatives of him also said that he did this and that he kept the papers he wrote on till the end of his life.
The last argument that the speaker gives is an argument against the fact that the Chevalier's escape from prison in Vernice was invented. The speaker said that  there were other prisoners in the same prison who have also had politically well-connected friends that were even more able to influence the justice than the friends of the Chevalier, and even those prisoners never got free. Moreover, it is a fact that the ceiling of the Chevalier's cell had to be repaired after he got free which is another strong argument against the thesis that he only invented the story of his escape.
