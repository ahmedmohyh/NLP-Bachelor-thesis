Chevalier de Seingalt lived in the eighteenth century. He wrote a memoir and people are arguing, about the true context in the memoire. The first piont ist, that he spend much money for big parties and gambling. He had to be very rich. And critics say, that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. He han'd have to borrow money if he was rich. They also argue about the conversation between Voltaire and the Chevalier, because the conversation was written down many years later. He wouldn't be able to remember the exactly phrases betweeen himself an Voltaire. The third point critics argue about is the escape from prision. He had a number of friends in Venice with pollitical background. And critics say, that he just write to much adventuring.
