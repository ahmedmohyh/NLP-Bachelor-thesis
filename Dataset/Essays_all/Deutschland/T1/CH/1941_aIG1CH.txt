The woman who speaked told us the opposites of the informations the text told us. To the aspect Chevalier escaped with a piece of metal by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof outside the text told us it is not the truth. Chevalier de Seingalt lied all the time in his memoirs . He wanted that his memoirs sounds more interesting and adventourus to the readers. But the woman memtioned that other prisoners had more spectacular escapes out of the prison than Chevalier so it does not sound so weird anymore. She thinks it could really happened that he escaped in a way like this.
Chevalier de Seingalt wrote in his memoirs that while he lived in Switzerland he was very wealthy. But other sources told that Chevalier borrowed money from a Swiss merchant so he can not was that wealthy he told all the time.
The speaker of the video disagreed with this aspect too. She told that he just borrowed the money while he waited for his own money to come. He needed the money at this moment so he borrowed it. But that means not that he was poor. The woman always find an argument for the truth of Chevalier´s storys and adventures.
