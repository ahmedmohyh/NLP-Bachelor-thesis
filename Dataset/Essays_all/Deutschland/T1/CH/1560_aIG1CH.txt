The given text is about the Critics of the memoir of Cevalier de Seingalt about his life and adventures.
It's a historic source that is very important for the European society in the eighteenth century. So many people read the source to get to know about that time. But some think that the facts and adventures he wrote about can not be true. for example he said that he met Voltaire, a famous author. But no one doubt that they met and conserved. He wrote their consevation many years later done, so it's not possible that they are all in all true and completly correct. 
some critics say that he just wrote some adventures like breaking out of the prison for enjoyable and fun reading. So the memoir is maybe more a exciting history then an historic source.
But the point is that nobody can proof the facts about his life because we are not living with him and were not living with him too.
