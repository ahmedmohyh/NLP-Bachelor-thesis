The woman said that the memoirs which Chevalier have written can be true.De Seingalt says that he is rich but the critics say that he borrowed considerable sums of money from a swiss merchant. But for the woman that is not a reason that he can not be rich. Maybe he eraned money and waits for it and because of all his parties he has no money anymore to pay them. So he borrows something to give it back later. The second point is that de Seingalt tells us about the work with Voltaire and that he has a conversation with him. Most people would say that this can not be true because the text was written many years after the conversations occured. But the woman said that he maybe have written the conversation between Voltaire and him down. Chevalier de Seingalt says that he escaped from the prison in Italy with a piece of metal to climbing through the roof but the critics mean that he had many friends in Italy who could have offered a bribe, but they did not think about that the friends did not help him or that the jailers were not bribed to free him.
