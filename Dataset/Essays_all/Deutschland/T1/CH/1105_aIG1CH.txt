Chevalier de Seingalt was born in 1725 and died in 1798. He met many famous people of the european society, such as kinngs and writers. He wrote a memoir about his life which seems to have been full of adventures, but until today it's not proofed if these stories are right or if he just invented some things which actually never happened to make it more exciting for the reader?
Chevalier passed some time in Switzerland and seemed to be whealty and celebrated a lot. But he also had to borrow some money from a Swiss merchant. So was he really that rich?
Money needs a bit time to "travel" from one country to another, especially in the eigtheenth century and it's imaginable that if he really spent so much money on partys and gambling it's imaginable that he run out of money until the rest arrived in Switzerland.
But what's with his conversations with Voltaire?
People who knowed him said that he worked with notes when he wrote the memoire, so it can be possible that he wrote down the conversations and used them for his work.
And the escaping from the prison in Venice?
Other people in this prison had friends with more political influence and power, so it's not very imaginable that they rescued him. Also they had repair the ceiling of the cell where he spent his time there, so why would there be a hole when he didn't escape through it?
