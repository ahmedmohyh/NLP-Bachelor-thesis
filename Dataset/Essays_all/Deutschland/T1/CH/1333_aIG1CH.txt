Both sides told me that Chevalier wasn´t the best man and his life was very critical. He wrote a memoir in which he recounting his life and adventures. Chevalier was a free man, spend a great deal of money on parties and gambling. He lived in switzerland and was very wealth. He met famous people and had a number of politically well-connected friends in venice. 

But critics say that in his memoir Chevalier skeptical conversations between himself and the famous people.
