The previous texts both dealed with the question of the accuracy of the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. In the written text it says, that there are many critics about the three most important and questionable parts of his live. The spoken presentation gave explenations for the questions in the text. The first  given example was the part in his memoir where he said he was a wealthy man during the time he spent in Switzerland. Critics do not believe that passage for it is also known, that he had to borrow money from a friend. The explanation is, that to be a welthy man he had to sell his mansion. Between having sold his house and getting the money there was a small period of time he was not wealthy. So he had to borrow money from a friend, which does not make hime a poor man.
Other criticer question the accuracy of the quotes from his conversations with Voltaire. It is not believed that he could remember the exact words from a conversation years ago. But other sources say he wrote down his conversations the same day they took place and reused them for his memoir. 
At last Chevalier de Seingalt mentions his escape from the prison in Venice. He says he climbed through the ceiling. Critics tell he was let free because of his friends in Venice who probably paid the bribe. Others say it is not realistic for other prisoners have had better connections. But also after he left the prision the ceilings had to be redone which makes his story believable.
