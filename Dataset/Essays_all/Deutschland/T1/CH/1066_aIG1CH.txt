The life of Chevalier de Seingalt.

The well known man Seingalt lived in the 17th century. He was a contoversial figure, because of his lifestyle.In his memoir he wrote down some facts, which experts are sure that they are not completly correct and he just wrote to make his life more exerciting to read.
He claimed to be very waelty, but still had to borrow money for his gambling or his huge parties. Also the fact that he always had to sell some proberty to get money is a sing, that he was not that rich. But there are more situations in his life were experts agree that is it cant be possible.
Another example is the conversation with Voltaire. The problem here is, that they can not imagen that all the quots are complety true. It is just not possible to remember a whole converation by the exact words and write them years later down.
But also his prision escape was probably different than he wrote it down in his memoir. He discribed it there that he used a piece of metal to make a hole and climbing through the roof. He claims that he did this with the help with very powerful friends in Venice, but in the prision were other people that had even more powerful friends, who did not escaped. So critics think that the celling was just broken.
