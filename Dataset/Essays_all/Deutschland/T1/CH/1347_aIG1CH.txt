Chevalier de Seinegalt was a controversal figure in the eighteenth century, but his memoirs became a very important source about European society in that time. 
But critics have doubts that some of the things he wrote aren't quite accurate. 
The proof that some of the things critics claim to be inaccurate might be true in the end gives a presentation about his memoirs. 
The statement that he was poor when he lived in Switzerland is untrue, because many people liked to gamble in that time and when he won, it took them a few days to change his win into actual money, that's why he had to borrow money.
About the conversation with Voltaire, the presentation says that de Seinegalt made notes about everything he could remember, every evening after their conversation and even refers to those in his memoirs.
When it comes to his prison escape, it is probably way more than just for enjoyable reading purposes. The presentation gives information about other prisioners who have more powerful friends, when it came to politics, than he had and those still weren't able to do it the easier way. 
As an addition to that, it is proven, that de Seinegalts cell's ceiling had to be repared and why would they do that if he didn't escape through it?
