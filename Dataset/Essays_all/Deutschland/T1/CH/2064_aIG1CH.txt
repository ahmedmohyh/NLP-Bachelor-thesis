The text is about Chevalier Seingalt (1725-1798) who wrote memorys about his meetings with kings or writers. Some critics say that his memorys can`t be true, because there are some mistakes in his sayings. 
First he said that, as he was in switzerland, he was very wealthy and spended much money to organisations. But it is also known that he needed to borrow some money and  if it would be true that he was very rich he would not needed to borrow money. In the reading it is also known that Chevalier needed to borrow some money, but they say that he needed it to get more money by producing something. They say, when you want to get money first you need something for the start and that was the money which Chevalier borrowed from an Swiss merchant.
Another critic of the text was, that Chevalier wrote in his memorys about his escape from a prison. They say it can`t be true, because there were many more famous people in there with bigger friends than Chevalier had and they couldn`t escape. Also the woman in the reading said that she doesn`t know how Chevalier could escape, but she also said that the prison room of Chevalier must be repeared after he was there and that`s the logical consequens when someone escaped from a prison.
