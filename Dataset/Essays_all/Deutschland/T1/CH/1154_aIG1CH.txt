In the referate the woman said that that he was rich and he borrowed money to his friends or to other persons. Because of his wealth he could organise many events where the high society met. The text says that the Chevalier had to borrow money for himself so he could not have been as rich as he wrote in his memoires. The text thinks that he wanted to make his life seems more glorios and exciting than it really was. Another example is his escape from the prison in Italy. The text tinks that he probably was freed from his jailers and not that he escaped through a hole which he had built with a piece of metal. The woman from the referate did not doubt his explanations about his escape. The fact that he met Voltaire and talked to him is probably right but the fact that he can remember their conversations exactly even they were a few years ago, seems to be some kind of weird. The text questions this point too. But the woman with the referate says that this converations had been very important for him, so that he could remember a few sentences exactly even after such a long time.
