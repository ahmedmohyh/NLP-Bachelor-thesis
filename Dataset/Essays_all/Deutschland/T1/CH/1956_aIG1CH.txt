The text says that the Chevalier had to borrow money from a swiss merchent to pay his parties and gambling but the listening said that is not true. The Chevalier was not poor, he had enough money but not enough to make even more money. That is the reason why he borrowed summs of money from a Swiss merchant.
The critics of the text also say that it is questioned if he really escaped from prison or if it is just a story in his memoirs. The listening That his memoirs could be true. He was not the man with the most influence of the Venice government in the prison so it would be quite unrealistic to come free as the only one. Out of other storys we know that the prison needed to repair a seeling in his room. So it is reliable that he realy escaped without the help of the government otherwise there wouldn`t be a seeling which needed to be repaired.
In general the text critisise his memoirs and question if they are reliable. In the listenings opinion they are absolutely. Out of storys and other people out of this time they knew that the Chevalier always wrote down everything just after it happend even when he came home after a night full of party and gambling, the first thing he did was writing down what happend. That means this sources is acurate and reliable.
