During the lecture, they tried to show that the arguments the critics had about the realness of the memoirs of the Chevalier were wrong. For example in the text it's said that the Chevalier called himself a wealthy person while living in Switzerland in his memoirs, when in reality, he needed to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But in the lecture they said that he was just waiting for his money to arrive and borrowed something from someone else in this short time span. Also, the Chevalier was able to recall the exact converations he had years ago. Critics claimed that one one could remember te exact words that long. In fact, the Chevalier was journaling and actually wrote down almost every conversation he had in his life right after they happened. Because of that, he could write them down in his memoirs exactly the way they took place in reality. The Chevalier also claimed to have escaped an Italian prison by just using a piece of metal with which he could climb thorugh the roof. Critics questioned the realness of this story and thought he had some good friends with a great political impact who were able to persuade his jailers to free him. But apparently there are some old Venetian documents which show that the ceilling of the Chevalier's prison cell needed to be repaired after he got free. So of course it was more likely that he just escaped with a piece of metal, destroying a part of the roof which needed to be repaired later.
