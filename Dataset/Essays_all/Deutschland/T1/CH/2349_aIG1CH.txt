In the text, the tree facts over Chevalier were written from the point of view from one of the people, who are against him and his memories. They don't believe him his stories. The listening was from one person, which wasn't against him. 
The first argue was, that he cant be so rich like he told, when he must borrow money from other people. But he only need this money for waiting for his next own money. Only because he borrows money doesn't mean that, that he was poor.
The second argue was, that the never could remember all points of his conversation with Voltaire. He wrote his texts many years after the conversation. But he had written all the conversations down after holding them. So he was able to give them so accuratly in his texts later.
The third argue was, that he had never broken out from a venician prison. He was bribed from a friend. But other prisonors had more and better connected friends than he had. The ceeling must being repared a few weeks after he was broken out. Why should it been repared, when he was bribed out from a good connected friend?
