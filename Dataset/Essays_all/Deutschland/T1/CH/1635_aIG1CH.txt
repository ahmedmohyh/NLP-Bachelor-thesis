The text and the audio are both about the memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798), where he talked about his life and his adventures.

In the audio the woman talked about the memoirs of Chevalier, but she said that no memoir can be correct. First it isnt exactly true that Chevalier was a wealthy and rich man as he lived in Switzerland.But he was not actually a poor man, he only has to wait for his money and he spend a lot of money for parties. in the text it is written, that Chevalier has a great deal of money. the second point, the woman takled about, is the Chevaöiers relation with the famous writer Voltaire. She explained, that it is not true, that Voltaire and Chevalier never met, but they did not have an important relationship. The last point she mentioned was about his escape from a prison in Venice. He escaped by damaging the prison and not how it is written in the text, by the aqcuittal of his jailor. 

But in the end the text and aswell the woman in the audio have the same opinion, no memoir can be exactly correct. Chevalier oly wanted to make his memoirs more interesting and exciting.
