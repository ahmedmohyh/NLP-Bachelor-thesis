In the presentation about the Chevalier, a woman tells her opinion about the memoir of the Chevalier, written at the end of his life. She thinks, that the memoir can be partly correct, but some points can't be true. She says, that the Chevalier was wealthy while he lived in Switzerland, but for being wealth, he had to borrow a lot of money. In this case, she has the same opinion like the critics, which arguments are mentioned in the text. The second point of her speech was about the Chevaliers conversations with Voltaire, a famous writer from the 80s, he also wrote about in his memoir. The woman says, he could have met Voltaire and he could have remembered some phrases, Voltaire told him. But it's impossible that the Chevalier remembered whole conversations after a couple of years. Critics said, it's impossible to remember any phrase after such a long time, so there she has an other but similar opinion. The last point is about the prison in Venice. The Chevalier wrote about his escape from the prison, but the woman said, that he couldn't have escaped from there, because there were other and stronger men, who could escaped easier than him. Critics said, he escaped because politics, the Chevalier has known, offered a bribe for him. There the opinions are different.
