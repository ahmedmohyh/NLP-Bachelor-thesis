The Chevalier wrote an memoir about his life and his advantures. At his time of life he met some famous people and because of that his memoir became very important and get an historical source. 
Some people said that the storys the Chevalier wrotes down arent really happened. They are thinking he had only done that to make his life more exiting and glamorous. 
For example he wrotes in his memoir he spent a lot of money there. But in reality he asked a merchant to borrow him some money. So it isn`t real that the Chevalier had been very rich.
He also wanted to make his advantures more interesting with the idea that he met Voltairer and conversed with him. This ins`t true too because it was written in the memoir an few years later so he counldn`t know the exact phrases the Voltaire told him.
