The Chevalier claimed, while livingin Switzerland, he was very wealthy, how it´s been said in the speaking. Evidence has surfaced that he borowed money, which you don´t need to if you´re rich. The Chevalier also claimed that he had a big friendhsip witch Voltaire, no one ddoubts that they met and conserverd. He says that he escaped from the prison that he made a whole in to the ceillling by using a piece of metal, critics don´t trust him in this point, but in the speaking it´s sad that after he has gone they had to get a new ceilling for his prison room.
