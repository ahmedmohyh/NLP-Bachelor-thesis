Both sources concern a memoir written by the Chevalier de Seingalt who lived from 1725 to 1798. The author of the written text claims, that the memoir is not accurate and historics cannot rely on the events mentioned in it. The lecture is a response to this claim. The lecturer defends the memoirs accuracy and explains the memoir indeed is of historical importance. First, the critics explain that Chevalier was not honest about his wealth because he did  borrow money when he spent time in switzerland. The lecturer's arguement is, that he was not poor, but he simply borrowed money because it took time until his own money arrived to the foreign country. Next, the author about the text observes that the conversations of the Chevalier and the famous writher Voltaire are not reliable because they were written down much later than when they took place. The lecturer defends the memoir and its converstations through referring to notes that the Chevalier took each night after his conversationts with Voltaire. That these notes existed is historically proven by other people that dealt with the Chevalier. These notes greatly influenced the memoir and therefore the conversations are a reliable source. Last but not least, the text explains that the memoir is not accurate because the Chevalier dramatized his life to make it seem more exciting. An example of this would be the Chevalier's escape of the prison. The author of the text claims that the describtion is too far away from what really happened and that the Chevalier probably got helped by his prisonmates when escaping the prison. According to the lecturer, this point does not make sense because the other prisoners were more powerful than the Chevalier and did not succeed to escape. Also, it is mentioned that the ceiling had to be repaired shortly after the escape which would line up with the story mentioned in the memoir.
