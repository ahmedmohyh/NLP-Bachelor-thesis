Chevalier`s memoires: accurat and correct as they seem?
Chevalier is a historical person who lived in the 18th century. He wrote down his memoires and explains many adventures and famous things that happend to him. But critics have some doubts about the correctness and accuraty of his writings, because he may have changed things and have puched them up to make his life better and more exciting. For example he wrote that he was very rich while he lived in Switzerland but other sources tell us that he had to borrow money. The question that comes up is why he had to borrow money if he was as rich as he wrote. An answer could be that he could also be rich but had to borrow money for something he really needed and that he could give the money back. This is just normal and well known till today. Many people borrow money from the bank and give it back later even if they are rich.
The other doubt is the correctness of his conversation with the famous writer voltaire. It is clear that he really met him, but he wrote down the conversations many years later. How could he know all the sentences they spoke to each other after all this time?
Another exciting story is his escape from the prison in Italy. But this is what critics can not believe. They think he did not escape, but he had famous friends who maybe helped him because they macbe . But a dangerous escape he did alone is more faszinating than a diplomatic discussion from his freinds to let him come out the prison.
