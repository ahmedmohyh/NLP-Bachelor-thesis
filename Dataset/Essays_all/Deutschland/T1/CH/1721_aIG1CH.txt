Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) was a very important person for the informations of the time, because he met many famous people and wrote about it in his memoir. His texts are important historical sources. But you can´t know, how accurate they are, because it could be possible, taht he wants to make the events more exciting. There are different opinions:
In the text there are three events, which can´t happen in real, because of many reasons, in the reading the woman trys to explain the events. 
The first event was, the Chevalier tells, that he was rich, but you know that he borrwos money from a merchant. The woman explains, that that musn´t be because he has no money. You can borrow money and be rich too. maybe he wants something which costs much money and don´t wants to use his own.
The second event was his conversation whith Voltaire. The critics think that it dosen´t happen, because the Chevalier writes about it, many years after he says he met him. Critics say, that he couldnt remember exact pharses. The woman says it could happen and he remembers a few phrases, becaus it was so exciting for him.
The last event is that he faked his escape from a prision. They think that the jailers were bribed to free him. But the woman says, that that couldn´t happen. Other people escaped before him without good connections, and people with good conections failed.
