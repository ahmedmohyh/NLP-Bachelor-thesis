In this essay i would like to talk about the differences between the presentation and the text in the theme of Chevalier de Seingalt.
First of all the text is about Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) who wrote a memoir recounting his life. His memoir become a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteen century when he visited lots of famous people, including kings and writers.
Also he wrote about his adventures for example his wealth in Switzerland, his conversation with Voltaire and his Escape out of prison in Vencie, Italy.

The presentator said that he had wealth, but had to borrow something, because he had to wait for his money to come back from gambling. The text said that critics argue that he wasn't wealth because he wouldn't have needed to borrow money, if he had really been very rich.

In the next point, the conversation with Voltaire, the presentator said that he wrote every day after the conversation  to get this meeting with Voltaire down in his memoir. The text said that began to write it after some years so that he couldn't remember exact phrases.

In the last point, the Escape out of the Venice prison, the presentator said that he is escaped by destroying his room, because the prison had to repair his room some days after the escape. The text said that it is more likely that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him. This was possible because of politically well-connected friends he had.
