The Text about Chevalier is summing up the critisism against Chevalier. For example are there many critics about his money and on what he is spending it (party, gambling). There is also the critic, that he wasn`t that rich, like he was telling his readers in his memoirs. He should have borrowed money in Switzerland, because he was running our of money. The Author of the Text also says, that he did write about conversations with the high society of the 18th century, but nobody prooved if it's right or not. 
Also there are there speculations about his story, that he was climbing out the prison in Verona. The spectulations tell,that this wasn't the truth and that he was setting free because the Chavalier's jailers were bribed to.
The presentation is more a adding of informations to thecritisism of the text. It is telling, that he wasn't poor just because he borrowed money. He was running out of money, because it takes long time to send his money from home to Switzerland, so he neede money to pay for more partys  and gamblings.The presentation also says , that no memoir of him iks exactly right, because his memoiry are about late night conversations and he didn't remember every word of the conversations.
 I can hear ou of both, text and presentation, that all they are saying/ writing,  are only speculate and that the truth was never found out about Chevalier.
