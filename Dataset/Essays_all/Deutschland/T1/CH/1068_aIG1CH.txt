The text and the lecture I just read and heard deal with the memorial of Chevalier de Seingalt. 
He wrote about his adventures and his life. Chevalier met a lot of amous people and vistited a lot of places, but not everything he wrote is easy to believe.

In Switzerland he spent a huge amount of money, and he describes himself as wealthy. He might have been wealthy, but it is proofen that he had to borrow a lot of money. Chevalier had to wait a long time to get money, so even though he was not poor, he may have been not as wealthy all the time.

Next he talkes a lot about his meetings with the famous writer Voltair. His detailed descriptions of evertyhing they talked about, makes it hard to believe that he remebered everything. Chevalier wrote his memorial years later, and even though he might have wrote notes while talking to Voltair, most people think he made up some ideas on his own. 

Last mentioned in the text and the lecture, Chevalier wrote about his escape from the prison in Venice. In his memorial ist says, that he escaped through the sealing. In the lecture it says, that a alot of powerful people where in the Venice prison without the possibility to escape, that is why it is more likley that they set him free. But as in the lecture mentioned, they had to repair the seeling from Chevaliers room after he left the prison. That would proove Chevaliers memorial right.

There is no proof for the memorial and his stories to be right, but also no proof that Chevalier just made those storys up. Wether its wrong or right, Chevaliers memorial is pretty accurate- maybe one of the most accurate of all time.
