Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 till 1798. He wrote a memoir about his life in european society and what he expirienced there. It is questioned if everything he wrote is true. The reason for that is that many things he wrote can´t be possible. It is written that he lived in Switzerland and had very much money but it is questionable why he needed to borrow money. Some people say it is because of their system but if you only hear then you don´t really know what to believe. He also told he met Voltaire and wrote down their complete conversation what is very unrealistic because you are not able to remember a whole conversation that is more than one hour ago. But also there are people who support him and say that it´s true. They say that he only wrote down what he remembered and that were only a few quotes. Many memoirs of other people are not very accurate but it is told that his is. Many people believe that he escaped from prison only because his room needed to be restaurated but the real reason why he was free was that his "jailers were bribed to free him".
