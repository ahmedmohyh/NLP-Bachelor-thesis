The arguments just mentioned are all trying to confirm that the Chevalier's achievements happened in the way he described in his memoirs.

First of all there is the incident with the merchant de Seingalt borrowed money from. To argue that this is not due to him being poor, it is said that there were some complications with receiving the money he had, so that in conclusion it doesn't have to mean that he was not wealthy. And since Chevalier's were known for spending a lot of money for gambling and parties, it is not not that surprising that de Seingalt had to borrow some for a short amount of time.

Furthermore it is stated in the defending arguments, that after the Chevalier has met Voltaire, which is proved to have happened, he always wrote down notes about their conversations, thus the stories in his memoirs might not have been 100 per cent correct, yet still pretty accurate.

Eventually it is tried to argue against the critics towards the Chevalier's prison escape, that is said to have happened with the help of politically well-connected friends, rather than by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. Arguments against this would be, that in that prison there were enough other people, who had better connections, yet didn't manage to escape. Additionally it is stated, that after de Seingalt's escape, the roof of the prison chamber had to be repaired.
