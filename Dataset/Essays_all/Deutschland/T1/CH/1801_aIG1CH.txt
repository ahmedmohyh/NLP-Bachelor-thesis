The following text is about the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) who was a somewhat contorversial figure. He wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures toward the end of his life. In the presentation they shown us some critics about Chevalier. They said it is right what the text says and you cannot convince somebody that everything what is mentioned abour Chevalier is right at all. Many critics say that Chevalier just wanted to make his life more exciting and glamorous than it really was for the people who read it. The text tells us that Chevalier had been really rich because he spended were a lot of money for parties and gambling but the critics say he was poor when he was in Swiss because he borrowed al lot of money from a Swiss merchant but all in all Chevalier was not poor because of  borrowing money, he already got wealth. There are also discussions about the conservations with Voltaire which he should had. The story with the escape from a notorious prison in Venice is also very claimed by many critics. There are many opinions about the things Chevalier should have done but in the end you can not know anything because maybe the stories were all not true and he only wanted to write a valuable historical source about European society in the eightennth century. The only thing we might can know that he met some famous people, including kings and writers and some stories might be true.
