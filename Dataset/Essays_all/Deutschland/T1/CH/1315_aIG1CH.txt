The text and listening part was about the Chevalier de Seingalt and zhe accuracy of his memories. There wre three stories they talk about.
The firts one ist about his money. Eventhoug he was pretty rich and he spend much money on gambling and parties, he must borrow a lot of money during his lifetime. The Text means like this it cant be true and his memories are wrong. But during the listening part, they said that he hasnt got much cash so in must wait for his cash money, during this time he must borrowed some money. So he was wealthy but he hadnt have much cash.
The second part ist about his conversation with vaultaire. Many critics doupt that he can remember every single part of the conversation, so they mean it isnt real. But the second Text ( listening part) tells us that he wrote everthing down on paper right after the conversation. That way he could use it many years later for his memories.
The third part was about his prison break storie. Critics doupt that he really breakout from Venice (Italy). They think he had many contacs so " Chevaliers jailers where bribed to free him". But the second text talks about a text from the 18th cenury, where ist says that his prison room must be repaired. That fits his prison break storie.
So their are many controversials in bouth text.
