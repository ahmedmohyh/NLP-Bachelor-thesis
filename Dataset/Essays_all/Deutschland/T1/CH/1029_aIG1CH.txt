The lector refers to Chevalier´s memoir and evaluates - considering every passage specifically - how accurate the content is.

As to her, Chevalier probably was not poor, even though he had spent a lot of money on parties and gambling. In Swiss, the way he proceeded is considered normal.
She does not think there are many faults in the passage about Chavalier's conversations with Voltaire. After every night of them talking, he had taken precise notes to be able to brief them accurately later on, which explains why she doesn't doubt that part of the memoir.
Concerning his prison escape, the lector can´t really believe it´s true since very few prisoners had been able to escape that certain prison in Venice. Nevertheless, she takes into consideration it might still be true Chavalier succeeded in escaping since the ceiling has had to be repaired after the end of his captivity and there would have been no other plausible reason for that than him having made that hole to climb through the roof.

Considering all of her arguments, the lector concludes that Chevalier's memoir propably is quite accurate despite all the critics.
