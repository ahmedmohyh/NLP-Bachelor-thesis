The arguments from the audio don´t agree with the arguments in the text. They give proof that everything Chevalier has written down is actually true.
They say that Chevalier had to borrow money in Switzerland and that he was rich at the same time. In the text they say that no rich person would have had the need to borrow money, but the audio explains that Chevalier spent much money on big parties and events. After this he had to wait for his left money to arrive so in the meantime he had to borrow some money.
They also give proof that Chevalier had all the converstions he wrote down in his memoir. The author of the text says that no person could remember every single sentence from a far away conversation, but in the audio they explained that Chevalier made many notes after every conversation with Voltaire. He has kept them for all the years and used them later when he wrote his memoir.
They also mentioned his escape from a prison in Venice. In the text the author explains that he couldn´t have free himself by using a piece of metal. He thinks that Chevalier had some conections so he got help to escape from the prison. The audio also doesn´t agree in this point. They point out that there was a text or note about the cell/ room where Chevalier had been in had to be renovated after his escape before there could go another jailer in, which gives proof for Chevaliers own statement.
The arguments of the audio are much more in detail and they proofed everything with the help of written down documents, which make their opinion very convincable. The author of the text only used proof which isn´t actually proof but more what he thinks about the Chevalier´s memoir. He doesn´t mention any visible proof.
