Some critics claim that the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt are only partially true and he seems to have distorted events, so his book would be better for reading. 
They say he wasn't wealthy although he claimed to be, because he borrowed money in Switzerland. Other critics say, he was rich, but he used up all his cash and because he couldn't sell land fast enough, he land himself some more money instead. In addition Critics complain about the precise conversation the Chevalier wrote, because it was years ago and one can't remember every detail of an conversation. However there are critics, who say he was writing down all he could remember right after his conversation with Voltair and just refered to his notes later on. Lastly the escape out of the prison in Italy seemed very unrealistic to many critics, so they assumed he had rather bribed prison guards to regain freedom. Others said, he had to be escaping through the roof, because they found notes, which said the prison had to repair the roof after the Chevalier was gone.
