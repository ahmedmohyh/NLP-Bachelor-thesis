The presentation says  the memoir of the Chavalier is very accurate. The first point is that the Chavalier was very wealthy and spent a lot of money on parties and gambling, but he needed to borrow money from a swiss merchant, cause the money wasnt so fast liquid like today. The text says also that the critics are skeptical about the accuracy of the conversation between the Chavalier and the famous writer Voltaire. The critics says that the memoir was written years after the conversations, so they can't be very accurate. The presentation says that the Chavalier wrote down everything down he remembered directly after the conversation. The escape from the Cahvalier is more likely that the Chavalier's jailers were brided to free him, cause of his politically well-connected friends. The presentation says an old Venice document tells about a hole  in the prison, so that was the hole which make with a piece of metal.
