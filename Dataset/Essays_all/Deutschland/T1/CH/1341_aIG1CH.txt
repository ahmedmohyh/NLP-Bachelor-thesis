In the text about the Chevailer de Seingalt,who live from 1725 to 1798, the life and lifestyle of him are shown. He was a simple man not rich ore somewhat but in his life life he learn many people who are richt and famous, for emamples kings and writers and so his memorie became.He also distored or invented many events to look rich and famous but in reallity he was a poor man and his life wasnt so glamoures as he are showed. In the time he lived in Switzerland he are very wealthy and spend much money for parties and gambiling.So maybe he has difficults to rase with  money.
But critics are very skeptical about the lifestyle of him and think his Life is a very big lie to the puplic. And critics also said that his family ore well-connected friends have givven him money that he can be get famous..And I havent the foggiest idea which reason he have had to do that.
