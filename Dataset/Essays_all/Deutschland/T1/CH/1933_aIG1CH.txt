The Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) wrote an autobiography(=memoir) in which he wrote about his adventures in life.

In his memoir he claims that he met a lot of famous people on his journey.He also states that he was very rich,gambled and partied a lot and that he had a conversation with Voltaire which he accurately wrote about. He also says in his memoir that he broke out of a prison in Venice through the ceiling by just using a piece of metal.

Critics claim that the Chevalier mostly lied in his memoir. They do think he met a lot of famous people and that he was gambling and partying a lot but not on his own money as he often borrowed the money from elsewhere meaning the Cheavlier wasn´t living such a glamorous life and actually way relatively poor. They also claim that he can´t write the conversation with Voltaire in detail as his memoir was written years later unless he lied as he is unable to remember eveything spoken about in the conversation. Critics say that he also didn´t escape from prison. the jailors were bribed to free him as the Chevalier had a lot of political friends.

The presentation however claims that the Chevalier wasn´t lying in his memoir as he just borrowed the money because he needed some time to get money. He was selling products and as he sold them he needed to wait to get the money. They also think that the Chevalier wasn´t making the conversation with Voltaire partly up as he kept notes years after the conversation. Even friends of the Chevalier have said that he kept the notes which means he can quote the whole conversation. The presentaion also says that the jailors weren´t bribed to free him  because other imprisoned people were even more powerful and weren´t freed.This means the Chevalier must have broken out of prison as there was no chance of him getting freed.

How can we know which side is right? Both sides have good arguments which makes it hard to believe only to one.
