In the audio the woman talked about Chevalier's life in Switzerland. he has been known to throw a lot of parties and he had been very wealthy. There was only the problem that he sometimes had to wait for his money to arrive but that did not make him any less wealthy. The text says that Chevalier was not wealthy at all because he had to borrow a lot of money.
The second argument is about Chevalier's conversations with Voiltare. The woman said that Chevailer wrote everything he could remember down after talking to Voltaire and he then used these informations to write his memoir. However the text says that a lot of critics say Chevailer could not have been able to remember conversations he had years ago, but since we heard that he wrote a lot of it down he could actually use a lot of it in his memoir.
Last argument was about Chevalier's escape from a prision in Venice. Chevalier wrote that he escaped prison by hitting a hole into the ceiling with a piece of metal and escaping over the roof. Critics portraied in the text say that he had a lot of powerfull friends which proably bailed him out. Anyways the woman declared that in the prison were people with friends which were way more powerfull than his and they did not get out. It is also known that they had to repair the ceiling in his cell.
