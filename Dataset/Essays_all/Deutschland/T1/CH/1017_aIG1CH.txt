In the hearing part we heard arguments of the memories of the Chavalier de Saingalt.
These arguments are about his life and a big part of his Life. He write about his adventure and I tell the arguments in the following.
The first argument is his prison break of a prison in Venice. He said that he was escaping, because his prison had to renovise. But it make no sence because, why a prison should have to renovise. He wrote about much famous and popular person like kings and writers he met, which does not make sence too.
So the most things he write make no sence. 

The differents of this text and the hearing part I tell in the following. 
In the text the tell that he he used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climed through the roof but in the hearing part they, said that he come out, because the prison he was had to renovise or clean, and so he escaped from the prison. Which is also different that i n the text they write, that it is impossible to remember the exact phrases from extended conversation held many years earlie and in the hearimng part they said the same, but
