The memoires of the Chevalier de Seingalt are a historical source which is highly questioned by some and seen as an accuate sore by others.
Both sides have many arguments for their point of view.

Firstly, the Chevalier claimes that he was rich while living in Switzerland but still had to borrow a lot of money which indicates that he was not rich.
Borrowing money does not mean that you are poor since there are businesses that do not get their money right away and have to borrow money to get over this period of time. This is the case nowadays and was the case at the eightteenth century too.

Secondly, the Chevalier uses quotes from his conversations with Voltaire which indeed happend but it is impossible to remmeber the exact wording after years have passed and you start to write your memoires. 
This is true but there is proof that the Chevalier wrote down notes everyday after his conversations with Voltaire and later referred to these notes which makes it much easier to remember thing that happend a few years ago.

Lastly, the Chevalier claimes that he escaped a Venetian prison by making a hole in the ceiling with a piece of metal. This seems very unlikely to one side since this would have been quite hard. The Chevalier had powerful friends which might have bribed someone.
This seems very unlikely too since there were people with much more powerful friends that still did not escape. The ceiling had to be repaired shortly after the 
Chevalier escaped which makes the story in his momoires much more likely than it seems.

To conclude, both sides have found arguments to proof and disproof the memoires but you have to compare on your own to find out what you think is true.
