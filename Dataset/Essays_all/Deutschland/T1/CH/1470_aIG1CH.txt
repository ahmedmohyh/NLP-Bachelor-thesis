In the lecture, the three events described in the text "Chevalier" were logically defended against accusations as followed: first, his life as a wealthy man in Switzerland. It is a evidential fact, that he had to borrow money from a merchant, but, as he was a wealthy, not a rich man, this could well be, as he only owned property, not money itself. But to convert his property into money would eventually take some time, therefore it is possible, he had to take some loans to raise money. Next, his most accurate described conversation with Voltaire. Seemingly, no man could remember a conversations from years ago, but if he wrote it down immediatly after his talk with Voltaire, he could easily write it down in his memoir, and there are testimonies of witnesses, that state, that he actually used notes while working on his memoir. And last, his spectacular escape from the Prison in Venice. Many claim, that such an absurd escape is impossible, and he actually could only have bribed guards to release him. But as other, even more influentual people in the same prison weren't able to do so, the only possible solution that remains, is, that he escaped. And as governmental documents clearly state, that the roof of his prison cell needed repairs after his escape, his described way is the most possible solution.
