Chevalier de Seingalt

At first, there has to be mentioned that it is not possible for memoires to be correct in every detail.
Nevertheless Chavelier´s memoir seem to be pretty correct as there is quiet a lot evidence for it.

The first critic point is that he needed to borrow money in Switzerland even though he claimed in his memoires to be quiet rich.
However, his wealth consisted mainly of long-term assets which were not so easily selled for money when needed. Therefore he borrowed money for gambeling.

Next critic point is that his written down conversations with Voltaire were not correctly. 
But Chevalier actually took notes after every conversation with him and friends of him said that he used those indeed for his memoir.

Last but not least, critics claim that Chevalier did not broke out of the prison in Venice but rather that he got freed as he were politically well-connected.
Actually, there were prisoners with even better connections and even those were not freed. In addition to this there are even some documents that show that the Chavelier´s room were repared after he had broken out. So why should it need any reparation if Chavelier did not broke out?

In conclusion, you can say that the main critic points of his memoir are actually easily rejected by arguments as well as evidence.
