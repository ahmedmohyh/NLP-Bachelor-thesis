In the text "Chevalier" is mentioned that the figure Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) wrote a memoir about his life and adventures. In the sound documentation was said that this memoir is a famous reliable source in history and also the text decribes it as very important because Chevalier met many kings and queens or other important person. For example did he talk to the writer Voltaire and in his memoir exists conversations with him. The text explains that these conservations couldn't be real but in the sound documentation is told that relatives of Chevalier confirmed that these conversations between him and the writer Voltaire actually happened. 
The opinions of the text and the sound documentation are second time not the same. For once (in the text), Chevalier is described as a poor, controversial person but the sound documentation critisizes that point of view. It's said that he wasn't poor, he only had to wait a time for his money. That doesn't make him a poor one.
The text also questioned the escape of Chevalier from a prison in Venice. They point out that he actually just could escape because he had good friends who had a political connection. Critics say that he just wrote a dramatic escape because it's more exciting to read. The sound documentation doesn't agree with that. It's said that a document of the jail in Venice say that he really escaped and broke free - not that he were allowed to leave.
All in all the text really critizes the memoir of Chevalier and his realistic, it's just mentioned why his stories couldn't really happen. The documentation was sceptical about the memoir, too, but it's obvious that they believe what is written in the memoir and think about the fact that everything is based on something true.
