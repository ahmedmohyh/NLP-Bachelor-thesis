The text and the speek treat the actual truth which is contained in Chevalier's memoires from around 1780. While the text supports a critical point of view which suggests that Chevalier tried to make his life seem more interesting than it actually was, the woman's speek defends certain aspects. Chevalier wrote that he once lived in Switzerland where he became very wealthy. But according to the text, he might have borrowed money to finance his lifestyle. Anyway, to borrow money does not mean being poor, following the woman. Some years after important conversations with the philosopher and author Voltaire, Chevalier wrote down exact passages. But critics are sure that these conversations cannot be repeated accuratly several years later. In contrast, the speeker says, that he did not want to rewrite these conversations sentence by sentence but tried to conserve the conversations main contents so far as he remembered.
Chevalier also tells about his escape from the Venice prison. According to his memoire, the dug a hole into the ceiling of his prison cell. But the critical text states the higher possibility of help from political friends. The speeker woman answers with the fact, that the government of Venice actually had to repair the ceiling in one of the cells. 
Finally the real truth about the reliability of Chevalier's memoires will never be found out, but we anyway can get an interesting view into society structures during the 18th century.
