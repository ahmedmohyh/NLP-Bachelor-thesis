They say, that Chevalier wasn't really poor as it is said in lecture. He just spend much money on partys and gambling etc. So after that, he had to borrow some money. In the lecture they say, that he has to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But he just had to borrow some, because he ran out of money because of the many partys.
The second argument they bring on, is, that Chevalier had capture the conversations with the famous writer Voltair just minutes after they had spoken. It's completly diferent than the lecture. The lecture says, that he captured it years after, so that he doesn's even remember everything especially exact phrases from the conversation, they had spoken about. 
The third diferent thing is his escape from the prison in Venice.The text says, that Chevalier just said that he made a hole in the ceiling to escape, because it was very enjoyable for the reader and that he had many politcally friends in Venice that could have helped him to free him. But in the oral text, it is said that Italy had to repair the ceiling, because it was broken. So why does Italy have to repair it, if Chevalier doesn't escape through it? And if he had so many politcallly friends than, why does he have to escape through the ceiling. And the point is, they say in the oral text, that the other prisoners had many more friends in a politcally situation than Chevalier, who maybe would have helped them to free out of the prison than Chevalier.
