The first point which is made in the report was about Chevalier's money. It was told that Chevalier indeed was rich and had a huge mund of money, the only problem was that it took time for him to get his money. So while he was waiting, he borrowed money form somebody else. This point is different in the text. In the text it is said that he only claimed to be rich and borrowed his money from a Swiss merchant. The explenation in the text is if he has money and is very rich, why does he even need to borrow money then? The other part is his meeting with the famous writer Voltaire. He wrote about it many years after the conversation happend because the conversations between him and Voltaire were very detailed, it was high critizied. In the text it is said taht is is imossible to remember the complete coversation ever so detailed, while during the speech was claimed that Chevalier took notes and kept these notes during these years, before writing this conversation down. The last point in the speach was how he escaped from the prison in Venice. According to the speach he escaped even tough other prisoners had better chances. Also that a wall needed to be repared, which didn't make sense, because Chevalier claimed to fled differently like he did in the text, where he used a piece of metal to make a hole into he ceiling and fled through the roof. The text also points out different than the speach. It is said that he escaped because of his politically well-connected friends.
