In the speech, there were many arguments about the life and the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt.
The first argument, which was given, was, that no memoire can be completely accurate. When you compare this to the argumentation of the text it is quite different. The text informs the reader about, that some critics don't think, that the text is accurate.
Chevalier de Seingalt loved it to spend much money on parties and things like this. Everybody thought he was rich, because he spend so much money on unimportant things like those parties. But after some time, he had to borrow money from other people, because he run out of money. In the speech, the argument was given, that he wasn't poor just because he had to borrow some money. The author of the text had a different way to argue. He wrote, that critics think, that he doesen't have had to borrow those huge sums of money when he would have been rich. 
An other topin in the speech was, that Chevalier wrote a memoire about the conversation between him and Voltaire. Chevalier wrote this memoire many years after the conversatin between him and this famous person. So he could not remember everything from this conversation, but he wrote down the most important things he could remember. In concern to that, the text is more critical again. It are again those critics, which dont believe, that Chevalier and Voltaire had a conversation. They think it is a simple lie.
