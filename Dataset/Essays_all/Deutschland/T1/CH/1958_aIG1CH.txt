The memoirs of the Chevalier de Seingalt are a controversial theme because its unclear if they are accurate or not. In the following two opinions on that theme are compared.
In the given text the author writes about the critics that think that the Chevalier lied about some events mentioned in the memoirs. By way of example they do not think that he was as rich as he claimed but even had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. In the other text it was saidthat he was not poor  but only had a unusual way to get his money by investing it and sell things so he had to wait for getting back the money.
Another example is the relationship between him and Voltaire and their conversations that could not be written down that accurate after many years in the critics' opinion because there was no way of still remembering all the words and themes. The other text argues aganst that by mentioning the Chevalier's journals that he wrote right after talking to Voltaire.
Additionally one controversy is the way how the Chevalier got out of prison. In his memoirs he describes it as a escape through a hole in the ceiling but the critics think that his jailers were only bribed which was impossible in the opinion of the other text because even more wealthy prisoners weren't able to bribe them. To add evidence has proved that the ceiling in his cell had to be repaired after his escape.
To conclude there is evidence against the accuracy as well as for it and we can not be fully sure.
