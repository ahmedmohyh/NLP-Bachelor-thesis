To conclude I can san, that the listening gave me much m ore informations than the text. First the narrator told that the chevalier isn't poor. When he was in Swiss he spent much money on partys or something like this. But that doesn't mean thet he is spending his money like he has endless. He loves the Partys and because of that he did. He wasn't rich too. After he spent so much on Partys he had to wait till the money he would get from other sources came so he borrowed money. Secondly they've told that he wrote about the conversation he hab with Voltaire in his memoir at the end of his life. He took many notes in the years after the conversation. Third they've told that he escaped from prison but I didn't understand. 
In the text there is more aboute how he was going since he met famous people like kings and writers. For the second point the text is nearly the same as the listening I think. It is told about his wealth and his Partys in Switzerland. But they tell us more aboute the sources the chevalier has the money from. They said he borrowed it from a Swiss mechant and that he normally was very rich. But that's the opposite of the narrators statement in the listening.
The text tells also a lot about the escape from a notorious prison in Venice. the narrator in listening didn't told alot about it too. I Think
