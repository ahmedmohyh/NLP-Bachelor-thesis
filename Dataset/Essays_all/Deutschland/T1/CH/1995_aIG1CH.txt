The article about Chevalier and the explanation disagree in nearly every point.  
Not every memoire is correct and that is right but that memoire from Chevalier is nearly correct. He was not poor even if he borrowed money often. But borrowing money does not mean every time that he is poor. In case he had to wait for his money he borrowed money. And when he had money he send the money to parties and because of this point he was rich. 

Althoug the conversation between Chevalier and Voltaire is a conflict between the critics and the memoire. The critics say that it can not be that they conversed in that way and that the biography explained everything right. And that is right but is it really meant in a bad way if Chevalier had not remebered everything what was said? No, it is only human. 

The final argument is that he escaped out of prison with the help of his friends. That is what is said in the article written from the critics. But the memoire shows another side up. The other inhabitants of the prison had more powerful friends than Chevalier had. Is it that impossible to think of his escape which he did himself? That is the point where the meanings split up.

To conclude the two opinions about Chevaliers life are very different (only not to say in every point). To know which opinion is right you have to be Chevalier for himself. Or a person who lived in this century. And because of that is not possible everybody has to bear his own decision which opinion he or she will follow. The opinion of the critics which had not lived in Chevaliers century or Chevaliers memoire written by himself in his century.
