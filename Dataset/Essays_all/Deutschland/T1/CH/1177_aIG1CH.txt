Chevalier de Seingalt wrote many memoirs but he is said to be not honest about some actions. 
In the text, three different situations are mentioned:
First, it is said, that, when he was in Switzerland, he said he was rich, but it is proved that he borrowed money. In the text is said, that this fact proves a lie. In the audio, they said that it proves the opposite. Every good company has to borrow money so they can make money and become rich. Chevalier did so, too. 
The second situation is, that he met Volaire, the philosoph, and talked to him. A few years later, he wrote a memoir about the conversation. In the text they criticise, that he cannot know all the details after such a long time. But in the audio, they disagree. They say, that he took notes and he uses these notes to write the memoir, so there are no faults because of remembering problems. 
The last situation mentioned in the text was his prisonbreak in Venice. He himself wrote down, that he used metal to destroy the ceiling and break out. In the text, they doubt because he had ties to the Venetian government and these friends might have organised his escape. The audio also does not agree in this point. There are two different reasons mentioned: The first reason is that other prisoners had famous friends, too and they did not escape. Furthermore, there are hints that his room had to be repaired after his escape and that shows, that the theory is probably correct.
