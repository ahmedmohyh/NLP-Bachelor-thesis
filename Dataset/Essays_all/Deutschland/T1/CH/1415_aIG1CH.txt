The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote about his life in Switzerland, being a very wealthy man, who loved to spend time and money on parties and gambling. As people found out, Seingalt has borrowed a lot of money from a merchant, which would mean, that he couldn't have that much money, if he has to borrow it. Other than that the Chevalier told about his escape from a prison in Venice, which couldn't actually be true which was proofed years later. 
The memoir which he wrote is probably a summary of the most exciting things which happened in his life, but a lot seems to be unrealistic which means that he might have written it to make it more exciting.
