The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir which tells the story of a rich, an important men, but there are doubts on the accuracy.
First, the Chevalier borrowed money while describing himself as a rich man.
Then, he wrote in his memoirs how he talked to Voltaire, which can be seen as as a fact, but he wrote this chapter years after their meeting, so the details probably aren´t correct.
His escape out of prison was enabled by a piece of metal, but his prison was repaired after his escape.
The damage wasn´t convergent with the way Chevalier escaped.
In the text, there are doubts mentioned due to the fact, that the Chevalier had friends in Venice who were involved in politics and could propably have offered him a bribe.
