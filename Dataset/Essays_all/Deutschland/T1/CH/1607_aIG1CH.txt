The chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798. At the end of his life he wrote a memoir about his life. Many people have doubts if all of his stories are correct or if he made some of them up. He was known to be rich and for spending a lot of money on parties and gambling. But the Chevalier borrowed much money from a man in Italy, that´s why some think he was poor. But it could have been that becuase he spent so much money on partying and gambling he just waited for the money to arrive. Some people also wonder about the realistic of his stories because he wrote the memoires years after he adventured them, so he made many things up by his mind. But this isn´t true because after he adventured something he took notes, so he won´t forget what he did and how it happened. Then there are also people who don´t believe that he got out of the prison in Italy, by making a hole in the ceiling just with a piece of metal.They say he just got out because had some well-connected friends. But there is an evidence, because the employees from the prison had to repare his old ceiling.
