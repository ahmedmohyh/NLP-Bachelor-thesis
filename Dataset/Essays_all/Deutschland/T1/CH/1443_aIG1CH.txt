The woman said some arguments against the critics, which are skeptical if the chevalier said the truth in hir memoirs. the first argument of the critics is that if the chevalier was as rich as he said, he didn't need to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. But the woman said that the chevalier didn't have to be poor to borrow money, because if he wants to have more money he first have to sell some property and this is a process, which takes time( a few days) and for that time he need money to do his big partys. The second argument of the critics is that it is impossible to remember conversations so accurate like the chevalier did. So her argument against the critics is, that it is possible to write accurate conversations, because he wrote every nights notes about his conversations of this night. Thats the way he could remember it in such an accurate way. The third and last argument of the critics was that the chavalier couldn't escape the Venetian prison by himselve, so they said somebody (like some politically well-connected friends) helped him. The womans argument against this was that some people in this prison had "bigger"/ more well-connected frieds. So why theire frieds didn't help them? Also she said that after the chevalier escape from prison hir room has to be repaired.
