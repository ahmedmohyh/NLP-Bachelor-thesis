The following text is about Critics. They say that Chevalier publish a conversation with Voltaire, who was a famous writer, but no one ever knows, that they met and talked to each other. Moreover they criticize his escape from the prison in Venice, because he has a lot of friends in Venice, who were politically well-connected and so they could help him out of the prison.

Noone exactly knows what of both possibilities happend, so you can't say what's right and what's not.
