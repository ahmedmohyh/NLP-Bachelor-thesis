The memories of Chevalier de Seingalt, wich he wrode after his death, are correct and accurate sources. Everything that Chevalier wrote down is correct in every single word. Many Critics think that the point that he had to borrow many is sceptical, because Chevalier it self said the he was a wealthy man. The fact that he had to borrow many was correct, but it was not because he were poor. He just had to wait for his money everytime, for wich he had work for. Partys and stuff he liked a lot, so he spend a big amount of money for it. After a time he run out of money so he had to borrow it and hgive it back after he recieved his own money. The Critics cannot believe this explanation. They are not familier with the fact that he was a wealthy man and still had to get money fro other people. Because of that point they think that pretty much from the memories of Chevalier de Seingalt are not true.
The fact that Chevalier escaped the prison ``Holywood like``, by using a piece of metal to destroy the ceiling to have space to climb through the roof many Critics also cannot believe. But why had the cell in wich Chevalier was be repaired at the ceiling after he was there? It only can be because he escaped through the wohle in the wall over the rooftops. The critics think that he had many political assistens, because he met many famous people like writers or kings. All of were able to help in get out out of the prison. The written memories of Chevalier are telling a different story. The fact that the ceiling in the cell of him was broken is a simple fact for escaping the prison through the rooftops....!
