The text was about the memoirs of Chevalier Seingalt (1725-1798), in which he wrote about his life. Since he lived in the eighteenth century, it is a good source about the European society in this time. Though there are some critics, who believe that not all stories were true, there are also a lot of people, who say that his memoirs are a reliable source.
As he lived in Schwitzerland, he said that he was living in wealth and had a lot of money. But critics found out, that he borrowed money from someone else. Believers in Chevalier say, that he just invested money in something and to wait to get it back and that is why he borrowed it from another man. Also critics are concerned about how reliable the conversation of him and Voltaire was, because he wrote it many years later and would not be able to remember excatly what he said. It is possible though, that he made notes after the talk to remember everything.
Another point is story about an escape from a prison with a metal piece. Critics believe that he would not be able to carve a hole in wall with it and rather say that he could escape, because he had some friends with a lot of power. Othe
