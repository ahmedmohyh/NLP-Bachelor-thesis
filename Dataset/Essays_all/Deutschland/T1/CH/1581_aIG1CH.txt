Chevalier de Seingalt was a debated person, people question him and try to prove that he was a faker of his own life.
Chevalier wrote his whole life as a memoir and tells everything he did in this book, so there are stories and adventures included, but people who worked with his memoir found out that not everything he wrote was right as he told it. 
People say Chevalier was very rich, in his memoir he tells from parties and events he organised and that he has spent a lot of money. There are critics who think he lied, because they found out that he borrowed a bunch of money from a merchant. Logically they say he wasn't that rich when he has to borrow money. But others say that he only sold his property and got his money from selling things, which were very expensive.
Another debated story is his escape from the Venetian prison by getting out with a selfmade hole in his room. Some explain this story different, that he had very important and powerful friends which were connected good in Venice so that they bought or discussed him free. The argument for the story is that critics found out that the room which he had been locked in had to be repaired in that time he escaped. So why would they repair his room when his friends got him free with their connections.A evidence also shows that he wasn't the only person who had good connection in Venice, other prisoners were named, who even had more well-connected and powerfull friends than Chevalier.
