The first fact that was pointed was that most of the chevaliers in Switzerland pay a lot of money for parties and gamblings, that was the daily routine of these kind of people. So the critic, that the Chevalier spend so much money on them is not correct.
In the text is written down, that it is possible that the Chevalier wasn´t as rich as he said. He often had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. The female in the second text said, that this is right and a fact, but questioned if a person who borrows money, is a poor person. The Chavalier had to borrow moiny because his textes needed a periode of time, so that he could earn money from them. Another critic is, that Chavalier sayed in his textes, that he escaped from the prison. People say, that he had some friends with very big influence of the government of Switzerland, so the idea is, that he didn´t escaped on his own, he just paid money to his friends and they let him free. In contract to that is, that the ceiling, where he had lived in was damaged on the roof after his escape and the prison had to repair it. Also there were many other mans in the prison, who had much more influence and friends where it seemt that they could get them out, but none of them managed to get free befor the periode of time was over.
Chacvalier had written down the conversations, after they were hold, so it is possible, that he knew some exact phrases which persons said many years ago.
