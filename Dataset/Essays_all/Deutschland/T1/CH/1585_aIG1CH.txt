The text and also the listening part are about a chevalier. 
The text tells about him writing a memoir about his life and adventures. 
In this memoir he tells about meeting famous people that were for example kings or writers like Voltaire.
But later he was claimed to have not always written the truth and to have invented interesting events.
One of these were his experiences of gambling and parties. He told that he had to borrow money. This is criticised because a man who has big property does not need to borrow money from others. 
He did also write about famous Voltaire in his book and gives citations from conversations between them. It is almost impossible to remember things exactly that have been said years before.
Finally the text tells about Chevaliers having been on prison in Italy and his escape. In his memoir he wrote that he had escaped alone without any outer influence but it is known that he had friends in Venice who could help him. 
The difference between the listening part and the reading parts could not be understood very well because there were problems with the headphones. I think that the things were better explained in the listening part and there were more details but that is all.
