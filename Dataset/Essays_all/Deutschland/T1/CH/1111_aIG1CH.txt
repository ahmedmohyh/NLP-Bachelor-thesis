Chevalier de Seingalt met very important people in the eighteenth century and his memoir is a valuable historical source about the European society in the eighteenth century. But many people have doubts about his memoir. He said that he lived in Switzerland and was very wealthy and spent money on parties. But he had to borrow money and a wealth person had not borrowed money. Another doubt is the recording from the conversations in his memoir with Voltaire. The memoir was written years after the conversation with Voltaire so it is not so accurate. Also his story about his escape from a prison in Venice, Italy is a doubt. He said that he made a hole by using a piece of metal and after that he climbed through the roof. So he wrote that for an enjoyable reading. They argue that Chevalier had many politically well-connected friends in Venice and they could had offered him a bribe.
