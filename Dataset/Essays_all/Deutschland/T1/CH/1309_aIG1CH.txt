The speech about the Chevalier was split in three parts. The first part was about the Chevalier himself. They said, that he was rich and spent lots of money on  gambling and parties. At one day, he had to borrow money, because he lost almost everything. 
The second part was about a specific night. The Chevalier wrote down everything, he remembered. In the text, nothing is mentioned about this night.
The third part was about the escape out of a jail in Venice, Italy. The Chevalier escaped through the ceiling, which had to be repaired. The other prisoners had good friends in Venice, which were a big political part. The Chevalier didn't had these connections, so he had a minor chace to get out of the prison legally. In the text is written down, that he had politically well-connected friends in Venice, which he never had. Nothing about the broken ceiling is mentioned too.
The second part of the text is about the conversations of the Chevalier and Voltaire. The name Voltaire wasn't said in the speech, so these parts are completely different.
