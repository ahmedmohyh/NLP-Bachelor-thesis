In the text had been written  in Chevalier´s memories parts hab been invented. First its said that he wasnt rich at all, he always had to borrow some money for parties and gambling from a swiss merchant but that isnt true. Its right that he sometime had to borrow some money from people like the swiss merchant but Chevalier was very wealthy but he just had property and if he los his money during gambling or parties then he had to sell some of his property to earn some money again. And that took some time so he borrow some money if he needed some but was wealthy enough to pay it back. 
Also in the text it is ment that he never had a converation with the famous writer Voltaire or that he must had invented many parts. But he really met Voltaire and he really had a conversation with him and after he had this conversation with Voltaire he exactly wrote down phras by phrase about what they talked about.
Also in the text it is ment that his escape out of prison must be a lie because he had very powerful friend in venice and that these powerful men ordered to get him out of the prison. But something like that never happend, some of the prisoners had much powerful friends then him and they never had been rescued so Chevalier hadnt been rescued. He really used a piece of metal to make a big hole in the ceiling and climed through the roof into freedom. It is fact that during these days that a ceiling had to be repared. So his spectectular escape must be the truth.
