In the presentation it was say that Chavalier was not poor like in the text, he had to borrow money from the merchant to made more money, although he had a big wealth.
Also it is said that the story with his conversations with Volraire is true. The Chavalier wrote everything from this converstaions down every night, so he can remember every single part after many years.
And it said too that the Chavalier can eycape from the prison in Venice on the way he said, that is shown through the sealing being prepared.
This statements are different to the statements in the text. But in every point the conversation explain why the text have to be wrong. In contrast to the presentation the text says, that Chavalier was poor, because he borrow much money,  that he can not have a real conversation with Voltaire, because he can not imagine everything after many years and that he can not escape from the prison, because it is quite unrealistic.
