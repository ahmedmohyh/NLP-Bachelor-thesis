In speak for the audience states that nearly everything which was written from Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725-1798, about his live is true and that there examples for the things that happened in his live. But the text says the completly opposite so that everything Chevalier wrote is wrong and he just wanted to make his live more interisting. First of all the speaker states that Chevaliker was rich while he was living in Swiss because of all the money he spend on parties and gambling and for the reason of that he needed to borrow some money because he was waiting for the money from his job. The text states to this point that if he really had been rich he wouldnt had to borrowe money. The next the speaker states is that while he was meeting and talking with the famous writer Voltaire he wrote always notes which he could use as he wanted to write his memories down. The text argues against this that he cannot had captured every conversation so this would mean that he doesnt said the truth and so was lying in his memorys and never met Voltaire. Furthermore Chevalier escaped out of the Venice prison just by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and this was also stated in the document about the escape from the Venice police. So it was stated that the ceiling had to be repaired after the escape. The text argues that it havent been possible to escape out of the prison.
So all in all one can say that the text states that Chevalier didnt said the truth in his memories and just wanted to make his live more interisting.
