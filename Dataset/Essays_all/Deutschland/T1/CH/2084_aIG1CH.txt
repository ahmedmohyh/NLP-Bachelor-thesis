In her presentation the woman said something about the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt and gave some arguments why his written "stories" are true. 

The first story that is often discussed is about his life in Switzerland because he wrote in his book that he was very rich and had a great life there. But critics are very skeptical about this because there are a lot of hints that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant and so he could not be a rich man. Against that the woman said in her speech that when someone borrows money it does not always mean that the person is poor. 
After that she talked about the part of his memoir where he wrote that he had a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire and what they were talking about.  The critics are saying the conversation was many years before Chevalier wrote his memoir and so it is not very possible to remember every sentence in a conversation. That is the reason why they are thinking that not everything in Chevalier's description of his talk with Voltaire can be true. But the woman said that he could make some notes quite short after this and so he had some good notes and could remember original sentences or just their meaning. 
The last point she was talking about is Chevalier's escape from the prison in Venice,Italy. Because he wrote that he just escaped with a piece of metal with which he made a hole in the ceiling and then he climbed over the roof. The woman told that this can be true because his ceiling must had been fixed after his time in it and that the argument from the critics in which they are saying that maybe some of his friends who had a good connection to the politicians helped him to escape must not be true because in the same prison were some persons with better connection to such people than he had. 

To conclude you can say that it is just a mirracle if Chevalier's stories are true or not.
