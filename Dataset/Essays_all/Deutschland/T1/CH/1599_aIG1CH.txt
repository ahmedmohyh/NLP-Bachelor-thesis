The Chevalier de Seingalt was a person who went on many adventures and met many famous people. He lived from 1725-1798 in Europe and in his lifetime he wrote a long memoir about all the things he experienced. It is said, that the Chevalier hat lots of money during his life in Switzerland, but spend it all on parties and gambling so he had to bowwow money. It is also critizised about him, that he wrote some conversations with famou speople years after the point where it happened, so maybe it ist not right, what he was writing, because he would n ot remember everithing exactly. In his memoir he also tells, that he escaped from prison, buy it is said that it`s not true, but the jailers let him go, bevcause he was well-connected with many venetian politicans.
