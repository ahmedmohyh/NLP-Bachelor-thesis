The first point, which is discussed, is the question wether the Chevalier was rich or poor. In the text it says that he indeed was wealthy and spend alot of money on gambling and partys but it also asked why he should borrowed money from a merchant, when he was so rich. In the audio part we heard that it was 

The second point mentioned is the accuracy of the captured conversation, the Chevalier had with Voltaire. The text complains that it's impossible to remeber the exact phrases, from a conversation held years earlier. In the audio part we learn that the Chevalier really met Voltaire and that he capt notes of the conversation, which he used later on for the memoires. There are even people who claim to know that the Chavilier took notes all along.
The third point deals with his escaped from a notorouis prison in Venice. The text says that he wrote it in a way it would be more pleasing for the reader. It also says that it would be more likly that a politically well-connected friend offered a bribe. The audio has another oppinion. In the audio they point out that there were people in jail with him who had way politccallier and well-connecteter friend than the Chevalier had. So that he would be bribed by a friend is not really possible. They also refer to the fact, that the Chevalier broke out by cutting a hole in his roof of the cell. The audio gives us the fact, that the jail stuff had to repare soon after the escape from the Chevalier the ceiling of the cell. So a escape as mentioned in the memoaries seems possible.
