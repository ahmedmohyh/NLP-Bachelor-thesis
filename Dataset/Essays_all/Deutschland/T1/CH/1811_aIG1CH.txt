In the following I am going to write an essay according to one text and one lectors speech about the Chevalier, who lived in the 18th century and wrote a long memoir about his life. 
The Chevalier is a somehow contraversial person because in his memoir he claims that he had met with kings and writes and that he had wealth while staying in Switzerland. There are some critcs that argue that if Chavelier would have been so rich he would´nt have to borrow himself money. The theory, according to a history lector, behind this story is that Chevalier had a great amount of investings and so sometimes when he had to wait for the money he lacked, he needed to borrow it. 
The next part about his life is pretty discussed as well, because Chevalier had whole phrases of his conversation with Voltaire in mind, years later. And so the critics claim that one is not able to recapture such ammount of information years later. The explanation of the history lector on this topic is that Chevalier has written it all down when he met with Voltaire so that when one time he would write his memoir he would be able to recapture it. 
The last contradictial tpoic about his life is his escape out of the prison in Venice. In claims to got out of it by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling. The spectical voices say that he would have had friends under the politicans and so he could offer a bribe. To this history captured in his memoire the history lector give the evidence that the cell had been restored after his break-out and you don´t need to restore a cell if it would not have been destroyed. There were others with good connections as well and they didn´t got out.
So may be some of the stories are even true
