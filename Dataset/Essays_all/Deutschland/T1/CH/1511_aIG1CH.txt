The Chevalier de Seingalt who lives from 1725 to 1798 wrote a memoir about his life. He met very much famous people during his life of big adventures. But there are critics who say his memoirs are not accourat enought. They say he has invented parts of his life to make it more interesting to the reader. There are evidences that he borrowed money for his events and partys. But the Chevalier was a very rich person so it makes no sense for him to borrow money from someone else. An other point why his critics are very skeptical is that he wrote about conversations, like the one with Voltaire, years after they have talked to each other. There is the question how could he remind phrases of these conversatins after all this years. In his memoirs he wrote about the escape from a notorious prision in Venice where he uses a pice of metal to make a hole in his cell. Critics say some politicians who were his friends helped him to escape but there were prisioners with friends who have a bigger influence than his friends. This all speaks for it that the Chevalier invented parts of the story.
