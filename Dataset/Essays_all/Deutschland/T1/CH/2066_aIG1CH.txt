The women in the listening part is sure, that the memoires about the Chevalier are true, although she says that there are some points where there is a little confusion. So it might be true that the chevalier spent lots of money in Switzerland and that he had a wealthy lifestyle but it isn´t true that he was still rich  a couple of time later, as he had to borrow money.
Then there are some critics in the text which is about a meeting of the Chevalier and Voltaire (a famous person) . The text critisize that the Chevalier wrote the conservation a couple of years later and that is impossible. But in the listening part is said that he had taken some notices about the conversation even in the same night of the apointment.
The text also doubts the fact that he escaped the prison of Venice by using a piece of metal to destroy the wall and escapes above the roof. He had a very good connection to friends in Venice who could free him easyly. On the other hand, the listening parts says that the wall was actually destroyed and there were other people in prison who had even bigger names and might have escaped more quickly than the Chevalier, because they had even better connections.
So the listening part has the opinion that the chevalier actually had lived like it is told in the memoires, but the text thinks the glamourpus life isnt true.
