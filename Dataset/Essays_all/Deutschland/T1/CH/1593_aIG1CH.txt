The memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) recounting his life and adventures is controversial topic. It is counted as one of the most important and reliable sources about European society in the 18th century although there have always been doubts concerning the accuracy of the events. 

In his book, Chevalier describes that he is a rich man and lives in Switzerland living for parties and gambling. Research presented that he borrowed money. However, some people say that it was normal even for a rich man to sometimes borrow money because they were having parties quite too often. 
Undoubtedly, Chevalier met a couple of famous people which drew attention on him. One of this people was the writer Voltaire which he had conversations with. In public, it is highly debated whether these conversations were really like Chevalier describes them. On the one hand, some people say that he could have not been accurate with the information because the wrote his memoir at the end of his life so he could have not remembered all the details he lists up. On the other hand, he might wrote down notes after each conversation as a diary entry. 
The most controversial thing about Chevalier's memoir is definetely his escape from a Venecian prison. The author claims to have escaped by removing the ceiling using a piece of metal and then climbing through the roof. It is not clear whether this version is true or whether he just had politically well-connected friends who could have helped him although this description of the events should have not been that rarely or even more legendary escapes should have taken place. 

All in all, Chevalier's memoir is pretty accurate over all and can be used as reliable historical source. Probably, we will never know what really happened but in my opinion, everyone has the right to a little legend about his own being.
