The text is about Chevalier de Seingalt, who wrote a memoir of his life. the text says that many points of his memoir are wrong, but the person from the speech said the opposite. They say that no memoir could be right in every detail, but the memoir from Chevalier is pretty accurate and reliable. So they think that the text that critizices Chevalier's memoirs is wrong. a critical point from his memoirs is the part where he wrote about the meeting with Chevalier. The text says, that he wrote his memoirs many years after the meeting and no one could remember the a conversation that detailful. However the person in the speech said, that its pretty sure that Chevalier had the conversation with Voltair and that me made notes about that conversation just in the night after their meeting. So when he wrote his memoirs, he wrote down what he can remember and take the help of his notes. That shows that his memoirs are trustful.
They also think that its right its right that he escaped from the  Venetian prison by using a piece of metal, while the text have doubts about the truth of the story.
The author of the text thinks that it is more likely that some of Chevaliers friends in Venice offered a bribe.
the speaker also says that its a fact that that Chevalier was very rich.
To pu it into a nutshell you can say that the speaker of the spee ch says the oppsite of the text.
