One example against the accuracy of the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt was the fact that he had to borrow much money while living in Switzerland, but just because of that he mustn't be poor. After gambling the money needs some time to arrive, so he had to borrow some money until that. Another reason against is the accuracy of conversations he had with Voltaire. People say that he couldn't know those exact conversations after such long time, but he took notes his hole life to remember those things to write them down. The third point against was the fact that he said that he escaped from a prison in Venice. Critics say that he got freed instead of escaping through the roof, but the point is, that the ceiling had to be repaired after he was free and there was no other reason for doing that.
