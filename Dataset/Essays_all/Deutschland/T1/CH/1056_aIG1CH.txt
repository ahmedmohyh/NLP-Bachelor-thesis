The man Chevalier de Seingald lives from 1725 to 1798. He wrotes alot of things especially about his life and adventures. He meets many famous people and writers so his memoir about his life and adventures gets very famous. It seems like his life was very interessting, exiting, wunderfull and glamerous but it wasn`t. First he lives in Swizerland and there he spend a lot of money for partys. He loves this life. So maybe he had many girls and even not a real girlfriend. What a man...He had many conversations at night with different people and this conversations where in this memoir too. He do this for many years like he woman said. His favorites dialogues were these with the famous people like Voltaire. He wrotes notes to every conversations that´s a kind of scary. Chevalier was in prision in Venice, Italy. He escaped from there. He does this with a piece of metal what is very clever , I think. But he hasn`t very powerfull friends what is very bad. But what is important to say is , that he had a number ofpolitically friends in Venice who helped him. And after that the prision had to be repaired because of the hole in the roof. This escape is maybe the most interessting act in his memoir because for some people is an escape very exiting and not even a normal thing that you do every day. So very many people read this with fun.  But later on in his life he gets very poor because he spend a lot of money for girls, partys and different things. The woman talks very motivided about this man so maybe she likes his kind of work.
