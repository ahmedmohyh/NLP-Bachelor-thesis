The text "Chevalier" is about the life by Chevalier de Seingalt.

The chevalier wrote a long memoir about his life and adventures. He mets a lot's of kings and big writers during his life. His memoir is an important historical source for the 18th century. He was spending a lot of time in Switzerland where he was spending a lot of money on parties and gamblings. But in his memoir his life is more exciting and glamarous than it really was.Critics are very skeptical with some points of his memoir. For example with the conversation between chevalier and the writer Voltaire. That means that not every detail in his memoir is correct. A few years later he got catched in Italy. He must go in the prison of Venice but he escaped the prison. Some people say that he got help by an gouvenor of Venice but in his memoir he tells that he had a piece of metal. And with this piece of metal he was made a hole in the wall and climbed through the roof. This story is very exciting but it isn't a realistic story.
Also chevalier was writng over conversations from the last night. He wrote down this conversation at the next. Maybe he get drunked last night.
