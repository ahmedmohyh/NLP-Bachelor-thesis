The Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) was a controversial figure and everything he discovered in his life he wrotes down.
We can say that he is a histroical source because in the eighteenth century he mets a lot people, therefore he knows a lot European society. In contrast to this point there were also some people who critics him.
In his time living in Switzerland the Chevalier was wealthy, accordingly he spends a lot of money there. Because of borrowing money fromm a Swiss merchant the critics were confused.
The critics were also skeptical about the conversation between the Chevalier and the famous writer Voltaire. They said that he can't remember the exact phrases Voltaire said because the conversation was a long time ago.
The last point is the escape out of the prison in Venice. The critics said that the Chevalier may have a lot of political friends and in prison they were bribed to free him.
All in all we could say that the critics were really skeptical about Chevaliers life.
