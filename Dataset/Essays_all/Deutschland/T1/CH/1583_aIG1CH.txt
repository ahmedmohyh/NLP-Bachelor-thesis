In the text about Chevalier, the teacher talked about three episodes of his life. The first one was about his money. Differently to the other text, the teacher says that Chevalier was a rich person who liked to spend his money on partys. Even if inthe text it says that he always borrowed money from someone else, the teacher is convinced that it only seems like this because he got his money a few days later but had enough property to spend that much money.
Furthermore the teacher said that he wrote down every word of the conversations he had with Voltaire every night which is different to what the other text tells. Because there it says that the conversations where written down years after and that it is impossible to remember exact what was said.
At last point his escape from the prision in Venice is questioned. The text says that he did not escape by himself but that his jailers were bribed to free him. The teacher's opinion is that other inprisions had much more powerful friends and no one has ever been able to escape. In addition, Chevaliers old prision room has been repared which shows that he escasped by making a hole in the ceiling.
