The Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1789) wrote a long memoire about his life and adventures towards the end of his life.
He was just like his memoire was a very controversial person. Some people say that his work has become a valuable source about the European society in the 18th century but other say that big parts of his storys aren't correct and very unaccurate.
He speaks about three big episodes of his life. 
The first one is his life as a wealthy swiss merchant who spends most of his money for parties and gambling. Some people don't understand where he got his big amount of money from.
The second episode is about the relationship to Voltaire. Nobody doubts that the conversations between the two men existed, but the Chevalier wrote the book from notes he took while he talked to Voltaire. Together with the fact that he wrote the memoire many years later the final version inside his book can be questioned and may be incorrect.
The third and last part is the escape from the prison in Venice. The question for this part is the method of escaping. He wrote that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof. But the more likely theory may be that the Chevalier's jailers were bribed to free him because he was well-connected a number of politically friends in Venice.
