The speaker of the presentation claimed that the memoires of the Chevalier de Seingalt are an accurate and valuable source of information about the European society in the eighteenth century. During the presentation the speaker defends the accuracy of those memoires and dismantles doubts about the accuracy of them. Concerning the matter that he apparently was not wealthy while living in Switzerland, the speaker stated that the fact that he borrowed money from a merchant is no evidence for him being poor, yet she firmly believed that he was indeed very wealthy.
Furthermore she also claims that the conversations of the Chevalier with the writer Voltaire are also indeed real. She backs this up saying that the Chevalier wrote down what was said in the conversations the day they were held. Apparently witnesses of that time have confirmed this.
And lastly, the speaker also claimed that the Chevalier did not bribe the jailers to free himself, because even with good connections you wouldn't be able to bribe the jailers. While saying that, the speaker also ensures us of the accuracy of the story that the Chevalier told, she claims that he indeed made a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof.
