Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) wrote a memoir about his life, including his adventures. But there are critics, who think that not everything he wrote is true. Chevalier wrote that while he was living in Switzerland he was very wealthy and spent a lot of money by partying and gamling but those critics are saying that  he borrowed a huge amount of money from a swiss merchant. In the speech that I have listened the woman argued that he spent the money on parties and gambling so he needed more so he borrowed money while he was wainting for it.
Another thing that the critics are sceptical about is that he couldn't remember all those memories especially the conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. They say that it's not possible to remember the exact phrases of the conversation, years afterwards. But the woman holding the speech says that after each conversation with Voltaire he wrote the phrases down and kept those. 
Also the point that he escaped from prison by using a piece of metal seems unrelistic.
