First, it is said that no memoir is completely accurate and that Chevalier's memoirs actually have a very high accuracy.
In the text, the first argument about the lack of accuracy is that he wrote in his memoirs about being very rich, going to parties and gambling. But in reality he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. However, the presentation disagrees with the argument that he was not poor, he just had wealth which had to be sold for him to get money. So of course he had to borrow some money.
Chevalier had conversations with Voltaire. The problem is, that he wrote exact sentences years after actually conversing with Voltaire. But this was made possible by noting down everything he remembered the night after the conversation. So he kept the notes and recreated the talks with Voltaire years after.
Furthermore, Chevalier was in Venice, Italy where he was in prison. In his memoirs he describes making a hole in the ceiling and escaping. The author of the text says that he probably just had friends who bribed him out. Nevertheless, other prisoners had even richer friends who could not bribe them out. Furthermore it is confirmed that the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired so it could still be possible that he escaped.
