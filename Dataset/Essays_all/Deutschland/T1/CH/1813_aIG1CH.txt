The chevalier wrote a memoire about his life. It talks about some interesting meetings with famous persons, but also about his journey to other countries. Critics say that it is quite impossible that the chevalier can think of every word he said in his life and include them to his memoire exactly. They also say that when the chevalier talks about his wealth, he seems to forget that he borrowed big sums of money in Switzerland. In this point of view the text shows the same opinion as in the 'Vortrag'. In fact that the chevalier really met some famous persons, the text says that it is pretty unsure that he has a real conversation with Voltaire because nobody doubt this conversation. But it's also impossible that the chevalier can think of every word in this conversation as it seems in his memoire.
