Chevalier, was a man living in the eighteenth century and he was a very controversial person and today theire many different views and meanings about him. That is what i am going to summarize in the following text.

In an audience about him the woman told that they hadn't any ideas who he escape from the prison and in the text below it says that he made a whole by using a piece of metal to climb out of the roof. Another reason is that noboby trust him that he had a conversation with the famous writer Voltaire although he recordet this in a memoir which is today a very important source about the European society in the 18th century.
Critics said that he couldn't be able to made the memoir may years after the conversation took place. The woman who made the audience disagree that this really take place like he said
