This lecture was about the Chevalier de Seingalt and his doubted adventures. It actually tries to proof the critics wrong.
The first adventure they are talking about is the long for merchant in switzerland. While the critics in the text source explain the borrowing of money with missing wealth, the woman from the lecture has another theory.  According to her Chevalier had a job in which you often have to wait some time for your money to arrive and that is the reason, why he borrowed some in switzerland.
The first adventure she refers to is the conversation with Voltaire. The lecture says, after the meeting between the famous writer and the writer of the memoirs,
he instantly wrote down the words in the next night. The critics however think he wrote it down years later.
The last adventure is about the escape from the prison in Venice. The fact that the Chevalier had powerfull friends is the critics reason to think about a bribe for the jailors instead of his discribed escape with a piece of metal. The lecturer however told the fact, that the ceiling had to be repared a few days after.
