Chevalier de Seingalt was a very controversial and figure in history. He lived from 1725-1798 and  wrote a long memoir in  which he claims to have met many famous people from his time. He is a very controversial figure, due to his claims. While some people believe that he only wrote the truth , others believe that some or most claims from him are false. 
One example for this is his escape from prison in Venice. He was prisoned in Venice and he claimed, that the broke out of the prison by climbing trough the roof, with a hole ,that he himself made with a piece of metal. People that believe the Chevalier suggest , that it is  likely that this happened like he says , others believe him not. Evidence for people that believe Chevalier is   that documents were found today, which suggest that  the roof in the prison needed to be repaired after his escape.

One other point that strengthens Chevaliers believebility, is that he used lots of notes , while writing his memoirs.So that he used notes from years ago to write his text. The people that critic Chevalier in contrast are saying that some of his conservations cant be true because of time d
