In the presentation the woman said different things as in the text. She critics, that the if the Chevalier would have been rich, he wouldn't be in need of borrowing some money from wealthy people in Switzerlannd, where he was living for a while, if his memoirs aren't invented. Also she says, that it is true that he met the famous Voltaire, but the things about they talked aren'tr true because after a few years he couldn't remember about exactly every theme they talked about. The woman also says, that he really broke out of the prison in Venice, but on a littlebit different way. He met in his life really famous people, and also in Venice he had some of his friends, who offered him a bribe to get out of the prison.
All in all I can say that the Chevalier wrote a lot of lies, but alwways with some true storys in it.
