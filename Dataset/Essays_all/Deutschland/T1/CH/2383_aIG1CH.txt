In the beginning of the audio extract the woman said that no memoir can be perfect at all but the Chevalier's memoir is very accurat. To proof this she pointed out the following statemants:
Fistly in the heard text was mentioned, that the fact that he borrowed mony from a merchant in switzerland do not mean, that he was not rich. It is explained, that he just had to arrive and before he could sell any things he had to borrow some money because he needed a place to live. After he had borrowed some, he started to sell things like before so he could pay it back. That means that he does not have to be poor just because he borrowed money. They is nothing said about the amount of money he borrowed.
To the third paragraph the woman said that Chevalier wrote down the conversations years later as they really happened but they are things existing which proofs that he had maked notes after any conversation so he could wrote them done very exactly.
In the audio extract it is also said that the prison in italy from which Chevalier broke out, had to be repare the ceiling in his cell in about the same period of time. So it could be possible that he indeed broke out of the prison and made a hole in the ceiling as he wrote in his memoir.
