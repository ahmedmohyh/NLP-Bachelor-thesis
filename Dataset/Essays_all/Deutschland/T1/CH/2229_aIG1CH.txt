The Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798, captured his whole live in his memoir. 
Firstly he wrote down the whole conversation with Voltaire but in the text they say he could not remember all of the conversation after many years, where he wrote his memoir. But it is quite conradicting because he wrote the whole conversation down so he does not to remember the conversation because he has it written down.
Secondly in the text it is stated that he did not escaped the prison by escaping through the ceiling with a piece of metal but he or one of his politically well-connected friends in Venice bribed the jailers so he could escape. But in the prison they had the roof repaired so he could easily escape through the roof by using a metal piece. 
And lastly in the texit it is stated that he wrote in his memoir that he was quite wealthy but borrowed big sums from a Swiss merchant. I could not understand the information from the presentation because i needed to fix the audio so i can not write anything relating to this topic.
