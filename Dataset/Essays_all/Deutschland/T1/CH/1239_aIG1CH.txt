The text and the presentation are about the Chevalier de Seingalt, who wrote a long memoir about his life and adventures. 
The text tells that he was an controversial figure and that he invented in many events. He mets many famous people and so his memoir become a valuable historical source about European society. He also borrowed very much  money in switzerland , so the critics had a point to attack him. They have said that, if the Chevalier was such a rich man, he wouldn't needed to borrow money. A famous writer, named Voltaire met the Cheveral and they have a conversation and  
the Cheveral write this conversation down in his memory. Critics said that he couln't remember the exact phrases from the conservation.
He also writes that he escaped the prison just by using a peace of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof.
The presentation tells that no memorys could be absolutely correct, because many of these points are a long time ago. He sprends much money and time in partys and theres told also that he borrowed money. He also hadn't as much friends as other prisioners.
So the text and the presentation don' agree absolutely.
