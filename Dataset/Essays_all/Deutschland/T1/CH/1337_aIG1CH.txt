Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life and the anventures coming with it at the end of his life. Some critics believe that these quite famous memoirs are not entirely correct and that Chevalier may have wrote some stories to be more interesting rather than displaying the reality but their are also some experts how think that the stories are actually true.
For example he wrote that he was very rich while living in Switzerland but there are sources that document him borrowing money from a merchant so he couldn't have been very rich. Some experts think that he borrowed money for a very short time while he was selling estates so in reality he was wealthy, but just didn't had the money itsself for a short period of time.
He also claims that he broke out of prision by making a hole in the ceiling and there are actually documents from Venice saying that the ceiling of the cities prison was repaired in the same period he claimed to escape from it. Critics on the other hand just believe that the jailers were bribed in order to free him rather than a real escape from prison.
In his memoirs talks with Voltaire are mentioned but they are deescribed very well so critics think he just invented many of them while writing. Others claim that he wrote the content of each talk down in the evening so he could remember it better so he could just refer to his notes in his memoir.
In the end both groups could just refer to documents that are very old and inaccurate or just invented to make his story seem more realistic but no one will probably ever know who of them is right.
