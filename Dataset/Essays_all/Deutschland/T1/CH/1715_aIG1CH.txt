The presantation mostly discribed why the memoir from the Cavalier is a lie. It was said that nobody can reamember adventures that accuratly and also there is much proof about the captured adventured, that shows what really happend.
At the presantation the main points from the text were discribed but not nearly discribed like the escape from the prison was mentiont and also why that was unlikely but it was not nearly dicribed. I think the presantation was summed up to the diffrent adventures and why they were not possible but it does not really discribed what was written in the memoire. Also there were no specific information about the Chavalier just a very short introduction. In the text, the author often presentet the opinion of critics and not his own opinion but at the presentation the women seemd to speek for these critics and to share their opinion.
