In the explanaition, which I just heard, the woman concers the critics of the text about Chevalier. She said, that the events in his memoir were pretty accurate but in the text the critics say that he invented many storys. 
 In the seconds of three Episodes, the text tell us how Chevalier lived in Switzerland and how fake his wealthy was. The critics said, that he borrowed considerable sums of money and that must stand for that he werent very rich. But the woman said that he was rich and, as both said, he spend his money for parties. She said that he had to wait for his money sometimes and thats why he borrowed money.
The critics also said that the conversations with Voltaire were also not like he described them. They say that he didnt even met Voltaire.
But the woman told me in her explination, that they talked but he used notes and jounals in his memoir.
On the last Episode, Chevalier were in jail and after his story, he escaped by using a piece of metal and afterwards climed on the roof. In one hand the critis say this isnt true, they say that this were just invented to make a better story and that it was more like that the jailers were bribed to free him. But on the other hand, the woman profed that his cell has to get renewed, because of the broken window.
