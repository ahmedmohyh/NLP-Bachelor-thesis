The Chevelier was a somewhat controversial figure. He wrotes a memoir about his life and adventures. He mets famous people like kings and writers. He spends a lot of his money for partys and events, so he wasn't really poor. He writes that he mets the famous writer Voltaire, but it's not doubt that they even met or talked to each other. But no one can proof that, because it was written many years ago. 
Chevelier was also in a prison in Venice, from where he escaped. He used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof. But thats also not proved, it could be that just a jailer let him go. But it doesn't sounds so good like if he escaped from the prison. He had well-connected friends in Venice, who could easily helped him to escape from the prison. So nothing, what he wrotes about, is proved. It could all be true but it could also be just came into his head and he wrotes what he wants. Maybe he just wanted to had a interestinged life and wrotes what he wants. But everything could also be true and his life was really interesting and enjoyable.
