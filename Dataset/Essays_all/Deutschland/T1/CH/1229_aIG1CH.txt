The Text as well as the speech said that the Chevalier wrote his memoirs out of his memories which could be possibil with some notes he took.
The second part of the text says that the Chevalier had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. The talk agreed on this and it agreed as well on the fact that the Chevalier wasn't poor, also it explained why he has to borrow the money while the text didn't. In fact he had to borrow it because his moneymaking progress took a time to work, so he had very much money but not in cash so he could pay someone straight so he has to borrow money for a short time periode.
In the third part of the text the escape of the Chevalier out of a notorious prison in Venice is the theme. The way he escaped was to make a hole into the ceiling of his cell and climb on the roof. This is told in the text as well as in the speech, but the text is bringing up some critics which have the opinion that he got out of the prision with the help of some of his friends with big influence. Against this, the speech brings up the argument that in this prison where many other prisoners which had friends with a lot more influence that the Chevalier had and they are still into the prison. Another argument, the talk brought up is the fact that the ceiling of the cell of the Chevalier had to be repared after he was gone.
