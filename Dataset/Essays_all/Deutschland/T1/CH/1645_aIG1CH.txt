Chevalier de Seingalt lived from 1725 to 1798 he wrote a long memoir about his life and his adventures. He met famous persons like kings and writers. So his memoir becomes a historical source about the European society. Critics thinks that Chevalier include some things that he doesn`t do so his life sounds more  interesting and more exciting than it really was. For example the fact that he lived in Switzerland and that he was very wealthy and thinks like this are disorted or invented. He had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant so thats the reason why critics thinks that he lie to the people. Because when he was really rich why he have to borrow money from other people. He also disodert facts like he was talking to the writer Voltaire. He disordert many facts so the critics don´t believe him. He talks also about an escape from a prison in Italy. But the critics were thinking  that he have politically well-connected friends in Venice so he do not escape by himself with a metal thing and climb out of the roof. So CHevalier is often critized by many people because he told stories in his memoir they do not working. His life is for many critics like a big lie. He told to many things so they can be possible.
