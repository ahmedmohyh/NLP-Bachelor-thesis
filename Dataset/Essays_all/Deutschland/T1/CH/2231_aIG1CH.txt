Chevalier de Seingalt 
A man named Chevalier de Seingalt who has lived from 1725 to 1798 wrote his rather controversial memoires short before he died. In his memoires he claims to have met many famous people like kings or writers. Many critics are saying that Chevalier faked many parts of his memoirs because they found some inacurracys for example his conversation with Voltaire. In the latter the critics say that Chevalier could not remember all the details of his conversation for such a long time given that the conversation has been held many years before the memoirs have been written. In the speech about Chevalier the speaker says that Chevalier has often made notes after he had conversations with important people. Another point critics have is that Chevalier is known for beeing rich and for big parties and gambling but he had to borrow a relatively big amount of money. For the latter there is the explaination that he had to wait for his money so he borrowed some money to  make sure he can pay his bills in time. The last argument in the text is that Chevalier didnt break out of prison but someone paid his bribe so he gets free. The argument against that was that even more important people were held in this prison and no one could pay the bribe for them and also the ceiling of Chevaliers prison room had to be repaired after he got out of prison. The latter had to happen because in Chevaliers memoirs there is written that he broke out of prison using a piece of metal with which he dug through the ceiling of his room. They also say that there has never been a one-hundret percent accurate memoir ever.
