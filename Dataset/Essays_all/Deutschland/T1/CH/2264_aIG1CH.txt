The memoir of chevalier de Seingalt are controversial questioned to be true, since a long time. Many of the events in his life from 1725 to 1798 seam to unbelievebill and thrilling. 
The most discussed events are that while he lived in Switzerland, claming to be rich he bought great sums from a merchant, so that criticals say he obviosly can not have been very rich. In difference experts who belive in his story say that he was rich, but that the society he wanted and later get part of was to get entrence to through a lot of partys and glamourase life, so to get the connection for making money you first had to spend some which is the reason for his borrowing.
The second event are the discussions with Voiltaire, while it is unquestioned that they happened criticers say, that it is not possible to remamber a qonversation in exact words many jears after it exually happened. A plossible explanation for this is that the Chevalier was known by people who lived taht time to take notes of importened events and that he also took notes from the Voltaire-conversation every night and keept them untill he wrotes his memoyres many jears later.
At last his version from the escaping of a Venive prison through scaping a hole in the ceiling and climbing the roof seams that dramatic that many people belive it to be ficton and that some rich importened jailers hellped him. But also autentic documents report about the fixing of the Chevaliers cell just after his escaping, so that there must have been a reason to fix it, and if happend like the criticals say prisioners with even more politically conected friends would have been able to escape, what never happened.
