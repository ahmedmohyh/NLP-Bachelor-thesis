In the lesson a woman talks about the accurateness of the Chevalier´s memoires and explain why his critics are wrong. 
To the episode in Switzerland critics say that if the Chevalier had been as rich as he wrote, he wouldn´t need to borrow money. But the teacher says that the Chevalier had no money, but wasn´t poor neither. He always needed time to change the assets he uses on trips into real money and for this time he borrowed the money. 
Critics think that one can´t remember everything of a conversation and so the conversations with Voltaire are not accurate. But the teacher/ professor argues that some of the Chevalier´s friends have told that he has always made notes right after the conversations  and used them while writing his memoires.
The third question is how the Chevalier was able to escape from a prison in Venice. Critics think that he has been freed by friends who payed money for him and not in a dangeous escape. But the teacher mentions that there have been a lot of even more well-connected prisoners with more money which have not been freed and after his escape the prison has to repair the ceiling in the Chevalier´s room and this is only necessary if the Chevalier´s story is true.
