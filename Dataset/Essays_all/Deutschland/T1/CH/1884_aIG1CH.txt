In the text about the Chevalier it says that he is a controversial figure. But after he met some famous people his memoir has become a valuable historical source. But in the audio it says that it is even a reliable source and they didn´t say a word about that there are any critics who raised doubts about the accuracy of his memoir. The text calls him quite poor because he has to borrow himself lots of money but in the audio it`s well reasoned: he spend so much money into parties and gambling that he didn`t have anything left for other essential things. About his conversations with the Voltaire the audio says that he wrote down everything they talked about in the nights but in the text there are critics that he might have wroten down the things lots of years after these conversations so that it`s another unreliable source. In the text and in the audio it`s about his escape from prison. He used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbed through the roof. So both sources are saying nearly the same in this point.
