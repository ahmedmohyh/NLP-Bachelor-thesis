In  the memoir of the life of Chevalier de Seinegalt, written by himself in the eigth century, is claimed to have alot of mistakes.
For example it seems not right that he was very wealth while living in Switzerland, but  had to borrow money at the same time. Other people say that this does not have to be a mistake. It is possible that he was wealthy, but had to borrow some money when he was running out of cash and had to wait for more. Rich does not alwayse mean a lot of money. It can also come in other forms.
The second point is his conversation with the famous writter Voltaire. His memoir were written years after the conversation so it is hard to belive that it is as accurate as Chevalier said. Other people swear that he often used notes of his earlier life to write and even he said he used to write down all the important points after these conversations with Voltair. Therfore it is possible that the conversation is not 100% correct, but nearly.
The last point critics questioned is his escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy. He claims to escaped by himself through the ceiling, while critics think that he could only escape with the help from some very poweful friends. Later it is told that after his escape the ceiling of his cell had to be repaired and other prisoners with even more powerful friend could not escape only with help by them. 
Therefor it is not sure how he was able to escape and be wealthy and also write an accurate conversation years after, but it is possible.
