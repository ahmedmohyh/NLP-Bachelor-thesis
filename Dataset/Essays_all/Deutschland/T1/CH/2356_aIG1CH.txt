In the presentation I´ve listen to, the woman tolds about Chevalier de Seingalt, a writer, which told about life and experiences in his books. 
He was a controversial person, until he met famous persons. Also today there are critical points against him.
The woman told in three arguments  the critical points of Chevaliers life. He wasn´t pour, he spend much money in Switzerland  on parties and gambling, she said in her first argument. Her second argument, was the meeting between Chevalier and Voltaire. It´s unclear if they really met, because some people think, that  he invented things to make his life more interesting.
Her last argument was, that his escape from the prison in Venice wasn´t real and he´s just telling about it in a  extrem way for doing it more interesting for the reader.
