The text about the Chevalier de Seingalt has a critizicing view on his memoir about his life. It is said, that he wanted to show his own life more exciting than it really was, eg. that he wanted to seem rich as he lived in switzerland although he actually wasn't.
In the speech was mentioned that he was wealthy but had to borrow money because he had to have a bugdet to start earning more.
That does not mean that he was poor during the time in Switzerland.
Additionally there is a difference in the presentation of conversations between the Chevalier and Voltaire. The author of the texts gives information about critics who claim that the conversations wasn't accurately explained because of the long time between the occuration of the memoir and the actual event, while in the speech was said, that he just wrote down what he really remembers. 
The speech does not agree with the text's arguments that the Chevalier lied about the escape from the prison either
