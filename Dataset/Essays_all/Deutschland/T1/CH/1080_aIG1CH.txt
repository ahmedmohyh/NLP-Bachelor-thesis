About the memoir of Chevalier is often discussed. It is not sure which poinst are true and which are maybe just made up by him. For example he says that when he lived in Switzerland he was quite wealthy but Critics are not sure if this point is correct. There are evidence that he borrowed money from a merchant which comes up with the question why he needed to do this when he was rich. But back in that time it was usual that people had to wait some times for their money to arrive, so it is possible that he just needed money till his own arrived. Another point is that Chevalier in his memoir tells about a meeting with the famous writer Voltaire, Critics are convinced that the memoir cannot contain the exact conversation because the meeting was years before Chevalier starting writing them down. An argument against this is that some people are convinced that Chevalier wrote down phrases of the converstaion the day he met Voltaire, which would lead to a quite accurate converstaion in the memoir. One adventure Chevalier tells about in his memoir is his escape from a prison in Venice. He says that he scaped by making a hole in the ceiling but Critics think that it is more possible that powerful frinds of him bribed the jailers. But this puts up another question, in the prison also had been other persons with even more powerful friends then his but why did they not escape?
