The speech from the woman was about the momoir of a historical person, names Chevalier de Seinigalt. She talked about him and about the critics of his memoirs. 

First she sad that the momoirs about him would be pretty excaggerted, but that the main point of it could be true. 
In the momoirs of Chevailer it says, that he had a conversation between himself and the famous writer Voltair. the Critics says that this could not be true, because he wrote it about a few years ago, they say that he can not remember it so long ago. The woman instead says, that it is possible that he can remember it so far. She says also that not everthing in this conversation can be true and that you have to read it cearfully. 
A critic is also, that Chevailer wrote in his memoirs that he could escaped from a notrious prison in Venice. They say that it can not be possible, thathe just a piece of metal that he used to make a hole in the ceiling. The woman says that the critics are good and she says, that she things that it can not be like he wrote it in his memoirs. But also she says, that it is a fact that he escaped from this prison and that this is very impressing, because in this prison were a number of people, who were more connected then Chevalier and that this persons can not escaped from it.

All in allthe woman says that the critics can be true, but morst of it would be a bit excaggerted. She says also, that when you read the memoirs of hiim you have to be carefull what you beliefe and what not not.
