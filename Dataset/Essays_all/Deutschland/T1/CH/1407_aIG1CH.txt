Chevalier was a controversial figure who lived in the 18th century. He is well known for his memoires in which he wrote about his encounters with famous historical figures.
But it is speculated whether his memoires are accurate or not. There are many reasons as to why his memoires aren't completely true. 
For example, it is known that Chevalier spent a lot of money on parties and gambling but apparently, he had to borrow money from a swiss merchant. The listening extrait explains this as a loan he had to take because he made his money off of properties he sold. Therefore, he had to wait a few days for his money to arrive.
Also, it is skeptical that his conversations with Voltaire are 100% true. Critics prompt it is nearly impossible to remember coversations years after you held them. The listening extrait shows, that those concersations could in fact be true since Chevalier could have written in his memoires every night after his conversation with Voltaire. 
Probably the most talked about conspirancy is his escape from a Prison in Venice. It is believed that he escaped by bribing someone, which is denied by the text extrait, saying it was impossible to bribe anyone in that prison. 
All in all, the text extrait definetly doubts Chevaliers accuracy whereas the listening extrait believes his memoires are mostly true.
