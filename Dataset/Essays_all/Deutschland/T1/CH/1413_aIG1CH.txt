In the following text there will be a comparison between the speech and a source about the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt who lived in the eighteenth cen tury and documented his whole life. According to the speech Chevalier owned some lands during the time he lived in Switzerland, but was wasn´t wealthy at all. He would had to sell all of his lands to be a part of  the status of rich he described he were. That´s why he borrowed money. Moreover old government documents exist which shows that the prison cell he was held in needed to be repaired. If the stories the way he escaped weren´t true the cell wouldn´t need to be fixed. The source on the other hand lets us assume that his stories were made up and somebody freed him. So why would his cell need to be repaired if the stories weren´t true?
