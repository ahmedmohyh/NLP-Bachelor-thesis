Chevalier was born in 1725 and died in 1798.He wrote memoirs of his life and adventures and was an controversial figure thats why there are some thing to explain about him.At first it was said that he made his life more exiting and glamourous that it really was .That's not really truth because while his time in Switzerland he really done some good deals on parties and gambling.Some peple didn't belive it because he borrowed money and if he was rich he would't do that.In the text there is also said that nobody doubt that he really met with Voltaire and had an conversation with him but in the explinaction i heard was it thru and he published what he was written many years later.The last point is the escape from the prison in venice.In the text it's said that he didn' make a hole in the celling and escaped with help of that.In the text is written that he had very well connected friends who got him out there But the room he was arrested in had to be repaired so it would mean that he didn' lie when he wrote that he escaped the prison by himself.
