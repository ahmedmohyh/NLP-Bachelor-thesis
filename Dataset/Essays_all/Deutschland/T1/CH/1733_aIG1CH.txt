Critics question the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. They think that Chevalier invented some events in is memoirs and that he made some that happened even more spectacular. These doubts raised because of some things that seemed to be more glamorous than different sources say.

There are three things in the text and in the lecture that don't go hand in hand with each other.

First the critics say that Chevalier lied about being wealthy as he lived in Switzerland. Chevalier says that he was kind of rich and went to a lot parties. The critics say he had to borrow money to go to these parties and hasn't got the wealth that he said he had. But the lecture explains that it doesn't have to mean that he was poor. Being wealthy doesn't mean having always a lot of money. It means that you have to do business and sometimes you have to wait for your money. In this waiting time Chevalier borrowed money but wasn't poor at all.

Second he had conversations with Voltaire but the critics say that the passages in the memoir are too detailed for being written a few years after the conversations with Voltaire. They say Chevalier couldn't remember it all so detailed just because of having been there. Against this you can say that it is prooved that there were notes of Chevalier direct from the discussions so he could keep all the things in his head and don't forget them.

Third he escaped from prison in Venice but in his memoirs it seems to be a bit too spectacular and the critics say that he just had good connections with some people who helped him out. If you believe the lecture there has been also much more people with even better connections with powerful people who didn't make it out of the prison. So Chevalier was clever enough to get out of the prison. Added to this the ceiling in the room of Chevalier was broken so they had to repare it and it wouldn'd have been neccesary to repare the ceiling if there was no real escape.
