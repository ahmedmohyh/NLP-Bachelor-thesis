Chevalier wasn´t a poor guy. He lived in Switzerland where he often spent money for partys etc. But some people say that he was pooor. It only looked liked that because he often had to wait for his money. But all in all he was very wealthy. The same information are given in the text. Only the point that there are people who he that differnet is not written. 
About the Voiltaire meeting: He wrote some phrases down in the evening of the day they met. The memoir was written one year later ,that´s write, but it was possible with these phrases to write down with the same words Voltaire and he used. The text is more critical about that because many people think that this meeting didn´t happen. And the meeting is the qualification that the written memoir is real.
It is not really clear if he flew out of the prison. The ceiling had to be repaired. But it is also clear that many prisoners had more powerfull friends. So why had only Chevalier the chance to flee? The others had a much bigger opportunity to flee. The criticers had so a really good reason to say that this thing couldn´t really happen. 
All in all the text and the presentation wasn´t so differnet. There are many critics and nobody know what really happen. But if you have both ( text and presentation) you have two pont of views and can make your own opinion about in what you belive and in what not.
