In the text it is said that the Chevalier had to borrow money in Switzerland which he spend on parties and gambling, but in the lecture it is said that he only borrowed the money because he waited for his to arrive. Also it is said that he wrote down his conversations with Voltaire the night after they had them. He used these documentations for his memoir so that the conversations can be accurate despite that he wrote the it several years after they had these conversations. In the same prison Chevalier was in were other people with more powerful friends than him and they couldn´t  bribe their way out of the prison like it was said about him. Also shortly after his escape the ceiling in his cell had to be repaired. There wouldn´t be a reason to do that if it hadn´t been damaged during his escape.
