In the audio skit there were several arguments which prove the truth of the Chevalier's memoirs. The argument is explainig the nessesarity of borrowing money in Switzerland. The Chevalier had been really rich for real, he only had to borrow money because of his buisness in which he had to wait for his money. So although it is true that the Chevalier borrowed money from a merchant he also was wealthy at the same time.  
The second argument supports the accurance of the conversations of the Chevalier und Voltaire. The audio says that every evening the Chevalier wrote down some notes about what they were talking about so that he could use them for his memoirs later on. This means that his recaption of the conversations with voltaire probably really tell the truth.
Finally there was the escape from the Venetian prison which critics say he could only have escaped with powerful friends. But the audio file explains that many other prisoners had powerful friends, too. And they never came free with this forgein help. So the only possible way the Chevalier could escape from Venice is to breack throug the ceiling. Furthermore after he left, the celing in his prison had to be repared.
