The Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) was a famous man when he lived. Nowadays he is seen in a lot more controversial way and critics believe that he invented many of his stories.
For example, the memoires of the Chevalier say that he was a rich man whilst living in Switzerland and that he was waisting a lot of his money. Even though, he borrowed much money from a merchant. So, this memoire is seen as very controversial because it doesn't make sense to borrow money if you're rich.
Also, the Chevalier was having a conversation with Voltaire which is probably to actually have happened. But the fact that the Chevalier included it in his memoires years after makes it very unlikely to have exactly happened that way because it is nearly impossible to remember a conversation for that long.
The third and final memoire is that he escaped form a prison in Venice by going through a ceiling. This one is probably the most controversial one of the three of the memoires. On the other hand, it is being said in the presentation that there exists data of people stating that the ceiling had to be repaired which leads us to the conclusion that this story might have happened the way it is told by the Chevalier.






By the way the headphones are terrible and so I couldn't understand much of what was going on in the presentation and I might not either in the next one(s). So, I changed them now hopefully that's better.
