The presentation contridicts the arguments against Chevalier's accuracy about his life which are written in the text.While the text claims that Chevalier must have been poor because he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant, the women from the presentation explains that he was indeed a wealthy man. The money that he owned came from selling property and this money took a while to arrive. While waiting, he had to borrow the rest. Moreover it is said that the records about Chevalier's conversations with Voltaire could not be accurate because these conversations took place years before the memoir was written. The explanation from the presentation is that Chevalier took notes about every conversation right after they had happened and then used these while writing the memoir. Servants and workers of Chevalier later comfirmed that he had indeed used notes while writing his memoir. The last claim in the text, that Chevalier bribed his way out of prison instead of escaping as he said, is also proven to be false by the presentation. The woman explains that there were many other rich people in prison and that none of them were able to bribe their way out. Furthermore the ceiling of his prison cell had to be repaired shortly after his escape and there would be no reason to unless Chevalier had been telling the truth.
