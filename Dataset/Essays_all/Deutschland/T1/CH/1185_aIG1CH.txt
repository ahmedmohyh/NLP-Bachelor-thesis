The Chevalier de Seingalt is a controversial historic person. Criticers says, that there are some things that can not be true but there are also arguments for the truth of his storys. Some people says, the Chevalier needs the money he borrows from the merchant, because he run out out of money for a few days (like we do at the end of the month) and needed it to pay for his extravagant lifestyle. Criticers says he was no wealthy person because why should a wealthy person borrows money? Another controversial theme is his conversation with Voltaire. It was said, that the Chevalier could remember the exact words because he wrote notices all his lifetime and used them to write his memoir years after he met Voltaire. Criticers said that the conversations written in the memoir could not be correct and as exact as it should be for a historical source. The last point the women talked about was the Cevaliers escape from a prison. She said that his only way out of it was to flee, because other prisoners, with more connections to people with high influence, could not be freeed by them, but maybe he just use his connections. An escape fropm a prison is also an amusement for the reader and maybe he just want to bring some action in his memoir.
