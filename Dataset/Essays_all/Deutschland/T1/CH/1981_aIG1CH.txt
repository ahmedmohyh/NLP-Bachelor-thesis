This essay is about the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. In this memoir he tells some quite amazing storys and it´s not clear if they really happend this way or if he just told them like this to make his life more exciting.
When he lived in Switzerland he claims that he was very wealthy and spend a lot of money for partys and gambling. Critics ask why he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant when he was rich. But there is an explanation which says that you have to invest a lot of money to make more. So at some point he had not that much but later he got a lot more back and that would mean that it´s true what he wrote.
A nother discussed point is the conversation between the Chevalier and Voltaire. The problem is that it is impossible to remember a conversation accuratly after a long time. But it is told that he made notes every evening when he talked to Voltaire and so he was able to write accurate about the conversation years later.
