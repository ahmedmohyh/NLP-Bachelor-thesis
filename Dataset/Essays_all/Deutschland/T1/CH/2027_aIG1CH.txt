The speaker in the audible text sided with Chevalier. She considered his memoir to be an accurate and reliable historical source. 
First, the reading text says that there is clear evidence about Chevalier borrowing money while spending a lot of it on parties and gambling.
The speaker in the audible text argues that Chaevalier needed money to be able to wait until his earned money arrived, so he had to borrow some.
Then, the text questions the accuracy of the conversation between Voltaire and Chevalier, since the memoir of the latter was written many years later.
On the other side, the speaker claims Chevalier wrote down the conversation based on notes he took when he talked to Voltaire.
Last, both talk about Chevaliers escape from prison and whether he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling, or had powerful friends, who were able to bribe the jailers. The speaker claims that other imprisoned people with even more powerful friends did not manage to escape. Furthermore, she speaks of a witness confirming that the ceiling of Chevaliers cell was repaired after his break-out.
