Their are many critics to the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt, but they can all be explained. First of all he wrote that he was rich while living in switzerland, but he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant, so critics think his statement of beeing wealthy cannot be true. Though just because he had to borrow money does not mean he was poor. He wanted to sell a proberty, which took a couple of days so during that time he needed to borrow money. When he sold it, he had lots of money again. Not having money, does not mean beeing poor. The money can just lie in proberties.
               There is another point where critics say he must have lied: Chevalier wrote about conversations he had with the famous writer Voltaire. Critics say that he cannot possibly remember every single word in their converstaion as he wrote his memoir a couple of years later. It is said though, that he wrote every night everything down what he talked about with Voltaire, so it is possible to know some exact frases Voltaire used.
                Chevalier's escape from the prison is also questioned as many critics say, that he had political friends who could have offered a bribe to get him out and that he would not have needed to escape through the ceiling. In the prison where other poeple though, who had more powerful friends and they did not get out. Futhermore the ceiling, where Chevalier wrote he escaped, had to be repaired after he got out of prison.
