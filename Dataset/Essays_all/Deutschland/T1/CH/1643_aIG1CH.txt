The somewhat controversial figure "the Chevalier" (1725-1798) wrote a long memoir about his life and adventures toward the end of his life. 
 
His memoires has become a valuable historical source about European society in the eighteenth century. He met many famous people like kings and writers but there are still some critics which have raised doubts about the accuracy of his memoir. 
One part of his memoir which brought some doubts is the time span he spent in Switzerland. He lost much money in partiing and gambling at this time, so he had to borrow some money from a Swiss merchant. Critics are now that the Chavalier were not rich because he had to borrow money but it is also possible that he were not poor and just had to borrow some money because he had no chance to get some of his money at the moment.
Another critized part is the conversation he had with voltaire. There are doubts on the accuracy of the real words theb spoke in this conversation because he made his memoires years after he met him. There is no doubt that he met Voltaire but it is quite possible that he could not remember every word. 
Another critizised part in his memoires is his escape from the jail in Venice, Italy. The Chevalier wrote that he escaped from prison by using a metal sheet to make a hole in the ceiling to climb out of the roof. Critics doubt that and suppose that the Chevalier`s jailers were bride to free him.

There are some doubts of critics in the Chevaliers memoires but there are probably there because of missing information.
