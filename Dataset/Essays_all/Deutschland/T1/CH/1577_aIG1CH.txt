The memoirs of Chevalier de Seingalt are hotly discussed, as if they are a reliable historical source or not.
The first point, that is discussed is, if he was poor or rich. In his memoirs it is said, that he spent much money on parties and gambling, but evidence surfaced, that he also borrowed money. He was a rich man, but sometimes his money needed too much time to get delivered, so that he borrowed money from other people. The second point, that is hotly debated, are his conversations with Voltaire. Critics say, that they are not excact phrases, but the Chevalier wrote their conversations from his memory down every night, so that it is possible, that the conversations are not everything is excactly phrased, but the topics are right. The third point is his escape from the prision in Venice, Italy. He said, that he used a piece of metal to make a hole into the ceiling to make his way out of the cell. Some people say, that it is wrong, because there were much better connected people in the prison, who could not escape, but it is prooven, that the seiling of the Chevaliers cell had to get fixed, so that his writings seem very true.
