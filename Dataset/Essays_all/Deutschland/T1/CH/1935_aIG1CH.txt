The Chavelier de Seigalt (1725-1798) wrote a long memoir recounting his life and adventures. Unlike to the text which criticizes the Chavalier for pretending to be rich because he used to borrow money in the presentation it is said that although the Chavalier borrowed money he wasn't poor. He only had to borrow money to survive because he was spending much money on events. It was also mentioned that the Chavalier did captured the conversations with the famous writer Voltaire. Furthermore in the presetation it is pointed out that the Chavalier escaped from the prison without any hints left, what is also mentioned in the text. In general the presentation rather diagrees with the information given in the text.
