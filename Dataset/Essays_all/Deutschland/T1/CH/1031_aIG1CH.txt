First of all it has to be said that no memoirs are right in every singel word but even though some things may be wrong other points the critics criticized were wrong like the short talk pointed out.The Chevalier had to borrow money because he sold some things while living in Switzerland. But normally it took the money some days to really arrive so during this time of waiting the Chevalier borrowed money he could pay back later. He was not poor. Secondly the critics complain that the Chevalier wrote down his conversations with the famous writer Voltaire years after their meeting and that's because they don't believe that The Chevalier could remember the exact words of their conversations. But this doubt is not convincing. The Chevalier not only sat down after the conversations and wrote down notes but he wrote down every single word he could remember. That's why the quotes from conversations are much more detailed and accurate than the critics say. Futhermore the critics complain about the prison escape mentionned in the memoirs. The Chevalier had powerful friends and possibly not escaped but was getting free bacause of his friends. But the prison was full of people with powerful friends and some even had more powerful friends than the Chevalier had. Even these people had to stay in the prison and where not getting free because of their friends. Besides the ceiling of the cell of the Chavalier had to be replaced after his escape. This fact makes the story of his escape more reliable.
