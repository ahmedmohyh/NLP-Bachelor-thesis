The Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) is a really famous person whose memoirs has become a valuable historical source about European society. Still many people believe that not everthing in these memoirs is actually true.
In his memoirs the Chevalier writes about his time living in switzerland and that he was very wealthy during this time but a lot of people think this could be a lie becuase there is evidence that he borrwed mony from a swiss merchant. But according to others even though this is true, it doesn't mean that the Chevalier wasn't rich. It sometimes took some time for his money arrive so while he was waiting for his new money he just borrowed something from a swiss merchant.
The next thing many people doubt is the accuracy of his conversations with Voltaire because it's impossible to remember the exact phrases from these conversations which is true too but it is known that the Chevalier took notes after the conversations and used these notes while writing his memoirs so it's possible that he the phrases are correct.
At last critics have claimed that he didn't really escaped from prison in Venice. They think the Chevalier's jailers were brided to free him becuase he had poltically well-connected friends in Italy. But that doesn't make much sense because other prisoners with even more important friends living in Venice weren't offered a bribe. Furthermore the Chavelier's ceiling had be repaired and the only possible reason it had to be repaired is that he actually made a hole in it to escape.
