Chevalier de Seingalt is an author who lived from 1725-1798. He is very rich and in the eighteenth century his literature was an important source about European society. At the end of his life he wrote a recounting of his life named memoir. One of the things he named in his text is about a conversation with Voltaire. Critics say that it is impossilbe that he could remember such exactly about the conversation with Voltaire because it would be too much time gone since then. Chevalier also talks in memoir about his escape from the Venetian prison. He wrote that he used a piece of metal to escape by making a hole in the ceiling an afterwords he climbed through the roof. Critican say that this story is nice to read but they couldn´t belive it because it´s too unbeliveable. Critican think friends had helped him out. 
Finally it could be sad that Chevalier wrote a book named memoir in which he tells his life but Criticans think that none of the storys he mentioned really happened.
