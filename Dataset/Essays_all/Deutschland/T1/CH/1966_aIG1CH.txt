The speaker says that the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt is reliable, they have found a lot of evidences and historical sources that confirm his memoir.

The first points is that the Chevalier was not poor, but wealthy. He borrowed sums of money from a Swiss merchant, because he invested his money before.
Second the conversation with Voltaire has to be real, though it was written years after the conversation was held. Friends and close relatives of the Chevalier found notes he took during the conversation, so he could remember everything even years after it actually happenend.
On last point they found out that the ceiling had to repaired after the escape from the Venetian prison. So the Chevalier must have damaged it before. Besides that other prisoners had even friends with more influence, but it was no help at all. Maybe he had some friends and relations, but they could not help him out after all.
