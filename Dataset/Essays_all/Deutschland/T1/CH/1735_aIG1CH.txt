At first the text is saying that Chevalier lives in Switzerland and that  he borrowed money from somebody to spend money on parties and gambling. The critics say against it that he wouldn't have borrowed mony if he really was rich so he had to be poor. The woman says that just borrwing money doesn't mean being poor. Maybe he just couldn't take his own money at the moment or . In the second point people critizis the conversation between Chevalier an Voltaire because it's so accuratly after a lot of years. They think that is isn't able to write such an exact conversation after a meeting many years ago. The woman thinks that he could have written everthing down every time after they met. So it would be able to write such an accuratly conversation. In the text they don't believe in the escape of the Chavelier because the critics think that his political friends or the jailers freed him so that he didn't have to escape by climbing trough the roof. The talking part doesn't agree with this. She knows that a lot of the other persons in the prison had more powerful friends than the Chavelier so they could have been out of the prison a long time before the Chavelier if he didn't escape but friends of him freed him.
