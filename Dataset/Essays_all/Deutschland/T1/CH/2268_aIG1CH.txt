The essay is about the differences between a text of the life of Chevalier de Saingalt and a speech about his life. 
In the speech, it was told that Chevalier de Saingalt was in prison but he could escape. And in the speech there is also something about his friends and how strong they are in the political life. In the text there just alittle bit about his time in jail and the same with his friends. In the text it is told that he wrote down his memories about the conversations a few years later but in the speech it was told that he wrote down his memories about conversations always at the same evening. 
To put it in a nutshell the text and the speech are jut a little bit different. The text is shorter and doesn´t include so much information abot Chavelier de Saingalt.
