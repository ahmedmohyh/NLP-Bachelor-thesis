The first argument is that Chevalier has just borrow money to make parties and gambling, because you had to sell before. So he just borrow money, because he has to wait for his own money. Moreover it is said that nobody can remember every word or the whole sentences of a conversation you had many years earlier, but Chevalier just wrote everything down what he remember. The last argument is that Chevalier said that he escape prison in Venice just with a small piece of metal and the explanation is that the people in the prison have to repair Chevalier's room in prison. 
In the text the critics give other examples for these three arguments. About the first argument they say that Chevalier was just poor, the second argument they explain with the fact that nobody could ever remember the exact words in a conversation many years earlier and nobody knows if Chevalier and Voltaire have really met. Another explaination for the last argument is that Chevalier had politically well-connected friens in Venice who could have help him.
