First it was told that money could not get out of nowhere. When the Chevalier spend time in switzerland or other countries he lived in, he lived in a good wealth and not with problems of money. But this contridicts to the fact, that money has to be made at first. Where did the Chevalier got his money from? It is told that he had got the money from his parents and had worked out to make his fortune grow. Then it was asked critically if his conversations where real or fake. The notes the Chevalier wrote while the conversations where not very precisly. So it is a question that gets along with this problem, whether the conversations are real or sticked together in a wrong way? His own notes are not fitting perfectly to the things he wrote in his memoir.
The text does have another facts about his money. In fact the text tells us, that the Chevalier had a bit of problems to affort his wealthy and big lifestyle in switzerland so he had to borrowed money. And it does not fit that the Chevalier wrote his conversations with precisly notes he had made, because the text says, that he had wrote his memoir mainly from his remembering. Where were his precisly notes?
But at the end we will never know what really happened, when we wont find any more facts that make a few arguments stronger and some other weaker. We can't travel back in time to watch if his conversations were real or fake and if his money was borrowed or not, can we?
