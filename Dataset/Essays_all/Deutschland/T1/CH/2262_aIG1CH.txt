From the part of the text and from the part from the listening, are some differents. At the listening part they told about  Chevalier de Seingalt, he lifes from 1725  until 1798, he wrote a long memoir recounting about his life and adventures. Also the speaker told about three arguments in her speak, and one of them you can find also in the text. But the other two are a littel bit different. She say that he was in a prison and after he gets out there, it will be repaird. And in the part of the text they do not write something about, that he will be in a prison so there are are dirffrent between the listening part and the part of the text. And the other diffrent is, about the conversation with Voltaire, an famous writer. The women from the speech said, that he talk to him and after that he write about him, but in the text they say, that the text about voltaire was written after a long time after the conversation. In one point they have the same  meaning, about that he will lives in Swizerland and had much money and also that he spent much money on the partys
