The text is about the man "Chevalier de Seingalt". It's devided in three parts, which are about different topics, that aren't linked with the other ones. The listening comrehantion gives the main points of the text, but sometimes, it disagrees with the facts in the text.
In the first part the text says that he met lots of famous people and his memoire became something like a valuable historical source about European society.  These facts are not given in the listened part. So you can say that the listening parts doesn't give aus any facts about the character of "Chavalier".
The second part of the text is about the wealthy life of the Chevalier in Switzerland. But it's also said, that he didn't earn all the money by himself, he borrowed  it from a Swiss merchant. So it isn't sure, if he was really rich, or if he just pretended to be. These facts totally agree with the listening part.
Part three tells us from the relationship to "Voltaire". The text says that the critics aren't sure, if there really was a relationship between them. They also criticise the things he wrote in his memoire about Voltaire, because they say, that it would be impossible to remember extended conversations from many years ago.
The listening part tells us, that Chevalier wrote down nearly every sentence that voltaire said, after their talks. So the text and the listening part disagree with eachother.
Part four gives us details about his escape from the prison in Venice. The text is more detailed, than the listening part, so it gives us details how he escaped from the prison. The listening part
