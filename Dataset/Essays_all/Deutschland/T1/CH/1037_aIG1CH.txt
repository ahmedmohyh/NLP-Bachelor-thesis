The given speech about the text "Chevalier" defends the crediblity of the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798), which is accused of being distorted to sound more exciting.

The text states that de Seingalt claimed to be rich while living in Switzerland, although it was confirmed that he had to borrow money from a Swiss merchant. The speech now defends de Seingalt's statement as it took time to convert physical objects to actual money and he only borrowed the money to continue gamble and go to parties without a break.
In the text it is also said, that he couldn't have written down the accurate conversations between him and the famous writer Voltaire, as he wrote his memoir many years after they met. The credibility of these conversations was defended by the speech, as he took notes each evening after talking to Voltaire and was consulting things he had written down while writing his memoir.
The last thing the text critisises is that de Seingalt probably didn't escape through the ceiling as he stated, but rather someone bribed his jailers.
