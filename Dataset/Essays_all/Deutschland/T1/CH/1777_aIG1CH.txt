The statement of the speaker is that the memoir from Chevalier de Seingalt might not be a hundret percent acurate, but is still a reliable source and is generally speaking trustworthy. The first critic that a reader make is that he wasn't as rich as he told he was. The speaker explains this with the way how he invested his money. He invested his money into property. So in order to be liquid he had sell some of is property, when he needed money. But because this always took some time he needed to borrow money from the bank, which he was able to repay as is money arrived after the accomplished deal. 
The secound statement from the counter side is that what he wrote in his memoir about the conversation with a famous person, is just made up, because it was written a long time after the actual conversation. She admits that it was written a long time after the actual conversation, but she also says that he had notes from the day of the conversation on that he based his writing. 
The last critic is that he didn't escape by himself out of his cell, but by the help of his powerfull friends in the politics. But she remindes us that their were some prisoners who had friends that were way more powerfull than his and didn't get out of prison.  Furthermore she brings up that is cell had to be repaired after his escape, what leads us to the only conclusion that he broke through the wall of the prison.
