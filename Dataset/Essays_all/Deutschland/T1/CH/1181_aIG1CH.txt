This essay is about if the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt (1725-1798) is filled with true or imagined memories of his life.

In the presentation it says that the Chevalier was not poor at all like it is written in the text. He has just needed the money wich he borrowed from a Swiss merchant to make more money then he even had. The woman who presents is also against the argument of the text which means that the conversations between the Chevalier and the popular writer Voltaire is not real. She says that the Chevalier had noticed everything he remembers of the daily conversations with Voltaire and after some years he wrote those memories in his memoir. The last argument of the text is that the Chevalier did probably not escape of a notorious prison in Venice but would be helped by his political friends. The presentation excepts this because there are much more prisonners who had even better political friends and stayed in prison. Another reason against it is that the ceiling must have been repeared and why should it be broken if no one made a hole in it.
