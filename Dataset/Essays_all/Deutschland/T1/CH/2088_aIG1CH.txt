I will write an essay about the different information that gave me the text about Chevalier and the speak about him.
So in the two sources they telling something about Chevalier's live, but with different information and in a diffrent way.In the text you can read that Chevalier was controuversial figure ans life in Swizerland and gave much money for parties and so ever, so you might can say he is very rich but this is wrong, because he has to borrow some money from peoples.it's all a shine. This identicly informations give us the speak. But then is there an other point in this story, that Chevalier records in the memoir with himself and Voltair, who is a famous writter. But criticers says that they never met each other and conversed. This is a point which is telling diffrent in the speak, because here they say that they have speaken to each other in a night conversation. In fact of this you don't know which of this storys is right you don't know which you can believe. 
The third point is the escape of the prison, because Chevalier was in a prison in Venecie, Italy from which he escape.This is a true fact, because in both storys they were telling this. But how he escape from the prison is a secret because in the text they say he escape by using a piece of metal and in the speak they don't give us much information how he get out of the prison, but what they do after he get out of the prison.
