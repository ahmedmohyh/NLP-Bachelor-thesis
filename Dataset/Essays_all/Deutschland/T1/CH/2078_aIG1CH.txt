An argument against the incorrectness of Chevaliers memoir is that he had to wait for his money. Obviously he was a wealthy man who could've bought anything he wanted to buy but he also had to wait for his money to arrive sometimes, so thats why he borrowed it. Also he spent a lot of it and people don't usually carry a huge amount of money with themselves at all.

Another argument for the correctness of his memoir is that even though crtitcs doubt the conversation between him and Voltaire, there is a possibilty that it's correct. In the memoir he just refers to the coversation, so obviously he couldn't remember everything that has been said all these years ago but who could?

The last argument proves the correctness of his prison escape. It's not very likely that his jailers freed him because other people were also imprisoned and not all of them would've helped him. Also his prison cell had to be repared after his refuge, so there is a huge possibilty that it's not just a tale and he actually fled the prison.

In conclusion, it is very much possible that his memoir is actually based on a true story and that he got to experience an adventurous life.
