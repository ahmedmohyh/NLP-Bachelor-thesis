After reading the text and listoning to the speeker the are some contradictionary points.
According to the speaker Chevalier´s memoirs in general are very accurate and reliable, however in the text critics question this fact.
Therefore both sources give some arguments.
First the text explain that Chevalier is not telling the truth all the time. The text questions the fact that he was rich person while living in Switzerland, because some evidence that he borrowed money were found. The authors believe that he was just able to spent such a high amount of money because of this borrowings so he is usually not a rich person. However the speaker does not believe them. Therefore she mentions that just because you borrow money you do not have to be a poor person. She suggest that he only borrows money while waiting for his new one.
Another contradiction is that the text claims Chevalier´s accuracy affecting the facts about Voltaire, since he wrote them down many years later. However the speeker explains that the facts are accurate, because witnesses  reported that he works with notes all the sime so he was able to develope a corect report years after the conversation with Voltaire.
The third contradictionary point affect his escape out of a Venice prison. The authors believe that he bribed the jailers instead of using a piece of metal to construct a hole. According to this the speeker mentions that no persons before and after Chevalier was able to bribe the jailers even when they had got more importance. She arguments that after his escape some government documents said that the ceiling has to be repaired. Concluding she states that the ceiling did not have to be repaired if he did not construct a hole.
Finally the text and the speeker show contradictions affectin Chevalier´s accuracy, reliability and reports.
