The text is about critism of the memoir from Chevalier and the speech answers to the mentioned points.
 The first argument is that Chevalier couldn´t have so much money because he borrowed money from a rich Swiss merchant but the speaker mentions as an argument against that opinion that it´s naturally for a rich man to borrow money from another rich person because nobody has right on the beginning lots of money. It is needed to invest first and that means that there was a time where he had no money because he invested everything and as he waited for the win of money he had later he borrowed money from a friend.
The next point says that the conversations between Chavelier and Voltaire are fake because they mention lots of details nobody could ever remember after that long time because Chavelier wrote his memoir years after the time when the converations actually took place. The speaker arguments that Chavelier wrote everything he could remember down right after the conversations but he hided the notes a long time so nobody knew about them until he published his memoir.
Last but not least the text mentions his escape of a prison in Venice where he said that he did this all by himself but the text says that he had rich friends whih would have helped him. As a contrast to that the speaker says that there were people who had a lot more famous friends than him and that the prison owns notes which say that the sealing of door had to be repared after Chavelier got out of the prison.
