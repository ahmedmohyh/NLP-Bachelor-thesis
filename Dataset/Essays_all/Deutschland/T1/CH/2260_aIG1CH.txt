The Text beginns with the intro which explains that the Chevalier wrote a long memoir in which he invened alot of things to make hir life sound more interresting. The Speach responses to that and says that his memoir ist pretty accurate. In the First Paragraph the Text brings up the point the Chevalier had to be very poor while living in Switzerland because he gambled allot and went to allot of parties. The Speach is putting that down with the argument that he only had to borrow money that often because it took him so long to sell the chips he won while gambling. Another argument of the Text ist that he wrote down a whole conversation which he had years ago and that argument gets enforced from the Speach because it says that he often took notes after having a conversation which was told by many of his friends after he died. In the last paragraph is about his escape of a Prison which many citics have raised about because they think its imposible but the Speach brings up the argument that the Sealing he claimed to be Broken out of has had to be repaired a few weeks later. All in all you can say that it seems like the Speach has been made to go against the Text because it brings up points which encountee all the arguments the Text gave.
