The text which talks about the life of Chevalier de Seingalt critizises his memoirs becaus they can't possibly be correct. He writes about his adventures which critics believe to be incorrect because he just wanted to make his life seem more exciting than it actually was.
In the text it is said that Chevalier was known to be a wealthy person but they later discovered that he borrowed a lot of money from a Swiss merchant. So they think he lied writing his memoirs. But in the lecture the woman says that he was a wealthy man because he had a lot of property which he saled to have actual money. But it takes a while to do this so for a short time he didn't have any money because the buying was still going. So he had to borrow money for his gambling.
The text also says that it can't possibly be true to remember that much of a conversation. Chevalier met Voltaire and many years later he wrote his memoirs in which he mentions his talk with Voltaire. Critics say it is impossible to capture these conversations accurately, so they belive Chevalier just imagined a lot of things they said. In the lecture we were told that people, who knew Chevalier said that he was known for often consulting his journals. So he probably wrote the conversation with Voltaire down right after it happened. 
The last thing the text critizises is the fact that he wrote in memoirs that he escaped from a prison by damaging the ceiling so much that he could escape. Critics find that unbelivable because he didn't have any help. 
But the woman in the lecture said that it is known that the ceiling of the prison had to be repaired after Chevalier escaped. So they believe it is true what he wrote down.
