Chevalier

The Chevalier (1725-1798) wrote down the memoiries ab out his life.
The text and the audio are about the critics of his documents.
They (his documents) are very important sources about the history of the 18th century. He met lots of people, kings and celebrities.
But critics (the text) say, he has wrote down his mermoires in a more exciting style than they really were.
One of the important points is his life in switzerland. He said he was very rich and spent a lot of money to parties.
But the critics say, he had to borrow money which means that he did not have much money. The opposite position is that he had to wait for his money, so he had to borrow money get along.
There you can see the controverses about the truth and about a "truth plus". Those who defend the Chevalier say he wrote down what he remembered but he wrote it down years later. So that is why it can happen that it´s not the whole truth whats in his mermoires, it´s what he remembered.
And the critics say he wrote not the real truth, he added something to be more interesting and glamorous.
