Chevalier de Seingalt, who lived from 1725 to 1798, has written a long memoir at the end of his life recounting his life and adventures. First he was a somewhat controversial figure, but after he met some famous people, his memoir has become a valuable historical source. This source is about European society in the eighteen century. There were some critics about some points in his life.
When Chevalier lived in Switzerland he was not poor. He had a very good wealth. He spend a great deal mof money in Switzerland to different parties and gambling. But some people sad that he was a very poor person, but then he couldn´t do anything like that. so that means that he was not a poor person but someone with a very good wealth. Also some people sad, that Chevalier borrowed considerable sums of money from a Swiss Merchant. So if he had been really rich, he would not have to do this.
Chevalier also met Voltaire. They conserves. He wrote down everything that he remembered. Some critics complain that it can not be possibly to remenber exact phrases from extended conversations many years earlier without any help.
There are also critics about how Chevalier could escaped from a notorious prison. This prison was on Venice, Italy. Chevalier used a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climes througt the roof. After he escaped they have to repair his "room" in the prison. Critics claim that while such a daring escape makes for an enjoyable reading, it would be more likely the Chevalier´s jailers were birbed to free him out of the prison. They also critics that he had a number of politically well-connected friends in the town Vience. They could have the offered a bribe to help him to escape.
