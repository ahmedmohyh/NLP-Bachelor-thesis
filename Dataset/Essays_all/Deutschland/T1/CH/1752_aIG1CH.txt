The first argument of the text was that the Chevalier wasnt as rich as he stated while living in Switzerland because he often borrowed money from a friend. In response to that however the woman in the audio lesson states that the Chevalier made money by selling properties and that it often took time to convert them into money. So he passed the time until he got his cash by borrowing money from a friend since he had no other choice considering his lifestyle of often partying and gambling. 
Next the critics stated that the dialogues that he had with Voltaire couldnt be accurate since he wrote them down long after the conversations happened. However there are reports from friends and family of the Chevalier that he often wrote down notes for everything in his life. The Chevalier also said himself that he wrote all he remembered down after his conversations with Voltaire. So the notes were only brought together at a later point of time.
Lastly the breakout of the prison in Venice. The Chevalier claims to have broken out through the ceiling by making a hole into it with a piece of metal. Critics say that he got out by using his relationships to powerful friends and that they offered a bribe for him. Against this stands that other prisoners that were captivated had even more powerful friends making it seem unlogical for him to get out but others not. One of the higher ups in the prison also recorded that the roof of the Chevaliers prison cell had to be repaired soon after the wrote down incident. Creating a situation that is unlikely to happen by incident.
