Chevalier de Seingalt is described as a somewhat controversial figure in the text, because none of the stories which he told can be confirmed without any doubt. When he claimed that he has been a very rich man while he was in switzerland, it was recentliy surfaced, that he had to borrow a lot of money to keep up his life. Now, the person who talked about his life said, that it´s quite possible, that he just had to wait for his money to arrive and while he was doing so, he could´t keep up his lifestyle. 
In his memoirs Chevalier talks about his conversations with a famous writer called Voltaire and critics say, that he wrote those conversations down much later, so that he couln´t possibly remember the accurat conversation. On the other hand, the woman who talked about him said, that he always used notes he wrote down shortly after the event he was taking notes about had happened. Then he used those notes to write his memoirs, so that he wouldn´t forget anything. 
               When he wrote about him breaking out of prison, there were a lot of critics who said it was just a lie and he was freed, because he had a lot of politically well-connected friends and through them he could get his freedom back. The woman talking about him said on the other hand, that shortly after his escape the ceiling in Chevaliers prison cell had to be repaired, because it was broken, which is an evidence to believe Chevalier wasn´t lying, he was actually telling the truth about breaking out through the roof.
