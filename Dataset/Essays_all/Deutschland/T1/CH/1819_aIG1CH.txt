The Chevalier de Seingalt seemed to have had many adventures and experiences in his life yet people are not sure wether the memoires he wrote about them are true and reliable because of that I am going to write an essay about the accuracy of his memoires.
First of all it is stated that the Chevalier wrote about him being very wealthy but if you do some research on that it is revealed that he borrowed money from a swiss merchant which makes his memoires less believable. However he could have borrowed this money because of some investments he had to make so while waiting for those investments to be successfull and bring money he had to borrow some money as well.
The meeting of Voltaire and him is also very questinable because he wrote this conversation down several years after the actual meeting which lets us doubt its accuracy yet again. But it is aslo revealed that he always made notes when talking to someone so he could have based the reconstruction of the conversation with Voltaire on those notes.
His prison escape is said to be a very good story since he semms to have escaped by making a whole into the prison ceiling and climbing out of it people say that this is accually true since the prison door had to be replaced after his escape from the venice prison other voices disagree with that idea while stating that he used his influence in the politic scene to escape which could be but wouldnt explain all the other prisoners with way more influence sttaying there not able to do anything.
