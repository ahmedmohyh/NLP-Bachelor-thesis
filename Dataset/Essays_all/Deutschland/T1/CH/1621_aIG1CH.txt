The first argument was, that the big amount of money, Chevalier spent in Switzerland, could obviously have been borrowed. But the fact itself doesn't mean, that he couldn't have that much money. Many people are borrowing money when they gamble or are at parties. There is the option, to pay everything back and have a good amount of money at the atm. The main reason ist, that having such a big amount of money with you is on the one hand dangerous and on the other hand just not relaxing at all.
The second one was, that there often isn't a evidence for a meeting. They could've met and nobody would've reconized it.
The last argument was, that, in history, there were much more people with friends, who had even more influence. That makes the fact, that having a mate in the jail is in his postion unrealistic, possible. 
Every single example in the text, is just a thing without a single evidence.
