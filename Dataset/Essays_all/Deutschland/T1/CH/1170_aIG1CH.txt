The arguments in the audition where strictly against the arguments in the text. For example the text says that Chevalier was claiming that when he was in switzerland he was very rich thought he spent a lot of money on party an gambling, but also borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. So why he borrows money when he was a kind of rich? With that the text argues that Chevalier was a lier. The women in the autition at the other side argues, that he only borrowed money because he invastated his money and waited on it to come back multiplizied. In that time period he needed money to live on his standarts so he borrowed money because he knew that he could pay it back in a few days. So he wasn't poor at all.
The text also criticises that his prison break in Venice, Italy wasnt as he claimed it was. Chevalier claimed, that he escaped by using a piece of metal to make a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof, while the text argues with his politically well-connected friends in Venice who offered a bribe for him.
The audition argues against that. The woman says that other prisoners in had better politically well-connected friends in Venice and that they weren't escaped from prison so the story of Chevalier have to be correct.
