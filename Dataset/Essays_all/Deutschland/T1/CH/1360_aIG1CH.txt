After reading and hearing something about the Chevalier there are some points which are not the same. In the text it sais that the Chevalier was very rich and did not borrow money from something but they said that he was very poor and borrowed money from others an was on partys to get money. But in other points like the conversation with Voltaire bot sources are right because both said that he wrotes down what they talked about. But in the text it sais that critics do not believe that he wrotes everything down because there was not one person there when they met so no one knows if it is right or not. In the hearing part there was no word about the critics. In the text it also sais that he has well-connected friends in Venice who helped him to escape the prison. But in the other source they said that he had friends in the prison but his room has to repaired and the part with the room which has to be repaired is not in the text. Also there are some different kinds of the escape from Chevalier. Also the text has more details of his life than the hearing part. Also the hearing part is in the most time the opposit of the reading text. So there are different informations about the same person. The most difference is the point about the information that he was poor or rich. In some cases both sources are the same but some times more detailed or not. Also the hearing part did not talked about how he lived in Switzerland and also it did not talked about that he had connection with famous people. Also it sais that the friends of Chevalier in the prison could escape with him and that they did not helped him to escape. But the text sais that he had help from friends from the outside who helped him.
