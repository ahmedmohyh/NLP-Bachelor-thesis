The Chevalier de Seingalt wrote a memoir about his life and adventures and many points of his discricing seems to be unrealistic, that it not happened like he tells. Now you can discuss, if all informations could be right in a historical text. The story that he borrowed many money from a merchant is also able to discuss, because it does not automatically mean that he have to be poor. Also critics are skeptical because of th e records in the memoir between Voltaire and the Chevalier. The prison escape of the Chevalier was also claimed by critics saying that he did not eycaped by using a piece of metal to open the ceiling. They said that he had many friends,who could offered a bribe to free him. But there is the point that something could be open and he also escaped and just wrote the story more exciting to entertaoin his readers.
