First of all it has been startet in the eighteens century, published the memoir. Many people wasn't rich in the century and must go to borrow a lot of money, but Chevalier was a rich men, he didnt borrow money from peoples. In the Memoir, Chevalier and Voltaire are in a conversation and he wrote everythink from these conversation down und then he published it years later in the memoir. 
In the Presentation we already heard few minutes ago, said the women, that they already give a lot of money out , then they have been on a party in Switzerland. And they have a bar, where they earn money to life, because he is working there to get richer. A second point was that he met  famouse people like Voltaire und wrote everything down , what they spoke about . The last point was that the his friends are in the prison of Venice and he powered for his friends and for the peace of them and the world. Against to the text , the statement of the prison are not very important and he get a lot critics about his memoir. People think he was lying to the Humanity, because no one know about a meeting between him and Voltair, a famouse writer. The text and the audio shows us the opposite meanings, because the one of them is out his view and the other one of a view from an other writer.
