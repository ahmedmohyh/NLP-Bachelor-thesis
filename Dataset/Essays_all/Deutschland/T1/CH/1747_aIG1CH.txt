In the lecture the womans has arguments against each of the arguments in the text given saying that the memoir is not accuracy. Its start with the argument  that he spend a great amount of money for partys but only borrowed it. The argument she is giving that he borrrowed it and payed it back later because he came rich later, with his memoir. The second argument says that the conversations are not accurately, because it was written many years after the conversations occurred. She says against that his friend always write the conversations with him immidltly down, after talking to him and gives him later his writings when he was writing his memoir. 
The last point gives Critics to his escape fom a prison in Venice. The text says that he only came out because politically well-connected friends in Venice bribed his jailers to free him. The argument from the lecture is that other jailed persons had much more influced friends and didnt get out. And in the documents of the prison stands that the ceiling had to be repaired a few days after the escape of Chevalier.  So its realistic that the escape he is describing can be true.
