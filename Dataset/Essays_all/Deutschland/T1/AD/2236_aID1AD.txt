Children aged two to five have to learn very much about live. For example about their needs and how they had to react in diffrent situations. One of this situation is the television advertising. They had to diside whether they resist this advertising or not. If not they had to ask their parents whether they could buy them this things. And than it is by the parents if their child gets this thing. For example the child watches TV his favourit series dragons or somthing and after it comes an advertising about a figur from this film whitch one can by in the supermarket. After that the child goes to his mom and ask her to buy this figur. So their is a secound opinion which knows more about the world and how it works. But when the child starts annouing his mother she maby desids against her on opinion and than the advertising has the chance to manipulat the child with more and more new figurs of this series and the child wants them all but the mother do not want to buy them. When this happens the child maby goes to the supermarket and buys tehem by itselfs. But the child can not do that because its to young. An other example is if the mother says yes but buys it with the money of the child. Than the child learns when it has enough money to buy the next figur that it can not have everything. This child will grow up and knows how to spend its money without a helping hand. It would not buy evrthing what the advertising says instad of bthe other child who maby would. In my opinion television advertising directed toward children aged two to five should be allowed to teach the children how to act in this situations. But the parents have to know how they had to react. When a brefed mother or father is given it would work and television advetising should be allowed.
