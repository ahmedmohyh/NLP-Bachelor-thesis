On the one hand children can get influenced negatively from the advertisement, for example from advertisements which shows the ideal of women or men. Advertisements which are constructed with a hidden message also can be dangerous for the child. For example it is a hidden sexistic message and the child would not even notice that because at its age it does not no what sexism is, but when the child grows up it could be possible that it can get a tendence to support sexism. Of course this is a extreme version of influence. It also can be bad words in the advertisements. The child hears them and automatically save them.
That could influence their future life.

On the other hand Televion advertisements are just a very small part in the childrens daily life, more important are the surrounding people like the parents. It is more important that they let the child grow up without wrong opinions or a specific creed. Furthermore it is the choice of the parents if their child watchs Television, because at the end it is their choice what they want to allow and what to forbid and they choose how to raise their child up and it is not the choice of any other person. 
Also it would be difficult to forbid the television advertising towards young children because you can not monitor what parents let their children watch and if there would not be any advertisments between the TV Shows the TV Channels have to fill a lot of more plot.

My opinion on this statement is that there are several advertisements on televion which young children should not see because it could have influence on their furture life and opinion and these advertisements should not allowed, but it is the choice of the parents what they let their child watch.
