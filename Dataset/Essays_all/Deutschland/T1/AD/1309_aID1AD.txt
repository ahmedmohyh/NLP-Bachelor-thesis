Advertises. Everyone, who watches tv sees them hundreds of times. But should they not be allowed if they are directed toward childs at the age from 2 to 5?
I think, advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. Kids at the age from 2 years to 5 years do not really have the understanding to realize, what the advertising shows. Maybe children understand the advertising wrong or do not think about the advertised object. For example, kids, who are watching tv without their parents see a toy, which they see completely different from it's usual meaning. The kids fall for this and maybe this toy isn't even allwoed for kids this young.
On the other hand, children at this age are very manipulatable, so they get the advertising and fall for the advertised object. They instantly want the object and do not even know, what it's meant for. At this age, it's not really possible to realize, what is happening around the children. They just see everything but don't think about the things they see. If you show a little kid a teddybear and say, that they need this, they think that they really need this. This is advertising in a smaller way.
The manipulation can be seen the other way too. Kids, who are manipulated by advertises, have no own opinion anymore. They are like zombies. They need this toy. Advertises in the tv are like a trap from the toy companies. Children tumble into the trap and they are caged. No way out until the parents buy this toy. Mostly kids are sreaming and crying, when they arent happy. As a dad, I couldn't stand this noise and would buy the toy. 
Advertises for young childs are indirectly directed towards the parents. No child would accept a no, if they want a toy. They annoy their parents until they are happy.
