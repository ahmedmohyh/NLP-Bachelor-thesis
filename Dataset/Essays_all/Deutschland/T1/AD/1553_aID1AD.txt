Nowadays, advertisment is everywhere. There is advertisment for every age, from babies to old people. It is hotly discussed, wether advertisment directed toward young children should be banned from television.
First of all, we have to recognize the legal status. In Germany everybody is allowed to say what he wants as long as it does not break other laws. Making a new law that bans a part of television advertisment would not
Secondly, trading with goods for children is a big part of the economy. If there was no advertiment on television, the amount of toys etc. would probably decrease. As a consequence, governmental income would also decrease because taxes etc. would not be paid.
Thirdly, everybody should be able to build up an own opinion. It is the right of children to watch advertisment on television and then decide about advantages and disadvantages and as a conclusion having an own, independent opinion.
There are also arguments in favour of banning advertisment for children from television. It is true that everybody should have the chance to build their own opinion but children are naiv and have no experience whatsoever. Because of this they cannot decide for their own good.
Moreover, with advertisment children are led to be future customers. Advertisment leads them through their lives.
As a conclusion, I do not agree with banning television advertisment for children.
