The amount of televison kids watch these days, since the Tv was created is higher then before. Kids spent their whole time in front of the TV or other specific high-tech systems. Kids, especially young ones can be distracted by the advertisments and can believe everything said in a 3 minute Tv spot. For example the Advertisments where unrealistic content is shown, like things that are on paper or package start living and flying around, or animals like unicorns get real and run through the living room. Another point of view is that the kids spent too much time in front of the Tv in general. They stop spending time with friends or just watch spongebob with them. There are also special Ads which kids will always keep in their mind. The ones with violent content, half-naked women or a lot of action stay in their minds and afterwards in school, they tell friend about it of course. 
But ads are not always bad and inappropriate. Sometimes they just want to make us realize how good we have it to have a home food and just a family. This concept goes for example with the "unicef" Advertisments. Those show often poor kids without food and family. If little kids get such a message is questinable though. Another pro aspect for ads is that are able to learn something new any may they can understand just a little how the "big world" works. Different pictures make different and impressions and different impressions make a more interesting place to live on. 
One way or another the influence of television and Advertisments is bigger then we think. But as long as our kids use some of their short time between Shows  and Cartoons to go out to remember what the real world looks like, things still didn´t hit the bottom
