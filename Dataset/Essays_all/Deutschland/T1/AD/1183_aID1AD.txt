Television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society. There are some good points, but also many bad ones for the children. In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life. Television advertising can be good for a children, whose parents are very busy and do not have many time for their child. Many television channels have learn programms for children, where children can learn for example languages or easy vocabulary. But it is not good for the children, to just sit in front of a TV and watch channels. They need influences of their parents and of other kids. They need to go out to the playground, play with their friends and get social. I think that children, who sit the whole day in front of a television, will not educate as good as the ones, who go out and learn from their parents and from their activities. The other children will not learn, how to get friends and to communicate with different people. They will also not have a good relation to their parents, because they did not spend much time with them, when they were young. I think, that it is really important for a children to have a good relation to their mother and father. The position of parents is so important for children, because they learn from them and act like them. When they do not spend much time with their parents, when they are young it will have aftermath, when they are adults. When they go to school, they will possibly be a misfit, beacause they did not learn, how to make friends and be social. 
To conclusion, I agree with that statement, because the television advertising is not good for a well education of the children and the relation to family.
