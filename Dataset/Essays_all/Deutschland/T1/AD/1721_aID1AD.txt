The television programm is full of advertisements. Espacally the programms for children. Now, short time before christmas, there are many new toys, for which, there is much of advertisements. Becaus of this, there is the big question: Is it good that the advertisement towards young children is allowed, or should it be forbidden?
The point, that the advertisements should be forbidden, is, that many children could think the things they see in the advertisement  are real. For example, a costume of superman. The children could think, they can fly with it, like in the advertisement. Because of this it could happen bad things. 
Against this, there is the point, that the parents of the child could manage the advertisements. They could change the programm, when there are advertisements, or make a deal, that the child is only allowed to watch one episode and must than turn the tv of. 
The next point is, that children from two to five are too young to watch much tv. If the parents allow them to watch many hours a day, it must be clear, that there might be advertising breaks.
Also if there are no advertisements towards so young children, they get confrated with it when they get older. Because they don´t know that there are many fakes in the advertisements they could think it is real. so the problem isn´t solved, it´s only later.
In my opinion the statement is complitly wrong. I think the parents must manage it and explain their children, that the advertisements are not always complitly right. If there is now advertisement towards this age, the confrontation is later, but not less extreme. so in fact it isn´t important, when they start to advertise.
