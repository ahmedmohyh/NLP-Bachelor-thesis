The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" is a thing which is often discussed in the media today. More and more parents allow their children to watch Tv every day in the morning and also in the evening, often the whole day but the question which we should think about is if that is good for the health and the brain quality of our children?
Children which are looking Tv every day have a more bad concentration than kids which are not looking Tv the whole day because the "Tv-kids" don´t know how to give tasks to themself and how to not going to be boring when they are alone in for example their room. Children which are not looking Tv the whole day or not so often know how to play with themself and they have a better concentration because they can play with things longer without beeing boring after a time.
A second important point to say is that the kids which are looking Tv every day have a bad fantasy because their own fantasy is not very supported by looking Tv then in Tv everything is how the executer wrote it and the children don´t have the chance to change something in the history or to create new characters. So their creativity has a limit but children which are not looking Tv the whole day have a much better creativity because when they play they can imagine everything and there is no limit like in the Tv. 
The most important argument is that parents which decided to make children shoud take care of them and for me it´s not to make the Tv to the animateur of the children. When you decided to have kids you have to take always care of them for the rest of your life and try to make them happy in every situation of their life.
At the end I can say that children are a big responsibility and that it should be clear that you can´t give them away when they´re getting on your nerves or if something don´t happens like you want it to happen so I think Tv advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because there are so many things you can do with them and which are making your childen more happy than just sitting towards the Tv and looking on it.
