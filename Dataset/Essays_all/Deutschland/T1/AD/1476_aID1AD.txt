Today you can find in every house a tv and the most people can't imagine to have no one. The most childrens starts to watch tv very early and when their parents or grandparents told them about their first tv they often start to laugh.
The first tv was in the middle of the 20th century on the market. The movies were black and white and have a button for switching the channels. In this time the most people can't buy one because the tv too expensive. But when a family owned a tv was watching tv the "highlight" of the evening.

After the quick text I would like to talk about the positive and negative aspects of watching tv in the young age of two to fve. 
I start with the positive site. 
One argument is that the childrens could learn something. In the channel for childrens are series where they could learn something new for example about animals, the nature or the world. Also the series like the "Sandmann" in Germany is a adorable serie to watch, but also the news that are produced extra for childrens are a good posibility for them, because the people who worked there, explained everthing easy so everybody could understand it.

The first negative aspect is that the childrens often don't want to go outside because they realy start to like watching tv, sometimes because of that, they lose friends and in this age is to have a friend very important.
The most series for childrens are often in the early morning in the tv is another negative point because it's bad to watch tv at 7am.
The last argument is that some childrens are learning some bad things from the serie or wehen they switch the channel.

I think it's okaywhen a children watch sometimes a movie or a serie at tv but only togehter with their parents so the parents knows which film the childrens watch. But in totally I agree the statement.
