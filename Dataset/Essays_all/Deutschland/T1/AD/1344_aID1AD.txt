In the following I give some points and will discribe if young children are allowed to use television. 

You often hear that young children (aged two to five) are using so much television because the parents watch so much TV or the parents haven`t got any time for their own children. 
I think that it is okay when young boys and girls are watching TV or play some games on the tablet or the laptop from their parents if the parents haven`t got much time to play with their children little games like "Memory" or "Hide and see" or go outsite in the forest and take a walk.
Also the kids learn how to act with the media and that could be very important for they future. 
But if the young children are watching to much TV they want more from day to day. The media are also bad for the eyes. if the children make the television to their hobby it could be that they were fatter and fatter, because only watch TV is boring so they eat sweat things. 

I think that it should be allowed that the children use the television if it`s not more than one hour on a day.
