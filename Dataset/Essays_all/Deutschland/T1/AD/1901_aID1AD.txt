Television is a multimedia thing and is in all countries very popular and all childs use television advertising all day. But is this good oder bad? 
On the one hand it is good because the childs can learn early to comunicated with other people in the world and understand how possible it is to use television advertising at the day. Otherwise it is good because you can learn how easy all things can be. For example how easy it is to write a text on the internet or how cool it is to look things on the television and can lay in your bed.
On the other hand it is bad because it is too eary with a age from two to five. The childs are childs and must be playing in the garden or somebody else but not use television advertising. Therefore the childs want too early to go on the television everyday. Otherwise for the childs (umfeld) is it not good because you do not have many real friends.
I think that the childs from age two to five should not be allowed to use television everyday because it is too early and not in all things good for the child. All in all I can say that is it not allowed for me and for me is it not okay that so many parents allowed the childs to use television so much in there freetime.
