Many of aus us it every day. the smartphone. the tablet. the computer. and there are critics an people which see a chance in the using of this new technology. but is it ok to give that high technology devices to children aged two to five? Or shouldnt it be allowed to give them to young children?
I can see this situation very often for example in my family or also on public places. The poblem with this is that the children cant imagin that its not real what they see. And its the same with tv advertising. When the children with two years lern to do the things from the tv advertising, they maybe start smoking with twelve years. On the other hand the advertising could help the parents find out what the children want. E. g. for present for the birthday or christmas. but there are also prospects. I thing that the young generation shouldnt see the advertisment on the tv for themselve. But when the companies will be allowed to make advertising spots only for young children the parents are able to take of the tv or when teh children see something, the parents decide if they buy the product or not, because they are in the need of paying it. Personally I think that the Television advertising directly towards young children should not be allowed because the children are in they own developement aged two to five. The advertisment should also expect the consumer to buy and that are in this age the parents.
