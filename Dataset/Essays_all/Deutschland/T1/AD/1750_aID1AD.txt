Everyday people have contact with television advertising and many people say it should not be allowed to direct this advertising towards children under the age of five years.
 When Children at this very sensitive age see an interesting advertisement they are very interested in it and want to have the product. 
For the companys it´s easy to win the children as their consumers. They make an advertising for television channels especially toward children for example for a "Barbie". The children think they need this toy and ask their parents to buy it. Of course it´s a big advantage for the company because they know that young children are important main consumers but now it´s the question if directed advertising toward children should be allowed.
A reason why it should be allowed is that the companys don´t  the children to buy the product of the advertisement and the parents could say "no". Also the company has to sale their products and when they produce children toys it´s okay to promote it. But on the other side children at the age of two to five are very sensitive and when they see an colorful and interesting advertisement they are leaded to buy this product.  

I think it should not be allowed to make an television advertising directed toward young children because they are very sensitive and naiv at this age and when they see an advertising with the goal to impress them and lead them to buy the product it´s not okay. They plant this thought of the new and cool product in their heads and controll them and this should not be allowed.
