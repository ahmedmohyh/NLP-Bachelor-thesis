The topic is about "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.".
That is a interesting question for parents if they allowed their kids to watch tv.
Because there are pro und contra arguments. But more contras.
The good thing is, that the kids see something interesting maybe.
But the point against that is that they could see too much mad thinks or "rubbish".
Maybe they see a advertise and now they want to have it. A new barbie or a car from cars. They are young and would not understand it.
In the advertise are showing new episodes. They want to see them but they are not allowed from the parents or the age (FSK).
It is possible that they do not understand allthing, again because they are too young.

Or the parents do not care about that and the kids are watching the whole day tv and the advertising. That would not good for the child. Because in this age the kids grow up and remeber that.

I think that it should be not allowed because of the arguments and the health of the kids.
