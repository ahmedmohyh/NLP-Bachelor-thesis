                    Advertising

There are many reasons for why television ads specifically targeted to young children should not be allowed, but in my oppinion one of the strongest is that children aged two to five often can't differentiate between a good tip from their friends or peers - maybe for a toy - or just plain advertisements. That means that those kids would often bug their parents about a special toy, just because they saw it on TV once. Their brains are simply not able to evaluate what they see as much as that of an adult can.

But on the other hand, most TV channels do need those advertisements, in order to cover the costs of producing and sending the children-friendly content that they're offering, and to keep it all running. If their would be no ads, the channel would need a different way to make profit, which in most of the cases results in premium-channels.

So the big question - that you have to decide for yourself - basically is, whether you want to be able to recieve and watch TV for free, or you want your children to grow up to children-friendly content with no ads, which means you have to pay a premium.

In my oppinion there is no perfect solution to that problem, especially because some familys don't have the leftover money needed to subscribe to a premium-channel. And as long as that is the case, TV ads targeted to children have to be allowed, or the children of those familys won't be able to enjoy content made for their age at all.
