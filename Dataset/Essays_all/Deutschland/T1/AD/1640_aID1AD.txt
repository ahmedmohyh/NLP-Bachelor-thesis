Since technical things developed much faster, children start to grow up with more technical things like smartphones, televisions, computers and so on, than in the past. At least every child grows up with a television and thats why there could be the question, if it should not be allowed to show television advertisings directed toward young children. 
It is obvious that children especially in this age during two to five are easy to influence. So whenever they see something they want or someone tells them to buy something cause they really need it, they change their mind so then they really want it. Then they always get on their parents nerves and were sad when the parents do not allow buying these things. Also they learn from television advertisings. If the guy or kid in the advertisement is doing something which looks like fun or something like that, the children watching this want to try it out, too. Even if it is dangerous. Also in these newer times the advertisings are often about ne apps and so on which pushes the children more and more to the technical side, so they stop playing outside or something. They trust in things, the television is showing them, so they even expect the things which are showed them in the advertisings even if it is physically not possible or something else. 

On the other hand the people, making games and so on have to show it in a way to children and so on. Otherwise they would not earn enough money to go on in their production. Also the television programms have to earn enough money to pay their costs. That is just possible with advertisings and so on. So many jobs depent on this.

All in one I think jobs are most important so this side wins for me.
