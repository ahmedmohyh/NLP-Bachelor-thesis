This text is about the line " Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.

First it's important to ask, if the children in these ages really understand the advertisment. They see the product and  maybe want to have it, if they like it. Probably the children will claim to their parents weeks and weeks, that they want to have the thing, shown in the advertisment. But maybe they don't. 
Advertising is more a thing for the parents so they have to decide, if they want to buy the product or not. So if they are able to spend the money, the product costs or not.  So the question isn't really if children in these ages should watch these advertisments, it's more important if it's necessary that the children watch it, when they don't really notice.
What speeks for the advertising is that the children get motivated to concentrate on one thing so maybe, the concentration of them gets better. Another point is that they see the new things , children in their ages can play with. 
A negative point is, as I said, that the children maybe claim at their parents, that they want to have the product even, if the parents don't have the money to buy it. So they will maybe argue with their children. 
I think, that advertisment is like everywhere, in the streets, shops, newspapers, or just the child in the kindergarten, which has the product. So it doesn't really matter if there is advertising in the TV or not.
