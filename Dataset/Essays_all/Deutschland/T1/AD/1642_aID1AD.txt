We are living in a world where technology is a very important thing and many people can't live without. Either the smartphone or tablets are in our hands. But often we like to lay on the couch an watch television, but should television directed toward young children be allowed?

This statement is a controversial theme. 
The children are even more younger when there starting to watch television and some parents don't care because the children are busy and couldn't go on there nerves. On the other side it isn't good for them because they can become bad eyes or don't go outside anymore. 
The young children will be learn the wrong things and if they are looking to much television they can be stressed and want to look even more TV.
In our society it isn't possible to say that the young children shouldn't watch Tv because it's a very big problem when everyone is watching it the whole time and they musn't. In comparison to that point it's so important for there rising to have freetime and play outside with friends. 
If they are watchuing television the whole time they are sitting in a room without freshly air and forget the time. Most of the time the parents don't think about this problem because of our technologe societiy.
Finally it's important for children to go outside and communicate. Television can make them nervous and often they watch the wrong things so they learn bad vocabulary for the future and mostly haven't the same experiences as others. 

In my oppinion it should be allowed for children to watch TV but not that often so they have enough time for using there freetime to gain experiences. Television adevertising directed toward young children should be allowed but parents should pay more attention on it. And I think not every child is watching TV that often so there are only a few with problems.
