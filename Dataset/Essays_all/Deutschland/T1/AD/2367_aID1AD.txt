Many children are watching movies or other specific things for kids on television. In television it is totally normal to put advertisings in breaks between series or movies, but should it be allowed to advertising directed toward young children?

In my opinion advertising toward young children should be allowed but in a specific way. The advertising should be about school things or games with a background to learn something. The advertising should not be about killing other people with swords or about pistols which shoot water for example. Annother reason why advertising toward young children should be allowed is that the channel where the kids watch their movies or series should be a channel for kids only and if there would be some advertises for older people that would not be so good. Especially if there are advertises about death or somethingelse.

All in all i think there is no reason that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed as long as it´s about games with some background to learn from them, books or computer games to prepare for the elementary school. It´s better than  "normal" advertises where they show how to shoot at eachother with a pistol or fighting with a sword in the garden. The advertises should fit in the channel genre. So if it´s a channel about history or stuff like that there should be advertises about antique swords. Thats totally fine. But if that channel is for kids only they should play advertises directed toward the young children.
