If children (aged two to five) should watch television is a question witch is hard to answer, cause every child is different.
Television could change your child, but it also can not. Many parents say, if their sons watch to much war films ore films where aggresivite plays a big roll, there will become the same when they´ve grown up. I think they don´t have to. A child who´s watching aggresive movies can also be the most relaxed kid in the universe, because it lets his "dark side" in the television, so he can be fully relaxed in normal life. On the other side, young children often can´t really make conclusion wich is reallity and which isn´t. So theire can thing that it´s normal to shoot whitch gun´s in normal life and they can get in to criminality. 
Often the parents do not have so much time for their you children so they put them in front of the television, that the television is doing the nani. That´s a completely wrong way to solv this problem, bacause a television can´t teach a child how life is giong on, because often TV don´t show how the real life is going on. Children who are aged two to five should discover what life can be and not how life can be manipulated. A better way is to interact which the children, instant putting them infroint of the TV. Television can also change their language and how they´re speaking. Often small children watch cartoons and don´t understand if it´s real so their can thing like Teletubbis, that their got a TV in their stoomach and try to find it witch a knife. Small Children really should not watch too often television, but if it´s only a few times a week, that´ll be ok. On this way they can learn wich is reallity and which isn´t, so they don´t think that it´s normal to use gun´s ore other aggresive thing, in real life.
