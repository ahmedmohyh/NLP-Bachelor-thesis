The television advertising directed toward young children, aged from two to five years is not good, because their are many bad television programms for kids and they can destroy their hole life. In the children television today are often series which are not good for kinds. On Kika are many series that are aged for twelve years. Some kids make things that they see in the television, and thats not good. For example some kids will cut their stomach, because of the Teletabbis. Another bad thing is, that the eyes from young children grow in these years. When they often watch television they must wear glasses in young years. Also it is not good to sit often on the couch and watch television. They must go outsite and play football or play playmobil to learn something and to move. When they play football or ride a bike they can met friends and have fun together. In the age from two to five, they cannot understand words so good an they go not to school. 
The television advertising directed toward young children, aged from two to five years has not so much poistive aspects. One positiv aspect is, that they can learn something in the television. Maybe they can learn to speak an to understand, or the watch some learning series for young children. Also the children relax, when they watch television and they can sleep better. 
In my opinion the television advertising directed toward young childrens should not be allowed,, so i agree with this statement. The youg children must play something an go outside and not sit every day on the couch an watch television. Parents should say, whats good for their childrens. But in my opinion its not good for the childrens. They often must wear glasses in the age of ten, because they have bad eyes when they watch every day television.
