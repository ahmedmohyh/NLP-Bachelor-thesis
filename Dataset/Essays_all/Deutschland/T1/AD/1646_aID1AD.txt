"It sais that televison adversising direct toword young children".
To begin television has a big place in our society. Nearly everyone is wathing TV nowedays because of the big number of TV-shows. Beside the TV-shows witch are just for fun or to relaxe at the end of the day ther are also TV-shows were you can lern new things. But should it be allowed for young children to watch it.

On the one hand as its been said television hasn't only TV-shows witch arent needed in life witch are just for fun so we have to split the wort television in two parts. If children learning something with the televison, for example there is a TV-show were a child can learn how to speek better or maybe how to draw it could be good for the kid because he or she is not wasting his or her time. Because in the young age children don't forget what they hear or see everything stays in their mind. 
But on the other hand this kind of experience can the child also have in public, for example by talking with its family. He or she has there also the oppertunity to learn with other children by playing. The child gets so a better social life and learns that its not only him/her.
The second part opf television are the TV-shows were you dont learn something you are just watching something happen. ther the children also get influenced.

I agree with the statement because in this age it is verry imortant to lern by doing and this in socitety. The Children aged two to five dont know really much because they have to learn everything new. Its importand to show them only good things and something good to lern because it will stany for the rest of his/her life.
