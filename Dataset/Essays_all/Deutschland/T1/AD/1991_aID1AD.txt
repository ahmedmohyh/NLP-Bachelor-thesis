Essay:
Television Advertising toward joung children has postive and negative sites.
On the one hand many children are not allowed to watch TV at such a young age, so the ads would probably not even reach them. But on the other hand the children, who watch television at that age, are not able to go shopping alone or to buy toys etc. on the internet. By seeing advertisements for those things on TV it would be easier for them to find out about the stuff they could get. Also the childrens parents would see those advertisements and could buy for example books or toys for their children. Young kids don't have money or a bank account. They can't buy what they want on their own. Their parent or older siblings are the ones who do it for them, so the advertisements doesn't have to reach the children. But what also is important, is the fact that young children aged two to five should not watch television, because it can have bad effects on their health. Of course their parents decide wether they are allowed to watch TV or not, but studies warn about negative side effects. Children should use their time to meet their friends and go on a playground. They should go outside and have fun by not by sitting on the sofa to watch TV all day. On my opinion advertisement toward children aged between two to five should be allowed, because their parents would also see those ads and could get ideas of what to by for example for their kids birthday. But children at that age should not be allowed to watch TV or at least they should only watch it for a short time.
