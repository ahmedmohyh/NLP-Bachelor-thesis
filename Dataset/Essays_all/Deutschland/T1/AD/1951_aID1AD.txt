I disagree with the following statement ,,Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) shold be not allowed" because the parents of the children can do what they wanted to do.
 But I also think that the parent would have a timeperiod in which the children can watch TV maybe 1 hour a day. This is important because lots of joung children dont know what to do in their free time. For example if a children always watch TV and the parents are not able to play with the child it dont know what to do in freetime in contrast to this a child who dont watch TV every day or not so mutch, is often more kreativ and dont need others to play with him. Another negativ point ist that their are sometimes TV shows wich are not realistic or just nothing for childs at the age of two to five but the parents let the kids watch this. Although watching TV is a way to give the childs something to do when the parents work or do other things but for a long time it istnt the right way to support the children. on the one hand you can disagree to this statement but on the otherhand you know taht it is dont realistic. 
If the television time can be limited children can whatch TV when the parents are not there but it also is not so mutch that the kids dont have time for themselves. But of cousre that isnt very realistic too because you cant see if the parents are wanted to do these rools and if not you cant say you have to pay for that.
