I think advertising towards young children which are between two to five years old should be forbidden to save all people who are over 15 years old from these annoying baby- and young children products like Pampers, Hipp, Playmobil and much more others. Also this would prevent children from wanting useless and overprized products like Lego, Hotweels and Barbie which are bad for them (because then they annoy their parents to buy more of it, which might start an addiction), the environment (because it is nearly completely made out of plastic) and also the parents because either they buy some things for their children or their children are getting mad. Also these things to play with are trown away after a while. Instead they should get something like an old gameboy, which is hard to destroy, cheap and also then the children do not need anything else to play. At commercials such as Hipp or Pampers you could say that it is made for the parents so they know which products are best for their baby/child. But seriously, if someone wants to know what really is good for their child, he should google it instead of believing in an commercial product which is overprized. 
I think that these commercials should be forbidden to save the teenagers from being annoyed by these advertisments because seriously, these advertisements are pretty annoying for example Hotweels commercials: The guy who speaks it does not really speak - he shouts his text, so that the children think that it have to be good and that they need it to be happy.
Seeing all the arguments everyone should see it now.
