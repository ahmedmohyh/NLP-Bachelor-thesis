"Should it not be allowed to produce television advertising directed toward young children at the age between two and five?".
On this question is based the following text, which shows advantages and disadvantages  including my personal opinion.

First, the main time a person is watching TV is during the evening.
Some people also watch a movie after lunch while they want to have a short sleep.
At this times a child aged two to five even sleeps too or it is playing with friends, so that the child can not see advertsisings.
However the television can be nessecary, because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep. 
But during such a movie there is not more than one time advertising. 
The most children are not interested in this advertsing and do not watch them, so that it is unnessecary to produce television advertising directed to young children, then they do not see them.
The most important argument is, that children aged two to five will never understand television advertising even if you show toys or pets, because they do not know the reason of advertising.

At my own opinion I will say, that television advertising for young children can be allowed, but it is not nessecary, because they do not watch much films .
Besides they do not care about the advertising and would not understand the background reasons for it.
