Regarding the statement "Television advertising toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed." I want to make my opinion clear in the follwing essay.

I do agree with this statement, since television advertising can be very aggressively pushing and there are real geniuses developing always new ways of manipulating the human mind.
I do not agree that it should be forbidden to advertise for for example clothes for these children addressed towards their parents, though. Grown up people and even older children who are further developed have to deal with this, because advertising in general is not a bad thing, just not for children who are not ready to judge and order these situations. As the children get older, with their personal development they will also learn how to deal with aggressive advertisements and there is no way of "protecting" your child of advertisements everywhere it goes, since there will be advertisements on most ways it will go, regardless whether it is the way to school or to the supermarket, we see it all the time. But advertisements in the television are not as hard to ignore as outside the supermarket, because a jumping, colored little guy with his voice bursting of excitement is clearly more catchy than a "salad, now -50%".
Psychologists are powerful people in this society, since they can practically manipulate people with the researches they did and science being so progressing. Opposing that, we have children of approximately three years who do not even fully know what they are doing and just want to have fun watching television while being confronted with the result a mastermind of advertisements created. I do not really think this is fair.

Concluding, I think addressing television advertisements toward children aged from two to five years should be forbidden, to simply save them in such a helpless phase of developing.
