I agree with the following statement because I think that children at the age of two to five are able to understand what the advertisemnet wants to say but they aren´t able to really think about it and if it´s good or bad. They can´t have an opinion about that so it´s unfair to let products look good to them but they can´t know an disagreeing argument. Children at that age believe everything they get to know or see because they aren´t able to know it better and as we all know that every advertisemnt is only made to convice the people to buy the product, children might only talk about that product after watching it in television.  Another contra is that if there were people in the advertisement who do kind of strange or dangerous things, the children might want to do them as well. 

On the other hand it depends on what kind of advertising the children see. If it were an advertisement that teaches the children something it would be okay to do that. If the parents have the opinion that thier chuild shouldn´t see that advertisement, they still can switch off the television. 

Even though it could be that the advertisement is teaching something good,I still think that it shouldn´t be allowed to show advertisements for children that are at the age of two to five in television because it´s not necassary ( the children can´t buy the product themselves anyway)  and there might be some risks.
