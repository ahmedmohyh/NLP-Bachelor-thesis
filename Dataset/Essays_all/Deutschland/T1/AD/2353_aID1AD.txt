The opinions concerning television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) are different. Some people think it should be allowed to direct advertising toward them and some people don't think so. It's important to take care of both points of view.

In television advertising things are shown positively to make people buy them. If a child watches an advertising for example for a new game, it could ask it's parents if he or her could buy it. But there are many different advertisings on television so the children could want more an more of these things which are shown in the advertising. In addition children should actually don't get the chance to watch TV all day. It's important for the children's development to go outside for example or to get a good preparation for school in the kindergarten. The advertisings are created funny and intersting for children to influence them.
The people who sell the things of the television advertising just get advantages of them. They get a lot of money for their products beacause many parents buy them when their child asks them to. 

I'm not quite sure about my opinion concerning this topic. On the one hand I think it's okay to allow television advertisings directed toward young children but on the other hand I think it could have a bad influence on them. There are some things in the TV that are not nessesary for children of young age. I think it's more important to prepare the children for their future life and a good education. Of course they should be allowed to watch television as long as it's not too much to have a bad influence on them.
