Today, mostly all famalies have a TV at their home. some of the young parents grew up with a TV theirselves so it is normal for them. So many children start watching TV in a young age. I also did so.
In this case some people think if it could be bad for the kids to see all the advertises shown in TV. Normally advertises are no bad things. Cars, clothes, websites or everything else is shown there. But that could be the problem with it. "Everything". Sometimes there are advertises for movies, maybe a horrro movie. Things children could be scared of. Maybe they can not sleep at the nights. 
We all know how easy it is to trick a child. They believe mostly everything. The same with the advertises they see. So it is easy to tell them wrong things. The things are shown there better than they really are. So the kids want to have everything they see there. It is so amazing for them cause they believe it. But right this point is also a reason to let them watch it, from the view of the econemie. The toy industrie lives from advretises. The children see it in TV and want to have it. 
So in the end I would say there are some advertises that are not good for the chilldren, but if they just watch the channels made for kids it is okay. I do not think that these channels show advertises for dating websites or horror movies, are they? And I watched TV too when I was young and I did not fail my life, I hope.
