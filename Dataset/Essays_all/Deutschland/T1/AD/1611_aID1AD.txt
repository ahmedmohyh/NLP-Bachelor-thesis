In this essay, I will state my opinion on the question wheter or not television advertising toward young children should be allowed.

Of course, it's fun for small children to watch their favorite shows on TV. But on this way, they also get in touch with digital advertising very easily. While on special channels for children, it's most likely some kind of fun games, on channels for older people almost everything could be advertised. In general, advertising is quite manipulative, making the people want to buy the stuff they try to sell - and small children can be manipulated very easily. When children see a new game, they probably beg their parents to buy it for them because they are obviously way too young to purchase something on their own. Then it's the parents' choice wheter or not their child is allowed to get a new thing to play with. Also, when children never get to see advertising, it's way harder for them to deal with it later in life. 
But advertising may also trick the children into thinking everything they see on TV is real. Especially for very young people, it's hard to make a difference between reality and a fictional world.

In general, I don't see something wrong with television advertising for young children. It's interesting to see the new games they may probably get for next Christmas and most of the time, they enjoy seeing advertising that is directed to them. Of course the children shouldn't spend too much time in front of a TV, but that's the thing parents should be keeping an eye on normally. Also, they should be aware of the fact that they need to show children how to deal with digital advertising the correct and best way instead of just forbid them to watch TV for all their childhood because this (as long as it's on a healthy dose) may even help them to understand life and growing up in the world they're living in since advertising is an important part of today's society.
