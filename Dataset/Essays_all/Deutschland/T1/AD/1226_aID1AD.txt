In the following I´m going to explain the arguments supporting and against the aforesaid these.

One point to support the Television adverstising toward young children is that they learn to how to threat the modern technic. It is an advantage because in the world nowadays HighTech plays an important rule in every branche. For example they see a teddy in an advertisement and connect the TV as something positive, so maybe they want to learn later on how an TV works and this can be an whelthy experience in the learn progress during the life.

In contrast to this it is not necessary for young children to live an life with much technic, this comes automaticly when they grow up and get informatic lessons at school or somewhere else. In this beginning years of a life children don´t need to come in contact with the modern technic, it is better when they learn to improve their motorical skills and speaking skills. This can be achive with the modern technic: there are so many apps and widgets for tablets and smartphones with the goal to get the childrens attention, but another important part of the growing-up (?) is to know how the reality works and don´t waste so much time in front of an TV.

To sum up my opinion, it´s good when children have interest on the modern technic (which is an effect of the advertising) but it is not necessary to advertise for children in this age because they maybe do not understand the advertisement.
