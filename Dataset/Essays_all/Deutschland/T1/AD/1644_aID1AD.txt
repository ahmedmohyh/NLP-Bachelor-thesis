There are advertisements in the television, that are directed to children between 2 and 5. Now i want to show some arguments for and against this and in the end summarize my opinion.

The first positive thing, that comes in my mind is, that these advertisements are for the childrens age and not for example some advertisements for adults. This can also be good for showing the children new things and maybe, if there is an advertisement for a toy for example, they want to have it and they can then play with it. Also there can be interesting advertisements for children so they get interest in new things which are shown in the television or something like that. 

But there are also negative points in these advertisements. One thing is, that the children maybe don't even understand one thing which is said. Also it could be a problem, that they get addicted to watching television if there is an advertisement they really like and which they want to see all the time. Also there can be advertisements, which aren't liked from every child. And that is not good if they start to cry from some advertisements or if they have bad dreams about something which was shown on the television. 

The question is now, if television advertisements, directed to children between 2 and 5 should be forbidden or stay allowed. 
In my opinion, they shouldn't be forbidden because it can be interesting or it can show things which are nice and which the children also like. There are also some negative things, but for the most things it could help that the parents overwatch their children, while they watch television. So if this is the case there should almost be no problem with these advertisementes and i think it is okay to allow them, because there aren't so good reasons against it.
