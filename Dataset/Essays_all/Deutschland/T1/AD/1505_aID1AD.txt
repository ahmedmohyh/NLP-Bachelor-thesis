No doubt about it, advertising plays a major role in our modern way of life. As we are confronted by advertisement every day it determinates our daily routine and consumption behaviour.
Nevertheless, is television advertising good to be seen by young children?
Or should television advertising directed toward young children aged two to five be forbidden?

The following arguments and counterarguments are about to answer this question!

The first reason for forbidding television spots directed to youn children is the danger of their consequences: Young children are not able to realize the differences between reality and advertisement and believe in everything that is said in those televison spots. However, advertisement is often exegerrated.
Thats the reason why advertising is too effectible for children at these ages. Compared to advertisement of McDonald´s which is directed to children in a very special way it results in a lot of money for the companies and a lot problems for the health of the children.


On the other hand advertising directed to young children offers some opportunities:

It allows children to react and to cope with advertisement at a young age which makes them to confident consumers.



In summing up it can be said that there are some opportunities and problems due to advertisements directed to young children.
After weighing the pros and cons it is more important to me to cover young children from advertisements!
