In my eyes television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. There is a very big influence from the world around young children to their mind. Advertising often uses an incorrect speaking or bad words, so that the kids learn things they should not do. For example my brother, he is four years old, watches tv and uses the same words, the speaker of the advertising text does. Sometimes there are words he does not know what they mean and uses them in a strange context.
Also I think young children are not able to decide what is real or what is wrong. There are lots of toys in the advertising, which are presented in a fantastic way, so that every child wants to play with it, but the most of them are different, when you have it in your hands. There are funny and exciting movies to show the newest Lego toys. The figures can speak and there are supporting soundeffects. Young kids, who are watching this, always think thats the way you can play with it.
Maybe the parents have problems to buy the correct present by reason that the kind do exactly what the want to have - the pretty dollhouse from the advertising and not another one! Most of the advertising toys cost to much money for normal families with more than one child. Twohundred euros for the newest model of Lego Technic ist a lot for a christmas present, but the kids are angry whan it is not the same they want. In their age they do not know that twohundred euros are a lot of money.
