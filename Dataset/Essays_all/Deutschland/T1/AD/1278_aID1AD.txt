Should Television advertising directed toward young children be forbidden or hould it be allowed?
In general young children are learning at every time of the day. They get visiual informations about all what they are doing and what they see and hear. Specific Television concepts could be useful to teach the children important things like counting, reading, colors or something like that. Also in the social sector it can be useful. On this way parents could be helped by rasing the children. Without specific studies about the topic over a long time, nobody is allowed to write a paragraph saying that it is forbidden to let children watch Televisison. Children are just in a process, where the way of getting visiual informations is important. If the children watch Television much time a day or week, they get the feeling that they always have to be entertaint and maybe they will get problems to concentrate in situation, they have to or get less focus on them. So they do not learn to be creative themselfs. Also they do not get children experiences like beeing outside and learning by seeing something new. It also could by critical for the childrens healthy. People who spending most of their free time in watching Television would not do hobbies, sports or investigate in social contacts. They might be fat and social isolateted. 
All in all i think that it is not important to watch Tv in this age and they have to learn by experiences and do not have to count or write. Things like that working without that. In this time, where all works with computers, it is important that by seperate using this things for a better life and making this things to our life and this should happen by rasing children. But i also think that it is unrealistic to forbid duch a maual thing. Noone could proove it and a liberal country like our is, parents are selfconfident to raise their children with own methods, as long as the children do not get physicl hurtness or something like that.
