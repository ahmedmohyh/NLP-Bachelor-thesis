Now I want to write an argumented essay about the statement if televison advertising directed toward young people sdf Habe irgendwie die zu argumentierende Frage nicht verstanden
Television advertising directed toward young people can have many consequences.If the children see advertising in television they want to have this products.
The Hersteller can manipulate the children with the advertising of new products.

But televison advertising  directed toward young children can also have possitive asspects.They can think about new products
