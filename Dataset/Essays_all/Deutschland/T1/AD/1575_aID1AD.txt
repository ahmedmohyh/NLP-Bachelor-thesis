The following text is about, that television advertising should not be allowed to young children between age two to five.
But is it importent?
It should be allowed, because of this, the parents are not so much stessed out. Their children are all the time in front of the television, so must not play with the children some games or do activities. Also the parents could do more work and are able to do more money.
It should be also allowed, because there are a lot of informational television shows, that could help the child by learning new things, for example the alphabeth or the one and one, in point of that, school would be much easier.
Nevertheless there are some bad points for the children in the television.
One reason for this is, that the kids are more indoor and not in the nature. They could getting fat and a couchpotato, because they aren't play any games outside, like hide and seek or running. Also the children woundn't get so much social expiriance with other children, which is very helpful for the future, because this time is the first point of life, where should make friends. I gives you impressions, how you should react to other people and how you shouldn't, this is very importent for every future, of every person, because you need it in work and to create a family.

Yes, I agree with the question ,,Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five ) should not be allowed'', because like in the next its an very importent time of life for the children, they should go outside, make some friend and should have fun together, because in their future they aren't able to this anymore. They just have not enouth time.
