For me is the statement : "Television advertising directed towrad young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed", a very important theme. 

I think that children between the ages two to five should go outside and learn something about whats going on arround them, and not sitting infront of the television  and wachting something very stupid. For an important reason is aswell that the children could get more stupid if they just sit infront of the television, like my parents often say, they couldn´t learn something from it, that makes me very sad . An other very important, maybe an old school fact, is that our parents or even our grandparents are growing up without watching television every day. For me there is no need that small chilrden have to watch television, why cant they play with theyr parents or even witch theyr older/younger siblings, they definitly got better influence on them than some characters in a tv-show. All this should be more fun for them, then sitting infront of the television.
Often i ask myself why could parents put their little child infront of the television,why dont the play and enjoy the time with them, the time is running so fast and they would see it much later when the time is over. But in the other hand the parents could let their children wacht tv sometimes, not too often, when they don´t really have time for them, for example during cooking or something like that. 

So like you could see I could found definitly more espects to agree with the statement. so for me the statement tells the truth, evenif some people wouldn´t see it. For me it makes more sence that little childrens are playing out seid or with their toys, but not with those electronical toys which be could have.
