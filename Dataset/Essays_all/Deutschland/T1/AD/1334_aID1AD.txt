Today, we are living in a digital century. You can find a TV in almost every house. So, television advertising should be allowed to young children?
I say principially yes!
It is always a question of the programme in the TV. Not every documentation is age-specified. A good example for this are series like "The Big Bang Theory" or "How I met your Mother". For young children, there are other series with are much more better, like the "Sandmännchen" every evening on KIKA.
When I was young, I could only watch this one TV-show every day.
But the main reason against television advertising is, that children have to keep in touch with other children. If your child is watching TV every day, every hour... If that happens, your child will loose his or her social contacts, the friends.
In this time of their life, children are learning very much, for example how to communicate with others. They have their first friendships, are meeting new friends in the primary school. Watching TV is not very helpful with that, it gives them a wrong view of life.
In the end, I would say, that television advertising should be principially allowed, but only, if the children are watching TV-programmes which are age-specified. If this would be allowed, there would be a big missing part in this digital century. But to let them watch TV always...
