The world is full of influences coming from magazines, TV or the people around you. For many it is difficult to cope with those influences, so should young children of the ages two to five be exposed to that kind of influence through advertising on television? This will be discussed in the following.

Some might say, every advertisement, as long as it is not offensive in any way, should be allowed to be shown on TV. Companies which produce products made for young children should have the rights to advertise these products like any other company with any other product. Only because it is directed toward a specific group of people, it should not result in a worse standing when it comes to selling. 
Furthermore, if parents do not want their young children to watch certain advertisements, they should not let them watch TV shows with a lot of advertising or turn the TV of, in the breaks.

However children in especially that age group are starting to develop their character and their interests. They should be able to do that without being influenced by advertisements what to like or not to like and what to do or not to do. Because of them developing a lot in that time, they are easy to influence, as they are looking for someone to tell them what to do. Even at that age, they want to fit in and be liked so they try to imitate people who seem to be popular and happy. Advertisement could take them the chance of really developing who they are. That state should not be used for advertising, selling products and ultimatly just making money.

All in all, I believe that children aged two to five are in a crucial stage of their own development which should not be sabotaged by advertisements or used to make money. Televison advertising should not influence these children in any way and should not be allowed to higher the chances of a good upbringing and development.
