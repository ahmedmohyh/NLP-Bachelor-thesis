In the following text we discus the topic: "Televison advertising directed toward young children between two and five years should not be allowed".
The first point against this statement is that young children can learn a lot if they watch a something about the world or about the nature but the problem here is that most of the children watch things which aren´t good for them.
 Another point against this statement is that don´t have any idea what they can do because  the perents of them don´t buy things with them they can play. Against this you can say that also can go out and with four or five years you have friends and you can do better things then watching TV. For example you can paly football or play catching other children.
The first point which agree with this statement is that it is not good for there young eyes to watch TV because maybe it can destroy there eyes and it is very bad if you need with young years glasses. 
Another point is that it is very important to have social contacts to other people maybe they can help you with a few things. For example they can help you to speak or to went.
In adittion you have to make your own experience and you can´t make your own experience if you sit on the coutch and whatch TV. Experience are very important for the future of young people and without them you have a harder live then others.

At last you can say that it isn`t good for young children to watch lots of TV but i don´t think that the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" is a good statement.
