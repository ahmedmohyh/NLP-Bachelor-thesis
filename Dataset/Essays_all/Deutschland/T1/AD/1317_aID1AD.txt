There is a tv in every normal family today. Because of this, everybody knows the problem that young children want to watch something on it but their parents don't agree. But is it right that children aren't allowed to watch something on tv? Is it a good idea to forbid this for children in the age of two to five?

First, we have to think of the great knowledge that these young children could get from watching interesting documetarys. Parents often think that everything what their children are watching on tv is bad. But thats not right because there are many good series for little children which prepare them for their life. Of course the parents must have a look for the tv when their children watching something. It is right that there is very much bullshit too. And it's important that little children don't watch some bad scenes because it could make them ill. An another important fact is that children shouldn't watch tv for too long time otherwise they don't want to play outside anymore or something else. But it's okay if the ý watch daily for one lesson and than their parents have time to relax. But today, there are too many young children in front of a tv everyday for a too long time. This is not even healthy anymore and they loose their connection to the real life. That's a big problem for many familys in our century because their childs life very unhealthy.

I think parents should allowe their childs to watch tv but it must be under control. The new televisions also have a timer that parents can chose how long their children are allowed to whatch.
