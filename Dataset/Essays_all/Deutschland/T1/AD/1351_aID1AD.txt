In the following i will write a essay about the statement:"Television advertising directed toward young children( aged two to five) should not be allowed."

It can be allowed because many advertising are good for there knowledge. But there can be adverstising which are not good for young children. Young children are watching Television in the morning when there are series for them. But if they are watching in the evening thats not good because there can be advertisings for old people. But very often the children watched television with there parents and if they are watching allone the most children passed the advertising away. It will be good for the young children when the advertising allowed. A lots of the advertising are funny and very interesting. The young children are going to bed very early. The advertising help them to learn the  language. So advertising can help them. 
Advertising can be ugly f.e. when they show what will be hapen if you are smoke zigarettes. They show it with some ugly pictures. The pictures are not good for young children because it can be scary for them.
Its good for the young children when the advertising should be allowed,because some advertising are for young children , they are funny and very interesting. The advertising are good to improve the language beacuse the children who are younger then five years they can not  speak good. They are definitly some advertising which are not good for young people but the most of them are in the evening.
