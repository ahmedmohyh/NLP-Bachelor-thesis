Should childern under 5 years watch television? For ansering this question I will name a few ponit´s for and against this these. 
Everybody know that nowadays nearly ervery child belongs to whatch television. But is it better for them to begin with exercising for learn reading? 
It´s very imtortant for children to go out and play games outside, especially in summer. It improofs the motoric of a child.
Lot´s of people say it´s not good for children in this age to watch television. But this meaning must spilt up in two sides. On the one hand, there are much programms on tv that children shouldn´t look, but there are also series like "Dora" and so on who improof, in this example, the english skills from a such young child by learnings things with a playing background. But even a child under 5 years shouldn´t watch the whole day stuff like that. It would be too much time spend on the television. 
But what is the anser now to the statemant, if children at the age of 2 up to 5 years should be allowed to watch television or not ? I not agree with this statement but neither disagree with it. In my opinion children shouldn´t spend their whole time at the tv, but there are some series whtich are good for a child so there must be a difference between watching tv, and watching tv with a usefull background. Watching tv could be forbidden, but watching tv with a usefull background is good for the child and should be allowed.
