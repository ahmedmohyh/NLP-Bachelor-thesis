Advertising for young children can be damaging to those because they tend to listen to their "stars" on the televison but on the other hand young children do not have the rights or money to buy those products in a shop or online.These children can easy be manipulated by the televsion, therefore they need an older person to buy it for them. Parents do want there children to be happy and might buy those products but they are very expensive and just for the moment since later on the children grows up and does not need it anymore. Parents should decide themselfs if a young children really needs these products or if they just want if because the "televison said it". If the advertising is inaprobiate or not desinged for the young crowd it should not be allowed anyway because they can heavily inflict the mental state of the children and manipulate them to do wrong things or buy illegal products.Good advertising is rare but effective since they can produces well desinged products which makes the children happy or maybe is good for their evolution by learing certend things by using the product. Also the parents should not left the children to long alone on the television because they might lag the skill to interact with other children later on which got attention from there parents and learned how to interact or make friends from them a bit by watching them or listen to them. Childrens need those social interactions to grow up normally and should not be damaged by any electronical media like advertising in their early years. Also it could make the children addictet to certend advertising or television. In the end i agree with this statement since the mental and social damage a Television advertising is to big and problematic for young children without their own mind since they get less attention from parents or other "real" person´s, do not interact with other children or get addicted to certend products.
