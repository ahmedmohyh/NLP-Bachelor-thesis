Today politics debate about tevevision advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed or not. So the main question we have to answer is, if this question will help and push the process of learning. In the following main part I´m going to discuss about that important question.

The main point of this debate include the question what is meant with television. We would say a programm which helps the progress of learning with the kids and parents combined. A process of learning not only about the parents and other non fictive persons but also with a virtuall help. In some steps of learning it might carry the process. On the other side you have the problem of the virtuall world. The children will have problems to combine both worlds. Also there is the problem of helthness. Television might increase illnes in futhure. 

All in all that´s the main problem of advertising televison dircected toward young children. They might learn easier and better but I don´t want to play with the future of my children when it´s not profe that it makes ill. In future when it might be profed it will be advertising, but in the moment I would say there we have the non profed responsibility of a better learning process and noone will take this opportunity.
