Should there be televisoin advertising directed to young children?

In my opinion, advertising shouldn't be made specially for children. There are many channels for kids, who use long advertisments to keep showing their program. Often the advertisment shows new toys, the children want immediately because they are so easy to influence and sometimes don't even know what the advertisments are. Besides, some advertisments are made for another group of people, for example teenagers or adults, so it has a bad influence on them. On the other hand, like I said before, a huge part of the channels that are available in this country need the advertisments to keep the channel running. They can't afford to show movies or TV shows without it. Yes, there are channels who don't really use advertisments, but usually they are not made for children this age (two to five years). It isn't possible to leave out advertisment from the channels, so parents should talk to their kids instead. Tell them what adertisment are, how they work, and that they are often made to bring someone to buy their product. That would also help the child to evolve a better sense for things they need, or better don't ask for. Another option is to not let the child watch TV, but that isn't really a solution, because from time to time it's possible that they do it anyway. I wouldn't stop showing advertisments to young children, but to choose the shown advertisments better. In addition I would reduce the time of the advertisment breaks, to lower the amount of advertisments directed to the children. Another possibility is to stop huge companies use the easy influence on kids to make them want something from the advertisments. Maybe there should even be a special  "Advertisment-Free" time on channels made for children young age.
