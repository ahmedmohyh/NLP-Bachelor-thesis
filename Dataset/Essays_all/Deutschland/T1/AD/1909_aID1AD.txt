In the following essay, I am going to write about whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
First of all, the children get used to seeing advertisements at a very young age since such advertising is allowed. This is introducing them to a society that is all about consuming things which are probably not even necessary. 
So what if these commercials are shown to innocent children, who are not able to think about the pros and cons of buying a certain product? The children are manipulated by advertisements.
But adults are too. Additionally, they are actually able to buy advertised things. So is advertising directed toward adults even worse? 
To sum it up, I would say that advertisements manipulate everyone but that is not necessarily a bad thing because it is a huge part of economy. and since the children's parents are the ones, who buy their kids the toys, they should be responsible for the advertisements, the child sees, as well. If the parents do not want their child to watch certain advertising they have to switch off the TV themselves. The law should not be blamed fo that.
