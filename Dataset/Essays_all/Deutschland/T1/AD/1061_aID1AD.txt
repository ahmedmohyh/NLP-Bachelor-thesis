Now i will count on some arguments for the statement.
Television should not be allowed for young children because they would see pictures they don't understand and which are not made for young childs. They shouldn't see that pictures, because they could be afraid of things they should not afraid of, like Zombies in a Horrormovie. Additionally they need the time to play outside and experiance the world and they can't do that because the TV is always more interrestic for young children, it' normal. Furthermore young children could start of having an unreal view of the world because they just see the suggerested pictures in the television and don't try to find it out themself. So in this important time for a child to grow up and learn things they should do it without TV, because it's an lonely live with just watching TV and they need the social links.
Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV. They just need to switch it on and they are in a new world where they can see what they want and expriance what they want. The television is part of our future, so why don't tell them early how to use it? The televison additionally could make friends or link familys, because it connects people. If they watch a funny quiz or if the watch a dramatic dokumentation, they do something together and that's the point.
In my view young children aged two to five should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents. For example once a week an doumentation which is specially made for young children is good to learn something and learn what the TV is. Anything more than this makes the points I wrote about the bad things on TV come true.
