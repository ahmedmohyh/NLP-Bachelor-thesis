The debate of advertising directed toward young children is a debate, which people talk about now and which is important for the future and the new generation.
Making adverts for young children can be seen as a smart idea because in this young ages, the children always try to convince their parents to buy them the things they see, for example in supermarkets. If they see a toy in the advert and then in the supermarket, they will ask their parents so that they buy it for them.
My second point is that adverts might stay in the children's mind and when they grow up and see products from the same name they might think of the past and connect the product with good emotions. This is securing the future group for buying their products.
But at the other hand, young children don't understand complicated advert, they only see the product and when they don't understand the product right, they might use it wrong and not what the people, who made it, want it to be used.
Another point is that young children don't buy themselves products and if the parents don't buy it for them, the advert will only be in television and not sold good in the markets.
To connect to my argument before, i close this argumentation with my last point. 
For many parents it is usual to let their children watch television, but they are parents who question this adverts and products, they might manipulate the children to make them to buy other products from them in the future.It is an education question to forbid televison for young children because only the parents decide what their children do in this age. The question of advertising directed to young children is another but is indicated in the education.

Personally, i agree with the statement because i think of bad manipulation when i think of adverts, internet and other things. People shouldn't focus on advertising their products good to children, instead they should think of educate young generations right to manage a friendly world again.
