For the statement "Television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.",which is in my opinion an important one to discuss, can be found arguments for and against. 
One argument against this statement is, that the children can learn from the television while watching, because they see what to do. It ist a type of leraning. They see something and they can copy it and try it on theire own. 
But children are also able to learn without televison, but from theire parents and other people.
Maybe children in the age of two or three are not able to understand what goes on on television, so you do not need it. 
Another argument for this statement could be, that children get used to early to it and maybe later always use it. 

I more agree then disagree with this statement. Of course you can say television advertising is a part of our society but I think it is not right in the age of two to five, because in my opinion it is not right that they could get used to it so early. Learning from real people the children have arround them they is in my view much better then from televison. It is easier if the parents help the children to learn new things, because they actually now how the children is reacting.
