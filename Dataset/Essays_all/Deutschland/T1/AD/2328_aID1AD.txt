I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Its not okay for the young children that they are directed by television advetising because its not good for their eyes, head, heart and body. Its better when they are doing anything else for their age and would conzentrait on thing for their age. In this age the children want more and more television advertising and you should not be allowed this. Probably then they will live ther life like they see in the television advertising and that doesnt work. 
When you allowed that television advertising directed toward young children they will porbably learn something for their life and would see what they should not do in their life. They will probably know how they can help anyone when the person needs help.
