Television advertising directed toward young children of course is a good way to advertise because young children can be manipulated easily with good ads but on the other hand is abusing this weakness to make a good amount of money due to the parents buying their children those advertised items because they love them. Basicly those advertisments abuse the children and their parents because the children are made to want the advertised stuff and the parents buy it for them. On the other hand these advertisments of couse help the companies behind the ads because they will make very much money out of it. Parents should also try to teach their children that they can't get anything they see on the television just because it is advertised.
I personally would disagree with the statement that advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed if it is appropiate advertisment. If the children are not forced by the ads to buy the advertised item I would totally accept that these ads would be shown in television. On the other hand if the ads would force the children to buy those items because they are presented as an item that the children must have when they actually don't really need it, I would agree with the given statement because the advertisment is just abusing the weakness of easily being manipulated that children have.
If I had to decide if I agree or disagree with the statement in general I would definitly agree with the statement since even though there might be appropiate advertisment there is still more bad advertisment that forces children to buy the advertised item. Of course ads should be make the viewer want the item that is being advertised but if the viewer is too young to decide what he really wants to buy they shouldn't be manipulated by these ads. In the age of two to five years  they can't decide what they want to buy on their own and so there shouldn't be ads directed to them.
