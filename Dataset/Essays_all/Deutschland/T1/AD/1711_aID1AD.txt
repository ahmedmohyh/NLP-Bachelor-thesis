Many parents who are out of their nervs or are just busy let their young children sitting in front of the television. They are watching series for children and they can learn from the characters which are shown there. With series for kids they can early learn how to count numbers or they learn to write a word. But out of this is television really good for them? Maybe they find out how to change the programm and then they are watching a movie or a serie which are not allowed for their age. Also they can be influence by different spots on the television. Maybe there is a spot for a new candy or something like that so the children want to have it. They want the candy so much that they are get on the nervs of their parents. They buy them the candy because they does not hear that anymore and the child is happy. But then when the child watch another spot maybe for a teddy bear the want to have the bear. Maybe the parents are buying the bear too but in time they are realize that the child wants more and more. Not every  child is like in the example but it can happen.

Finally I think that children from the age two to five should not be allowed to watch television. At this age it is easy to influence their mind because they believe what is saying in the television. On the other hand I think that when the parents have a reason to let their kids watching television and they are watching over their children so they can not change the program or something like that it is their own decision to let their children watching child series on the television.
