In the following essay, I am going to discuss the question wheter television advertising direct toward young children ( aged two to five ) should be allowed or not.

To begin with, there are a few arguments against this kind of television. In general, the children are influenced by the media in a very young age. Nowadays, they are a lot younger than they were for example ten years ago. By forbitting a television advertising these young children one may be able to stop this development, or even trend.

Another argument for young children against watching television is the fact that they then do not spend a lot of time outside. In that young age it is important to experience things by themselfes and not only seeing them on television.

On one hand, there are all these negativ aspects about television for young children, on the other hand, there are also a few arguments for allowing it. First of all, the parents can control the time that their children spend in front of the television. Watching it once a week for a short time means a huge difference  compared to watching it every day for a few hours.

Secondly, some  TV shows for children can actually help them to learn new things without them even noticing it, for exemple a foreign language. In Germany, there excist a few TV shows that explain English vocabulary and grammar by telliing exciting adventures to the kids. 

To sum up my opinion, I find the argument that the parents should control the time their children spend watching television the most convincing, because the children in that young age (two to five) shoud not be influenced by the media all the time. In my opinion, you can not replace talking to your child, or ging outside with them by letting them sit in front of the TV all day. If they just watch it once in a while, they can actually learn a few things. Therefore I thing that television advertising direct toward young children should be allowed.
