Television advertising especially directed to young children is a very complicated topic. First of all I would say it depends on the intention of the advertising. The intention of advertising can be very different in many ways. Some commercials are worked out to show the people, in this case children from two to five, the real quality of the product and just want to give you some ideas to buying stuff you could need. Beside that there are many Commercials which are trying to manipulate you and have the intention to sell a cheap product for a high price. This can be dangerous if children are involved. Children in the aged of two to five cant think about that like grown up can. They watch the commercial and want to buy it. They can't decide whether the money for the product is woth or not. After that the parents of the kids have to tell them that this is maybe just a typical plastic product which is not worth to buy. And argument for the advertising directed to young children is that they learn how to figure out what they find interesting and which things are shown in the wrong light and are not worth buying them. For them who will not think about that at this age it can be still dangerous because they will not detec whether someone tries to steal your money by selling you a shitty product which is not like they thought it would be. Over all I can say that commercials directed to young children can sometimes be really nasty and it should be controlled that the commercials are free to watch for kids and dont try to manipulate their brains. If the concers advertising their product correctly and just show the young viewers neutral the product to give an idea of buying it I personally would say that it's okay. It just depends on how the commercial is made.
