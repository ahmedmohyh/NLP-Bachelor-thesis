Television advertising is a very common topic in daily life. Many people ask themselves if advertising directed to young children is a good thing.
The difficulty in advertisements for children is with the parents because they always need to reject the wishes of their children as they cannot buy everything for them even if they wanted to. In general, kids are very believing and as advertising is always at least a little bit manipulating, so that they could have problems with dealing with lies in future life. For example, playmobil advertising always shows the figures moving on themselves but in reality they are very static. Even by this little movements, children might be confused about the unmobility of the figures when they see them. It's difficult to find an example for advertising towards children because almost everything they show does not really work like it is shown or does not even exist.
Nevertheless, television advertisments have also positive aspects for young children. It could also be that they learn to handle with rejections and understand in early age, they cannot get everything they want. Also the television advertising will always be present for them even if they are older, so advertising kind of prepares them for the adult life. If children get confronted with problems very early, they have more time to learn from them.
In my opinion, there is no need to forbid television advertising directed towards young children. If there was not such a great amount of advertisements for adults too, I would have thought about it again, but as children have to deal with advertising until their death, they should also learn to deal with it in younger ages. To me, the lies in advertising are not a problem for children too because I think it is important to not limit their imagination and to support it. Fantasy is only present for children and we should let them believe in it, as it is also part of growing to point out the truth.
