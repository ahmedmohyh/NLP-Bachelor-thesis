Television advertising for children is a very controversial topic. In the following, I'm going to comment on the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".

Whilst some people might say that companies need to advertise their products to make more revenue, it really shouldn't be allowed to advertise products for young children. This has a few reasons, which I'm now going to elaborate. First of all, childs don't have as much experience as older people. For example, children could think that if the boy in the chocolate advertisement does have perfectly white teeth, chocolate wouldn't harm their teeth either. This could lead to serious problems, because the child may eat more chocolate than appropriate. Second of all, small children are much more easily influencable than older children. It is the same reason, why children aren't allowed to vote if they're under 18 or in some cases 16. Children don't know what's good for them and what not and advertising can give them a false idea of sweets, for example. While parents could tell them, that it isn't healthy to eat sweets every day, advertising might tell them things like this, so the company can sell their product more often. These are just few examples of cases, where television advertising would have a negative impact on children of that age.

Concluding, it should be forbidden to advertise for young children.
