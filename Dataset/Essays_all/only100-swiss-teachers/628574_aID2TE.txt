There are different types of teaahers. There is the kind one who does not want to do harm to his students and all pupils love to go to his lessons, eventhough it's always loud and nobody exactly understands what they haave to do. The other one who is unfair, streng and nobody really enjoys his classes. But here everybody understands what they are getting teached.
Is it therefore more important to have a gentle teacher than to have one who really understand whtat he is teaching?

First of all you can say, that if the teacher relates well with his students the motivation to learn increases. Simply because they like to go to school and want to learn. 
It is also easier for them to learn when the teacher is kind and jokes are allowed to make. This increases the fun, which will make them more motivated and curious about the subject.
On the other hand, there is the argument that you can have the nicest person teaching a subject but if (s)he does not understand what (s)he is teaching, then there is no chance that the pupils understand the subject. This will have a bad influence on their knowledge in case they want to go to university. 

In my oppinion it is more important to have a teacher who teaches excellent knowledge than to have a kind teacher. Beacause I want to be prepared for university and not joking around and then getting lost at university. I would rather choose the knowledge eventhough this would mean I really have to motivate me more than with a nice teacher.
