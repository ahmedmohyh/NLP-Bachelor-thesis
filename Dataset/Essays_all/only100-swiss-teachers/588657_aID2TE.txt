I neither agree nor disagree with the statement. A good mix between the two is the best thing. In the time of Nazi Germany for example, the Teachers weren`t relating to the students at all. This caused really harsh schools were the pupils weren`t even allowed to eat peanuts. The opposite is what those feminist cunts want to do in America, where there should be one "Safe Space" per pupil and the teachers aren`t allowed to use "his" or "her". This level of trying to relate to pupils leads to a very shallow delivery of information to them. So the teachers should be able to relate enough so that they can understand the problems the children could have. If one student wants to eat a creamy cheese sandwich in class, he maybe shouldn`t be allowed to eat it, but he shouldn`t be humiliated like jesus on the cross.
Also, excellent knowledge isn`t needed. It is enough if the teacher can bring across what the subject is about and explain the topics that are discussed(That of course is dependant on the level of school, but I`m thinking about elementary right now). In University, the teacher needs to have excellent knowledge of the subject and doesn`t have to be able to relate to the students, because honestly, if you can`t solve your own problems at University, you are at the wrong place.
