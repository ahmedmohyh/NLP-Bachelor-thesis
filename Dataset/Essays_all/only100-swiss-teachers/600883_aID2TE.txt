What makes a good teacher?
A teacher should not only have knowledge of the subject they teach but also be able to relate to the students. Which is more important?
The goal of every teacher should be to pass on as much knowledge to their students as possible. A teacher may be very knowledgable but lack the skills necessary to pass on that knowledge to the students, in which case the they may end up learning little to nothing.
If a teacher can relate well with students, it will have the effect that they enjoy coming to their lessons and are more motivated to participate in class. 
Students will have more respect for a teacher who notiably has a lot of expertise in their subject. However it may be more important for a teacher to be very enthusiastic about the subject they teach to show the students what is fascinating about that subject. 
Students need to be able to communicate well with their teachers to get their needs met. If students are to afraid to ask questions or inform the teacher when things are going to quickly, they will likely not learn very much. 

In conclusion I'd say that both is absolutely necessary. If I'f have to chose, I'd say the ability to relate is more important. It is more the way in which knowlege is passed on to the students that determines whether they really learn things that will stick with them or not.
