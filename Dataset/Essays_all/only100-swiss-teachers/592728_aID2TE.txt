What I first need to say and what is verry important: Without any knowlegde you can't become a teacher. It maybey sounds simple but it is absoulutely true that 
if you don't have the knowlege that you should be teaching you can't be or become a teacher. The relation between a teacher and his or her students follows this fact and is as well very important. You can have as much knowledge or be full of learned things, but if you don't have the ability to teach, help peolpe to understand things and if you can't relate good with your audition or with the public, you won't be able to teach. Well, maybey "relate" is the wrong word. It is not to important to relate with students perfectly or teach things clear. Everyone, even if the teacher has no charisma and any ability to relate with the audience, will understand something and will learn what he or her thinks is important about the lesson beeing told. I assure you that with a good teacher who understands you as a person with a lower knowledge and knows your problems, learning will be so much more easy than if he/her only knows things but can't express them to you. But, it is not necceceraly to be thaught a lesson like this. As I sad you will always learn something and you mostly will understand a part of the lesson, even if your teacher is bad and has this ability of relating with you not.
So as the final answer to the statement mentioned I want to say that the knowledge of a teacher is the base of the school but if he has the ability to relate with his studenz
