Is it more important that the teachers have a excellent knowledge of the subject being taught or that they have the ability to relate well with the students?
If the students like their teacher they have more motivation in the lessons. If they have more motivation they learn better. If they learn better they have better marks in the tests and if they have better marks in the tests they have more fun. Its more important that the teacher have the ability to relate well with their students. 
If the teacher have the ability to relate well with the students, they like him. They have the feeling he understands them and they feel save. Then they feel better and have more motivation. They take part in the lesson and so the learn more. If the teacher have just a excellent knowledgement that can`t work. The students maybe don`t like him and then they have no motivation. Therefore they also don`t take part in the lessons and the teacher doesn`t have their attention. Then they learn nothing from his excellent knowledgement.
But of course it`s not good if a student asks a question and the teacher can`t answer him. Of course the teachers need some knowledge about their subject. 
If the students learn more because they are motivated they write also better exams. The problem is just if the teacher don`t have a good knowledge about the subject being taught he maybe couldn`t explain the students the difficult things they have to know. A teacher with more knowledgement could do this better. 
Very important is too that the students have fun because then they have positives emotions and learn also better. 
So I think it`s better to have a teacher wich have the ability to relate with their students.
