ability to relate better than knowledge?

First of a teacher who's standing in front of the class and not understanding what he's talking about is bad. When a student doesn't understand a topic and the teacher is just sitting there and being nice in won't help the student. Without knowing how to explain a topic a teacher is useless. It's the same as when students were having lessons without a teacher just doing all by theirselfes. They won't reach anything. A teacher should be able to make students understand what's going on in his subject. If not there will be some nice and polite persons who are talking but something and no one is getting it. If so some years later there will be some adults doing their jobs without knowing what they're doing.

On the other hand you have teachers who know everything of their subject. Unfriendly, non-socializing teachers. No, robots! Emotionless robots reading their stuff and not even carrying about the students. There's only a machine saying the students what to do and how. No humanity. Just a cold and grey machine. "I'm scared of the exam." "I don't care. Just learn it." No empathy. That leads to frustration and alienates. There is no one left who cares about the students, no one who tells them that they can do it. Moreover that leads to a sad and frustrational school time. There is no fun anymore! No hope!

All in all both extremes are awfull. In my opinion both shoud be weighted the same.
