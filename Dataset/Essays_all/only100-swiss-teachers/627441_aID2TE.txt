The ability to relate well with students is quite important, but is it more important than excellent knowledge?
Of course a good connection to the students is important. If a teacher can relate with the students and awake their interrests, they probably like a subject more and could remember it better.
But the knowledge of the teacher is as important. Most of the schools are depending on the basics learnt at the school before. If a teacher tells wrong subjects, students have to learn it a second time and probably mix them together. The students couldn't be sure in which teacher they should belive.
A teacher should be able to explain even difficult things in an easy way, that everyone could understand. A good relation helps that the students listen but if the teacher can't explain something because of missing knowledgeit is difficult for the students. Also for good students it could get enoying.
I think it depends on which level someone is teaching. By teaching at primary school the relation has a bigger importance than at the gymnasium. But even if the stuff is easier the teacher has to know what he is talking about.
Finaly at our level the students have to bring their interest with them and profite more from a teacher with excellent knowledge. Like in many other subjects I think to find the middle between both is the best.
