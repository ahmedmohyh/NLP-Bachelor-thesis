I agree with this statement because being able to relate with pupils is more helpful for the effect of learning than teaching very profound on a specific subject. In the schooltime pupils have to deal with many different teachers. It isn't alwayseasy to deal with so many teachers, so the ability to cooperate with each other is very important. If a teacher hasn't got this ability, there can be a certain distance between students and teachers. This causes students to feel not understood and affects their school perfomance. But the realtion between a student and a teacher isn't only affected by the teacher. Students have to be open too and should try to get on with the teachers they have. Today it is often seen that students and their parents blame the teacher because of bad results. This makes the job very stressful and not always easy. To get good results not only a good teacher is needed, sure it is helpful, but a big part of getting good results has to be done by the student. Many parents don't see this point and go after the teacher of their children. Sometimes real witch-hunt is being made by angry parents. Fifty years ago something like that would'nt have been possible. Back then parents always were on the side of the teacher and blamed theirkids for the bad results.
