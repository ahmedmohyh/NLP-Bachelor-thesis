The teacher needs to have a certain knowledge of the subject he is teaching otherwise the students can't learn anything. Because when a student has a question and the teacher can't answer it how is the student supposed to learn. Knowledge is an important part of education. If our teachers would relate with us, we would get along very well and instead of learning we would be having fun with the teacher rather than learn what we need to learn of the subject. So, if the necessairy knowledge isn't available for us, how are we supposed to learn. Sure, it helps when a teacher understands us and can be insightful, but it is not more important than the knowledge that is aquired to teach. For example, if an english teacher would relate well with students and they would ask him to dismiss their homework because they already have so much going on, he will do it. And if this happens multiple times the students aren't going to learn about the subject as much as they could have if they had done their homework. That is why I disagree with the statement that a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
