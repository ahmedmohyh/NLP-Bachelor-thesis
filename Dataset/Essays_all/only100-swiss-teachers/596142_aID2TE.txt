Every student wants a good teacher. But what qualities define a good teacher? Some might think it is simply about their level of knowledge,some like teachers with social skills. Over the recent years new conclusions about good teaching were being drawn, and the opinions still vary a lot today. 

First of all, I do strongly believe that teachers should have a good relationship to their students. If there is no connection whatsoever, the students might not be learning as efficiently. If students don't feel understood or taken seriously, it might often end in a rebellion. It is known that students do learn better when they have a good relation to their teachers. 

However, if the teacher has the ability to relate well with students but not the knowledge of the subject and how it should be taught, the students might get unmotivated, leading to a frustrating situation for both. Students do want to learn something, and a teacher not able to transmit it to them will have to face a situation where both students and teacher don't get along. 

In conclusion, I think teachers should posess both skills, intellecutally and socially. The key to a good climate during class is a feeling of connection between student and teacher but also his ability to transmit his knowledge. By covering both of them, students will not only improve their level of knowledge, but tey will also actually like going to school which are the basic conditions to success.
