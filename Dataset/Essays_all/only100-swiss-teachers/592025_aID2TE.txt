Well, on the one hand it is really important that a teacher has the ability to relate well with students because for every student's the school like the second home. Imagine, we are there, five days a week and we are there for instance eight hours a day. That's a high number of hours we are spending there. To know that you haven't got a well relation with your teacher can destroy your learning abilitys. If a teacher is able to relate well with students it would be the best thing. Every teacher is a type of an idol for a student and just knowing that your teacher want to relate well with you it's a massive argument against the knowledge of the subject being taught. On the other hand students are going to school for learning new things and for improving as well. And not for having a good time with a teacher just because he has the ability to relate well with students. Most of the students don't mind if the teacher don't relate well with them because they are going to school because they would like to learn something. And they wanna learn efficient and truely things. Therefore it's important to have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught. 
To be honest, I can't say wether I agree or disagree  because for me there should be an equality. Both arguments are on the same level of value because it is extremely important that a teacher relates well with students but an excellent knowledge of the subjects is really important as well. It is still a school and a school is here for learning and improving. So a good knowledge is a advantage.
