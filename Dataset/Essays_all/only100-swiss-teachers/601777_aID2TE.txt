Yes I totally agree with this statement, because also me as a student sees differences between the teachers who have this ability to relate with us and the teachers who aren't able to explain something. For example: Our physics teacher has an excellent knowledge of his subject and he really knows everything about physics. But the problem is, that he isn't able to give his knowledge and interest to us. We never understand what he explains and he doesn't understand why we don't know anything about what he teaches us. That's also why the most of the students in our class need to go to extra physics lesson to repeat everything from school.

I think it's important that everyone who wants to become a teacher also gets a special education how to teach children or young adults. A teacher is only a good teacher when he knows how to teach and give his knowledge to the students. Otherwise you can also become a scientist where you don't have to give your knowledge and interest to other persons. Another example is our German teacher who is really the oposite od our physics theacher: He really knows the best excercises to learn us everything we need to know. His lessons are always very interesting and after every lesson, you have the feeling that you've just learned something new. He has the very important ability to relate with his students and to give them the best knowledge about the subject.
