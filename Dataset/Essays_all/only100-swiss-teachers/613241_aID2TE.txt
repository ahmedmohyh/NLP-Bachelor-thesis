Is a intelligent teacher or a "friend teacher" better? Many students and teachers are asking him self this question. But it's controvers.

An argument for a teacher with the ability to relate well with students is, that the students have more interestings and joy to visit the class, because the teacher can motivate them and explain them things in an other way. Also they have a more personal relate to the teacher, which makes, that the students have more interests of coming in class because they want to communicate with the teacher. They are more open for his lessons.
But it could also be, that the students would not have enough respect infront of the teacher and then thinking, they have nothing to do for school, or just do anything in class but not school stuff.

An argument for excellent knowledge of the subject is, that the teacher really knows what he's talking about. He could explain the thing they learn in many ways. He can make bridges to other themes, which make the subject more interesting for the students. He could animate the students with the interesting things of the subject.
But if the teacher is too much in love with his subject and thinks, that's the most important thing in the world, he could scare the students who don't like the subject. Also if the teacher doesn't interest for the students, they have no motivation to interact with him and then they won't interact with the subject and in the class.

I think it's important, that a teacher knows a lot about his subject, but it's more important that he's fully interested in his subject. Because if he's totally interested he can motivate his students with his positiv and joyfull thinking about the thing, he's learning them. But for that he also has to have a good relation to the students. Because if he doesn't, the students are not getting motivated. They can't share his emotion, because they have no "personal" connection to him and his subject.
