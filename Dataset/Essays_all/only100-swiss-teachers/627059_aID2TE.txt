I disagree cause it's very important for the students to have a teacher who knows what he is talking about, for what is a teacher good when he is a good friend to you but can't teach you anything. For this you can go to the psychatrie. You need a teacher to get more knowledge that you can later us when you start working. For what is a teacher who doesn't know something and jus talk about the weather with you. That would be wasted time and after a view weeks you would be so bored and start becoming retarded and all the other classes will slow and steady get cleverer than you.
But a teacher have to be your friend in a way and also needs to be a human but he also have to teach you something. I personally like teacher which are not teaching so much but when im realy honest I need a teacher that bring me something and help me suceed in my life with the learned knowledge. For example when you would be Roger Federer and someone who doesn't know anything about tennis comes to you and tries to teach you. You wouldn't realy listen to him or would you? I don't think so. Because you want to get better and better and for that you need someone who knows something.
