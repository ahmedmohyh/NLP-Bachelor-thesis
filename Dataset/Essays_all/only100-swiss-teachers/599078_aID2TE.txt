Today it is pretty hard to find good teachers because either they know a lot and can't really connect with their students, or they have a good bond with their students but not an excellent knowledge. 

On one hand I guess it is pretty important, that a teacher has an excellent knowledge of what he wants to teach. Students come to school to learn something and get better. If a teacher doesn't know a lot about his subject it is impossible for students to learn new things. If they have questions their teacher maybe isn't able to answer because he doesn't even understand what they're talking about. In this case it is easier for the students not to ask anymore and if they don't ask, they won't understand the subject to it's fullest.

On the other hand it is quite important that a teacher can relate with his or her students. If students can't connect with their teachers, they maybe start disliking the subject and won't learn anything for their examinations, which will probably lead to bad marks. Bad marks usually lead to disappointment and I think a disappointed student will learn less for this subject than he or she did before or even say he is ill, and miss during these lessons.

In my opinion it is important that a teacher has the ability to relate well with students and has an excellent knowledge of the subject he or she is teaching. If they have a lack of one of these abilities, their students won't learn as efficient as if they had a teacher who could do both. But I guess at some point it is pretty difficult to find a teacher like this. The best way to choose probably is to find a teacher who hasn't got the best knowledge of all but can still relate with his or her students.
