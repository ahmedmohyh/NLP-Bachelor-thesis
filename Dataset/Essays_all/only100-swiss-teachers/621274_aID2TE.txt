Is a teacher's ability to create a good relation to his students more important than his specific knowledge ot the subject? In this little essay I would like to analize this question and look for an anwer.

If a teacher has a huge knowledge about his subject the students are able to learn a lot for their future. But an excellent knowledge could also cause negative effects for exemple if their is too much information the students do not have an overwiev about all the paper and books. Especially weeker students can not get all the information.

A teacher's ability to relate well with the students is really important because the students like to go into classes and learn new interesting things about a subject. But if the teacher has a too closed relation to his students it could be difficult. They discuss about other things instead of the subject and the students get bad marks because they did not learn anything.

In my opinion a teacher should have both abilities. The knowledge is really important but he should also find a way to get all the informations to the students. A teacher can inspire his students by creating intersting lesson and having organized school materials. He should also be friendly, answer the questions of his students and like his job. As a conclusion knowledge and also a character and behavior are essential to be a good teacher.
