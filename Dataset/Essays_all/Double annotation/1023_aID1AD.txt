The statement is about ''television advertising toward young children'' and is a very complex topic with a lot of pros and cons. I will start off with the pros, come to the cons after that and give my opion at the end.
At first children, especially at a very young age, are very easy to influence. That is why parents always should pay attention about what they are watching. They could get bad dreams about scary things they watch or develop a fear all of the sudden. 
As they can be influenced so easily, they also might want to have every new toy they see on TV and rather look at these new things on the TV, than go out and play with the toys they already own.
Now I will talk abbout the pros of this statement: When the children see for example the toys, that they want to have, on TV, it is easier to buy them because their parents do not have to take them to the store. If the child would come with them, they would probably find other toys and would want to buy them all. Another reasons is that they would not even unterstand everything, so it is not important if they watch it or do not.

In my opion it is very important that children are protected from adversiting, because they are so easy to influence and probably believe the things that are said, even though they are not true. I think that the channels should not be too influenced by that and that the always have to keep an eye on their children to prevent them from seeing something bad.
