0,"The children have to learn, that not everinthing is like it looks in the advert.",0
1,"The companies actually manipulate the children because especially the younger ones, aged two to five, can't decide whether it is something they really need or if it was simply shown in an advertisement.",0
2,"Even though they might get the product, advertising is not all about reality and the child might get disappointed.",0
3,The children really want to have the product and might annoy their parents until they buy it.,0
4,"On the other hand children are learning very much in this part of life, so the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products.",0
5,One reason for this is that young children don't have the experience to see if a product of their favour is useful or useless for them.,0
6,If those young children see advertising for the necessary or the right stuff it might be usefull that they watch this advertising.,0
7,"First off all it seems to manipulate the young children, because the things named in the advertisings are used to atract these young children.This works because they donÂ´t even think about the price and if they really need these things.",0
8,"For sure, children are manipulated by exciting advertisements and are used to make their parents buy these products, but if parents are upset with that, they shouldn't allow their child to be manipulated.",0
9,One stong arguement againt advertising towards young children is that they don't realise this manipulation.,0
10,All in all I would say that I donÂ´t agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because I think that there is nothing to worry about if  little children come in contact with television advertisements.,1
11,"I agree with the following statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",1
12,"There are different oppinions to the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two or five)should not be allowed.""",1
13,"On the one hand, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it's unhealthy for them to whatch television too often since that could cause that they don't move enough.",1
14,"So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should not be allowed, because in this age children started making their first social contacts, which is very impotant for their growing up.",1
15,"Therefore, I completely agree with the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"", because forbidding this kind of advertising could reduce many problems in families.",1
16,"So I think that television advertising toward young children should be not allowed, because they are too young and can be manipulate.",1
17,"A argument on the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",1
18,I'm agree with the following statement that television advertising directed toward young children in the age between two to five should not be allowed.,1
19,"In the following I tell you my oppinion of the question, if Television advertising directed toward young children between two to five years shuold not be allowed.",1
20,An other negative point is that the childrens aren't abled to judge things regarding their quality or the need of it.,2
21,"There are some good points, but also many bad ones for the children.",2
22,"Children will know, that they can't have everything they want and that not everything is like it is in TV.",2
23,The most important one is that the kids can be manipulated into buying things they see.,2
24,"But as always there are some disadvantages and some advantages, for the children, their parents and those buisneses.",2
25,"So, firstly the positive thing is that the children can learn something about the world very early and they do not need to talk to their parents or read a book but thats really sad, for me.",2
26,Forthermore the childrens often dont need the object.,2
27,The only problem which occures is that if the parents don't theach their children they might get too much manipulated and materialistic.,2
28,One reason for this is that young children don't have the experience to see if a product of their favour is useful or useless for them.,2
29,It is the best way to prepare kids for the future.,2
30,Television or any other media stuff is a big factor and influence in our world for all people.,3
31,Television is in our time an important source for news for adults or teenagers.,3
32,This could  be the reason why we create televion advertising.,3
33,The children would grow up with wrong information before they could understand the truth of the television and its consequences on their.,3
34,My last reason is that children at the age of two to five are defintiv to young to look tv because of the risks and the consequences of this media to themselves.,3
35,So that Television is an important source for young children for preparing their future life.,3
36,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,3
37,Especially young children are getting easily influenced by television.,3
38,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,3
39,Television is today more impportant than in the past.,3
40,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",4
41,"However the television can be nessecary, because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep.",4
42,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,4
43,Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.,4
44,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,4
45,Many children spend too much time on watching TV.,4
46,My second reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours after hours tv and so they would  not focus on there future work lives.,4
47,"Young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but itÂ´s not the right way, I think.",4
48,First of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us.,4
49,"All in one I think it`s okay, that children watch tv in a small part of time, if they don`t forget to do important things for school and playing outside with their friends.",4
50,Not too much advertising!,5
51,The children get irritated and don't know how to react.,6
52,"On the other hand, if the parents take care of them and pay attention, the children will not get any problems, but they will have fun with their new toy or other things.",6
53,But if the parents stay cool and maybe ignore the children while they are crying they will soon stop doing it.,6
54,"That is a problem because parents do not want unhappy childreen and then they have to say to their child, he would not get the toy.",6
55,"And if they parents don't look up details about that item and just trust their child because it makes it happy, the child might end up with a broken toy, which will make them even more sad.",6
56,"If the kids throw a tantrum, they'll get over it sooner or later.",6
57,"Often, the parent would give in on their child, which is not going to give up on that toy.",6
58,"Children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product.",6
59,Children are easy to manipulate and if they want something really bad they often get it because their parents can not stand their cute child.,6
60,"If they don't get the object, they start to cry or they are sad about the desission of their parents.",6
61,But there are also some reasons for advertisements towars young children.,7
62,I think children maybe donÂ´t want advertising that is directed toward them.,7
63,"On one hand itÂ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children, because the children in the age of two to five canÂ´t say anything about there own opinion, because they are to young to say it.",7
64,Advertising addressed to young children can create both a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing one's life.,7
65,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",7
66,"So all in all I would say, advertisements for young children are a good thing to get them learn to hear a 'no' and to let their skills grow.",7
67,"Advertisement for children does not have to be a bad thing, it can be used to influence them so that their behaviour will have a positive effekt on society and nature.",7
68,"I can understand that companies direct their advertising towards young children, because in that age, children can be manipulated very easily, and while adults and other children are better able to decide wether they actually need the advertised product, they only care about the great video and not about what the product actually is.",7
69,On the one hand young children have to learn how to deal with advertising.,7
70,"On the one side it should be allowed to show such as these advertisments, because the children are more informed, what is in trend and can compare with other children.",7
71,In addition to that I can say that advertisements are rarely showing the truth.,8
72,But advertisement also creates a wrong image of reality.,8
73,As a consequence they need to agree with the advertising or at least to believe it is true.,8
74,"The ads are making everything more colorful and brighter, and they do not necessarily show reality.",8
75,"On the other side, advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television.",8
76,As an adolscent you know how to deal with adverts and that their content isn't always the truth.,8
77,"The things shown in the commercials aren't reality, but it is the reality that commercials are out there in real life.",8
78,I would understand if someone says that there is no differance between advertation and manipulation.,8
79,Another point ist that there is not just advertisment on television but also in the shops or by games on smartphones.,8
80,But the opposite of that argument is also an argument fot these ads if you see it from the perspective of the companies who then gain money.,8
81,All in all I donÂ´t really agree or disagree with the statement.,9
82,In my opionion there are two sides to this statement.,9
83,In my opinion i agree with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples.,9
84,"But on the other hand, there are some reasons why I disagree with this statement.",9
85,Finally I agree with the statement.,9
86,All together i would agree with this statement.,9
87,For this reason I disagree with the statement.,9
88,"So all in all, I agree at some parts with the statement, but not at all.",9
89,In the following I will discuss this statement.,9
90,But in my opinion I have to say that I do agree with the statement above.,9
91,"So if they watch TV, an advertisement could easily make them want to have the product shown in the advert.",10
92,"
Advertises are often shown in the TV.",10
93,Nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches TV.,10
94,Television advertisement is nowadays used to get the consumer's attention and to attract them to buy a company's products.,10
95,"On the other side, advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television.",10
96,Television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society.,10
97,"Every time we turn on the television we can watch a lot of interesting films, but also a lot of advertisments.",10
98,Television advertising has a big role in modern society.,10
99,The people making this advertising will try to guess what kind of people will watch their content so they catch the right crowd which probably buys this kind of things.,10
100,Children watching these advertisements are often influenced by the product's appearance in the media.,10
101,In this case parents have no choice and will buy the thing the children want to have.,11
102,It is important to mention that children do have a say in what their parents buy them.,11
103,At the most time the products are very expensive and the parents do not want it to buy for the children.,11
104,"This way, they can also learn from it and maybe develop a sense for what's good and what's not, so they can better decide what to buy for themselves when they're older.",11
105,and if the parents are smart they will tell them that they do not need it so the parents will not buy it.,11
106,"If they decide not to buy something, their kid will just forget about it after a while (we've all been there) and everything's just fine.",11
107,"The Children might even get unhappy because their parents can not afford what they want, and the Children don't understand why their parents don't buy them what they want because they don't understand the use of money.",11
108,But one the other hand the parents still have to decide what they are going to buy and even if they are letting them watch television.,11
109,Additionaly only the parents know what they can afford and the Children don't think about the price of something they just want it or not.,11
110,"And if the parents have a lot of money and don't care about what they buy in the first place, why not show these children some cool toys on TV to make them happy?",11
111,"Furthermore, the parents have to have an eye on their children if they watch TV.",12
112,"Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.",12
113,If parents don't watch over them they don't stop watching the TV.,12
114,The parents have to keep an eye on their children to protect them against too much television advertising and television consume.,12
115,The parents should care about the time their child is sitting in front of a TV and if the child is watching something that is meant to be for his age.,12
116,"I think that the parents should make a rule that says how long their children are allowed to whatch TV and what they are allowed to whatch, for instance half an hour a day and just the programm that's especially for childrem so that it can't happen that the parents sit their children in front of the TV so that they don't have to care about them.",12
117,The only thing parents could do is to set a limit of TV watching for there children so they can be social and hang out with there friends.,12
118,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",12
119,Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.,12
120,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,12
121,"I share the opinion that children in this chapter of their life, have to play outside.",13
122,"""Young children should play outside more often"" that is sentence every child has heard a lot of times in her or his young years, but why should they play outside?",13
123,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,14
124,But on the other hand the parents are still deciding what they are going buy and if they are letting them watch television at all and in the most cases the children have to accept their decision.,14
125,The children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money.,14
126,"Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.",14
127,So responsibl parents shold act in a way not let their children whatch all of this ''junk'' TV.,14
128,"And children will  be confronted with commercials anyway, it is not just on TV.",14
129,"But I also think that if kids see too many nice things on tv they like, they may will be way too greedy on those things which their parents might not even be able to afford.",14
130,"As children have Tv channels that are directly presenting shows for their age, it is logical that they have to get money.",14
131,But one the other hand the parents still have to decide what they are going to buy and even if they are letting them watch television.,14
132,And every child has to learn that not everything what is said in the TV is good and that they can not get anything what they want.,14
133,So the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people.,15
134,But in the age of two to five it is very important to have social contact to other people in their age.,15
135,Some kind of them have to find new friends when they begin the time in the kindergarden.,15
136,The children without playimg with other children don't know the contact with others.,15
137,"On the other hand the young children need fresh air and the conversation with parents or friends, wehn the children watching Tv all day, they are allone and haven't activity.",15
138,"But if the children are just sitting in front of their television they have no time to make these contacts, so it could be that they later may have problems making friends with other people.",15
139,"In this chapter of their life, they normally have to play outside with friends and don`t have to sit in their room and watch tv.",15
140,So the relationship to other children is better when the children play with other children.,15
141,"They need to go out to the playground, play with their friends and get social.",15
142,Young children must play with other friends and should not sit at home to watch television.,15
143,"Especially kids at a very yound age really want to have a toy, then play with it for a while before loosing interest.",16
144,"They actually never get to know different toys, like 'Barbie', 'Lego' or even 'Playmobil'.",16
145,"But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy.",16
146,"As they can be influenced so easily, they also might want to have every new toy they see on TV and rather look at these new things on the TV, than go out and play with the toys they already own.",16
147,And some of these different toys will show them tecnical and motorical skills.,16
148,"Children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them.",16
149,"Children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product.",16
150,"It leads to different behavior of your childreen, as they want more and more because they get to see the newest and hottest toys erveryday, that is why soner or later nothing will be good enough for them anymore.",16
151,"Why should a three-year-old girl want anything else than the new robot-barbie, that is praised to be the one and only toy in advertisements?",16
152,Furthermore getting to know many toys they would like to have by television advertisings could help little children to accept that they won't get everything they wish in their life and that they have to be happy with what they get.,16
153,"Theres another argument against advertisements towards young children: Imagine, you`re a children at age two to five.",17
154,"The last argument against ads directed toward young children is  
In my opinion the advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because the companies should not use young children in that way to get more money.",17
155,"So I think advertisement for children sould not be allowed, when it is affecting them in a negative way and sets them under a bad influence.",17
156," For the question, if the advertising directed toward young children shoul not be allowed, you can think on some opinions for and against it.",17
157,"To conclude, I think, these advertisements should not be allowed, because for the children, there is no benefit.",17
158,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",17
159,"So I think that television advertising toward young children should be not allowed, because they are too young and can be manipulate.",17
160,Another argument against advertising directed to children is that it might not be worth it for some companies to direct it to children.,17
161,But there are also some convincing arguments against showing young children advertisings on TV.,17
162,"I agree with the following statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",17
163,in our society today all kids just sit inside and play with their tablats or phones that is very bad they dont receive the experience from playing outside the advanteruse in the forests or the scary dog from your neighbor they just knew the internet.,18
164,Chrismas is coming but their is no idea.,19
165,E. g. for present for the birthday or christmas.,19
166,But it can be useful if young children have no idea for birthday or chrismas.,19
167,"If you tell a child that Santa Clause exists, it will believe.",19
168,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",20
169,Personally I think that the Television advertising directly towards young children should not be allowed because the children are in they own developement aged two to five.,20
170,In my opinion television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed.,20
171,"So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should not be allowed, because in this age children started making their first social contacts, which is very impotant for their growing up.",20
172,"So I think that television advertising toward young children should be not allowed, because they are too young and can be manipulate.",20
173,"So there comes up the question, should TV advertising dirceted towards young children be forbidden.",20
174,"On the one hand, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it's unhealthy for them to whatch television too often since that could cause that they don't move enough.",20
175,All in all I wouldn't allowed advertising in Tv for young children becouse of the strong aspects meanshen earlyer.,20
176,"I think that television advertising that is directed towards young Children should not be allowed, but young Children should not watch much television and the parents should control what their Children watch.",20
177,"I agree with the following statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",20
178,"So they want almost everything they see, and they get it, because theyÂ´ll bag for it until they get what they want.",21
179,They cant think of the consequences of their own acting and if they see something they like they want it.,21
180,Our society is made of consumers and sellers.,21
181,They cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant.,21
182,and for them it seems to be the best thing in the world.,21
183,Our whole society is about buying and selling - consuming.,21
184,They are simply very easy to impress which makes them making desicions about spending money they don't have and can cause a lot of frustration if they don't get it.,21
185,They do not must know this stuff and they do not buy anything.,21
186,That is why they can be manipulated very easily.,21
187,They do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use - convincing people to buy the product.,21
188,That is the normal reason to produce advertisings.,22
189,"If that is not enough reason, one could also claim that companies should have the right to advertise.",22
190,There are different reasons either supporting this advertising or not.,22
191,I'd like to add to this po A new point I want to manshen is the fact of the industie behind this Add.,22
192,"So should, as a consequence, this advertising be forbidden?",22
193,"Because it isn't not really neccessary for the once, who want to advertise their products.",22
194,"So all in all i say, that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed.",22
195,So they can inspire their selfe with the advertising.,22
196,There are some people who say that this kind of advertising should not be allowed.,22
197,They are finally the one who decide weather to buy the advirtised product or not.,22
198,"At this moment, I totally agree with this statement and it should not be allowed, everything else is to much for this children.",23
199,On the one hand you can say that it should be allowed because there are many products or toys that are helpful for children in this age.,23
200,That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+,23
201,In my opinion it should be not allowed to show TV advertisments for children between two and five.,23
202,But itÂ´s the wrong way to use young children to make profit.,23
203,I think it is not right to manipulate children through advertising.,23
204,"None of the children in these ages will have enough money to buy these stuff, so these spots should not be allowed.",23
205,"In my opinion, people should not have the urge to protect children from everything.",23
206,So the advertising should be controlled by some people that know what is right for children aged two to five.,23
207,"Because these children are usually at a very young age, it is discussed whether to ban these ads or not.",23
208,Children in this age should go outside and enjoy their childhood and do not sit inside infront of the television or other media.,24
209,"It is better to show them books with a lot of picures than to let them whatch TV .Young children should also play outside with friends, because they have to learn the difference of the real world and the world that is showed by the medias.",24
210,The young children should play outside or do other stuff than sitting in fornt of a television and watch some strange series.,24
211,they should go outside and play and not sit inside and watch television.,24
212,It's important that children go outside and move instead of sitting in front of the TV the whole time.,24
213,In my opinion young children should generally just spend a small amount of time watching television.,24
214,"The most important point for this statement is that the children should not sit in front of the television all the time, they should go and play outside on a playground whit ther parents or ther friends.",24
215,"I totally agree to this statement, because it could bring the young children to much to the television and could them let forget to play outside.",24
216,Young children must play with other friends and should not sit at home to watch television.,24
217,"A little kid should play with its toys and parents and not watch televison the whole day, because it can be a negative point in its developement.",24
218,Second i will write arguments for the statement.,25
219,"In the following, the statement will be evaluated.",25
220,Now i will count on some arguments for the statement.,25
221,First i will write the argument against the statement.,25
222,The following text is about the named statement.,25
223,With this statement the following text is occupied.,25
224,For example alcohol.,26
225,"Cigarettes, snacks or smartphones.",26
226,The consumption should be determined by the quality of a product rather than the appearance.,26
227,That would be copmromise.,26
228,To come to a conclusion I am of the oppinion that with the right leading from the parents even young children could navigate through the jungle of television advertising and they will learn how to deal with it.,27
229,"To put it briefly, television advertising can be dangerous for children since they cannot decide what is good or bad for them.",27
230,"On the one hand, children are constantly confronted with all sorts of advertising, as they watch television.",27
231,"The Children probably don't even understand the television advertisment, but the parents like the advertisment more when it is a well made advertisment.",27
232,"Also children donÂ´t know the risks of television advertising, they have to learn it when they will grow up.",27
233,Another argument for the advertising is that children always want to be treated as grown-ups so they like to watch advertising on television because it is a thing that is also on channels for older people and so they maybe feel more accepted as a child in the world of adults.,27
234,"Its much more important that young children learn something in books or outside then watching television advertising just made for them and in the young age its easier to get in that children mind and to let them think what they should think about ther product, so that they want to buy it or the parents should buy it and when they dont buy it the young children are sad.",27
235,"A lot of children may not be even able to understand advertising in normal television, so they would be rather nerved as influenced.",27
236,"The most children are not interested in this advertsing and do not watch them, so that it is unnessecary to produce television advertising directed to young children, then they do not see them.",27
237,advertising in the television is not just bad for kids from 1 to 5 its also bad for adults.,27
238,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",28
239,But there are many problems if children see advertisments which are focused on them.,28
240,On the one hand a confrontation with this kind of advertising could be bad on the other hand children can only learn from it if they are confronted with it and learn to spectate advertising from other perspectives.,28
241,"On the other hand children are learning very much in this part of life, so the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products.",28
242,"The people that make the advertisment aim for money, they mainly see their own profit and not the negative influence they have on children.",28
243,One stong arguement againt advertising towards young children is that they don't realise this manipulation.,28
244,"When children are heavily influenced by advertising, this leads to children trying to convince their parents of buying a product much more often as they already do, and this habit puts a much greater strain on the parents, who will probably give in to their children more and more often, because they have not got the strength to have similar fights over products over and over again.",28
245,"So all in all I would say, advertisements for young children are a good thing to get them learn to hear a 'no' and to let their skills grow.",28
246,"Its much more important that young children learn something in books or outside then watching television advertising just made for them and in the young age its easier to get in that children mind and to let them think what they should think about ther product, so that they want to buy it or the parents should buy it and when they dont buy it the young children are sad.",28
247,"The promblem with advertisement, which is directet to children, is that it does not aim for a better futer.",28
248,"But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy.",29
249,"Children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product.",29
250,"When only parents would get advertisements for toys, most of them would not really care about it and they probably would not buy the toy the kid would have chose - especially the more expensive ones.",29
251,"And in the advertisin they show the newest and coolest toys and when these young children look at them, they emidiatly whant to have them.",29
252,Furthermore getting to know many toys they would like to have by television advertisings could help little children to accept that they won't get everything they wish in their life and that they have to be happy with what they get.,29
253,"Children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them.",29
254,"And if the parents have a lot of money and don't care about what they buy in the first place, why not show these children some cool toys on TV to make them happy?",29
255,"Especially around christmas are toys advertised very much, because the people need presents for their families and friends and when a child see toys and books and computer games everywhere it's not surprising that asks it's parents for more than one christmas present.",29
256,"Probably the parents don`t go to a toy shop with their kids very often, so an advertisement is a good way to get to know some playing stuff.",29
257,"Finally, the adverts might want to make a child force their parents to buy a toy for them.",29
258,If they don't learn that early they may have problems with it later.,30
259,But children especially young children don't know.,30
260,"Sometimes the children learn something, they shouldnÂ´t learn.",30
261,"If they don't learn this, they could have problems in their life.",30
262,"And if they weren`t confronted by advertisements and the `no` of their parents, they never learn it.",30
263,"They also do not know about the risks in our society and whether something is good or bad, because they are just at the begining of their developement.",30
264,So itÂ´s not ok to show them this kind of stories because they learn from it...,30
265,But it does not make sense that a young aged children is able to get important information.,30
266,"Furthermore, children cannot make own decisions yet, they are controlled by their parents or adults in general.",30
267,When they watch television and there comes an advertising they see something and the parents have to say: no you can`t get it.,30
268,A good side of television advertisement is the fact that some products for children can be presented on TV and the children will talk to their parents about it.,31
269,Another argument for the advertising is that children always want to be treated as grown-ups so they like to watch advertising on television because it is a thing that is also on channels for older people and so they maybe feel more accepted as a child in the world of adults.,31
270,"Its much more important that young children learn something in books or outside then watching television advertising just made for them and in the young age its easier to get in that children mind and to let them think what they should think about ther product, so that they want to buy it or the parents should buy it and when they dont buy it the young children are sad.",31
271,"On the one hand a pro argument of showing these advertisings in Tv is, that the products have mostly a pedagogic aspect, so the child learns new things.",31
272,"Television advertising can be good for a children, whose parents are very busy and do not have many time for their child.",31
273,"Enterprises have chosen this method of advertising because they are on current with nowadays' methods of ""raising"" a child and that televisions are often a part of it.",31
274,"The Children probably don't even understand the television advertisment, but the parents like the advertisment more when it is a well made advertisment.",31
275,The television advertising is sometimes very funny and beautiful for the kids.,31
276,"In this case you have to know that television advertising can be negative for the growing up of little children because in many television advertising, there are bad stuff.",31
277,The topic of advertising in the tv to young children is difficult.,31
278,In this essay I am going to give some arguments pro and contra this topic.,32
279,"On this question is based the following text, which shows advantages and disadvantages  including my personal opinion.",32
280,In  the following text I am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.,32
281,In the following I will present my opinion on this topic.,32
282,In this essay I will show off the advantages and disadvantages of this topic and comment on it.,32
283,In the following text I am going to explain some arguments in favour and against the topic to get an answer.,32
284,In the following I will discuss this statement.,32
285,IÂ´m going to compare advantages and disadvantages.,32
286,"As a result I agree with the statement, because there are a lot of disadvantages and only a few advantages.",32
287,"But as always there are some disadvantages and some advantages, for the children, their parents and those buisneses.",32
288,But when televison advertisement towards young children is not allowed it doesnÂ´t stop that young children can be manipulated very easily and want most of the things they see.,33
289,I think rather than ban advertises directed to kids from television it is more important to teach the kids how to deal with advertises.,33
290,"Also children donÂ´t know the risks of television advertising, they have to learn it when they will grow up.",33
291,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",33
292,That's why televison advertisement that's directed toward young children causes trouble.,33
293,"To put it briefly, television advertising can be dangerous for children since they cannot decide what is good or bad for them.",33
294,"A lot of children may not be even able to understand advertising in normal television, so they would be rather nerved as influenced.",33
295,The television advertising directed toward children could confuse the children because they dont know how to deal with the situation.,33
296,"But I think televison advertisement towards young children cannot be forbidden, because we live in a democratic state, where everybody can publish, what they wrote or filmed.",33
297,Televison advertising to children between two to five - a controversal topic which is often discussed.,33
298,Television should not be allowed for young children because they would see pictures they don't understand and which are not made for young childs.,34
299,In the end I can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 2-5 must be allowed to interfier with that.,34
300,In my view young children aged two to five should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents.,34
301,"In the end, I'd like to say that young children should be allowed to whatch TV because it can be interesting for them and they can learn something.",34
302,"Television directed toward young people should  be allowed but the children should watch tv not so often like adults, because they have not enough concentration to watch an hour a day.",34
303,"I agree with the statement, that television should not be allowed toward young children.",34
304,I think it's okay if children want to watch television.,34
305,"The statement, that televisions should not be allowed to young children between two and five years is sometimes correct.",34
306,"Young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but itÂ´s not the right way, I think.",34
307,All in all in think it should be allowed for young-aged children to watch TV but parents have to take look if it's not too long or what movie is on the TV.,34
308,"When they do not spend much time with their parents, when they are young it will have aftermath, when they are adults.",35
309,But on the other hand they are just kids and so they would be totally influenced by this.,35
310,So they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour.,35
311,"So that there are also bad influences, what have follows for the future life of these children.",35
312,"If they don't learn this, they could have problems in their life.",35
313,If they don't learn that early they may have problems with it later.,35
314,"They might even become angry at them, throwing a tantrum if they want something really bad.",35
315,They learn things from them like how to behave in some situations.,35
316,"They will also not have a good relation to their parents, because they did not spend much time with them, when they were young.",35
317,"One can't really tell them what to do ore not, they will experience this themselves.",35
318,They are unenlightened and do not question absolutes.,36
319,"If they see something, they are not capible of nmaking up an own opinion.",36
320,So they believe in wrong things and regard lies as true.,36
321,They believe almost everything.,36
322,Because they are unenlightened they obey what the growns ups say.,36
323,"Maybe they don't understand a lot but they know, or better to say they feel all of that what's happened.",36
324,"They only think ""they are small, they don't think, they understand nothing in their age"" and for them it doesn't matter how they feel.",36
325,The persons give us a wrong point of view.,36
326,and for them it seems to be the best thing in the world.,36
327,Television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society.,37
328,Besides they are confronted with advertising anyways for example in the supermarket or the streets or magazines.,37
329,Nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches TV.,37
330,That is the normal reason to produce advertisings.,37
331,"But advertisement is a allday thing so if they would not see it on the TV they would see it in the streets, radio and big city.",37
332,"Nowdays, advertising is a normal part of the television.",37
333,Television advertising has a big role in modern society.,37
334,Advertisment has an big influence on our society.,37
335,Advertsing is too big in the society today.,37
336,"
Advertises are often shown in the TV.",37
337,Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.,38
338,"Parents should make sure that their children grows up with things, which are important fot theier future.",38
339,The only important point is the behaviour of the parents toward the children.,38
340,"By far the best point to make is that no matter what the child wants, no matter how sad it will get, everything is always up to the parents.",38
341,"The position of parents is so important for children, because they learn from them and act like them.",38
342,I think it is important that you as a parent support the devolpment of your child.,38
343,"Furthermore, children cannot make own decisions yet, they are controlled by their parents or adults in general.",38
344,Another important thing is the knowledge of the children.,38
345,The parents have the chance to decide what the child does and what is bought in the end.,38
346,"A solution can be, that the parents of the children have to handle right with this topic, because itÂ´s important for their children and their developement.",38
347,They also can't tell if it's worth the prize of it.,39
348,They also wouldnÂ´t know the value of these things.,39
349,"Also there is the chance, e.g.",39
350,but there are also prospects.,39
351,And that could be even worse.,39
352,Their health and happyness would suffer and the profit of the industry is not worth it.,39
353,They only show them a possibility.,39
354,Doubtful.,39
355,In addition children would only see the product and what they are worth.,39
356,This is an easy way for these kids to get some general knowledge and gives there parents some time to do other things then working or having a look at what there child is doing.,40
357,So the children may know what will happend in an older age.,40
358,So the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people.,40
359,Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.,40
360,So the parents can do housework like cooking or doing laundry without really caring for the child for a few minutes.,40
361,So you can question why there would be a potential bad influence for their children.,40
362,So the relationship to other children is better when the children play with other children.,40
363,They could look at the reaction of ther children.,40
364,So the parents can control their children nevertheless.,40
365,Furthermore the parents could prepare their kids.,40
366,But often young children can learn something by watching television.,41
367,"The kids have to whatch films and series to learn also from them , who made for the children, but they dont have to have a Television for him or herself.",41
368,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,41
369,"This basically has nothing to do with the normal programm young children watch today, but if they get used to watch TV every days since they are maybe 3 years old they might start watching this kind of movie ways earlier then they should.",41
370,"For instance, there are many shows on the TV that are especially for very young children and that try to teach them something by having fun which can be very effective.",41
371,"Many television channels have learn programms for children, where children can learn for example languages or easy vocabulary.",41
372,Furthermore more many child series and movies on TV teach many life lessons so that the children will be prepared for life and their social life.,41
373,But an important thing is also that there are lots of educating movies and series which help the children to live or preparing their life.,41
374,Many chanels started producing movies and series for young children where they show how to learn for example languages like english or french.,41
375,"Nowadays, children at this age have their own TV in their room and there are many shows whitch are not good for them or things they can not understand at this age.",41
376,But is that right?,42
377,But is this right?,42
378,BUt,42
379,"This is sad and depressing, isn`t ist?",42
380,That's enough.,42
381,That's not good.,42
382,And so now this is waht I came up with.,42
383,But that did not change my opnion!,42
384,"), it's fine.",42
385,Finally I agree with the statement.,42
386,Young children can be influenced easily.,43
387,Young children can be easiliy influenced by everything.,43
388,Children can also be influenced more easily by different things.,43
389,"First of all it is well-known that little children are heavily influenced by their surroundings, so that they can get manipulated easily as well.",43
390,"In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life.",43
391,"The children believe every word and can get a wrong image   of what is realy important in life, because they do not have any experiences like that yet.",43
392,Another aspect is that children believe in everything what they see.,43
393,On the other hand children of this age have a high level of influence.,43
394,But on the other hand they are just kids and so they would be totally influenced by this.,43
395,That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+,43
396,Those ads are mostly colourful and show the product to be far more alive than it actually is while also giving it abilities which their real counterparts do not have.,44
397,"The following text is an essay about the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."".",45
398,This essay is about the topic if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.,45
399,In the following text I will discuss the question if television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not.,45
400,In the following text I am going to write a discussion about the statement if television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.,45
401,The following essay deals with the topic of allowing television advertising for young children from age two to five.,45
402,The following text discusses the statement if television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should be allowed or not.,45
403,"In the following text i will discuss if ""Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed""
General Television advertising influence of course all of the people,also young people,because the advertise is always shown in a perfect way without faults, because they want that everybody will buy the product,so therefore they will earn a lot of money.When young people see something very special for them on the television, they tell their parents that they want it, but they only want it, because it was shown so perfect and not because they tried it.",45
404,"I will talk about the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five)should not be allowed"", in the following essay.",45
405,"In the following essay i will show negativ reasons and examples for the statement "" Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"".",45
406,"A argument on the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",45
407,The advertising in television should be regulate from the people who make the TV-program.,46
408,In my oppinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed.,46
409,advertising should be stoped but  thats impossible because the concerns are too big and cannot be stoped.,46
410,"So all in all i say, that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed.",46
411,In order to answer the question as to whether or not such tv ads should be banned or not the companies' perspectives should also be taken into consideration.,46
412,"My opinion to this topic is, that televsion  advertising directed to young children should be stopped.",46
413,"On the one hand, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it's unhealthy for them to whatch television too often since that could cause that they don't move enough.",46
414,I am agree with this Statement because the televison advertising have many negatives effects.,46
415,"So no, it should not be a law or a rule for all channels to not show advertising.",46
416,"On the one hand, there seems to be no need for a prohibition of especially this type of advertisements since most of the children aged 2 to 5 are allowed to watch television anyway and are therefore confronted with other advertisements, that might have an even more negative impact on their development, e.g.",46
417,But I think everybody have to think about that statement on his own to have an own opinion about it.,47
418,For me its hard to judge about this because i never thought so intensiv about this topic.,47
419,In the following I will present my opinion on this topic.,47
420,In the following text I am going to explain some arguments in favour and against the topic to get an answer.,47
421,In  the following text I am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.,47
422,"But I think, you canÂ´t say no with a law, so itÂ´s difficult to handle with this topic.",47
423,"Likewise, I agree with the point that it should not be allowed.",47
424,I think it is wrong.,47
425,But in my opinion thats part of our economic system.,47
426,My opinion to that statement is divided.,47
427,In the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices.,48
428,"They want to use computers, smartphones and tablets etc.",48
429,"Children get a phone earlier every generation, and with that they have the connection to everything that is out there.",48
430,"In our generation it is normal that children have a mobile phone and a ""I pad"" or something like this.",48
431,We are living in a world where technology affects our daily life and where we are dependent on it.,48
432,"If parents are trusting and caring with the fact that their kids use a technological product and a thing that can make ""abhÃ¤ngig""(?",48
433,And in our society it is not unusal to play with smartphones even at an young age.,48
434,But it's important that - especially today - someone watches more over the technological use from children.,48
435,but is it ok to give that high technology devices to children aged two to five?,48
436,I'm lucky that I had a childhood without a phone or a computer - all these things were something my parents didn't allowed me to play with.,48
437,"We learn the most in this years, and if we get anything we want, if our parents always buy our favourite candy at the groucery; we learn that it is normal to get anything we want, and that it is normal to always get and eat our favourite candy.",49
438,I recognised that many children grow up  different since I bacame older.,49
439,I remember the happiness i've felt when my father gave me his phone for a minute or when my parents said that I can watch a movie that's longer than forty-five minutes.,49
440,"The parents try to get them back to the old times, like playing in the garden or reading a book.",49
441,"When I was 5 years old I`d love to play with my friends or with my babyborn.Furthermore, I do not even really now what happens around the world or what televison can be.",49
442,"In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life.",49
443,Think about your childhood ?,49
444,And sometimes you even feel like you want to be a little kid again just to be able to try all these brand-new amazing things.,49
445,For example its seems to me as if my childhood has just ended and now I'm already confonted with the force of earning money next year - after leaving school - to become independent and live the life I want.,49
446,"They wont be as happy as they were, because the children want more and more things but can not always get them from their parents.",49
