0,"On one hand itÂ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children, because the children in the age of two to five canÂ´t say anything about there own opinion, because they are to young to say it.",0
1,I think children maybe donÂ´t want advertising that is directed toward them.,0
2,"I can understand that companies direct their advertising towards young children, because in that age, children can be manipulated very easily, and while adults and other children are better able to decide wether they actually need the advertised product, they only care about the great video and not about what the product actually is.",0
3,But there are also some reasons for advertisements towars young children.,0
4,If those young children see advertising for the necessary or the right stuff it might be usefull that they watch this advertising.,0
5,"Theres another argument against advertisements towards young children: Imagine, you`re a children at age two to five.",0
6,The companys sponsering the ads could just claim that theyÂ´re not aiming for the younger children.,0
7,Advertising addressed to young children can create both a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing one's life.,0
8,"May one can say that advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, because it is allowed to be directed toward everyone in every age.",0
9,"On the one side it should be allowed to show such as these advertisments, because the children are more informed, what is in trend and can compare with other children.",0
10,"So I think advertisement for children sould not be allowed, when it is affecting them in a negative way and sets them under a bad influence.",1
11,"But as just mentioned, it's the quality of the advertisement that really matters, thus instead of wanting to prohibit them all, one should rather ask for more appropriate ads, that don't damage young children in any way.",1
12,"To conclude, I think, these advertisements should not be allowed, because for the children, there is no benefit.",1
13," For the question, if the advertising directed toward young children shoul not be allowed, you can think on some opinions for and against it.",1
14,The question is if this advertising should be forbidden because of the influence that it could take on young children.,1
15,So I think advertisement towards young children should be allowed.,1
16,"On the other hand, this adverts shouldn't be allowe because these young children can't do anything with this adverts.",1
17,"Because these children are usually at a very young age, it is discussed whether to ban these ads or not.",1
18,"On the one side it should be allowed to show such as these advertisments, because the children are more informed, what is in trend and can compare with other children.",1
19,In my opinion advertising toward young children shouln't be allowed.,1
20,In my view young children aged two to five should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents.,2
21,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",2
22,"Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.",2
23,"Young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but itÂ´s not the right way, I think.",2
24,In the end I can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 2-5 must be allowed to interfier with that.,2
25,"Television directed toward young people should  be allowed but the children should watch tv not so often like adults, because they have not enough concentration to watch an hour a day.",2
26,I think it's okay if children want to watch television.,2
27,"All in one I think it`s okay, that children watch tv in a small part of time, if they don`t forget to do important things for school and playing outside with their friends.",2
28,"I think that the parents should make a rule that says how long their children are allowed to whatch TV and what they are allowed to whatch, for instance half an hour a day and just the programm that's especially for childrem so that it can't happen that the parents sit their children in front of the TV so that they don't have to care about them.",2
29,In my opinion young children should generally just spend a small amount of time watching television.,2
30,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",3
31,Advertising addressed to young children can create both a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing one's life.,3
32,But there are also some reasons for advertisements towars young children.,3
33,"Advertisement for children does not have to be a bad thing, it can be used to influence them so that their behaviour will have a positive effekt on society and nature.",3
34,"So all in all I would say, advertisements for young children are a good thing to get them learn to hear a 'no' and to let their skills grow.",3
35,On the one hand a confrontation with this kind of advertising could be bad on the other hand children can only learn from it if they are confronted with it and learn to spectate advertising from other perspectives.,3
36,On the one hand young children have to learn how to deal with advertising.,3
37,I think children maybe donÂ´t want advertising that is directed toward them.,3
38,But there are many problems if children see advertisments which are focused on them.,3
39,"The Children probably don't even understand the television advertisment, but the parents like the advertisment more when it is a well made advertisment.",3
40,I remember the happiness i've felt when my father gave me his phone for a minute or when my parents said that I can watch a movie that's longer than forty-five minutes.,4
41,Think about your childhood ?,4
42,"When I was 5 years old I`d love to play with my friends or with my babyborn.Furthermore, I do not even really now what happens around the world or what televison can be.",4
43,"We learn the most in this years, and if we get anything we want, if our parents always buy our favourite candy at the groucery; we learn that it is normal to get anything we want, and that it is normal to always get and eat our favourite candy.",4
44,"The parents try to get them back to the old times, like playing in the garden or reading a book.",4
45,"Just ten years back in the past the young children went outside to meet the nature and learn things about it, they played outside and had toys to understand some first easy things.",4
46,I also remember me having fun to go outside and not having to worry about an television advertisement.,4
47,And sometimes you even feel like you want to be a little kid again just to be able to try all these brand-new amazing things.,4
48,I recognised that many children grow up  different since I bacame older.,4
49,"In this chapter of their life, they normally have to play outside with friends and don`t have to sit in their room and watch tv.",4
50,"The following text is an essay about the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."".",5
51,This essay is about the topic if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.,5
52,In the following text I will discuss the question if television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not.,5
53,In the following text I am going to write a discussion about the statement if television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.,5
54,"In the following text i will discuss if ""Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed""
General Television advertising influence of course all of the people,also young people,because the advertise is always shown in a perfect way without faults, because they want that everybody will buy the product,so therefore they will earn a lot of money.When young people see something very special for them on the television, they tell their parents that they want it, but they only want it, because it was shown so perfect and not because they tried it.",5
55,The following essay deals with the topic of allowing television advertising for young children from age two to five.,5
56,"I will talk about the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five)should not be allowed"", in the following essay.",5
57,"In the following essay i will show negativ reasons and examples for the statement "" Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"".",5
58,The following text discusses the statement if television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should be allowed or not.,5
59,"A argument on the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",5
60,So they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour.,6
61,"The children believe every word and can get a wrong image   of what is realy important in life, because they do not have any experiences like that yet.",6
62,"So that there are also bad influences, what have follows for the future life of these children.",6
63,An other negative point is that the childrens aren't abled to judge things regarding their quality or the need of it.,6
64,That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+,6
65,Young children can be easiliy influenced by everything.,6
66,"Although children cannot decide what is good and what is bad for them, they have opinions.",6
67,They create wrong needs and slow down the psychological development.,6
68,"They also do not know about the risks in our society and whether something is good or bad, because they are just at the begining of their developement.",6
69,Children can also be influenced more easily by different things.,6
70,Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.,7
71,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",7
72,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,7
73,First of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us.,7
74,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,7
75,Especially young children are getting easily influenced by television.,7
76,"However the television can be nessecary, because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep.",7
77,Many children spend too much time on watching TV.,7
78,When they look tv the children are independent of this media so they can't live without watching tv.,7
79,"Young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but itÂ´s not the right way, I think.",7
80,Nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches TV.,8
81,"On the other side, advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television.",8
82,Television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society.,8
83,Besides they are confronted with advertising anyways for example in the supermarket or the streets or magazines.,8
84,"So if they watch TV, an advertisement could easily make them want to have the product shown in the advert.",8
85,That is the normal reason to produce advertisings.,8
86,"
Advertises are often shown in the TV.",8
87,Advertisment has an big influence on our society.,8
88,Television advertising has a big role in modern society.,8
89,"Nowdays, advertising is a normal part of the television.",8
90,Some parents will maybe buy the toys and then do not have enough money left for other things.,9
91,"Children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them.",9
92,"And if the parents have a lot of money and don't care about what they buy in the first place, why not show these children some cool toys on TV to make them happy?",9
93,"They will then ask their parent to buy it, but a lot of parents cannot spend as much money at toys even if they want to.",9
94,"This way, they can also learn from it and maybe develop a sense for what's good and what's not, so they can better decide what to buy for themselves when they're older.",9
95,It is important to mention that children do have a say in what their parents buy them.,9
96,and if the parents are smart they will tell them that they do not need it so the parents will not buy it.,9
97,"And while they usually are not able to actually buy these things, they are often able to heavily influence their parents when insistin on wanting to have something.",9
98,"But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy.",9
99,"One cannot forget though, that children aged two to five may not have a sense for rational thinking or are conscious about money's worth at all, so they might see some completely useless and easily breakable item on TV, which they then want to have for christmas.",9
100,In  the following text I am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.,10
101,In my opinion i agree with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples.,10
102,But I think everybody have to think about that statement on his own to have an own opinion about it.,10
103,In my opionion there are two sides to this statement.,10
104,In the following I will present my opinion on this topic.,10
105,In this essay I am going to give some arguments pro and contra this topic.,10
106,In the following I will discuss this statement.,10
107,All in all I donÂ´t really agree or disagree with the statement.,10
108,In the following text I am going to explain some arguments in favour and against the topic to get an answer.,10
109,My opinion to that statement is divided.,10
110,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",11
111,Personally I think that the Television advertising directly towards young children should not be allowed because the children are in they own developement aged two to five.,11
112,"On the one hand, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it's unhealthy for them to whatch television too often since that could cause that they don't move enough.",11
113,"I agree with the following statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",11
114,"So I think that television advertising toward young children should be not allowed, because they are too young and can be manipulate.",11
115,"So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should not be allowed, because in this age children started making their first social contacts, which is very impotant for their growing up.",11
116,In my opinion television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed.,11
117,All in all I would say that I donÂ´t agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because I think that there is nothing to worry about if  little children come in contact with television advertisements.,11
118,All in all I wouldn't allowed advertising in Tv for young children becouse of the strong aspects meanshen earlyer.,11
119,"Summarising all points I can conclude that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because of the negative impact this could have on their development and because of them being not reasonable enough to make their own decisions and to realise whether something is good or bad",11
120,"But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy.",12
121,"And in the advertisin they show the newest and coolest toys and when these young children look at them, they emidiatly whant to have them.",12
122,Furthermore getting to know many toys they would like to have by television advertisings could help little children to accept that they won't get everything they wish in their life and that they have to be happy with what they get.,12
123,"Children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product.",12
124,"And I think that is a very important way for companys to sell their products, because this is the most affective and also the easiest way to reach the children and earn money by selling them specifc toys.",12
125,"When only parents would get advertisements for toys, most of them would not really care about it and they probably would not buy the toy the kid would have chose - especially the more expensive ones.",12
126,"when there is TV advertising for a specific toy, that the children like it and the parents can buy it to them.",12
127,So the toy-industry needs the advertising toward young children to sell their products and get money.,12
128,"Sometimes the toy or whatever isn't as fancy as it seems or people in the advertisement do not show the right behavior that the parents taught them before, so kids are going to question everything and we all know how annoying this could end.",12
129,"Probably the parents don`t go to a toy shop with their kids very often, so an advertisement is a good way to get to know some playing stuff.",12
130,So the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people.,13
131,"In this chapter of their life, they normally have to play outside with friends and don`t have to sit in their room and watch tv.",13
132,Children in this age should go outside and enjoy their childhood and do not sit inside infront of the television or other media.,13
133,"On the other hand the young children need fresh air and the conversation with parents or friends, wehn the children watching Tv all day, they are allone and haven't activity.",13
134,Young children must play with other friends and should not sit at home to watch television.,13
135,"They need to go out to the playground, play with their friends and get social.",13
136,ItÂ´s better for them to play in the kindergarten or to play with their mum.,13
137,It's important that children go outside and move instead of sitting in front of the TV the whole time.,13
138,"For so many children its too difficult to learn, that parents often don`t allow them to be outside until 9pm or like in this discussion, buying some playing stuff (from the advertisements) for them.",13
139,"For example, children with the age of two to five should reed some books or play games like football.",13
140,"Making advertising for them, shows that there is a high number of children watching tv and if the companies would stop it, maybe not as much children would watch television.",14
141,"A good point is, that some kind of them show news for children, so they can understand it, or show some series with animals.",14
142,In addition parents might be happy about TV programm without advertising directed toward young children because they wouldn't suffer from an annoying child who really wants to have the toy car it has just seen in TV and cries now the whole time because his parents won't buy the mentioned car.,14
143,"And children will  be confronted with commercials anyway, it is not just on TV.",14
144,This could  be the reason why we create televion advertising.,14
145,The children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money.,14
146,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,14
147,"So it can start to be really annoying, especially for parents, if kids will never stop talking about wanting what they just saw on the TV.",14
148,"For the concerns itÂ´s very lucrative to do advertising to young people because they watch it, they want it and they go to their parents to talk with them if the children are allowed to get it.",14
149,In the television is so much aadvertising like never before and even small children watch television.,14
150,But an important thing is also that there are lots of educating movies and series which help the children to live or preparing their life.,15
151,But often young children can learn something by watching television.,15
152,Furthermore more many child series and movies on TV teach many life lessons so that the children will be prepared for life and their social life.,15
153,"The kids have to whatch films and series to learn also from them , who made for the children, but they dont have to have a Television for him or herself.",15
154,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,15
155,"ItÂ´s better to show them, how to handle with television or games or something like that, because the children are learning for their lifes and not just for the moment.",15
156,"In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life.",15
157,"For instance, there are many shows on the TV that are especially for very young children and that try to teach them something by having fun which can be very effective.",15
158,The coming and existing media will open new and in a few things much easier oppurtunities to get something in mind of a young kid.,15
159,"Many television channels have learn programms for children, where children can learn for example languages or easy vocabulary.",15
160,Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.,16
161,"Furthermore, children cannot make own decisions yet, they are controlled by their parents or adults in general.",16
162,But if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine.,16
163,The parents have the chance to decide what the child does and what is bought in the end.,16
164,"By far the best point to make is that no matter what the child wants, no matter how sad it will get, everything is always up to the parents.",16
165,"The parents have to decide, what is the best for their children.",16
166,So the parents can control their children nevertheless.,16
167,The only important point is the behaviour of the parents toward the children.,16
168,So it is actually the parents' duty to raise their kinds sensible to what they are seeing or hearing.,16
169,That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+,16
170,Young children can be influenced easily.,17
171,"First of all it is well-known that little children are heavily influenced by their surroundings, so that they can get manipulated easily as well.",17
172,Young children can be easiliy influenced by everything.,17
173,But on the other hand they are just kids and so they would be totally influenced by this.,17
174,Children who are that young don't know how to compromise it.,17
175,Children can also be influenced more easily by different things.,17
176,On the one hand the children are so small that they aren't able to reconize the fact that they get manipulated plus the fact that is pretty easy to do it because they don't have th ability to reflect things.,17
177,"The children believe every word and can get a wrong image   of what is realy important in life, because they do not have any experiences like that yet.",17
178,Another aspect is that children believe in everything what they see.,17
179,At this age of confusing realizations children can be manipulated very easily.,17
180,In the following I will discuss this statement.,18
181,One decision must lead to other decisions as well.,18
182,BUt,18
183,But is this right?,18
184,"Also there is the chance, e.g.",18
185,But is that right?,18
186,But that is only guessed.,18
187,But there is also the other side of the problem.,18
188,And that might be a problem as many criticers say.,18
189,Now i will count on some arguments for the statement.,18
190,In the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices.,19
191,"They want to use computers, smartphones and tablets etc.",19
192,"Children get a phone earlier every generation, and with that they have the connection to everything that is out there.",19
193,But it's important that - especially today - someone watches more over the technological use from children.,19
194,But also young children use it for education.,19
195,"If parents are trusting and caring with the fact that their kids use a technological product and a thing that can make ""abhÃ¤ngig""(?",19
196,The children in the age two to five get up too with the new technoligy.,19
197,In the future there will be more and more technology and we can not forbidm the children to not live that life.,19
198,but is it ok to give that high technology devices to children aged two to five?,19
199,We are living in a world where technology affects our daily life and where we are dependent on it.,19
