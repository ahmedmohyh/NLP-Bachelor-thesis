0,my opinion to this topic is that televsion  advertising directed  should be stopped,0
1,so it may occure the question whether tv advertising  aged  shoud or should not be allowed,0
2,i am agree with this statement because the televison advertising have many negatives effects,0
3,in the following essay i will show negativ reasons and examples for the statement  television advertising  should not be allowed,0
4,first of all i would say that it would be difficult to stop televison advertising which is  in the ages ,0
5,nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches tv,0
6,television advertising  should not be allowed,0
7,in the following text i will inform you about television advertising,0
8,in the television is so much aadvertising like never before and even small children watch television,0
9,in the following text i will discuss the controverse theme if television advertising  should be allowed or not,0
10,forthermore the childrens often dont need the object,1
11,for example children do not need their own playstation when they are really young they do not know that it is unhealthy if they use it too much for example that they get problems with their eyes et cetera,1
12,in the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices,1
13,furthermore there would be some children who want to get everything they see on tv and for poor parents it would be really difficult to explain why their friends already own these things which seem to be important,1
14,if they always want more toys the parents maybe will follow their wishes to make their children happy and make these wishes come true which can lead to the missing abilities mentioned before,1
15,but children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them they will be really unhappy,1
16,then the parents can simply buy the object,1
17,on the other hand if the parents take care of them and pay attention the children will not get any problems but they will have fun with their new toy or other things,1
18,first you should allow this kind of avertising because it helps the parents to buy things which fit with the specific wishes of their children,1
19,the parents dont like to see their children cry and they bought the object for them,1
20,but often young children can learn something by watching television,2
21,furthermore more many child series and movies on tv teach many life lessons so that the children will be prepared for life and their social life,2
22,my second reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours after hours tv and so they would  not focus on there future work lives,2
23,watching tv in these ages can also be discussed whether itâ´s good for them,2
24,in the end i can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 25 must be allowed to interfier with that,2
25,actually that is a thing that every child is going to do in that young age they are going to the kindergarden or to a kita and will only be watching tv in the mo0ments when they are at home,2
26,also to hold against the argument that children that watch tv are not interfering with there family anymore the parents could watch the sereies with them and make a game out of it so they will make tv watching a family activity,2
27,also little children learn what is forbidden and what is right but they should watch series which are made for young children with an age of if they look criminal series it is not good for their evolution and they can missundertand what the people are doing,2
28,furthermore the parents have to have an eye on their children if they watch tv,2
29,i disagree with this statement because it is not bad if little child seeing television advertising in this age but they should not watch it so often,2
30,my last reason is that children at the age of  are defintiv to young to look tv because of the risks and the consequences of this media to themselves,3
31,the first reason is that young children at the age  can not understand the main statement from the television because there brain can not translate or understand the film which is shown as a consequence it should not be allowed,3
32,my second reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours after hours tv and so they would  not focus on there future work lives,3
33,the third and important reason for me is that the television is a media which is lying fluently to have better quotes of the public to become famous and rich,3
34,it stress the parents and it could destroy the entership between the family and friends,4
35,if they dont learn this they could have problems in their life,4
36,on the other hand if the parents take care of them and pay attention the children will not get any problems but they will have fun with their new toy or other things,4
37,the children get irritated and dont know how to react,4
38,forthermore the childrens often dont need the object,4
39,but children especially young children dont know,4
40,if they dont get the object they start to cry or they are sad about the desission of their parents,4
41,they create wrong needs and slow down the psychological development,4
42,my second reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours after hours tv and so they would  not focus on there future work lives,4
43,not everybody sees that as negativ because a lot of people doesnt believe that children for example aged  understand the things they seemany parents cant even imagine that many aspects while the growing process can have an influence on the futured personality of the kidsfor me its the biggest problem in todays community and forbiding of television andvertising directed to to the young children wouldnt be a solution for the probmlem,4
44,in the end i can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 25 must be allowed to interfier with that,5
45,television  young people should  be allowed but the children should watch tv not so often like adults because they have not enough concentration to watch an hour a day,5
46,the children should be allowed to watch television and use all the technology the presnt has to offer because we are living in a constant development of technology and in the future there will be more of that,5
47,the only thing parents could do is to set a limit of tv watching for there children so they can be social and hang out with there friends,5
48,my second reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours after hours tv and so they would  not focus on there future work lives,5
49,but on the other hand watching telivison advertising in these ages can lead to the missing ability to appreciate things which are advertised in the tv such as toys or electronic devises to play with,6
50,i disagree with this statement because it is not bad if little child seeing television advertising in this age but they should not watch it so often,6
51,in the television is so much aadvertising like never before and even small children watch television,6
52,the children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money,6
53,so it may occure the question whether tv advertising  aged  shoud or should not be allowed,6
54,televison advertising is not good for the childish brain because they do not know what is important and what is not but i do not think that it is bad if they watch it,6
55,this essay will be about the ban of advertising spots on television directing to children between the age of two and five,6
56,furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children,7
57,on one hand itâ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children because the children in the age of  canâ´t say anything about there own opinion because they are to young to say it,7
58,the children aged  are far too young to think about there own opinion and to think about advertising being  them,7
59,to conclude i think these advertisements should not be allowed because for the children there is no benefit,7
60,on the one hand children are not able to think critically about the advertisement,7
61,in conlusion i would say that  a special advertisment for children should only be allowed if the advertisment is controlled by the parents or a kind of institute in the aspect of influece a learning,7
62,i think children maybe donâ´t want advertising that is  them,7
63,on the other hand this adverts shouldnt be allowe because these young children cant do anything with this adverts,7
64,plus the strategy of advertisment is to create needs and children cant deal with that,7
65,all in all adverts for children aged  shouldnt be allowed because of their negative effects on the children,7
66,all in all adverts for children aged  shouldnt be allowed because of their negative effects on the children,8
67,in my opinion i agree with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples,9
68,for me its hard to judge about this because i never thought so intensiv about this topic,9
69,televison advertising is not good for the childish brain because they do not know what is important and what is not but i do not think that it is bad if they watch it,10
70,their health and happyness would suffer and the profit of the industry is not worth it,11
71,some say that it is all going to be compromized and going to be technical,11
72,they only help companies to improve their profits and this is not good,11
73,we shou,11
74,there are a few ones that do not have a probleme with the change but the most do,11
75,thats not good,11
76,they cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant,11
77,thats the way many people think about the influnce of media like televison on young childreni dont think it should be not allowed but i am not the opinion that its positive for them,12
78,furthermore the parents have to have an eye on their children if they watch tv,12
79,but for the industry it is easier to persuade children than adults who reflect their actingthey would not profit of this ban although watching tv for young children is dangerous and unhealthy in general,12
80,not everybody sees that as negativ because a lot of people doesnt believe that children for example aged  understand the things they seemany parents cant even imagine that many aspects while the growing process can have an influence on the futured personality of the kidsfor me its the biggest problem in todays community and forbiding of television andvertising directed to to the young children wouldnt be a solution for the probmlem,12
81,every parent should decide if he lets his child watching things  which can be dangerous for the development of his own child,12
82,i disagree with this statement because it is not bad if little child seeing television advertising in this age but they should not watch it so often,12
83,the children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money,12
84,my second reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours after hours tv and so they would  not focus on there future work lives,12
85,the only generation is the elders generation whom are not used to technology at all,13
86,so the snetence above is mostly to hear form the older generation,13
87,younger people than,13
88,on the other hand children are learning very much in this part of life so the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products,14
89,furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children,14
90,children may believe whats said in the advert,14
91,i think children maybe donâ´t want advertising that is  them,14
92,the children aged  are far too young to think about there own opinion and to think about advertising being  them,14
93,on one hand itâ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children because the children in the age of  canâ´t say anything about there own opinion because they are to young to say it,14
94,on the one hand children are not able to think critically about the advertisement,14
95,in addition the parents should explain theire children how they have to handel with advertising,14
96,but this aspect is just valuable if the advertisment is supposed for children and does not have strongly influecing parts,14
97,to conclude i think these advertisements should not be allowed because for the children there is no benefit,14
