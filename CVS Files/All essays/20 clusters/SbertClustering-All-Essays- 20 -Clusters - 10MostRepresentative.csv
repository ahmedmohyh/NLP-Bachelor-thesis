90,Some advertising are especially for young children.,9
91,The advertising must be for the children so that they understand the idea behind it.,9
92,"This is a strong point, but opponents say, that tese two to five year old children don't even understand and get what the advertisement is about, so it is kind of useless to make advertisement especially for this children.",9
93,If someone has a problem with advertisement directed at young children they should rather concern themselves with the values their kid learns and what's really important in life.,9
94,"By aiming advertisement at a group of two to five year olds the industry is playing an unfair game, by taking advantage of the children so young they are barely able to make up their own mind.",9
95,"Young children want almost everything they see and for parents these advertisings for children wouldn't be good at all (although their parents could say no, but most parents just want their children to be happy).",9
96,I think children maybe donÂ´t want advertising that is directed toward them.,9
97,In my opinion it is useless to show advertisments for young children because they cannot buy the product which makes the advertisment a waste of time and money.,9
98,In various occasions there even is advertising directed toward young children.,9
99,There are advertisings which are not good for children because they are sometimes too young to understand the backround of the advertising.,9
100,"That view can cause conflicts between the children and the parents which can, in worst case, loose their control.",10
101,Another point is that it takes also a lot influence of the child.,10
102,"Children don't have the same abbility to overthink things and see behind what is being shown to them, as an adult does.",10
103,Children need and want other things than adults.,10
104,Especially when the children are in such a young age they can be influenced very easily.,10
105,This could cause that children try things they`re not made for.,10
106,"And if their parents do not care about what the children are watching or do not teach them how things really are, these children might get problems in their future.",10
107,That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+,10
108,If children are about one to fourteen years old they aren't able to think responsible or make important decissons.,10
109,But this can have negative influences on the young children.,10
110,First of all television advertising isn't something you can allow or not.,11
111,In my opinion the advertisement should not be banned but somehow reduced.,11
112,If the advertisements show bad things such as violence or things which are easy to understand they should not be allowed.,11

118,In my opinion we should allow the advertisement but we should control it.,11
119,"First of all, I think we have to ask ourselfs, what kind of advertisement we want to forbid.",11
120,"Children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product.",12
121,"But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy.",12
122,If they see an advertisement they would love to have that thing and it's difficult for the parents if they are in a store with them and doen't want to buy toy's.,12
123,"Every child wants the newest and coolest toys and keeps nagging their parents to buy it for them, and so most of them do.",12
124,"At this age the children dont have a real own oppinion, which means that if the advertisament say that they need this toy and everybody wants it they think ist true and then they also want this toy.",12
125,Because if the children see all these great toys they want to have it for sure.,12
126,"Children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them.",12
127,"On the one side, it can be really annoying for the parents when their kids see many of advertisements about toys and always want to have stuff.",12
128,"These children see them and then, they want all of the toys and harrass their parents to buy them.",12
129,"First, children are very naÃ¯ve and mostly want to have the ""coolest"" toys.",12
130,In my opinion television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed because these,13
131,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",13

133,In my humble opininon television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.,13
134,In my opininon television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.,13
135,All in all I can say that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because they are too young to understand that they want to sell products.,13
136,Some people say that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.,13
137,In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because of several reasons.,13
138,In my opinion the TV advertising directed towards young children should't be forbidden because of the arguments above.,13
139,"Im my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.",13
140,Television is a big part in our daily lives.,14

150,The goal of those advertisments is making people buy their products.,15
151,It's very important for them to advertise their product but sometimes advertisement is also very manipulative for the people that are confronted with it.,15
152,As we know advertising wants to make us buy products.,15
153,"Actually every advertising has this aim, to make people to want have a product.",15
154,Advertisements want to sell a product.,15
155,On the other side advertisments try to persuade our mind to buy something.,15
156,"Additionally, those advertisments often show, that one might be more included into the society, or in specific peers, when one  chooses to buy this product, which again makes them eager to this product.",15
157,Those advertising can influence their mind and how they will think and act later.,15
158,In order to sell a product many companies are using advertisment to make it look better.,15
159,The advertising has a direct goal: people who buy unnessesary things.,15
160,In the following text I will explain why it should and should not be allowed.,16
161,In my opinon it can be allowed but it is useless.,16
162,"However, I do not see a good reason why it should not be allowed since it does not badly affect anyone.",16
163,"First I like to mention a positive argument, why it should be allowed.",16
164,I think itÂ´s difficult to say whether it should be allowed or not.,16
165,"I think, that it should not  be allowed.",16
166,But if it should be allowed or not is the other question.,16

172,It is better when they play outside with their parents or other young children in their age.,17
173,They should play outside and meet friends and play with them.,17
174,Instead they should play with other kids outside and learn to share and communicate with them.,17
175,They should play outside or play with teir family.,17
176,Their childhood would be better if they'd go outside and play with friends.,17
177,I think the kids should play outside than sitting inside and watching TV or playing with a smartphone.,17
178,Young children will also go more outside and play with there friends games like hide and seek or football.,17
179,Instead they should be playing somwhere outside in the garden with their friends or exploring the nature.,17
180,In the following i am going to discuss whether i agree or disagree with the previous statement.,18
181,"This essay will outline, to what extent one should agree or disagree to this statement.",18
182,"The question of this essay is, if i agree or disagree with the following statement.",18

187,In the following I will discuss this statement.,18
188,In the following I will discuss this statement.,18
189,In  the following text I am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.,18
190,Their minds are not fully developed and are easy to influence.,19
191,What they see on television isn't how the real world works and it might give them wrong ideas.,19
192,However it is a try to influence their parents.,19
193,If they watch TV they can get an idea of what they want.,19
194,On top of that they do not reconize when they are influenced.,19
195,Their state of mind is not that developed to realize such an influence.,19
196,They have expierience and can decide if they want to spend their money on this product or not.,19
197,Another point is that they tend to do what they see.,19
198,They are not capable to differentiate the importance of things in life because they do not have the exprience they need.,19
199,So if the television tells them to like that or do this is has a such a big effect on them because they do not know yet what the main things in the world are.,19
