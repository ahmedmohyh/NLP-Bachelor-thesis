0,Thats the way many people think about the influnce of media like televison on young children.I dont think it should be not allowed but i am not the opinion that its positive for them.,0
1,I think that the channels should not be too influenced by that and that the always have to keep an eye on their children to prevent them from seeing something bad.,0
2,Besides should the media not be directed to so young kids.,0
3,"But I think televison advertisement towards young children cannot be forbidden, because we live in a democratic state, where everybody can publish, what they wrote or filmed.",0
4,But when televison advertisement towards young children is not allowed it doesnÂ´t stop that young children can be manipulated very easily and want most of the things they see.,0
5,"My opinion to this topic is, that televsion  advertising directed to young children should be stopped.",0
6,Also I think that parents have to told their children that it isnÂ´t everything real what they see on tv.,0
7,Television should not be allowed for young children because they would see pictures they don't understand and which are not made for young childs.,0
8,"Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.",0
9,So the companies make much money with these advertising especially at chrismas time.,1
10,"Without the ad about it on television, they maybe would have never known that this special thing existed in the first place, and if the parents decide to give it to them for birthday or christmans, the child will be very happy.",1
11,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,2
12,But often young children can learn something by watching television.,2
13,Nowerdays childreen spend lots of their time watching television.,2
14,"However the television can be nessecary, because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep.",2
15,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,2
16,When they look tv the children are independent of this media so they can't live without watching tv.,2
17,So that Television is an important source for young children for preparing their future life.,2
18,"So in this important time for a child to grow up and learn things they should do it without TV, because it's an lonely live with just watching TV and they need the social links.",2
19,Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.,2
20,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",2
21,my generation ist i think the last who doesnt have phones or something in teir childhood we play outside with our friends and doesnt text over facebook or snapchat.,3
22,All of the younger generations are often seen as the generation of the internet and social media.,3
23,The only generation is the elders generation whom are not used to technology at all.,3
24,"Children get a phone earlier every generation, and with that they have the connection to everything that is out there.",3
25,So the snetence above is mostly to hear form the older generation.,3
26,I'm from the generation where the media got important.,3
27,Now a days a television and the outraging development of the technology is very normal to the young generation and there parent generation.,3
28,The next generations will grow up with this media like its for them such a normal thing.,3
29,But many children nowadays also watch more television instead of playing with their friends.,3
30,"Another good thing about the advertising is, that also the parents see them and might find new toys for their kids.",4
31,"Probably the parents don`t go to a toy shop with their kids very often, so an advertisement is a good way to get to know some playing stuff.",4
32,"And in the advertisin they show the newest and coolest toys and when these young children look at them, they emidiatly whant to have them.",4
33,"When only parents would get advertisements for toys, most of them would not really care about it and they probably would not buy the toy the kid would have chose - especially the more expensive ones.",4
34,"But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy.",4
35,"If a advertisement is really good and adresses the child with - for example - bright coulours and a catching name, the child is most likely going to want the toy or other thing it sees.",4
36,Furthermore getting to know many toys they would like to have by television advertisings could help little children to accept that they won't get everything they wish in their life and that they have to be happy with what they get.,4
37,"Finally, the adverts might want to make a child force their parents to buy a toy for them.",4
38,"Sure, there are other people who say that thats the concept of advertising but most people do not want to buy some things to their children and experience that they donÂ´t use it or play with it.",4
39,Obviously itÂ´s just an easy to make the commercial colorful and interesting so that the young kids get the feeling they despretly need that certain toy.,4
40,"The following text is an essay about the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."".",5
41,This essay is about the topic if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.,5
42,In the following text I will discuss the question if television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not.,5
43,In the following text I am going to write a discussion about the statement if television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.,5
44,The following essay deals with the topic of allowing television advertising for young children from age two to five.,5
45,"I will talk about the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five)should not be allowed"", in the following essay.",5
46,"In the following text i will discuss if ""Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed""
General Television advertising influence of course all of the people,also young people,because the advertise is always shown in a perfect way without faults, because they want that everybody will buy the product,so therefore they will earn a lot of money.When young people see something very special for them on the television, they tell their parents that they want it, but they only want it, because it was shown so perfect and not because they tried it.",5
47,"In the following essay i will show negativ reasons and examples for the statement "" Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"".",5
48,The following text discusses the statement if television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should be allowed or not.,5
49,"A argument on the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",5
50,"The Children might even get unhappy because their parents can not afford what they want, and the Children don't understand why their parents don't buy them what they want because they don't understand the use of money.",6
51,It is important to mention that children do have a say in what their parents buy them.,6
52,Additionaly only the parents know what they can afford and the Children don't think about the price of something they just want it or not.,6
53,"And if the parents have a lot of money and don't care about what they buy in the first place, why not show these children some cool toys on TV to make them happy?",6
54,"Children shouldn't get to know the way, money, beauty and  expensiv stuff in general influence everyone of us and how they affect our daily life.",6
55,At the most time the products are very expensive and the parents do not want it to buy for the children.,6
56,In this case parents have no choice and will buy the thing the children want to have.,6
57,But one the other hand the parents still have to decide what they are going to buy and even if they are letting them watch television.,6
58,But kids should not think they can have everything and those whose parents have not much money should not be shown what they miss.,6
59,"They have also the exercise to teach their kids the handling of money, the use, treatment and importance of things and the moral behind it so that they have the power/need to change their kids minds.",6
60,"On one hand itÂ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children, because the children in the age of two to five canÂ´t say anything about there own opinion, because they are to young to say it.",7
61,I think children maybe donÂ´t want advertising that is directed toward them.,7
62,But there are also some reasons for advertisements towars young children.,7
63,Advertising addressed to young children can create both a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing one's life.,7
64,"Theres another argument against advertisements towards young children: Imagine, you`re a children at age two to five.",7
65,"I can understand that companies direct their advertising towards young children, because in that age, children can be manipulated very easily, and while adults and other children are better able to decide wether they actually need the advertised product, they only care about the great video and not about what the product actually is.",7
66,"So all in all I would say, advertisements for young children are a good thing to get them learn to hear a 'no' and to let their skills grow.",7
67,That`s why there is the problem of advertisements directed toward little children in the age from two to five.,7
68,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",7
69,The companys sponsering the ads could just claim that theyÂ´re not aiming for the younger children.,7
70,"More important, theses adverts influence the children's mind and their psychological development.",8
71,"Furthermore there are some advertisements that might have a positive consequence on children, for example if an ad promotes physical activity, like going outside and playing with friends, although this is quite rarely the case.",8
72,"But the most advertisements are not affecting the children in a negative way, they only make the children want a toy.",8
73,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",8
74,"The people that make the advertisment aim for money, they mainly see their own profit and not the negative influence they have on children.",8
75,Their effect is always hidden as the parents wouldn't allow their kids to buy the advertised product.,8
76,"They also do not know about the risks in our society and whether something is good or bad, because they are just at the begining of their developement.",9
77,"Although children cannot decide what is good and what is bad for them, they have opinions.",9
78,But children especially young children don't know.,9
79,They also do not have this critical thinking of things that adults have.,9
80,Children who are that young don't know how to compromise it.,9
81,"And if they weren`t confronted by advertisements and the `no` of their parents, they never learn it.",9
82,"Furthermore, children cannot make own decisions yet, they are controlled by their parents or adults in general.",9
83,"Also, they do not really have the chance to have or to build an own opinion, because they are too young.",9
84,"They only think ""they are small, they don't think, they understand nothing in their age"" and for them it doesn't matter how they feel.",9
85,But on the other hand they are just kids and so they would be totally influenced by this.,9
86,But an important thing is also that there are lots of educating movies and series which help the children to live or preparing their life.,10
87,"The kids have to whatch films and series to learn also from them , who made for the children, but they dont have to have a Television for him or herself.",10
88,But often young children can learn something by watching television.,10
89,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,10
90,Furthermore more many child series and movies on TV teach many life lessons so that the children will be prepared for life and their social life.,10
91,"For instance, there are many shows on the TV that are especially for very young children and that try to teach them something by having fun which can be very effective.",10
92,"ItÂ´s better to show them, how to handle with television or games or something like that, because the children are learning for their lifes and not just for the moment.",10
93,The coming and existing media will open new and in a few things much easier oppurtunities to get something in mind of a young kid.,10
94,For example once a week an doumentation which is specially made for young children is good to learn something and learn what the TV is.,10
95,"Many television channels have learn programms for children, where children can learn for example languages or easy vocabulary.",10
96,"All in all it is a exercise for all of us to find a good way to handle this situation, because the technology will improve and improve and there will be more and more companies using this way of advertising.",11
97,Eventually I think that it really depends on what sort of advertisement it is and what product is getting advertised.,11
98,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",12
99,"On the one hand, children are constantly confronted with all sorts of advertising, as they watch television.",12
100,"Also children donÂ´t know the risks of television advertising, they have to learn it when they will grow up.",12
101,To come to a conclusion I am of the oppinion that with the right leading from the parents even young children could navigate through the jungle of television advertising and they will learn how to deal with it.,12
102,"To put it briefly, television advertising can be dangerous for children since they cannot decide what is good or bad for them.",12
103,On the one hand a confrontation with this kind of advertising could be bad on the other hand children can only learn from it if they are confronted with it and learn to spectate advertising from other perspectives.,12
104,But there are many problems if children see advertisments which are focused on them.,12
105,"A lot of children may not be even able to understand advertising in normal television, so they would be rather nerved as influenced.",12
106,On the one hand young children have to learn how to deal with advertising.,12
107,Even young children are used to listen and see advertising.,12
108,That is why the profit of companies selling for example toys would rise.,13
109,Their health and happyness would suffer and the profit of the industry is not worth it.,13
110,"There are no convincing arguments for this ponit and I am sure, that this is never going to happen, because it doesn't make any sense at all.",13
111,"The value of one product gets less, because of the high onsume.",13
112,In addition children would only see the product and what they are worth.,13
113,That mean that compernies can make a lot of money with the slots for this Add's .,13
114,In this case parents have no choice and will buy the thing the children want to have.,13
115,So adults are choosing more wisely which product they can effort and which not.,13
116,On the other hand advertising could be an bad influence either.,13
117,They also wouldnÂ´t know the value of these things.,13
118,In the following I will discuss this statement.,14
119,All in all I donÂ´t really agree or disagree with the statement.,14
120,In my opinion i agree with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples.,14
121,First i will write the argument against the statement.,14
122,Finally I agree with the statement.,14
123,Now i will count on some arguments for the statement.,14
124,For this reason I disagree with the statement.,14
125,In  the following text I am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.,14
126,All together i would agree with this statement.,14
127,"So all in all, I agree at some parts with the statement, but not at all.",14
128,There are several reasons why television advertising toward young children should or should not be allowed.,15
129,But there are also some convincing arguments against showing young children advertisings on TV.,15
130,But on the other hand there are also arguments for television advertising toward young children not to be allowed.,15
131,There are a few different reasons why television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.,15
132,"The last argument against ads directed toward young children is  
In my opinion the advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because the companies should not use young children in that way to get more money.",15
133,Another argument against advertising directed to children is that it might not be worth it for some companies to direct it to children.,15
134,Another example why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed is that those children can choos which products they want to use or which toys they want to play with.,15
135,"On the one hand, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it's unhealthy for them to whatch television too often since that could cause that they don't move enough.",15
136,"There are arguments for and against the prohibition of television advertising directed toward younger children, which I will summarize and analyze in the following text .",15
137,"On the other hand, television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because it's very interesting for them because they can learn something.",15
138,That is the normal reason to produce advertisings.,16
139,Besides they are confronted with advertising anyways for example in the supermarket or the streets or magazines.,16
140,There are different reasons either supporting this advertising or not.,16
141,So they can inspire their selfe with the advertising.,16
142,Besides they do not care about the advertising and would not understand the background reasons for it.,16
143,There are some people who say that this kind of advertising should not be allowed.,16
144,"If that is not enough reason, one could also claim that companies should have the right to advertise.",16
145,Do they need advertises directed to them or does it has a negative effect on them?,16
146,"So should, as a consequence, this advertising be forbidden?",16
147,Advertsing is too big in the society today.,16
148,the smartphone.,17
149,I'm lucky that I had a childhood without a phone or a computer - all these things were something my parents didn't allowed me to play with.,17
150,"In our generation it is normal that children have a mobile phone and a ""I pad"" or something like this.",17
151,In the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices.,17
152,"Children get a phone earlier every generation, and with that they have the connection to everything that is out there.",17
153,Young children get up with new smartphones or other things.,17
154,And in our society it is not unusal to play with smartphones even at an young age.,17
155,You can see what phones and computer did to them.,17
156,"Now, when I see all these five-graders with a cellphone bigger than their heads, I'm happy my parents forced me to play outside.",17
157,"They want to use computers, smartphones and tablets etc.",17
158,"On the other hand children are learning very much in this part of life, so the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products.",18
159,"Its much more important that young children learn something in books or outside then watching television advertising just made for them and in the young age its easier to get in that children mind and to let them think what they should think about ther product, so that they want to buy it or the parents should buy it and when they dont buy it the young children are sad.",18
160,"The advertisement could also show the children the variety of items and make them understand, that they don't need everything that's shown in the commercials, but I think that they are just too young to judge.",18
161,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",18
162,Children should decide themselves what they want and advertising helps them to gain information about the things they could possibly need.,18
163,"The ads are perhaps the best way to get to know new products, and I think the children deserve to sometimes (not always!)",18
164,"The Children probably don't even understand the television advertisment, but the parents like the advertisment more when it is a well made advertisment.",18
165,These advertisements are created and designed for one purpose only: They're supposed to persuade children to want the product bad enough to beg their parents to buy it.,18
166,"The people that make the advertisment aim for money, they mainly see their own profit and not the negative influence they have on children.",18
167,"I can understand that companies direct their advertising towards young children, because in that age, children can be manipulated very easily, and while adults and other children are better able to decide wether they actually need the advertised product, they only care about the great video and not about what the product actually is.",18
168,"They will then ask their parent to buy it, but a lot of parents cannot spend as much money at toys even if they want to.",19
169,Some parents will maybe buy the toys and then do not have enough money left for other things.,19
170,and if the parents are smart they will tell them that they do not need it so the parents will not buy it.,19
171,"And while they usually are not able to actually buy these things, they are often able to heavily influence their parents when insistin on wanting to have something.",19
172,"And if the parents have a lot of money and don't care about what they buy in the first place, why not show these children some cool toys on TV to make them happy?",19
173,"Often the parents won't allow them buying those things, but when children get confronted with this ""cool stuff"" their friends in kindergarten may have, they get sad and won't be part of the group.",19
174,It might be possible that they donÂ´t even want some of the things shown in the advertisement but beg their parents anyways just because theyÂ´ve seen it on TV.,19
175,"Especially around christmas are toys advertised very much, because the people need presents for their families and friends and when a child see toys and books and computer games everywhere it's not surprising that asks it's parents for more than one christmas present.",19
176,The children really want to have the product and might annoy their parents until they buy it.,19
177,"One cannot forget though, that children aged two to five may not have a sense for rational thinking or are conscious about money's worth at all, so they might see some completely useless and easily breakable item on TV, which they then want to have for christmas.",19
178,So how is there any difference.,20
179,One reason for this is that young children don't have the experience to see if a product of their favour is useful or useless for them.,21
180,"Children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them.",21
181,Another point ist that when young kids see advertisment about new products everyday they will not be satisfied about what they have because they always see that there are new and better products.,21
182,An other negative point is that the childrens aren't abled to judge things regarding their quality or the need of it.,21
183,The most important one is that the kids can be manipulated into buying things they see.,21
184,"Additionally children can't even realize, when they are getting baited by a company, so that it is up to the parents to explain why a particular product is not as good as portraied in the TV, which most of the time can't be understood by children, which might lead to some sort of unhappiness.",21
185,"It leads to different behavior of your childreen, as they want more and more because they get to see the newest and hottest toys erveryday, that is why soner or later nothing will be good enough for them anymore.",21
186,Another argument is the industry that produces toys and other things for young children.,21
187,Forthermore the childrens often dont need the object.,21
188,"Its much more important that young children learn something in books or outside then watching television advertising just made for them and in the young age its easier to get in that children mind and to let them think what they should think about ther product, so that they want to buy it or the parents should buy it and when they dont buy it the young children are sad.",21
189,Personally I think that the Television advertising directly towards young children should not be allowed because the children are in they own developement aged two to five.,22
190,"I agree with the following statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",22
191,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",22
192,"So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should not be allowed, because in this age children started making their first social contacts, which is very impotant for their growing up.",22
193,All in all I would say that I donÂ´t agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because I think that there is nothing to worry about if  little children come in contact with television advertisements.,22
194,"So I think that television advertising toward young children should be not allowed, because they are too young and can be manipulate.",22
195,"On the one hand, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it's unhealthy for them to whatch television too often since that could cause that they don't move enough.",22
196,In my opinion television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed.,22
197,"I think that television advertising that is directed towards young Children should not be allowed, but young Children should not watch much television and the parents should control what their Children watch.",22
198,"In the following I tell you my oppinion of the question, if Television advertising directed toward young children between two to five years shuold not be allowed.",22
199,In my oppinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed.,23
200,The advertising in television should be regulate from the people who make the TV-program.,23
201,advertising should be stoped but  thats impossible because the concerns are too big and cannot be stoped.,23
202,In order to answer the question as to whether or not such tv ads should be banned or not the companies' perspectives should also be taken into consideration.,23
203,"So all in all i say, that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed.",23
204,"So no, it should not be a law or a rule for all channels to not show advertising.",23
205,Giving attention to both sides we can conclude that tv advertising should not be banned.,23
206,"On the one hand, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it's unhealthy for them to whatch television too often since that could cause that they don't move enough.",23
207,"So all in one I think that the Television advertising should be allowed, but those who make the children learn something they shouldnÂ´t learn shouldnÂ´t be allowed.",23
208,These advertisements should not be allowed to see in the Television befor eight at night.,23
209,The poblem with this is that the children cant imagin that its not real what they see.,24
210,For example that little girls could think that unicorns and elves are real because they saw that in TV.,24
211,"For example if a child sees a plastic horse on TV running around and jumping, it would think, that this horse is really able to do that, but it is not.",24
212,Many pograms aren't real but the children watch them and think they want do the same.,24
213,Another aspect is that children believe in everything what they see.,24
214,Also I think that parents have to told their children that it isnÂ´t everything real what they see on tv.,24
215,"But it is normal for kids to believe in things that aren't real, like princesses or fairytales.",24
216,On the one hand the children are so small that they aren't able to reconize the fact that they get manipulated plus the fact that is pretty easy to do it because they don't have th ability to reflect things.,24
217,In the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices.,25
218,We are living in a world where technology affects our daily life and where we are dependent on it.,25
219,"They want to use computers, smartphones and tablets etc.",25
220,"If parents are trusting and caring with the fact that their kids use a technological product and a thing that can make ""abhÃ¤ngig""(?",25
221,But it's important that - especially today - someone watches more over the technological use from children.,25
222,"We live in the 21th century, the century where electronic stuff and internet media gets more and more important.",25
223,You have to know how to handle the modern development of technic in our world and not to allow something is not the right way.,25
224,but is it ok to give that high technology devices to children aged two to five?,25
225,In the future there will be more and more technology and we can not forbidm the children to not live that life.,25
226,The children in the age two to five get up too with the new technoligy.,25
227,"They use young children, who might never had contact to any kind of media before, just to make money.",26
228,"On the positive side of advertising stands the fact that companies make a lot money from the parents which got affected by their children to buy them their toys, candy, and so on.",27
229,So they believe in wrong things and regard lies as true.,28
230,They believe almost everything.,28
231,They are unenlightened and do not question absolutes.,28
232,The persons give us a wrong point of view.,28
233,It teaches wrong ideas of living in abundance and owning everything.,28
234,First of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us.,29
235,In the end I can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 2-5 must be allowed to interfier with that.,29
236,So that Television is an important source for young children for preparing their future life.,29
237,"I think that it is important for young children watching television but it is important what they watch and how long, because they need conversation with other persons and activitys.",29
238,"Young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but itÂ´s not the right way, I think.",29
239,Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.,29
240,"However the television can be nessecary, because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep.",29
241,"The main thing, that is important is the bad influence by television for too young children, so it could exists problems in future, which are developed by the television.",29
242,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,29
243,It does not mean that television makes you child uncreative or stupid but showing your child how to handle all these unreal and given impressions is important for his/ her following development.,29
244,The parents have the chance to decide what the child does and what is bought in the end.,30
245,Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.,30
246,"By far the best point to make is that no matter what the child wants, no matter how sad it will get, everything is always up to the parents.",30
247,"The parents have to decide, what is the best for their children.",30
248,So the parents can control their children nevertheless.,30
249,"Furthermore, children cannot make own decisions yet, they are controlled by their parents or adults in general.",30
250,But one the other hand the parents still have to decide what they are going to buy and even if they are letting them watch television.,30
251,"Parents should make sure that their children grows up with things, which are important fot theier future.",30
252,"The position of parents is so important for children, because they learn from them and act like them.",30
253,So it is actually the parents' duty to raise their kinds sensible to what they are seeing or hearing.,30
254,"Older children, like with the age of five or six or elder, it is of course right and possible to watch television with a time, which is given by the parents, so that the cildren can watch a serie for one hour and then itÂ´s finished for this day.",31
255,"After the kindergarden or school, if they finished their homeworks or other things which they have to do, it`s okay to watch tv in a cutted time.",31
256,As you can see there are a lot of times where they do not have time watch TV so they shopuld have a time where they are allowed to watch there series or there favorite movie.,31
257,The best way is when the parents regulate the watching time and also what they watch!,31
258,"However the television can be nessecary, because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep.",31
259,"If parents know what's good for there children, they can say how long they're allowed to watch.",31
260,"All in one I think it`s okay, that children watch tv in a small part of time, if they don`t forget to do important things for school and playing outside with their friends.",31
261,"Additionally they need the time to play outside and experiance the world and they can't do that because the TV is always more interrestic for young children, it' normal.",31
262,So the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people.,32
263,ItÂ´s better for them to play in the kindergarten or to play with their mum.,32
264,"The age of two to five is the time for children in the kindergarden and there they learn how to behave with other kids, so it's important not to destroy this at home.",32
265,Young children must play with other friends and should not sit at home to watch television.,32
266,I disagree with this statement because young children aged of two to five should be learn to play with other children at their age.,32
267,"For example, children with the age of two to five should reed some books or play games like football.",32
268,But in the age of two to five it is very important to have social contact to other people in their age.,32
269,Children in this age should go outside and enjoy their childhood and do not sit inside infront of the television or other media.,32
270,So the relationship to other children is better when the children play with other children.,32
271,The children without playimg with other children don't know the contact with others.,32
272,"They might even become angry at them, throwing a tantrum if they want something really bad.",33
273,They are simply very easy to impress which makes them making desicions about spending money they don't have and can cause a lot of frustration if they don't get it.,33
274,They would want to have everything and that is a bad thing for our society in general because it should be all about what you think and how happy you are and not about owning every toy or all the money you can get.,33
275,"They must accept, that they cannot have everything.",33
276,"So they want almost everything they see, and they get it, because theyÂ´ll bag for it until they get what they want.",33
277,They also wouldnÂ´t know the value of these things.,33
278,"get what they want, even if it is not the best thing to buy.",33
279,They cant think of the consequences of their own acting and if they see something they like they want it.,33
280,They will annoy their parents to buy this thing.,33
281,In this age they are  already able to show us what they want.,33
282,But there is also the other side of the problem.,34
283,But it's also important to think about the consequences.,34
284,One decision must lead to other decisions as well.,34
285,BUt,34
286,And that could be even worse.,34
287,And that might be a problem as many criticers say.,34
288,But there has to be a limit.,34
289,but there are also prospects.,34
290,"Also there is the chance, e.g.",34
291,But that is only guessed.,34
292,But on the other hand the parents are still deciding what they are going buy and if they are letting them watch television at all and in the most cases the children have to accept their decision.,35
293,But one the other hand the parents still have to decide what they are going to buy and even if they are letting them watch television.,35
294,"So I think, that the parents have to chose if there children are allowed to have a Television.",35
295,"On the other hand we could say that it is part of the parentÂ´s job to decide if and what their children watch in the TV, to give them the right values.",35
296,But we can decide wich shows and programs our child should watch.,35
297,"Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.",35
298,"Nowdays, advertising is a normal part of the television.",36
299,Television advertising has a big role in modern society.,36
300,Television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society.,36
301,"But advertisement is a allday thing so if they would not see it on the TV they would see it in the streets, radio and big city.",36
302,"On the other side, advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television.",36
303,"
Advertises are often shown in the TV.",36
304,"Tv channels also make a lot money with advertising too, which is also a good thing.",36
305,Nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches TV.,36
306,I am agree with this Statement because the televison advertising have many negatives effects.,36
307,This could  be the reason why we create televion advertising.,36
308,"Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.",37
309,"But they should keep in mind that if they don't watch it between the ages of 2 and 5, they might watch it after that, and for sure parents can't keep an eye on everything their children see; the modern world is just too full of that, not even on tv but also at the streets, radio or newspapers.",37
310,"Furthermore, the parents have to have an eye on their children if they watch TV.",37
311,Every parent should decide if he lets his child watching things  which can be dangerous for the development of his own child.,37
312,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",37
313,The parents have to keep an eye on their children to protect them against too much television advertising and television consume.,37
314,The parents should care about the time their child is sitting in front of a TV and if the child is watching something that is meant to be for his age.,37
315,I think that the channels should not be too influenced by that and that the always have to keep an eye on their children to prevent them from seeing something bad.,37
316,If parents don't watch over them they don't stop watching the TV.,37
317,"If parents know what's good for there children, they can say how long they're allowed to watch.",37
318,Chrismas is coming but their is no idea.,38
319,"In this chapter of their life, they normally have to play outside with friends and don`t have to sit in their room and watch tv.",39
320,"The parents try to get them back to the old times, like playing in the garden or reading a book.",39
321,"In this case, they would spend more time inside the house and not in the nature playing with their friends.",39
322,So the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people.,39
323,"Just ten years back in the past the young children went outside to meet the nature and learn things about it, they played outside and had toys to understand some first easy things.",39
324,"I share the opinion that children in this chapter of their life, have to play outside.",39
325,In the past the children go outside an play with other children.,39
326,"For so many children its too difficult to learn, that parents often don`t allow them to be outside until 9pm or like in this discussion, buying some playing stuff (from the advertisements) for them.",39
327,"Some of them does not know the old classics like playing outside ""I build my one garden"" or games which have to do with fantasy and your own imagination.",39
328,They can do better things in that age like playing games outside.,40
329,but arent they too young for that?,40
330,They will become an adult fastly enough.,40
331,But only children who are older than four should do this.,40
332,Later in life they'll watch a lot of tv and in childhood they shouldn't spend their time with this.,40
333,Children should not think that alcohol is as cool as it is getting presented.,40
334,"Maybe they could watch tv but not the hole day and not when the weather is goog and you go outside ,but when the weather is bad an you donÂ´t can go outside you musst play with your  playtoies and when he is older he know a litle bit what is good and what is bad.",40
335,But if the parents stay cool and maybe ignore the children while they are crying they will soon stop doing it.,41
336,The children get irritated and don't know how to react.,41
337,"He saw an advertising where this happend and the solution was that the child hurt the other one, and that is not ok.",41
338,You have to think how little children feel aswell but not many persons do that.,41
339,They could look at the reaction of ther children.,41
340,"The children have no other choice than accepting this, except for begging or crying.",41
341,But if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine.,41
342,"A situation for example for this is when a child is sad because another child took his car for playing away, so the kid is really sad and donÂ´t know what he could do.",41
343,"But when they donÂ´t do this, their children start crying and behave absolutly stupid.",41
344,"In reallife the kid who is sad, because he want his car back, knows that he can hurt the other one to get his car.",41
345,"The Children probably don't even understand the television advertisment, but the parents like the advertisment more when it is a well made advertisment.",42
346,"The most children are not interested in this advertsing and do not watch them, so that it is unnessecary to produce television advertising directed to young children, then they do not see them.",42
347,But in my opinion they should keep the amount of advertisements they show between kids TV channels to a minimum and they should also just play the advertisement at the end of a show so the kid does not get interrupted by it and as a result watches all the advertisements while waiting the show to go on.,42
348,"But I think children are very easy to manipulate, so on some tv channels for children there isnÂ´t television advertising.",42
349,In my opinion advertising should be banned out of childfriendly TV and they should also renew and think about what they show in this kind of TV and if this might be realy childfrtiendly.,42
350,The reason for that is that the television advertise directly toward young children.,42
351,"Its much more important that young children learn something in books or outside then watching television advertising just made for them and in the young age its easier to get in that children mind and to let them think what they should think about ther product, so that they want to buy it or the parents should buy it and when they dont buy it the young children are sad.",42
352,Advertising on channels who are made for kids are something else - the way the product is getting presented will be a lot more interesting for a kid than for an adult.,42
353,All in all I wouldn't allowed advertising in Tv for young children becouse of the strong aspects meanshen earlyer.,42
354,Not many children watch television at the age of two or donÂ´t understand the content of the advertisement.,42
355,I remember the happiness i've felt when my father gave me his phone for a minute or when my parents said that I can watch a movie that's longer than forty-five minutes.,43
356,I also remember me having fun to go outside and not having to worry about an television advertisement.,43
357,"When I was 5 years old I`d love to play with my friends or with my babyborn.Furthermore, I do not even really now what happens around the world or what televison can be.",43
358,For example songs that you will remember even four weeks later or situations out of daily life.,43
359,Think about your childhood ?,43
360,And sometimes you even feel like you want to be a little kid again just to be able to try all these brand-new amazing things.,43
361,Furthermore it is brilliant to see how happy kids can get just by watching the little clip of maybe just 10 seconds.,43
362,"We learn the most in this years, and if we get anything we want, if our parents always buy our favourite candy at the groucery; we learn that it is normal to get anything we want, and that it is normal to always get and eat our favourite candy.",43
363,"The parents try to get them back to the old times, like playing in the garden or reading a book.",43
364,"Me and my family always enjoyed it and I want this for other families, too.",43
365,"I think comercials for children should be limited, and controlled.",44
366,"At this moment, I totally agree with this statement and it should not be allowed, everything else is to much for this children.",44
367,"In my opinion, people should not have the urge to protect children from everything.",44
368,"This means that children are manipulated more and more often, and in my opinion that should not be allowed.",44
369,In my opinion it should be not allowed to show TV advertisments for children between two and five.,44
370,In the future there will be more and more technology and we can not forbidm the children to not live that life.,44
371,In my opinion parents have to - especially nowadays - be stricter with children or young teenager.,44
372,"Someone may take this to an extreme and say that kids' childish natures are being abused, which is highly questionable from a moralic point of view.",44
373,That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+,44
374,"I think televesion towards young children in the age from two to five should not be allowed, because children in that age can be manipulated very easily.",44
375,The children would grow up with wrong information before they could understand the truth of the television and its consequences on their.,45
376,That would also help the children that they dont need to watch bad Tv.,45
377,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,45
378,There future lives could be mainly destroyed or would stay on the lies of the television.,45
379,So it wouldnÂ´t make a difference at all for the children themselves just for the TV channels to reorganize the programm.,45
380,This could  be the reason why we create televion advertising.,45
381,So responsibl parents shold act in a way not let their children whatch all of this ''junk'' TV.,45
382,"A good point is, that some kind of them show news for children, so they can understand it, or show some series with animals.",45
383,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,45
384,Advertising is one of the main money makers for channels and it would be a really hard challenge for some of the smaller ones to keep showing the same content as before.,45
385,Another point ist that there is not just advertisment on television but also in the shops or by games on smartphones.,46
386,In my opinion too much television or advertising is bad for young children.,47
387,It is not good when young children watch too much television.,47
388,I disagree with this statement because it is not bad if little child seeing television advertising in this age but they should not watch it so often.,47
389,"To put it briefly, television advertising can be dangerous for children since they cannot decide what is good or bad for them.",47
390,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",47
391,Not everybody sees that as negativ because a lot of people doesnt believe that children for example aged two to five understand the things they see.Many parents cant even imagine that many aspects while the growing process can have an influence on the futured personality of the kids.For me its the biggest problem in todays community and forbiding of television andvertising directed to to the young children wouldnt be a solution for the probmlem.,47
392,"In this case you have to know that television advertising can be negative for the growing up of little children because in many television advertising, there are bad stuff.",47
393,In my oppinion it is not good for young children to watch television advertising directed toward young children.,47
394,"Young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but itÂ´s not the right way, I think.",47
395,Especially young children are getting easily influenced by television.,47
396,Sometimes it is hard to connect working and having a family.,48
397,In the following I will present my opinion on this topic.,49
398,In the following text I am going to explain some arguments in favour and against the topic to get an answer.,49
399,For me its hard to judge about this because i never thought so intensiv about this topic.,49
400,In  the following text I am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.,49
401,In this essay I am going to give some arguments pro and contra this topic.,49
402,Despite having taken the negative aspects into consideration the opposing side should have jusgt as much attention.,49
403,This is a well discused question and in the following I try to answer it.,49
404,All in all it could have two sides of view.,49
405,"On this question is based the following text, which shows advantages and disadvantages  including my personal opinion.",49
406,In the following I will discuss this statement.,49
407,"So I think advertisement for children sould not be allowed, when it is affecting them in a negative way and sets them under a bad influence.",50
408,The question is if this advertising should be forbidden because of the influence that it could take on young children.,50
409," For the question, if the advertising directed toward young children shoul not be allowed, you can think on some opinions for and against it.",50
410,"To conclude, I think, these advertisements should not be allowed, because for the children, there is no benefit.",50
411,"On the one side it should be allowed to show such as these advertisments, because the children are more informed, what is in trend and can compare with other children.",50
412,"All in all, adverts for children aged from two to five shouldn't be allowed because of their negative effects on the children.",50
413,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",50
414,"Because these children are usually at a very young age, it is discussed whether to ban these ads or not.",50
415,"May one can say that advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, because it is allowed to be directed toward everyone in every age.",50
416,"But as just mentioned, it's the quality of the advertisement that really matters, thus instead of wanting to prohibit them all, one should rather ask for more appropriate ads, that don't damage young children in any way.",50
417,"But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy.",51
418,"Children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product.",51
419,"Especially kids at a very yound age really want to have a toy, then play with it for a while before loosing interest.",51
420,"And if they parents don't look up details about that item and just trust their child because it makes it happy, the child might end up with a broken toy, which will make them even more sad.",51
421,"As they can be influenced so easily, they also might want to have every new toy they see on TV and rather look at these new things on the TV, than go out and play with the toys they already own.",51
422,"Children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them.",51
423,"And in the advertisin they show the newest and coolest toys and when these young children look at them, they emidiatly whant to have them.",51
424,"That is a problem because parents do not want unhappy childreen and then they have to say to their child, he would not get the toy.",51
425,Furthermore getting to know many toys they would like to have by television advertisings could help little children to accept that they won't get everything they wish in their life and that they have to be happy with what they get.,51
426,"And if the parents have a lot of money and don't care about what they buy in the first place, why not show these children some cool toys on TV to make them happy?",51
427,Young children can be influenced easily.,52
428,Young children can be easiliy influenced by everything.,52
429,"First of all it is well-known that little children are heavily influenced by their surroundings, so that they can get manipulated easily as well.",52
430,Children can also be influenced more easily by different things.,52
431,At this age of confusing realizations children can be manipulated very easily.,52
432,"At first children, especially at a very young age, are very easy to influence.",52
433,"In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life.",52
434,Young children are very easy to control and to influence.,52
435,That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+,52
436,Another aspect is that children believe in everything what they see.,52
437,On the one hand there are arguments against such a law.,53
438,"But I think, you canÂ´t say no with a law, so itÂ´s difficult to handle with this topic.",53
439,A law against it could be understood as resistance against the money-ruled society we have got today.,53
440,Finally i think it should be stoped but its impossible.,53
441,We can not ban all posters and magazines.,53
442,"Likewise, I agree with the point that it should not be allowed.",53
443,Especially young children are getting easily influenced by television.,54
444,When they look tv the children are independent of this media so they can't live without watching tv.,54
445,Firstly children get influence by television.,54
446,Espacilly younger children get influenced a lot by these media.,54
447,Most of children watch television so they are at their own.,54
448,"Young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but itÂ´s not the right way, I think.",54
449,These young children are very naive and so it is very hard for them to understand what is the truth and what is not in the TV.,54
450,Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.,54
451,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",54
452,Many children spend too much time on watching TV.,54
453,Because they are unenlightened they obey what the growns ups say.,55
454,"Maybe they would even be easier influenced by populists than other persons if They did not learn howe to say :""No!""",55
455,They controll our childreen.,55
456,That is why they can be manipulated very easily.,55
457,"But when they donÂ´t do this, their children start crying and behave absolutly stupid.",55
458,"And if it cries because they wont, then it will have to learn its' lesson.",55
459,She wouldn't talk about this doll and her mother wouldn't be in despair.,56
460,"But what if the mother of the girl is so poor, she works everyday to be able to buy food and has no money for that doll?",56
461,"The doll can even talk and dance, but that is why she is so expensive.",56
462,The girls wants the doll so bad that the mother doesn't know how to react.,56
463,"It sounds harsh but we have to accept that there are people in the world that will use us, they will manipulate us.",57
464,We also seem to be in a battle with other people.,57
465,"There is a new advertisement on the TV showing something really nice, you are going to get the feeling of really wanting to be owner of this.",58
466,"In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life.",59
467,At the young age of three or four children are starting to develope the conciousness about themself.,59
468,The development in this young age is very importent.,59
469,Children aged two to five years start to speak and to create their own personality.,59
470,For children the ages two to five are the most important year of development.,59
471,The age of two to five is the most important time of the life of a children because they learn so much about the life and deleope in a fast time.,59
472,The developement of a child in this age is,59
473,Children in these years are in an important part of  their life.,59
474,But an important thing is also that there are lots of educating movies and series which help the children to live or preparing their life.,59
475,They learn speaking and walking and a lot of other important things.,59
476,But is this right?,60
477,But is that right?,60
478,"This is sad and depressing, isn`t ist?",60
479,"When they do not spend much time with their parents, when they are young it will have aftermath, when they are adults.",61
480,"So that there are also bad influences, what have follows for the future life of these children.",61
481,So they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour.,61
482,They need influences of their parents and of other kids.,61
483,If they don't learn that early they may have problems with it later.,61
484,"If they don't learn this, they could have problems in their life.",61
485,It stress the parents and it could destroy the entership between the family and friends.,61
486,"They will also not have a good relation to their parents, because they did not spend much time with them, when they were young.",61
487,"They also do not know about the risks in our society and whether something is good or bad, because they are just at the begining of their developement.",61
488,The reason is that they are in contact with others and that's better for their future.,61
489,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",62
490,In my view young children aged two to five should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents.,62
491,But watching too much TV in general is not advisable for young children because they should play outside and think for their own instead of just getting their stories delivered through the TV.,62
492,"Young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but itÂ´s not the right way, I think.",62
493,In the end I can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 2-5 must be allowed to interfier with that.,62
494,In my opinion young children should generally just spend a small amount of time watching television.,62
495,"All in one I think it`s okay, that children watch tv in a small part of time, if they don`t forget to do important things for school and playing outside with their friends.",62
496,Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.,62
497,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,62
498,"Children shouldnÂ´t watch tv often in that age, thatÂ´s clearly.",62
499,As a consequence they need to agree with the advertising or at least to believe it is true.,63
500,They do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use - convincing people to buy the product.,63
501,But advertisement also creates a wrong image of reality.,63
502,"They will believe everything they are told and by that are easy to manipulate, so that they want to buy all the products the commercial is showing.",63
503,Advertisment can be developed in a way that may have a hidden influence on their opinion later.,63
504,In addition to that I can say that advertisements are rarely showing the truth.,63
505,Besides they are confronted with advertising anyways for example in the supermarket or the streets or magazines.,63
506,One stong arguement againt advertising towards young children is that they don't realise this manipulation.,63
507,"On the other side, advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television.",63
508,"So if they watch TV, an advertisement could easily make them want to have the product shown in the advert.",63
509,"There are some good points, but also many bad ones for the children.",64
510,"But as always there are some disadvantages and some advantages, for the children, their parents and those buisneses.",64
511,"So, firstly the positive thing is that the children can learn something about the world very early and they do not need to talk to their parents or read a book but thats really sad, for me.",64
512,Furthermore the parents could prepare their kids.,64
513,It is the best way to prepare kids for the future.,64
514,So the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people.,64
515,"On the other hand the young children need fresh air and the conversation with parents or friends, wehn the children watching Tv all day, they are allone and haven't activity.",64
516,This is an easy way for these kids to get some general knowledge and gives there parents some time to do other things then working or having a look at what there child is doing.,64
517,Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.,64
518,So the children may know what will happend in an older age.,64
519,"So they want almost everything they see, and they get it, because theyÂ´ll bag for it until they get what they want.",65
520,"If they watching theese ads theyre just like ""Oh mama i want this"".",65
521,and for them it seems to be the best thing in the world.,65
522,Having seen an interesting ad about a toy for example can have them begging for it.,65
523,They also can't tell if it's worth the prize of it.,65
524,They see this toy is the best and they want it.,65
525,They just need to switch it on and they are in a new world where they can see what they want and expriance what they want.,65
526,It might be possible that they donÂ´t even want some of the things shown in the advertisement but beg their parents anyways just because theyÂ´ve seen it on TV.,65
527,They do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use - convincing people to buy the product.,65

537,"But as always there are some disadvantages and some advantages, for the children, their parents and those buisneses.",66
538,"If they decide not to buy something, their kid will just forget about it after a while (we've all been there) and everything's just fine.",67
539,But if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine.,67
540,Therefore it is possibly the best way to find a way between getting your childreen some of the goods but not always and when ever they want.,67
541,"On the other hand, if the kids stay nice and quiet, they might have the chance to get the thing they want for christmas.",67
542,"By far the best point to make is that no matter what the child wants, no matter how sad it will get, everything is always up to the parents.",67
543,"The Children might even get unhappy because their parents can not afford what they want, and the Children don't understand why their parents don't buy them what they want because they don't understand the use of money.",67
544,"This is not just bad for the atmosphere in the family itself, but could also affect the childs mental health, if they feel like they never ever get what they want the most.",67
545,"On the other hand, if the parents take care of them and pay attention, the children will not get any problems, but they will have fun with their new toy or other things.",67
546,The kids might be sad if their parents decide not to give these items to them.,67

554,"Nowdays, advertising is a normal part of the television.",68
555,In the television there are several different ways of advertising for a product or an campaign.,68
556,Almost everything has its own advertise.,68
557,That is the normal reason to produce advertisings.,68
558,Our whole society is about buying and selling - consuming.,69
