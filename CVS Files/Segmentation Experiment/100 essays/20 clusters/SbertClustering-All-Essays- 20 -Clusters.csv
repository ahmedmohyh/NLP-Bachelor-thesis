0,"should it not be allowed to produce television advertising  at the age between two and five
on this question is based the following text which shows ",8
1,"  including my personal opinion

first the main time a person is watching tv is during the evening
some people ",17
2," they want to have a short sleep
at this times a child aged  even sleeps too or it is playing with friends ",19
3," that the child can not see advertsisings
however the television can be nessecary because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep 
but during such a movie there is not more than one time advertising 
the most children are not interested in this advertsing and do not watch them ",5
4, that it is unnessecary to produce television advertising directed  ,8
5," they do not see them
the most important ",14
6, is that children aged  will never understand television advertising ,12
7," you show toys or pets because they do not know the reason of advertising

at my own opinion ",11
8," say that television advertising for young children can be allowed but it is not nessecary because they do not watch much films 
besides they do not care about the advertising and would not understand the background reasons for it  

",8
9,"in the following text ill discuss the statement about the programm of television which is directed to very young children by the age of 

for me itâ´s an important theme to talk about because the medias in our time can be very dangerous for the developement of children and ",17
10," teenagers but in this moment the age of the young chldren is important for the statement
",19
11, television is something which is fun and free time for you but it ,17
12," can change your opinion about some topics and meanings which you have
young children are very influenced by everythingwhich they see and hear ",4
13, the television can be dangerous or bad for them but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias but itâ´s not the right way ,17
14,"
itâ´s better to show them how to handle with television or games or something like that because the children are learning for their lifes and not just for the moment

in the statement itâ´s described that very young children from the age  should not watch television and ",17
15," it has something true because in the age of two or three years you should not watching televeison
a little kid should play with its toys and parents and not watch televison the whole day because it can be a negative ",17
16, you canâ´t say no with a law ,6
17," itâ´s difficult to handle with this topic

a ",6
18," can be that the parents of the children have to handle right with this topic because itâ´s important for their children and their developement
older children like with the age of five or six or elder it is ",19
19, right and possible to watch television with a time which is given by the parents ,15
20, that the cildren can watch a serie for one hour and ,15
21," itâ´s finished for this day

so ",3
22," at some parts with the statement but not at all
the main thing that is important is the bad influence by television for too young children ",17
23, it could exists problems in future which are developed by the television,17
24," for the question if the advertising  shoul not be allowed you can think on some opinions for and against it
 the television advertising is sometimes very funny and beautiful for the kids so they can lough and be happy they show some carracters that show the kids how they can do something and the children are learning something but ",5
25, there are some advertising that arenâ´t very helpful to show children how they can do something or they can behave sometimes the children learn something they shouldnâ´t learn a situation ,11
26, a child is sad because another child took his car for playing away ,1
27, the kid is really sad and donâ´t know what he could do he saw an advertising where this happend and the ,11
28," was that the child hurt the other one and that is not ok in reallife the kid who is sad because he want his car back knows that he can hurt the other one to get his car so itâ´s not ok to show them this kind of stories because they learn from it 
they should show how to play a game or to take part in other plays where he can play with other children
also ",1
29, that children who are at the age of  shouldnâ´t be allowed to watch tv because itâ´s not good for their eyes itâ´s better for them to play in the kindergarten or to play with their mum there are some little things that could make them happy for axample spending time with their mum ,17
30," they can build a better feeling for each other because they get to know each other better
how i said in the begining there are some funny and beautiful advertising which make the children smile and be happy but ",11
31," that they can do other things for being happy 
so all in one ",14
32," that the television advertising should be allowed but those who make the children learn something they shouldnâ´t learn shouldnâ´t be allowed so the advertising should be controlled by some people that know what is right for children aged  
 ",8
33,the following text is about the named statement television is today more impportant than in the past in the past the children go outside an play with other children so its different than today most of children watch television ,8
34, they are at their own i ,13
35, with this statement because young children aged of  should be learn to play with other children at their age when they look tv the children are independent of this media ,17
36, they cant live without watching tv so the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they arent be alone and ,17
37, they meet new people the reason is that they are in contact with others and thats better for their future it ist ,9
38, important because later they can meet new friends easier than without playing with others the children without playimg with other children dont know the contact with others so the relationship to other children is better ,9
39," the children play with other children 
an arguement could be that the television shows pograms which arent good for young children also the pograms are for older children aged seven many pograms arent real but the children watch them and think they want do the same so the television isnt real many pograms could be dangerous for young children ",17
40," they dreams bad and thats not good for their little life 
much peeple say that television is good for their future and its is the real life b ut it isnt it the shows are played of actors who leatn their text and ",17
41," play it for the camera and the pproducer so it isnt the real life 
the children can learn of watching tv that isnt right because the children learn more in playing with toys beside they learn the rules of their parents and they know in which their are allowed to something and what it isnt allowed to do 
so the children shouldnt watch television because they are things which are better than that also the independence of watching television is tall ",17
42," they are older they want watching tv all the time then they dont meet friends or do a hobby
the age of  is ",9
43, time of the life of a children because they learn ,4
44, much about the life and deleope in a fast time the developement of a child in this age is ,4
45, for and against the prohibition of television advertising  younger children which ,8
46," text 

first of all it is wellknown that little children are heavily influenced by their surroundings ",4
47, that they can get manipulated easily ,14
48, this can be used effectively by television advertisements which portray them a false picture of reality causing children to ask their parents for things they dont actually need this is often the case with toys that are shown to be really fun in advertisements ,11
49," in reality they often are quite lame
additionally children cant even realize ",19
50, they are getting baited by a company ,16
51," that it is up to the parents to explain why a particular product is not as good as portraied in the tv which most of the time cant be understood by children which might lead to some sort of unhappiness

nevertheless one can argue if this is reason enough to prohibit advertisements  ",8
52, it would be pretty hard to establish nowadays it is common that even little children spend some time in front of the tv and ,17
53, there has to be some sort of advertising between two shows that are made for children it wouldnt be too clever to put something in there that isnt  children ,11
54,"
furthermore there are some advertisements that might have a positive ",16
55, if an ad promotes physical activity like going outside and playing with friends ,16
56," this is quite rarely the case

eventually ",6
57," that it really depends on what sort of advertisement it is and what product is getting advertised as for the previous example with toys if a false picture of the toy is portraied to bait consumers into buying that is obviously not the right way to do it
however an absolute prohibition is ",16
58, nearly impossible to to happen because tv companies have to earn their money and companies that produce shows for children are no exception but as just mentioned its the quality of the advertisement that really matters ,12
59, wanting to prohibit them all one should ,10
60," ask for more appropriate ads that dont damage young children in any way
",2
61,"the following essay deals with the question wether telivision advertising  aged  should be allowed 
for children the ages  are ",8
62," year of development they learn speaking and walking and a lot of other important things

the young children should play outside or do other stuff than sitting in fornt of a television and watch some strange series later in life theyll watch a lot of tv and in childhood they shouldnt spend their time with this
if they watch series ",4
63, the krã¼melmoster they may have the same ideas as the actors and do things they arent allowed or get hurt ,3
64," doing this
the development in this young age is very importent one cant really tell them what to do ore not they will experience this themselves but without watching tv they will meet some friends and are outside in the natur they create other ideas without the influence of television they get social contacts which they cant make if they only spend their time infront of the tv
for example i got to know my best friend with the age of 1 because our mothers are friends and we only spend out time outside and played with the dogs or by bad weather we built thing and played memories we werent allowed to watch television and later the only thing we watched was the sandman this only goes ten minutes and was nearly ",17
65," our bedtime
the age of  is the time for children in the kindergarden and there they learn how to behave with other kids ",4
66," its important not to destroy this at home
in my oppinion television advertising shouldnt be allowed",10
67,"television advertising  should not be allowed 
with this statement the following text is occupied iâ´m going to compare ",8
68," 

an arguement why children should not be allowed to use television with the age of  is that they are to young to understand a lot of things which are told there parents should make sure that their children grows up with things which are important fot theier future for example children with the age of  should reed some books or play games like football also they could draw some pictures or learn how to spell theier names if children with young age only watch tv they will do this ",17
69," is that a children with young age often has to be alone because the parents have to work the whole day or must have to do something where a little children is not usefull than they could watch tv with the result that their fixed on the television also if a children watch important politically soaps earlier it grows up with a better knowledge of the important things of life but it does not make sense that a young aged children is able to get important information 

a young children with the age of  has to learn the calours or how to differences animals with other animals ",4
70, it is better to show them books with a lot of picures than to let them whatch tv young children should ,15
71," play outside with friends because they have to learn the difference of the real world and the world that is showed by the medias

as a result ",9
72, with the statement because there are a lot of ,6
73, there are a lot of more things children with young age could do much better than watch television in my opinion children who look at pictures or learn the colours with young age have a lot of knwoledge more than children watching tv ,17
74,television advertising is often directed to certain groups of people one of them are children who are between two and five years old there are some people who say that this kind of advertising should not be allowed in the following ,5
75," present my opinion on this topic

in my opionion there are two ",6
76, to this statement i can ,6
77, with the people who are saying that this kind of advertising should be forbidden children who are that young dont know how to compromise it the ads are making everything more colorful and brighter and they do not necessarily show reality the children really want to have the product and might annoy their parents until they buy it its ,2
78, not fair of the marketing people they use young children who might never had contact to any kind of media ,12
79," just to make money they know exactly what the children want and they use this knowledge just to make themselves richer 

but ",18
80, there are some reasons why i ,6
81, with this statement even if the child really wants the product that was advertised on tv the decisions if its bought or not will be made by the parents the child cant just buy things on its own the role of the parents is another reason why ,12
82, commercials should be allowed the parents can decide ,10
83, and how often children watch tv and it is their decision if they want a two year old boy or girl to watch tv the other reason why it should be allowed is one simple thing you cant hide advertising sooner or later the kids will be confronted with ads and it could be good to let them know early enough that it is out there when they become older they will know better how to handle advertisment children will know that they cant have everything they want and that not everything is like it is in tv the things shown in the commercials arent reality but it is the reality that commercials are out there in real life and if tv advertisment towards children isnt allowed commercials in magazines on the radio and ,5
84, on the internet shouldnt be allowed ,10
85, children get a phone earlier every generation and with that they have the connection to everything that is out there and the internet is even harder to control than tv one decision must lead to other decisions ,7
86,"

allinall i say that i ",6
87, with the ststement television advertising  younger children should not be allowed the parents have the chance to decide what the child does and what is bought ,2
88, and children will  be confronted with commercials anyway it is not just on tv,12
89,should advertising toward young children be allowed in this essay ,2
90," of this topic and comment on it

of course it is interesting for a little girl to watch tv and see a doll in the advertising that wants to play with her but what if the mother of the girl is ",1
91, poor she works everyday to be able to buy food and has no money ,14
92, doll the girls wants the doll ,1
93, bad that the mother doesnt know how to react the doll can even talk and dance but ,1
94," expensive now imagine the girl never saw this advertising she wouldnt talk about this doll and her mother wouldnt be in despair  

in my opinion advertising toward young children shoulnt be allowed children dont earn money and cant buy things on their own many children spend too much time on watching tv people go working and people have families sometimes it is hard to connect working and having a family exspecially if a mother thinks that she cant make her daughter happy because of not buying a doll she saw ",12
95,"the following text discusses the statement if television advertising  in the age of  should be allowed or not

imagine young children sitting infront of the television if those young children see advertising for the necessary or the right stuff it might be usefull that they watch this advertising although they are  the children the ads can be usefull for the parents 
but ",8
96, they are just kids and ,13
97, they would be totally influenced by this even adults are influenced by advertising because it sticks to your mind and you cant influence which advertising you watch so young children who arent grown up at all would be victims of those advertisings furthermore if the parents dont control their kids they watch many of those ads ,12
98," the children have a complete wrong view of the reality because they think thst those ads show the reality 

in my opinion i would forbit those ads because ",12
99, that children should grow up without all the influence and should do other stuff ,19
100, watching the tv so i as a mother would not want that my kid watches all the ads which show my kid a different way of the reality  ,15
101,"did young children bacame addicted to modern technic 
in the following text ",7
102," discuss the question and will give my own opinion about the statement wether television should be allowed  or not 

i recognised that many children grow up  different ",17
103, i bacame older some of them does not know the old classics like playing outside i build my one garden or games which have to do with fantasy and your own imagination they replace their imagionation with a cartoon ,1
104, it is important that you as a parent support the devolpment of your child many young children are not really recognised by their parents instead of spending their time with them they make their life easier and put them infront of a television i know that it is not easy to raise up a child but you decided wether you can handle the stress and work or not you know that a child will bring up problems andverantwortung   it is not bad for the child if it watchs tv a few times a week but it has to be controlled the time and easpacially what kind of tv they are watching otherwise ,17
105," it is not possible to forbid television for children under five years because each parents have their own way to let their kid grow it does not mean that television makes you child uncreative or stupid but showing your child how to handle all these unreal and given impressions is important for his her following development 

finally i can say that ",17
106, with the given statement bacause if you forbit something it bacomes more interesting you have to know how to handle the modern development of technic in our world and not to allow something is not the right way prepare your children right for the modern world,4
107,"in the following text i will discuss if television advertising aged  should not be allowed
general television advertising influence ",8
108, young peoplebecause the advertise is always shown in a perfect way without faults because they want that everybody will buy the product,16
109, they will earn a lot of moneywhen young people see something very special for them on the television they tell their parents that they want it but they only want it because it was shown ,18
110," perfect and not because they tried it at the most time the products are very expensive and the parents do not want it to buy for the children
but i ",18
111, think that children with two years do not recognize the advertise ,2
112, well than children with five years the two years old children will not react like five years old children maybe they will strike or something like thatif they do not get that product but the two years old children will forget it and maybe their parents will buy another toyproduct which is better and cheaper and the child will ,1
113, that the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is right in a way but i think that children until three years do not have the knowledge about that stuff ,8
114, thatâ´s why i think young children until three can see television advertising but for older young children until six or seven ,5
115, they come to schoolit schould not be allowed because they have the knowledge and can discuss withe their parents about it ,19
116,many people dont like advertisements for young children ,2
117," for children 

first television is not good for young children and many of these young children arent even allowed to watch tv 

and if they are allowed to  for  example half an hour the parents and the children too doesnt want to have different advertisements in tv the parents because they think its not good for the child it may want something it doesnt need and the child just wants to watch its series on tv advertisements would only steal them their expensive and very short time 
theres ",5
118, against advertisements towards young children imagine youre a children at age  would you be interestet in buying stuff to play with yes ,2
119," you would be so you ask your parents to buy these toys for you and as actually everytime you ask they say no this is sad and depressing isnt ist so some companies may save the children from being sad and do the advertisements towards the parents maybe with some deeper information for them

but there are ",11
120, some reasons for advertisements towars young children for ,2
121," many children its too difficult to learn that parents often dont allow them to be outside until 9pm or like in this discussion buying some playing stuff from the advertisements for them they must accept that they cannot have everything and if they werent confronted by advertisements and the no of their parents they never learn it 
another important thing is the knowledge of the children they actually never get to know different toys like barbie lego or even playmobil probably the parents dont go to a toy shop with their kids very often ",18
122," an advertisement is a good way to get to know some playing stuff and some of these different toys will show them tecnical and motorical skills 

so ",11
123, advertisements for young children are a good thing to get them learn to hear a no and to let their skills grow the only important ,2
124, is the behaviour of the parents toward the children they are supposed to look for their children to not let them too often watch tv and espacially not too long  it would be bad for the child buying some ,17
125, not everything they want toys for the children and let them play with them or reading a book with them are much better opportunities ,1
126,should television advertising  aged  be forbidden in  the following text ,8
127," name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion

in the television there are several different ways of advertising for a product or an campaign for example songs that you will remember even four weeks later or situations out of daily life besides you can watch advertisements in tv that show people who do embarassing things ",16
128, that the spectators laugh about them thats why there is the problem of advertisements  little children in the age  as they are able to sing the song that they listened to in television or want exactly these cookies that their star is eating in the advertisement too that these little persons are influenced by such advertisement is a sad ,12
129, one can pretend them from that by forbid them to watch tv apart from television there are ,17
130, much interesting things to do and let them know how things are working ,9
131, showing them how to bake a cake drawing pictures or doing other creative work but there are ,9
132, reasons that are for the idea of allowing advertisements toward little children in tv the earlier they are confronted to advertisements the better they can resist them ,8
133, they are older that would cause not buying the things that one has seen in tv but ,18
134," that being independent from the advertisements 

all in all ",16
135, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed because ,8
136, that there is nothing to worry about if  little children come in contact with television advertisements so nobody cares ,8
137, it is clear that you are going to watch them ones and it could be a way to make people resistant to advertisements ,16
138," with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed

usually ",8
139, that it does not matter to me what kind of advertisement they are showing during different shows or films but this statement made me think about it and ,16
140," now this is waht i came up with
advertisement is something that we all hate i guess i can say that but sometimes ",16
141," the ones for little kids are just funny and entertaining to watch furthermore it is brilliant to see how happy kids can get just by watching the little clip of maybe just 10 seconds also isnt it just really nice to see all the new things they are inventing for them and sometimes you even feel like you want to be a little kid again just to be able to try all these brandnew amazing things

but there is ",11
142," of the problem
first of all ",6
143, that children in that age should not be watching as much television at all i feel like if they are watching all these advertisements between their movie they are going to want these things really bad most of the times we all know that situation dont we there is a new advertisement on the tv showing something really nice you are going to get the feeling of really wanting to be owner of this so it can start to be really annoying ,12
144, for parents if kids will never stop talking about wanting what they just saw on the tv the parents or somebody else eventually has to buy it and ,18
145," it gets boring or they are going to start wanting something new so people just keep spending money and more money on things their kids see in an advertisement
moreover industries invent toys or other things that are dangerous for kids if they are going to see that on the tv they are going to really want to play with something like that
in addition to that i can say that advertisements are rarely showing the truth sometimes the toy or whatever isnt as fancy as it seems or people in the advertisement do not show the right behavior that the parents taught them ",12
146," kids are going to question everything and we all know how annoying this could end
also did you realize that we barely even have conversations in this time anymore we barely talk to each other and that is ",13
147, because of people spending too much time with social media and other electronical devices ,7
148, the little kids from today should go outside and ask their friend about their new toy better than watching tv and seeing all the new things there i ,15
149, remember me having fun to go outside and not having to worry about an television advertisement but i sure have to say that i remember me really wanting something from an advertisement ,16
150,"

as you can see this is a topic people could probably discuss about all day but ",6
151, i have to say that i do ,6
152, television advertisement toward young children should not be allowed because there is ,8
153, many more exciting things in this world they should see and they shouldnt get jealous of other kids because they have something new from the advertisement that they do not have and ,12
154, have a much easier life,6
155," for and against the statement telivision advertising directet toward young children should not be allowed 

may one can say that advertising  should be allowed because it is allowed to be  everyone in every age of course it is a weak ",8
156, but at least it is one also one has to add that young children aged  normally do not watch tv that often therefore it does not really matter if there is that kind of advertising or not but in case that the children watch tv nearly all day it could be helpful for later maybe the children are not interested in this advertising in a way and do not listen to it or watch it so there is the chance that they wont be interested in advertisding later ,12
157," they wont be easily influenced

but that is only guessed one ",13
158, that is against television advertising  young people is that it is not good to get influenced in this young age and if one thinks about it in a rational way it becomes clear that children are interested in advertising especially if the advertising presents new things to play with also they do not really have the chance to have or to build an own opinion because they are too young as a ,8
159, with the advertising or at least to believe it is true for example if it is about a new snack that is ,16
160," good for children because it suppports them in becoming large and stong but actually its main ingredient is sugarl so they believe in wrong things and regard lies as true this could be a problem for their later life because they wont be able to see the difference between lies and  the truth 

all in all television advertising  should not be allowed ",5
161, that is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children,19
162,"in the following i tell you my oppinion of the question if television advertising  between  years shuold not be allowed

in my mind it is not a question of the age of the children because i think that television is not good for anybody but ",8
163, everybody has to chose for his self because it is his or her life and not the life of the anyone else so ,6
164," that the parents have to chose if there children are allowed to have a television
the children hast  to learn about the politics and know what is beeing in the world but kids under five years would not be interested of the politics and the other things to learn in the television ",17
165," the films and series for kids have to be kontrolled by the parents so they can not whatch films and series which are not allowed for them 
the kids have to whatch films and series to learn ",15
166," from them  who made for the children but they dont have to have a television for him or herself
it is a part of the the youth of many kids they not have to have a television to have a good youth because if the parents spend time for their children they can ",17
167," have fun without an own tv so if the parents dont want to allow a tv for the childs they have to soend time for them
but if the parents can say stop if the child whatched to much tv or watch movies and serier which are not allowed to whatch for a child in  his age ",15
168," the child should be allowed to have or watch tv 

to sum up ",17
169, this toward because not every parents have time to spend time for his or her children and the tv is a good alternative to entertain the children so every parents had to chose for his own child and ,17
170,"chlidren form the age of  have not been able to develop their own charcter jet that makes them an easy target for advertisement because they are easy to influence the question now is should advertisement directed to children of the named age not be allowed  


children of the age  are the future of the human society ",2
171, they are the ones that will determ the things that will be bought in the future and the standards that will define our future society advertisement for children does not have to be a bad thing it can be used to influence them ,12
172," that their behaviour will have a positive effekt on society and nature
the promblem with advertisement which is directet to children is that it does not aim for a better futer the people that make the advertisment aim for money they mainly see their own profit and not the negative influence they have on children by trying to sell their products they can set unrealistic standars of beauty or material things that children may want to own one day the ",12
173," of this can be depression because nobody is happy with their body or with the stuff they own and they will simply be unhappy
children should have the chance to develop their own character as isolatet from advertisement as possible ",12
174," that they can find out for themselves what they want to look like and what they want to own and in which way they can find pleasure and happines

bacause of these given ",14
175, i come to the conclusion that advertisment directet to children should not be allowed because it takes away their chance to develop their own individual charcter ,2
176," on the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
first i will write the ",8
177, against the statement children should decide themselves what they want and advertising helps them to gain information about the things they could possibly need in this age they are  already able to show us what they want the children probably dont even understand the television advertisment but the parents like the advertisment more ,12
178, it is a well made advertisment young children should not watch too much television anyways ,12
179," the parents have to control what their children watch
second i will write ",17
180, for the statement the advertisment has an influence on the children and in this age they dont know ,2
181," they are under an influence additionaly only the parents know what they can afford and the children dont think about the price of something they just want it or not the children might even get unhappy because their parents can not afford what they want and the children dont understand why their parents dont buy them what they want because they dont understand the use of money 
",18
182, that television advertising that is s young children should not be allowed but young children should not watch much television and the parents should control what their children watch,8
183," write a text about the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed 

first we live in the 20 century an it is impossible to use nothing technoligy young children get up with new smartphones or other things the children in the age  get up too with the new technoligy

188, because young children learn at the television colours or other things but a negativ ,17
189, is that she learn things that she dont need ,4
190," that it is important for young children watching television but it is important what they watch and how long because they need conversation with other persons and activitys  
 ",17
191,there are different oppinions to the statement television advertising  aged two or fiveshould not be allowed in this essay ,8
192," pro and contra this topic
 as children have tv channels that are directly presenting shows for their age it is logical that they have to get money tv channels like nickelodeon or kika are very common and the children like them very much ",5
193, it would be sad for them to turn them off because the channels are not allowed to show advertising so it is important to show advertising  ,10
194, the channels can stay alive another ,3
195, is the industry that produces toys and other things for young children they really need to present their advertisements to children and ,2
196, they would not sell nearly as much as they do now children see the toys on the tv and ask their parents if they can have it when only parents would get advertisements for toys most of them would not really care about it and they probably would not buy the toy the kid would have chose  ,1
197, the more expensive ones so the toyindustry needs the advertising toward young children to sell their products and get money another ,11
198, for the advertising is that children always want to be treated as grownups ,2
199, they like to watch advertising on television because it is a thing that is ,16
200, on channels for older people and ,15
201, they maybe feel more accepted as a child in the world of adults but there are ,19
202, against showing young children advertisings on tv the most important one is that the kids can be manipulated into buying things they see if a advertisement is really good and adresses the child with  ,8
203,  bright coulours and a catching name the child is most likely going to want the toy or other thing it sees they will ,1
204, ask their parent to buy it but a lot of parents cannot spend as much money at toys ,1
205, they want to some parents will maybe buy the toys and ,1
206, do not have enough money left for other things if they would not buy the toy the child would be very sad or angry about his parents and probably ,1
207, be bullied by other kids because they do not have the newest ball or other kind of things besides that these toys can be really expensive they ,1
208, tend to be useless especially kids at a very yound age really want to have a toy ,1
209, play with it for a ,1
210, lay in a cupboard and be forgotten after a ,13
211, the child will fill its room with things it does not play with anymore and does not need it that might be not as bad at the ,1
212, the child grows older it is going to want a more adult room and ,19
213, has to throw a lot of toys away or has to donate or sell it if possible in my opinion it is a very controverse thopic and i cannot say if ,1
214, or for it i would ,6
215, that we should allow companies to show their advertisements  and ,10
216, should let the children watch it but ,15
217, they should keep the amount of advertisements they show between kids tv channels to a minimum and they should ,10
218, just play the advertisement at the end of a show ,16
219, the kid does not get interrupted by it and ,19
220, waiting the show to go on finally ,3
221, the parents should keep an eye on their very young children ,19
222, they do not spend all their time watching tv because tv itself is not very good for them ,17
223,the statement is about television advertising toward young children and is a very complex topic with a lot of pros and cons ,8
224, start off with the pros come to the cons ,6
225," that and give my opion at the end
at ",6
226," at a very young age are very easy to influence that is why parents always should pay attention about what they are watching they could get bad dreams about scary things they watch or develop a fear all of the sudden 
as they can be influenced ",19
227, might want to have every new toy they see on tv and ,1
228," look at these new things on the tv than go out and play with the toys they already own
now ",15
229, talk abbout the pros of this statement when the children see ,19
230, the toys that they want to have on tv it is easier to buy them because their parents do not have to take them to the store if the child would come with them they would probably find other toys and would want to buy them all another reasons is that they would not even unterstand everything ,1
231," it is not important if they watch it or do not

in my opion ",3
232, children are protected from adversiting because they are ,19
233, easy to influence and probably believe the things that are said ,14
234, that the channels should not be too influenced by that and that the always have to keep an eye on their children to prevent them from seeing something bad,17
235, about making money in any possible way and ,16
236, the advertising towards the costumer plays a big role ,16
237," but should there be an age limit that forbids it that younger children stand under the influence of the companies

a well known strategy to make profit is adressing the costumer directly and in buisness all tricks are allowed ",2
238, why not make the product attracting to little children who are an easy target ,11
239, they donâ´t think about the ,14
240, if they really need it obviously itâ´s just an easy to make the commercial colorful and interesting ,16
241, that the young kids get the feeling they despretly need that certain toy of course itâ´s the parents that pay but the children are being annoying and loud for ,18
242," get what they want
so some people might say those children are too young and shouldnâ´t stand under that influence because they canâ´t decide wether that toy is actually that much fun and laugh as it is presented on tv but that ",1
243, the children might want something for the outdoor fun like a new special ball and ,1
244," they want to play outside and stop sitting in front of the tv and that canâ´t be bad at all

finally ",13
245, the opinion that television advertising towards young children doesnâ´t have to be forbidden because itâ´s not just the influence of tv commercial even ,8
246," they go to the shops with their parents the companies always try to get the young ones to be interested in their products so it wouldnâ´t make a difference at all for the children themselves just for the tv channels to reorganize the programm
",18
247, television advertising  should not be allowed because its unhealthy for them to whatch television too often ,10
248, that could cause that they dont move enough its important that children go outside and move ,19
249," sitting in front of the tv the whole time
moreover they could get used to technic too much ",15
250," they already whatch tv in that young age too often they want to use computers smartphones and tablets etc in their future way too often because they think its just normal and everybody does it because television advertising  was allowed so they stay in their room all the time and dont go outside because they can have contact with their friends by using their smartphones which is very unhealthy
on the other ",7
251, television advertising  should be allowed because its very interesting for them because they can learn something for instance there are many shows on the tv that are ,5
252," for very young children and that try to teach them something by having fun which can be very effective

in my opinion television advertising  should be allowed but the parents shouldnt let their children whatch tv too often because its very important for their health and social life that they ",5
253, that the parents should make a rule that says how long their children are allowed to whatch tv and what they are allowed to whatch ,17
254, half an hour a day and just the programm thats ,15
255, that it cant happen that the parents sit their children in front of the tv ,17
256, that they dont have to care about them its very important that they undertake something with their children ,14
257," they could go to the playgroung
in the end ",13
258, say that young children should be allowed to whatch tv because it can be interesting for them and they can learn something but their parents have to whatch that they dont do it too long  ,17
259," write an essay discussing the prohibition of television advertising toward young children

on the one ",8
260, there seems to be no need for a prohibition of ,10
261, most of the children aged 2 to 5 are allowed to watch television anyway and are ,17
262," confronted with other advertisements that might have an even more negative impact on their development eg alcohol advertising

on top of that there is the chance that these advertisements create an interest the children can dedicate their life to eg playmobil toys of ancient rome may create a passion for this epoque nevertheless this includes the risk of bad habits that may have a negative influence on their ",12
263, we have to consider this kind of television advertising as dangerous as parents cannot realize their ideas of education anymore if they allow their children to watch televion for example they might consider a close contact to nature as necessary but ,5
264," an advertisement their child is completely fixed on the advertised toys and does not want to leave the house anymore

all in all ",11
265, that it is necessary to differentiate advertising addressed  can create ,16
266, a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing ones life eventually it depends on the content of the advertisement and how the parents can include this in thei ,11
267,"young children can be easiliy influenced by everything so if they watch tv an advertisement could easily make them want to have the product shown in the advert so there comes up the question should tv advertising dirceted towards young children be forbidden 
there is the question how far we are gonig to go to protect our children and ",8
268, an advert could heavily influence them they are most likely not going to grow up if they dont get in contact with adverts because if they dont get adressed ,12
269, they are 25 they are going to be ,13
270, they are 6 so how is there any difference if they dont get the experience of watching adverts they will not be able to deal with them ,12
271," they are  older 
furthermore these adverts dont damage the kids at all they are just showing new toys of cereals and ",2
272, they are trash why ahouldnt the companies have the right to show the world what they created there the children have to learn that not everinthing is like it looks in the advert and ,12
273," it makes them cry it will form their character 
finally the adverts might want to make a child force their parents to buy a toy for them and if it cries because they wont ",11
274, it will have to learn its lesson and if the parents want to give their sweetie anything it desires and they have to buy every fing toy it sees in an advert ,1
275," dont blame the advert but blame the parent 
in my opinion there is no real reason to forbid such tv adverts because the experience of such things are very importat for children of that age there are no convincing ",12
276," for this ponit and i am sure that this is never going to happen because it doesnt make any sense at all but  
   ",13
277,concerning the given statement about television advertising toward young children people have differnt opinions some are convinced they should not be allowed ,8
278," others dont mind them in the following the statement will be evaluated

on the one ",6
279," children are constantly confronted with all sorts of advertising as they watch television ads that are  people their age would be better for their intellects than those that are meant for adults only to keep them safe from sexual and violent subjects it would be helpful to show the right ads on channels they watch
on the other ",2
280," chidren aged  should generally not be allowed to watch television regularly if parents are responsible with their childrens time management there is no need for tv companies to show ads  them
it is important to mention that children do have a say in what their parents buy them having seen an interesting ad about a toy ",5
281," can have them begging for it 
but actually those children are not customers ",18
282, they dont have a say in what their parents buy them therefore advertising about toys and other childrens products should ,2
283," they are potential customers  not the children themselves

in conclusion ",19
284, children are an important part of todays economy they should not be confronted with advertsing  them in public media,2
285,advertising follow us through our whole life even young children are used to listen and see advertising but is that right should young children be influenced by television advertising in the following ,5
286," discuss this statement

on the one ",6
287," young children have to learn how to deal with advertising for example that not everything what is said in advertsings is right or usefull if they dont learn that early they may have problems with it later 
on the other ",2
288, advertising could be an bad influence ,16
289, if young children are confronted with ,19
290," much advertising that they didnt even realize that the things in advertising arent real and in cause of that they will believe in things that aren real and build their world on wrong thoughts for example that little girls could think that unicorns and elves are real because they saw that in tv it could be hard for the parents to explain their kids that the unicorns are only animated and that they dont live in the real world such a statement could be shocking for a young child
but it is normal for kids to believe in things that arent real like princesses or fairytales if they grow up they will realize that they lived in castle of fantasies it is a normal experience for kids and nothing to worry about because it worked for generations of children
furthermore the parents could prepare their kids for example it is necesarry to talk about the advertising and the parents should explain their kids that you cant buy everything just because it looks fantastic in the advertisement they could make a trip through the supermarket and show their kids the toys of the television advertising and show them ",12
291," that they arent that fantastic 
besides they are confronted with advertising anyways ",16
292," in the supermarket or the streets or magazines it is hard to completly isolate children and protect them from advertising

to come to a conclusion i am of the oppinion that with the right leading from the parents even young children could navigate through the jungle of television advertising and they will learn how to deal with it it is the best way to prepare kids for the future it isnt nedded to forbid television advertising for young children because it isnt needed to protect them from anything if they know how to protect themselves ",5
293,"television advertising has a big role in modern society cigarettes snacks or smartphones almost everything has its own advertise but what about toys for kids do they need advertises directed to them or does it has a negative effect on them should television advertising  not be allowed
advertising has an effect on everybody no matter if he or she is young or old nevertheless its not a secret that little kids are likely to be influenced by such things if a kid sees that this toy is the best like it is said in the advertise it believes that it is tne best but sometimes things are to expensives to affort for some families a kid who believes only this toy is the best could be frustrated or sad if it doesnt get this toy a situation that could be strenghten by other children who have this toy furthermore could the other kids begin to bully a kid who has not got the best toy like they said in the advertise 
anyway the modern world is full of advertises not only in tv ",12
294," in the internet at train stations or on walls in cities so where is the difference between an advertise that says parents buy this or that for your kids because its the best or if it sayskids look thats the best toy in the world the message is the same for children they see this toy is the best and they want it especially kids aged  can not differentiate between advertises directed to them and advertises directed to other persons
moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids they have to make them clear that not everything said in television is right on the one ",12
295, a confrontation with this kind of advertising could be bad ,16
296," children can only learn from it if they are confronted with it and learn to spectate advertising from other perspectives
",12
297, than ban advertises directed to kids from television it is more important to teach the kids how to deal with advertises if theyd just be abandonned the kids would never learn how to deal with things or persons that try to manipulate them maybe they would even be easier influenced by populists than other persons if they did not learn howe to say no,12
298,"nowadays many advertisments on television feature cute toys aiming to attract young children to want them because these children are usually at a very young age it is discussed whether to ban these ads or not

many parents know the struggle of their kid seeing something quite expensive and useless on tv like a flying barbydoll or a selfdestructing car the kids might be sad if their parents decide not to give these items to them they might even become angry at them throwing a tantrum if they want something really bad this is not just bad for the atmosphere in the family itself but could ",12
299," affect the childs mental health if they feel like they never ever get what they want the most

on the other ",14
300, if the kids stay nice and quiet they might have the chance to get the thing they want for christmas without the ad about it on television they maybe would have never known that this special thing existed in the ,18
301," place and if the parents decide to give it to them for birthday or christmans the child will be very happy

one cannot forget ",1
302, that children aged  may not have a sense for rational thinking or are conscious about moneys worth at all ,4
303, they might see some completely useless and easily breakable item on tv which they ,3
304," want to have for christmas and if they parents dont look up details about that item and just trust their child because it makes it happy the child might end up with a broken toy which will make them even more sad

by far the best ",1
305, to make is that no matter what the child wants no matter how sad it will get everything is always up to the parents if they decide not to buy something their kid will just forget about it ,18
306, weve all been there and everythings just fine and if the parents have a lot of money and dont care about what they buy in the ,18
307," place why not show these children some cool toys on tv to make them happy

concluding id say that ads aimed towards young children shouldnt be banned because as one can see really no matter what its always up to the parents if the kids throw a tantrum theyll get over it sooner or later the ads are perhaps the best way to get to know new products and ",2
308, the children deserve to sometimes not always get what they want ,19
309, it is not the best thing to buy this way they can ,18
310, learn from it and maybe develop a sense for whats good and whats not ,14
311, they can better decide what to buy for themselves ,18
312,"as technoglogy evolves more and more product selling companies find more ways to advertise their products and trick people into believing they need those products this being achieved by making use of several psychological tricks and methods
and ",16
313, there arent only products for adult people the focus is ,11
314, on teenagers and children in ,19
315," a lot of companies only sell toys for children making this an essential part of our economy
but keeping in mind how companies find ways to manipulate their potential customers the question arises whether or not advertising ",2
316," on television directly addressed to children should be prohibited

in order to support this statement one could argue and say that ",8
317, their childish minds and behaviours kids are much more easily tricked into doing an believing things than adults making it much easier to make them want to have certain things someone may take this to an extreme and say that kids childish natures are being abused which is highly questionable from a moralic ,19
318," of view
furthermore children influenced by tv ads are going to to try and make their parents buy those certain products which they most likely wont ",12
319," causing unnecessary tears

despite having taken the negative ",14
320," should have jusgt as much attention
so ",6
321, tv advertising might influence children there is no sign that it causes any major negative effects or even damgage to them it does not hurt them ,5
322," all has there ever been a child being seemingly damaged by wanting a new toy car doubtful
in order to answer the question as to whether or not such tv ads should be banned or not the companies perspectives should ",12
323, be taken into consideration from their ,6
324," of view advertising is essential to find potential customers
and ",16
325, if they suddenly werent allowed to show ads on tv anymore theyd ,10
326, find another way to advertise their products ,16
327," via smartphones

giving attention to ",7
328, we can conclude that tv advertising should not be banned,10
329,the statement tv advertising  should not be allowed is about what impact ads can make to humans ,8
330," 

it depends on their parents if their parents are strong and do not buy their kids everything they want to have ads will not have a big impact it ",12
331, depends on which ads are showed if there are only advertises about things that kids do not need like insurances or cars no one will bat an eye it will get interesting ,12
332, advertises are shown with kids as target the children will try to force their parents to buy them the things they have seen on the tv but if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine so it is very important to show the children who has the power in addition children  are not that good in arguing they will just say something like i need this toy please buy it daddy and if the parents are smart they will tell them that they do not need it ,12
333, the parents will not buy it the children have no other choice than accepting this except for begging or crying but if the parents stay cool and maybe ignore the children ,18
334," they are crying they will soon stop doing it
another ",13
335," is that some ads which children should not see are shown at night or in the late evening so there is no danger that children could see ads they should not see

so i ",2
336, with this statement because smart parents are stronger than any advertise and if they are not they should think about their role as a parent,19
337,if youve ever accidently switched to a tv channel for kids ,15
338, watching television or have children yourself who  watch these channels youve probably encountered the high amount of long advertisment blocks in which products like expensive toys sweets or lemonade are being presented in todays world a lot of parents use modern media to entertain their kids because of what it is important to question the effect of these advertisments on the younger generation ,12
339," developed children aged 

these ads are a big part of the marketing campaign of the toy and sweet manufacturers banning them for being inappropriate would seriously harm these companies as there wouldnt be many ways left they could reach the kids there target group the ways left would be the internet which is ",2
340," often used by young children and the direct advertisment in the streets

yet one should consider that the advertisments are always flashy and show the happy children who use the product they never show what effects the lemonade has on their health if it is unhealthy and full of sugar their effect is always hidden as the parents wouldnt allow their kids to buy the advertised product it is wrong to sell an unhealthy product to innocent children

also important is that the children arent really developed ",11
341, they havent had many experiences with money and arent able to decide whether the board game they want ,18
342," badly is overpriced often the parent would give in on their child which is not going to give up on that toy

considering all of these ",1
343, it is somewhat clear that the target group of children aged  isnt ,19
344, ready to be influenced and ,6
345," manipulated by the toy companies i
",1
346,"advertisment has an big influence on our society it can have a big impact on how we behave and what we spend our money on so should young children at the age of  have contact with advertisment for their age already

first advertisment  would be very effective because it would reach ",2
347, the children but the parents ,19
348, parents are often not able to resist the wishes of their children that is why the profit of companies selling ,18
349," toys would rise
futhermore advertisment is needed to inform the public about new products it is important to inform the customers buying toys clothes and everything else for young children about new products and innovations too

on the other ",12
350, young children at the age of  can not make their own buying decisions and they are not able to handle money becauso of that it may be more effective to publish advertisment directed to middleaged people because they as parents decide ,2
351, young children have contact with advertisment every day advertisment directed to them would have a bigger impact on them and their behavior they ,2
352," do not know about the risks in our society and whether something is good or bad because they are just at the begining of their developement that is why they can be manipulated very easily advertisment can be developed in a way that may have a hidden influence on their opinion later

summarising all ",19
353, i can conclude that television advertising  should not be allowed because of the negative impact this could have on their development and because of them being not reasonable enough to make their own decisions and to realise whether something is good or bad,5
354,i can understand that companies direct their advertising towards young children because in that age children can be manipulated very easily and ,2
355, adults and other children are better able to decide wether they actually need the advertised product they only care about the great video and not about what the product actually is and ,11
356, they usually are not able to actually buy these things they are often able to heavily influence their parents ,18
357, insistin on wanting to have something this means that this kind of advertising can be very efficient because more and more younger children watch television on a regular basis ,12
358," more and more companies direct their advertising towards this age group
this means that children are manipulated more and more often and ",2
359, that should not be allowed when children are heavily influenced by advertising ,2
360, children trying to convince their parents of buying a product much more often as they already do and this habit puts a much greater strain on the parents who will probably give in to their children more and more often because they have not got the strength to have similar fights over products over and over again as probably mostly sweets and things to play with are advertised children will probably eat more sweets which could lead to more children being overweight and as people often keep eating habits ,18
361," growing up this might increase the already big problem of obesity in the future
additionally parents will spent more money on sweets and mostly unneccessary things which can be a problem in families which are not wealthy
therefore i completely ",18
362, with the statement television advertising  should not be allowed because forbidding this kind of advertising could reduce many problems in families,8
363,"especially young children are getting easily influenced by television nowdays advertising is a normal part of the television
the question is if this advertising should be forbidden because of the influence that it could take on young children

a lot of children may not be even able to understand advertising in normal television ",5
364," nerved as influenced
there are some products that may not be shown to children for example alcohol children should not think that alcohol is as cool as it is getting presented
advertising on channels who are made for kids are something else  the way the product is getting presented will be a lot more interesting for a kid than for an adult
an easy way to prevent children from this danger is a regulation of the time a child is watching tv too much tv time leads to a bad eyesight and maybe to a bad social abillity because of the ",12
365," that a lot of kids are watching tv for hours and hours without speaking to everyone or to get in contact with new friends or kids

for me advertising towards young children is not a problem the parents should care about the time their child is sitting in front of a tv and if the child is watching something that is meant to be for his age
imagine that there would not be advertising anymore  where is the money for the channels coming from  some channels would not be even able to exist
advertising is one of the main money makers for channels and it would be a really hard challenge for some of the smaller ones to keep showing the same content as ",12
366," that can be discussed wether good or bad is that children get inspired for their whishes on christmas
",1
367, this is something that can be as good as bad,6
368, arguement regarding to the statementtelevision advertising  should not be allowed ,8
369," lines

the television advertising  children could confuse the children because they dont know how to deal with the situation there could be ",11
370," a bid teddy bear on the television who tells the children that they should buy him and that he is the best teddy bear that they will ever have young children aged  wont notice that thos is just a pr strategie and that this teddy bear can not speak with them

but it is ",11
371, a good train for children for learning how to deal with treat from the internet or the television ,4
372, they learn how to handle in situations like these most of the time the parents can tell them that th eteddy bear can not speak and that the things he says in television are just a lie ,19
373," want the teddy bear the spreadings from the parents are mostly deeper and more respective for the children than the ones out of the television

there is ",1
374, a problem given by television advertisement because a lot of children are feared by the figures or symbol in the advertisement spots clowns big bearslions etc ,11
375, they cant sleep at night and are scared to go outside this is a problem for their process of growing up because theyll always have the picture of the big clown they saw ,19
376, they where four inside their head ,13
377, they dont notice it specially anymore but it will ,13
378," be on the inside

but television advertising towards children with two years is not a big problem because the children with two years will not notice that it is towards them and they wont notice what is going on in these advertising spots ",2
379," the parents can be calm beecause it isnt a big problem to deal with

furthermore these advertising spots can bring the children to bad ideas ",12
380," their parents will not buy them the bid teddy bear they just go inside the shop and steal it because the teddy bear said i want you to own me or cuddle me there are a lot of children who get treated by those spots this can be a start for an criminalisation of the children

all in all i can say that these advertzising spots towards children with  years are unnecessary and lean them to do criminal things none of the children in these ages will have enough money to buy these stuff ",2
381," these spots should not be allowed 

",10
382,"kids in this age canâ´t buy everything what they see on the tv but they want to have it and talk to their parents and they will buy it 
also ",18
383," that parents have to told their children that it isnâ´t everything real what they see on tv
 but ",17
384, children are very easy to manipulate ,19

also children donâ´t know the risks of television advertising they have to learn it ",5

387," is that children believe in everything what they see for example they see on the tv that you are cooler if you eat fruchtzwerge children want to have fruchtzwerge 
in this case parents have no choice and will buy the thing the children want to have
so ",18
388," that television advertising toward young children should be not allowed because they are too young and can be manipulate
but companys earn a lot of money with this television advertising ",8
389, it would be hard to forbidden televison advertising toward young children,8
390,"sould advertising directed  aged  be allowed or not
this is a very controversial question and it is hard to decide between yes and no ",2
391, evaluate the two options and come to a conclusion answer or ,6
392,"

a lot of people believe that it is unethical to introduce children to the world of this kind of economy at the age of two years these young children should not bother about whether they want a pink barbie doll or a blue pegasusunicorn just from looking at television advertisements because they could have been influenced too much it might be possible that they donâ´t even want some of the things shown in the advertisement but beg their parents anyways just because theyâ´ve seen it on tv sure there are other people who say that thats the concept of advertising but most people do not want to buy some things to their children and experience that they donâ´t use it or play with it
another ",12
393," against advertising directed to children is that it might not be worth it for some companies to direct it to children not many children watch television at the age of two or donâ´t understand the content of the advertisement that sounds like the companies that make adverts for children lose more money by putting the advertisement on national television than for actually selling the product
however the parents of the young children might want to buy some of the products because they believe that they are good for their toddlers and that they might enjoy it seen from this angle those television spots arenâ´t directly produced for young children but more for parents of young children

i belive that television advertisements should not be  because i believe that it is just a waste of money and time for the companies that decide to produce a  television advertisement because i belive that young children donâ´t need to watch television and they shouldnâ´t be talked into  things they donâ´t truly want
in my opinion advertisements can be directed to children aged five and older because i believe they can handle the input of information better that chikdren younger than five",8

on the one ",8

425, these advertisments because the children are more informed what is in trend and can compare with other children they usually dont read newspaper or magazines ,12
426," they can see things from the televeision
but there are many problems if children see advertisments which are focused on them the brain of children in this age is not ",5

428, be influenced more easily by different things if you tell a child that santa clause exists it will believe but an adult knows that it is not true they ,4
429," do not have this critical thinking of things that adults have     

in my opinion it should be not allowed to show tv advertisments for children between two and five they see something colourful beautiful etc and for them it seems to be the best thing in the world they will annoy their parents to buy this thing tv ads are just made to manipulate a childs brain because of the straightforward thinking in todays life it is very difficult to keep children away from electronic media because everyone has a tv or something similar in his home so the advertisment companies use this as an ",12
430, and manipulate a childs brain,19
431,now i will count on some ,13
432," for the statement
television should not be allowed for young children because they would see pictures they dont understand and which are not made for young childs they shouldnt see that pictures because they could be afraid of things they should not afraid of like zombies in a horrormovie additionally they need the time to play outside and experiance the world and they cant do that because the tv is always more interrestic for young children it normal furthermore young children could start of having an unreal view of the world because they just see the suggerested pictures in the television and dont try to find it out themself so in this important time for a child to grow up and learn things they should do it without tv because its an lonely live with just watching tv and they need the social links
otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching tv they just need to switch it on and they are in a new world where they can see what they want and expriance what they want the television is part of our future ",17

in my view young children aged  should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents for example once a week an doumentation which is specially made for young children is good to learn something and learn what the tv is anything more than this makes the ",17

today there is a television in each family and the parents and the adults in the family are watching tv children in the age between two and five spent almost all there time ",17

449, they have to say to their child he would not get the toy a nother probolem is that often the werbung manipulates the audience for example playmobil there is a child playing with the new playmobil castle and there is a dragon which can act it can spy fire or is flying in the clouds in the reality that is not possible but younger children would trust the television and think it is real then ,1
450," they get the new playmobil dragon and want to the it spying fire they are sad becaus they thought it works

452,"television advertising  can be allowed
on the one ",10
453, there are many reasons to support an advertising free tv programm first children in this age even do not understand what advertising means and how it can influence them in a bad way thats why parents have to keep an eye on their children during their watching period not every parent is able to do ,5
454," because they can have lots of work outside the living room
in addition to that there is the question wether showing advertising and influence them is moralic right or not because it isnt not really neccessary for the once who want to advertise their products and why should someone pay ",16
455," much money just to show such things like toys to children who sometimes even cant talk in their age
but one the other ",18

457, fictional movies dont also there is the chance eg ,3
458," there is tv advertising for a specific toy that the children like it and the parents can buy it to them and it helps parents to confirm their young children to turn the tv off because there will be a five minute break full of advertising which is boring to see anyway
in my opinion its not neccessary to show little children television advertising but it doesnt have to be canceled the parents have to decide what is the best for their children thats enough",12
459,"essay

in our technical world the television in a big part of our life espacilly younger children get influenced a lot by these media so is it a good idea to confront this young children already in this age with television advertising

as in verios studies proven young children get more influenced by any kind of adverting than young adults or older people these young children are very naive and ",5
460, it is very hard for them to understand what is the truth and what is not in the tv also would a children try to buy everything which is showen in the tv because they just want to have everything and this were the parents have to do their work and sometimes have to say no to for example ,17
461," the children wants to buy a knife

but as alreday mentioned ",1
462, we life in a techinical world and to understand and to life in this world every people need the skills on how to handel advertising because it is such an important skill it is important that the ,16
463," generation lears this skill very fast and there is no place better than in your family over a long period of time 

of cause some content is just not right for children like zigarets alkohol or other kinds of violent games these advertisements should not be allowed to see in the television befor eight at night 

so ",15
464, i say that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed but advertisement is a allday thing ,10
465, if they would not see it on the tv they would see it in the streets radio and big city so ,3
466, banning direct advertisement is not the right way ,10
467," discuss the statement that it shouldnt be allowed to show advertising content to children below 5 years of age
if you look at the statement you can see that it only means television advertising the most advertises are related to the content that is sent between those advertises ",8
468, in a show for young children there wont be a car advertise ,11
469, the people making this advertising will try to guess what kind of people will watch their content ,16
470," they catch the right crowd which probably buys this kind of things
if you look at the financial part the tv channels ",16
471," have to make some money to run their business and the content shown 
if i combine those ",16
472, and if the advertising content shown to the children is nothing harmful my opinion of showing television ads to younger people is that they are okay in a way of financing the channel but i ,5
473," think that if kids see too many nice things on tv they like they may will be way too greedy on those things which their parents might not even be able to afford they shouldnt be teached to that much consuming like its often shown on the television but its not that bad if they dont see too much tv and advertising at all 
so if their parents are sitting right beside them and are ",18
474, looking at the stuff their children watch the tv can be switched off ,15
475, an ad comes and parents can protect the kids from unsuitable content or advertising but they should keep in mind that if they dont watch it between the ages of 2 and 5 they might watch it ,12
476, parents cant keep an eye on everything their children see the modern world is just too full of that not even on tv ,19
477, at the streets radio or newspapers,3
478,"the question if children between two and five should be the audience of adverstising is difficult

young children are very easy to control and to influence if they see something they are not capible of nmaking up an own opinion that is why advertising on telvision in between kids program is not good children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents if they do not get the product then  the parents are in the situation to forbid their children something the television says they are allowed to get 

but in the most televion channels for kids there is less advertising in the morning ",12
479, espiaclliy children age  watch teelvision there is less of an optertunity for them to see advertising ,12
480," the question is if there really is television adcertising direceted to only this age group

still there is the chance of seeing advertising and the wish rises of getting more and more toys the value of one product gets less because of the high onsume ",12
481, it is not right to manipulate children through advertising even ,2
482," they might get the product advertising is not all about reality and the child might get disappointed

on the other ",11
483, children get conftonted with advertising daily even ,2
484," the television is turned of there are enough adverts in kids magazines or on big posters wich are hung up all over the place the child can not not see the newest products that his parents should buy

but the problem with television advertising is that you do not have to know how to read the posters or buy the magazine it is free to turn on the television and watch at all the concerns wich try to sell their newest and best product to little kids wich do not know better

",12
485," that not allowing television advertising directed to children aged  would not make such a big of a change our whole society is about buying and selling  consuming you can not protect you child fully and forever but i do think that we have to start somewhere we can not ban all posters and magazines but we can decide wich shows and programs our child should watch in shows like toggolino or  zdftivi there is no advertising in the morning as a kid i watched sandmann in the evening and there was no advertising aswell

so no it should not be a law or a rule for all channels to not show advertising but in the primetime for younger children to watch television it should be at least reduced that would be copmromise to ban it completitly will not stop the child from beeing influenced by adverts",8
486,our society is made of consumers and sellers we have the urge to make economics we ,16
487, seem to be in a battle with other people who earns more money who is better at selling we are living in a world where technology affects our daily life and where we are dependent on it this could  be the reason why we create televion advertising however ,16
488, adults are effected by advertisments ,11
489," young children who cannot differ between information and manipulation so should television advertising  be forbidden
in this paragraph you will read ",8
490, why commercials for children should be unallowed at the young age of three or four children are starting to develope the conciousness about themself thex figure out that if they say i they are meaning themself at this age of confusing realizations children can be manipulated very easily because they are unenlightened they obey what the growns ups say even if they are in a television that is why it could be unmoral wanting to convince children to buy a product or even be something they later would not chose to  be furthermore children cannot make own decisions ,12
491, they are controlled by their parents or adults ,19
492,  so what sense would it make to advertise towards children if they cannot determine to buy something if the intention is not brainwashing especially advertisment about special group of people like parties or organisations could be dangerous for children ,2
493, adults gets convinced by them and start to think that it is not bad to treat people with certain skin colours or religions ,19
494," other people
however there is a reason why maybe advertising toward children should not be forbidde although children cannot decide what is good and what is bad for them they have opinions by forbidden television advertising one would take a away the right of children to make up their own opinions and discover a capitalistic world if that is not enough reason one could ",5
495," claim that companies should have the right to advertise everybody should have the freedom to be what they want to be unless they harm other people yet they do not harm children by advertising their products they only show them a possibility and every children should have the right to have possibilities and chances by hiding commercials it would mean to hide a whole society and that could be even worse
to put it briefly television advertising can be dangerous for children ",8
496, they cannot decide what is good or bad for them they are unenlightened and do not question absolutes however companies should have the freedom to promote their products no matter what age the consumers are as much as children should be seen as person with own opinions moreover people should stop wanting to hide the possibilities that are offered and this does ,2
497," refer to television advertisements
in my opinion people should not have the urge to protect children from everything it sounds harsh but we have to accept that there are people in the world that will use us they will manipulate us but it does not make it any better if we try to hide it in front of children we should ",12
498, inform them television advertising directed tword young children is a little step into a world that acknowlegdes problems and give every one the choice to believe what commercials say or not ,12

500, generations will grow up with this media like its for them such a normal thing but is this right in the following text ,17
501," discuss the thesis if television advertising directred toward young children should be or not be allowed

if wed go 50 years back in the past we would see that kids and young adults had more complications to look up things they had to go to a library to look up informations also for young aged children it could be helpful in the past and ",8
502, in my generation we learned things very early with plays or childrenbooks the coming and existing media will open new and in a few things much easier oppurtunities to get something in mind of a young kid apps are a good example ,4
503," there are existing lots of apps to let the young children understand few things that they can bring in experience in their age and this the apps try to message in a way of playing games

but do we need that do a children in the age of 25 need media or apps to get something in his or her mind just ten years back in the past the young children went outside to meet the nature and learn things about it they played outside and had toys to understand some ",4

",9
507, with the statement that television should not be allowed toward young children sure the media brings new oppurtunities and easier ways to bring something in the mind of somebody with it but ,17

509, things of life it is more important that it can get the ,6

511,in the follwing text i deal with the topic of adds for young childrenaged  and at the end ,4
512, that he young kids are getting perpeard if they watch adverter in that young age becouse in that time children doent watch allone tv they often have they farther or mother ,8
513, to them so that they can controlle how long they kids are watching tv ,15
514, add to this po a new ,6
515, of the industie behind this add that mean that compernies can make a lot of money with the slots for this adds  and that mean that the channel have more money to produce a better tv shows that would ,16
516, help the children that they dont need to watch bad tv on he other ,15
517," that it isnt good for yound kids to watch more the 30 min a week tv but this add maked for the would inspirat them to watch more that would be healy also they arent the one how goes in the supermarked and bought the thinks promoted in this adds for example the two years old kids see a add for ice cream in the tv them this kid would a ask this parend that is that   becouse they dont know that  is in the add and if they knnow that it is they would just ask can you bought me that or this  so the parent need to dicisde
all in all i wouldnt allowed advertising in tv for young children becouse of the strong ",12
518," write a discussion about the statement if television advertising s young children aged  should not be allowed

on the one ",8
519," you can say that it should be allowed because there are many products or toys that are helpful for children in this age they learn things from them like how to behave in some situations
on the other ",1
520, you can say that some of those toys and products are extremly fictional because the children learn ,1
521, much from them and sometimes want to be just like the character they are playing with they often try to do thing like them but are not able to do ,14
522," because they are humans
another example why television advertising  should be allowed is that those children can choos which products they want to use or which toys they want to play with

all in all ",5
523, that television advertising toward young children aged  should be allowed ,8
524, the products or toys are helpful for children in this age ,1
525, they can learn from them,14
526,televison advertising to children between   a controversal topic which is often discussed in the following text ,8
527," in favour and against the topic to get an answer 

first of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us

but the influcene of advertisment  younger children is probably even higher they do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use  convincing people to buy the product for example a young boy who maybe already has a lot of cars sees advertisment on a new one the advertisment tells him that this car is way better ",5
528, all others  the boy will probably believe that and will feel the need to get this car while an adult is maybe going to understand that there is no need for this new car because the boy already has a lot and the new car is not better at all another ,1
529," young kids see advertisment about new products everyday they will not be satisfied about what they have because they always see that there are new and better products 
one ",18
530, is that this unsatisfaction and the feel to need the new product is not just by young kids ,18
531, grownups can feel that way because of advertisment another ,11
532, ist that there is not just advertisment on television ,16
533, in the shops or by games on smartphones for example at a game with little monsters there maybe is advertisment for the monsters as figures to buy such advertisment is ,11
534," not directed to adults but to younger children and in our society it is not unusal to play with smartphones even at an young age

summing all up ",7
535, it is clear that advertisment is not good for younger children but we cannot do a lot against it advertisment is everywhere and ,2
536, parents do not let their kids watch tv or play on smartphones the children will get in contact with advertisment you cannot protect children from it the only thing we can do is to teach younger children that they do not need everything shown by advertisment and to think critical about the ,12
537, told by advertisment and maybe for this it is even better to start at a young age because advertisment belongs to our everyday life,11
538,every time we turn on the television we can watch a lot of interesting films ,3
539, a lot of advertisments these are influenicing us in every age ,16
540, we are young children who are aged  are in a period of life where they learn a lot of things which they need for their ,4
541, life and its not that unusual that they ask questions ,14
542," talk about the question if television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not 
young children can be influenced easily many of us remember the series we liked as a child ",8
543, the other things we saw in television so ,3
544, we saw something we liked we wanted to see more and wanted to have it so its not a surprise that the toys we saw in the advertisments were laying under the tree on christmas or were given to us on our birthdays children want to have many things they see even more ,1
545, they are looking exciting and interesting and many parents want to give them what they want to make them happy or just to stop them being annoying and exhausting the advertisments are manipulation the children by attract their interesting and showing the product as a great and exciting thing which it needs to have for this reason id forbid advertisments for children in a young age but one the other ,2
546, have to decide what they are going to buy and ,18
547," they are letting them watch television 
especially around christmas are toys advertised very much because the people need presents for their families and friends and ",18
548," a child see toys and books and computer games everywhere its not surprising that asks its parents for more than one christmas present this time is very good for the economy 
summarized i can say that young children can be influenced easily by advertisments ",18
549, they want to have more and more but ,14
550, deciding what they are going buy and if they are letting them watch television at all and in the most cases the children have to accept their decision also its good for the economy if they are buying toys and other stuff for their children for this reason i ,18
551," with the following statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
young children must not the advertising ",8
552, they are watching a movie or something like this it is not good ,3
553," young children watch too much television
so without advertising the movie is not ",3
554, long and the kids can play outside for example the child watch always television and is in the house it can get ill because the body is not ,15
555, a disease is in school or childgarden in the garden they can get stronger often the advertising is full of crap from electronical stuff like a flying barbie or something lika that when they watch television and there comes an advertising they see something and the parents have to say no you cant get it but it can be useful if young children have no idea for birthday or chrismas so they can inspire their selfe with the advertising any child know this chrismas is coming but their is no idea so they can watch one hour television and ,11
556, they now many things but only children who are older than four should do this for younger children television is not good it is okay ,15
557, they see a little passage from a movie but not longer than ten minutes without advertising later they get bored from adverts and eat some chips in the break because they dont enjoy the advertising and they become too fat in my opinion too much television or advertising is bad for young children they become stupid and want all things from advertising later in school they want watching always television and all the things from the advertising and they get bad marks at school so it is important to regulate the time sitting in front of the tv and watching adverts while their is advertising the parent have to talk with their children the advertising in television should be regulate from the people who make the tvprogram the best way is ,5
558, the parents regulate the watching time and ,15
559, what they watch not too much advertising,16
560,concerning the question whether there should be television advertisement s young children ,8
561, believe that they should not be made this is ,6
562, that young children are not ,19
563, able to tell apart between an advertisement and reality this problem has already been adressed in the film and gaming industry ,16
564, by introducing age restrictions while the problem in advertisement is not mature content it can ,2
565, that which is s young children those ads are mostly colourful and show the product to be far more alive than it actually is ,11
566, giving it abilities which their real counterparts do not have while an adult knows that the things depicted in an ad are only big exaggerations of the truth a child might think of them as true this is simply because of a childs nature of ,11
567, having lots of fantasy which only adds onto the graphics shown in the ad companies ,16
568, which is the reason for creation of such ads in the ,16
569," place meaning they willingly exploit the childrens fantasy for personal profit lastly a possible threat those ads may pose might be that the ads might lead children to believe they had certain abilities which could cause them to unknowingly kill themselves

to sum up ",11
570, that adds for young children should be prohibited from being played on tv as they exploit the missing characteristics in children to make them want to have things the reason why this is ,17
571, important for tv adds is the ,16
572, that the medium of television allows creators to manipulate children into thinking a toy has way more abilities ,1
573, with the following statement that television advertising dircted toward young children should not be allowed in my oppininon television in gerneral is not good for kids betwen the age  watching television in that young age could not be good for them they can do better things in that age like playing games outside on the other ,8
574, you can say that they have to decide for themeselve but arent they too young ,13
575, i havent watched tv in that young age and i think that it is not an ,17
576, i see more advanteges by not watching television my parents took that decision ,17
577, and they knew what was good ,14
578, at that time the most things you cann see on tv at are things you can discover for your self you could collect your own experiances but you can not see that ,15
579," if you take other familiys you would find other oppinions perherps some familys would think itâ´s good they could argue with the creativly of the kids tv could make theme more creatively so they could have an bigger horizion 
all in all it could have two ",15
580," of view in my oppinion it is not good for young children to watch television advertising 
",5
581,"i would understand if someone says that there is no differance between advertation and manipulation but it is not that easy you need to check many other factors which influents opinions 
one stong arguement againt advertising towards young children is that they dont realise this manipulation if they watching theese ads theyre just like oh mama i want this they dont think about specific stategies which companys could use to make the people buy their products another opinion could be that the eventually decision is made by the parents they decide it but there may be parents do everything for their children and really mean everything but ",12
582, thats part of our economic system everbody need comercial at least someone who has an company whitout advertation its very difficult to get new customers but there is not just the company lead ads there is oral propaganda too ,16
583, its okay if children want to watch television but its ,17
584, important to think about the ,6
585, when i was in the age  ive loved to watch it but ,3
586, the main reason was that my parents didnt allowed me to watch it me and my siblings were allowed to watch from 700 pm to 750 pm it was a tradition and everyone looked forward to these fifty minutes all in all id say its okay if children are allowed to watch tv but its ,17
587, important to think about what could happen if they watch too much in my opinion its not that intelligent to let kids watch tv the whole time but why i know that children have to play outside and do things without any technology im from the generation where the media got important im lucky that i had a childhood without a phone or a computer  all these things were something my parents didnt allowed me to play with i remember the happiness ive felt ,17
588, my father gave me his phone for a minute or ,1
589, my parents said that i can watch a movie thats longer than fortyfive minutes in ,15
590, im lucky that i wasnt in the gerneration where phones and other technologies took over now ,7
591," i see all these fivegraders with a cellphone bigger than their heads im happy my parents forced me to play outside 
back to the question  ",7
592, there are positive things if parents let their kids sit in front of the tv but they have to watch over them one hour is totally fine for youngaged children in my opinion parents have to  ,17
593, nowadays  be stricter with children or young teenager you can see what phones and computer did to them the only thing they care about is what their new profile picture should look like or why they have not that much likes at their instagrampicture it all started with the television because its the ,7
594, technological thing young children can work with if parents dont watch over them they dont stop watching the tv and ,7
595," thats not far away from using a mobile everytime 
all in all in think it should be allowed for youngaged children to watch tv but parents have to take look if its not too long or what movie is on the tv thats ",17
596, many parents dont care about what their child actually watch it could be a documentation ,15
597," a movie thats not allowed for children under eighteen
so my opinion is that tv is okay me and my family always enjoyed it and i want this for other families too but there has to be a limit if parents know whats good for there children they can say how long theyre allowed to watch im sure that parents who know the ",17
598," their children have to stop watching tv 
if parents are trusting and caring with the ",17
599," that their kids use a technological product and a thing that can make abhã¤ngig its fine
but its important that  ",19
600, today  someone watches more over the technological use from children,7
601,"television advertisement is nowadays used to get the consumers attention and to attract them to buy a companys products
therefore firms use the most abstract way to potray their product publicly 
children watching these advertisements are often influenced by the products appearance in the media
the consumption should be determined by the quality of a product ",12
602," than the appearance
of course firms like toysrus have to adapt their advertising to the group they want to target to get the best possible outcome
but considering that today society is dependent on media more than ever the influence ads have on ",12
603," children and adults is increasingly high
especially kids should not be raised in such a materialized society they cannot differ between the appearance of the product in the advertisement and the realistic relation between price and quality
that will lead parents to buying products they would consider too expensive or not appropriate under usual circumstances
why should a threeyearold girl want anything else than the new robotbarbie that is praised to be the one and only toy in advertisements
these advertisements are created and designed for one purpose only theyre supposed to persuade children to want the product bad enough to beg their parents to buy it
in my opinion parents should keep their children away from tvadvertisements ",12
604," they cannot differ between real quality and the quality the products are promised to have
otherwise advertising will overcome rational consumption


",16
605,"the topic of advertising in the tv  is difficult children shouldnâ´t watch tv often in that age thatâ´s clearly for the concerns itâ´s very lucrative to do advertising to young people because they watch it they want it and they go to their parents to talk with them if the children are allowed to get it but itâ´s the wrong way to use young children to make profit maybe it isnâ´t wrong to start in a young age with that things so the children may know what will happend in an older age everyone is controlled by the media at all in the digitalized like tv or radio and in the undigitalized way like newspaper
finally ",5
606, that shouldnâ´t be allowed because the children have to play outside with friends or get wet from the rain without any problem they should not controle by the media ,10
607,the statement that televisions should not be allowed  between two and five years is sometimes correct children in these years are in an important part of  their life for example to learn the ,17
608, things for school some kind of them have to find new friends ,9
609," they begin the time in the kindergarden now its important to concentrate to get a correct circle of people 
in this chapter of their life they normally have to play outside with friends and dont have to sit in their room and watch tv its bad that they maybe see things they souldnt have to see maybe some scenes of terror or something like thatthey dont understand it and they get fear itâ´s important ",4
610, the children have to watch tv to choose the right program a good ,17
611, is that some kind of them show news for children ,15
612," they can understand it or show some series with animals
",15
613," itâ´s important to draw a line between playing outside doing homeworks and watching tv i share the opinion that children in this chapter of their life have to play outside after the kindergarden or school if they finished their homeworks or other things which they have to do its okay to watch tv in a cutted time
in my opinion its sad how much children in this chapter become bad in school or cant speek very well because they only watch tv all in one ",17
614, its okay that children watch tv in a small part of time if they dont forget to do important things for school and playing outside with their friends,17
615,"the following text is an essay about the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
on the positive ",8
616, that companies make a lot money from the parents which got affected by their children to buy them their toys candy and ,18
617, make a lot money with advertising too which is ,16
618," a good thing in the end advertising directed to children is a big and important part of the economy 
on the negative ",2
619, stands that young children between the age of two and five are easily affected by what they see in tv so they want almost everything they see and they get it because theyâ´ll bag for it until they get what they want in the ,17
620, time that does not sound really bad in any way but if you really think about it it is because the ,14
621, years of a humans life are probably ,0
622, ones we learn the most in this years and if we get anything we want if our parents always buy our favourite candy at the groucery we learn that it is normal to get anything we want and that it is normal to always get and eat our favourite candy out of this ,4
623, are resulting a lot of problems like people which think they always get what they want and people which instinctively think it is okay to eat a lot of bad food and ,6

all in all i donâ´t really ",14
625," comercials for children should be limited and controlled 
and that in a way that they wonâ´t get affected by them in the wrong way but ",19

627,children at a young age are a great audience for big buisneses who want to sell their stuff but as always there are some ,18
628," for the children their parents and those buisneses
in my opinion young children should generally just spend a small amount of time watching television they got easily distracted by it and they ",17
629, got influenced by the advertising in television little children cant understand that the toys or sweets that are shown are rarely the way as we see them in tv  they start asking their parents if they may have all this too expensive things often the parents wont allow them buying those things but ,18
630," children get confronted with this cool stuff their friends in kindergarten may have they get sad and wont be part of the group
buisneses are spending a lot of money on advertisings ",11
631," and they know exactly in which way they can reach everybody from small children to old people for their younger audience they use bright and shiny colours and cool effects they often know in which way they may influence the parents of the children too they make them believe that those things are good for their children
at least ",11
632, with the statement advertising should be used on older peolpe but not on kids at this young age children shouldnt get to know the way money beauty and  expensiv stuff ,2
633, influence everyone of us and how they affect our daily life,6
634, for and against the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed a point for con ,8
635, is that parents could find out what there children like and dislike playing with they could look at the reaction of ther children an angurment that it should not be allowed is that the children like the television advertising ,17
636, much that they dont want to leave the television and look way to much of it my ,15
637, point against that statement is that children could enjoy the advertising between ther series they dont have to upset ,8
638, ther serie is ending because ther is an advertising adressing them and not just ther parents another point for the stament is that children could like every spot ,3
639, much that they want everything what they see and ,14
640, the parents have to tell the children why it isnt possible to buy them all what they want to have the most important ,18
641, against the statement is that the children could enjoy what they are seeing they could even have fun during the advertising the most important ,2
642, for this statement is that the children should not sit in front of the television all the time they should go and play outside on a playground whit ther parents or ther friends so if they like the advertising to much they could forget playing outside and ,8
643, the children are young you could bring them much more easier on your ,19
644," that they do whatever you want 
i totally ",14
645, to this statement because it could bring the young children to much to the television and could them let forget to play outside its much more important that young children learn something in books or outside ,17
646, watching television advertising just made for them and in the young age its easier to get in that children mind and to let them think what they should think about ther product ,12
647, that they want to buy it or the parents should buy it and ,18
648, they dont buy it the young children are sad and  years is way to early to watch much televisison and television advertising ,18
649,today children are already confronted with the permanet influence of social media and technology at a very young age which seems to be a chance for companies to sell their products by using advertising in a clever way thats why ,2
650," discuss the following statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

on the one ",8
651, against such a law for exemple one can say that permanent advertising is a part of our time today ,10
652, that children have to learn how to handle it also adults and teenagers are always confronted with advertisemen  ,11
653," last week i saw a new car in the tv but i wasnt able to buy it because of a lack of money
furthermore getting to know many toys they would like to have by television advertisings could help little children to accept that they wont get everything they wish in their life and that they have to be happy with what they get
but ",12
654, for television advertising toward young children not to be allowed a law against it could be understood as resistance against the moneyruled society we have got today critics say that children have to be protected from this bad world to enjoy their childhood and develope in the best way they will become an adult fastly enough for example its seems to me as if my childhood has just ended and now im already confonted with the force of earning money ,8
655," leaving school  to become independent and live the life i want
in addition parents might be happy about tv programm without advertising  because they wouldnt suffer from an annoying child who really wants to have the toy car it has just seen in tv and cries now the whole time because his parents wont buy the mentioned car

especially because of the two last ",5
656, im agains television advertisement for children,11
657,there are a few different reasons why television advertising  should not be allowed first of all young children aged  arent able to recognize if its true or not what they are told and what they see on televisionon television advertising there are used many tricks that make the people believe they will be happier and their life will be much better with the product that is shown the children believe every word and can get a wrong image   of what is realy important in life because they do not have any experiences like that ,5
658, learn something within watching television advertising even on such a young age they can ,12
659, make their own experiences with consumit could be a way for them to experience that advertising is not always the truthin my opinion it would be good if children learn the difference between what they are told as a zielperson and what things are realy likeon a young age it would be important to take care that the children are not confronted with advertising too often otherwise it could have a negative influence on they,12
660,when it comes  parents tend to protect them from outer influences ,19
661, you could say parents are overprotective children must learn about the actual reality and have to deal with the triggers people send with advertisements parents themselves often cannot recognize the triggers in advertisements and watch them daily without fearing an influence by media so you can question why there would be a potential bad influence for their children on the other ,12
662, the young childrens brain must ,4
663, they can be confronted with advertisements which influence childrens thoughts television advertisements manipulate the brain by sending out triggers often not recognized by the mentality children cannot tell if people tell the truth or a lie at such a young age to not leave children with this manipulation is not overprotective it is good parenting which protects young children from problematic influences until they can do it themselves ,12
664, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed but only until they do can tell truths from lies or triggers they cannot be cut of reality because of potential influences for their whole life,8
665,there are several reasons why television advertising toward young children should or should not be allowed ,8
666, that children in the age of  are too young to understand that they are manipulated by the commercials they will believe everything they are told and by that are easy to manipulate ,12
667, that they want to buy all the products the commercial is showing children ,11
668, cant judge if something isnt worth the money it costs ,6
669, they would want to have the item no matter what and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they cant afford a new toy for them thats why televison advertisement thats  causes trouble on the other ,1
670, its good for the economy if many things are sold but ,16
671, that children dont understand the advertisement and just want to have the newest best toy and in the advertisement every toy is shown like its the best of them all thats why its unfair to show children these commercials the advertisement could ,12
672, show the children the variety of items and make them understand that they dont need everything thats shown in the commercials but ,11
673, that they are just too young to judge,14
674,"
advertises are often shown in the tv they adress all ages even really young children and that might be a problem as many criticers say 
young children are easily influencable by television advertising so they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour 
on the other ",12
675," we could say that it is part of the parentâ´s job to decide if and what their children watch in the tv to give them the right values 
another ",17
676, might be that children aged  are not interested in advertises and ,2
677, they are they have no opportunity to get what they want without their parents so the parents can control their children ,19
678," 
and every child has to learn that not everything what is said in the tv is good and that they can not get anything what they want this is a really important process in the life of a child and the understanding is easier ",4
679," it starts as early as possible 
so ",13
680," that television advertising toward young children should not be forbidden but the parents might know that they have to control the tv activity of their children








































































































































































































































































































































































",8
681,television is in our time an important source for news for adults or teenagers but ,17
682, young children use it for education there are many movies or series with an educating backround but the question is if it is ,4
683," good that television advertising  aged  years and if it should not be allowed in the following part i will explain and answer these questions
firstly children get influence by television and specially young children who arent educated or who start to learn are a part of these children aged  years start to speak and to create their own personality 
so that there are ",5
684, bad influences what have follows for the future life of these children for example if young children watch teletubbies who arent speaking with words the hole episodes they maybe ,4
685," wouldnt speak this discussion about the teletubbies are public in the world and politiciens think about stopping the production and to stop selling the dvds
but an important thing is ",3
686, that there are lots of educating movies and series which help the children to live or preparing their life they can learn about the right and the wrong what is easier to understand ,4
687," you watch it how to handle with another children or how to prepare for school so that television is an important source for young children for preparing their future life 
so im ",17
688, with the statement that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed television is a too important factor of the life of a young children these are a too important education source for them there are more positiv follows for young children who watch tv than negative ones,8
689,in the last five years more children in the age of  started watching televion for more than three hours a day the reason ,17
690," is that the television advertise directly toward young children
on one site children can learn from some of these chanels for young people many chanels started producing movies and series for young children where they show how to learn ",11
691, languages like english or french as a ,4
692, of this children already learn even in a young age how to speak an other language ,4
693, they will may be better ,13
694," they will come to school and started learning this language there
on the other site if children started watching television in their freetime for more than one to two hours a day they have no time to do other things like going outsite and playing with friends but in the age of  it is very important to have social contact to other people in their age
so ",4
695, television advertising  in the age of  should not be allowed because in this age children started making their ,8
696, social contacts which is very impotant for their growing up but if the children are just sitting in front of their television they have no time to make these contacts ,9
697," it could be that they later may have problems making friends with other people

",9
698,all of the younger generations are often seen as the generation of the internet and social media but many children nowadays ,7
699, playing with their friends in ,9
700," more and more parents plant their kids in front of the television to have some rest or because the child is more calm
this effect is often used by huge companies directing their advertisements towards younger children ",17
701, raise their sales figures this can be seen as exploiting the childrens innocence ,18
702, they tend to wish for things they saw and that excited them the companies actually manipulate the children because ,18
703, the younger ones aged  cant decide whether it is something they really need or if it was simply shown in an advertisement so should as a ,18
704," this advertising be forbidden
personally i dont consider this ",10
705, children are nothing but the medium to their parents money enterprises have chosen this method of advertising because they are on current with nowadays methods of raising a child and that televisions are often a part of it if the parents now think of this advertising as ethically wrong one ,12
706," has to think about who is letting  year olds sit in front of the tv so it is actually the parents duty to raise their kinds sensible to what they are seeing or hearing for sure children are manipulated by exciting advertisements and are used to make their parents buy these products but if parents are upset with that they shouldnt allow their child to be manipulated instead of blaming companies of their poor skills raising their child they should put more attention to what they are transmitting their child and enlighten them about possible manipulating advertising even at that young age
letting a two year old sit in front of the television is not the right way to silent them and there are a lot of other methods to use ",12
707, excite ones child so play with your kids ,1
708, telling media to stop such advertising you dont need to worry about something that has no impact on you or your children,10
709," with the following statement that television advertising  in the age between  should not be allowed

in this case you have to know that television advertising can be negative for the growing up of little children because in many television advertising there are bad stuff its right that little children in the age between  dont understand much about a lot of things but ",8
710," that the television advertising would influence them indirect in their growing up
on the other ",12
711, its alright if there is television advertising ,10
712," for their age group but if theres television advertising for teenageradults its not okay anymore 
television or any other media stuff is a big factor and influence in our world for all people you have to think how little children feel aswell but not many persons do that they only think they are small they dont think they understand nothing in their age and for them it doesnt matter how they feel but you have to see it in a different view little children maybe know whats going on in this situation and television advertising is sometimes not always a part of their growing up  maybe they dont understand a lot but they know or better to say they feel all of that whats happened 
in my opinion the worse thing and you cant do it aswell is that nobody asks them how they feel or if they want that all people think of themselves and this is in character very egoisticselfish
in conclusion you see sometimes it is important that television advertising  little children in some cases if its not television advertising for adultsteenagers but summarized it should not be allowed
  
     
  
",12
713,"they controll our childreen
nowerdays childreen spend lots of their time watching television as many smaller childreen aged  believe in evrerthing they hear or see because they are not able to bild their own opinion ",19
714," they are a popular victim of advertising companies
  there are ads for toys kids food and the newest sport articles the ads are often  straight s young childreen with the use of childish language and by creating a happy and concsious atmospere with backround music and certain matching colors in the spot 
it leads to different behavior of your childreen as they want more and more because they get to see the newest and hottest toys erveryday ",11

thats why ",16
720, there should be certain rules for the advertising companies which they have to follow ,10

on the one ",6
725, that the television advertising which is  could lead to a higher television consume at a younger age because the young children are willing to watch the advertising which is meant ,8
726," for them in this case they would spend more time inside the house and not in the nature playing with their friends the parents have to keep an eye on their children to protect them against too much television advertising and television consume
on the other ",15
727, that it is not that necessary to not allow television advertising  because it is in the ,8
728, of the parents or everyone else ,19
729, how to handle this situation in our modern times and the technical improvements it is clear that companies search for ways to improve their advertising aswell that is why they use the televison to spread their advertising for their products all over the country on the easy way with putting it into the televison in my opinion the companies hope to reach with that kind of advertising with cute little children in it the parents and make them buy that product for their child too or to buy it just because that advertising make them feel in some way ,12
730, parents identify easily with televison advertising which is set up like this because they think about their own child directly but ,12
731, everybody have to think about that statement on his own to have an own opinion about it i can not make a ,6
732, in that case because i can understand the companies acting in that way but i can ,6
733," think of the fears people might have about television advertising  
all in all it is a exercise for all of us to find a good way to handle this situation because the technology will improve and improve and there will be more and more companies using this way of advertising",10
734," that it would be difficult to stop televison advertising which is  in the ages 
televison advertising could be helpful especialy for parents if they donâ´t have an idea concerning to give a present to their child

735, watching telivison advertising in these ages can lead to the missing ability to appreciate things which are advertised in the tv ,12

my opinion to this topic is that televsion  advertising directed  should be stopped furthermore the parents have to have an eye on their children if they watch tv watching tv in these ages can ",5

739,nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches tv in the television is ,16

first you should allow this kind of avertising because it helps the parents to buy things which fit with the specific wishes of their children so the little child can watch tv and ",5
741, the adverts it says that it likes to have this and that therefor the child doesnt have to speak well its enough to say i want that and it ,11
742," on the advert then the parents can simply buy the object 
next this kind of advertising helps the companies to improve their sales and adress the specific group of people which the products are made for so they would do babytoyadvertisments only for young children aged 

on the other ",11
743, this adverts shouldnt be allowe because these young children cant do anything with this adverts the children get irritated and dont know how to react as an adolscent you know how to deal with adverts and that their content isnt always the truth but children ,2
744," young children dont know 
more important theses adverts influence the childrens mind and their psychological development thats not good children may believe whats said in the advert plus the strategy of advertisment is to create needs and children cant deal with that 

all in all adverts for children aged  shouldnt be allowed because of their negative effects on the children they create wrong needs and slow down the psychological development they only help companies to improve their profits and this is not good we shou",2
745," inform you about television advertising
i am ",16
746," with this statement because the televison advertising have many negatives effects
the ",8
747," one is that the children often want the object in the televion they think that is cool and they often try to convince their parents if they dont get the object they start to cry or they are sad about the desission of their parents the parents dont like to see their children cry and they bought the object for them
forthermore the childrens often dont need the object the seller push their object in the advertising because he know what he have to say he only tells the posi and the children see that and in result they get it from their parents
in addition the parents should explain theire children how they have to handel with advertising the children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money if they dont learn this they could have problems in their life 
all in all the advertising isnt good for the young people it stress the parents and it could destroy the entership between the family and friends 
",12
748,"television advertising  should not be allowed thats the way many people think about the influnce of media like televison on young childreni dont think it should be not allowed but i am not the opinion that its positive for them

 every parent should decide if he lets his child watching things  which can be dangerous for the development of his own child not everybody sees that as negativ because a lot of people doesnt believe that children ",5

on one ",8
755, itâ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children because the children in the age of  canâ´t say anything about there own opinion because they are to young to say it ,2
756," children maybe donâ´t want advertising that is  them the children aged  are far too young to think about there own opinion and to think about advertising being  them
on the other ",2
757, you could say that itâ´s good to direct the advertising toward young children ,2
758, they canâ´t say if they want to do that because itâ´s the only way to direct an advertising toward young children itâ´s ,2
759," important for the television advertising to do that
all in all ",16
760, it might be important for the television to direct advertising toward those young children,2
761,"young children should play outside more often that is sentence every child has heard a lot of times in her or his young years but why should they play outside

now a days a television and the outraging development of the technology is very normal to the young generation and there parent generation the only generation is the elders generation whom are not used to technology at all there are a few ones that do not have a probleme with the change but the most do so the snetence above is mostly to hear form the older generation  
the children should be allowed to watch television and use all the technology the presnt has to offer because we are living in a constant development of technology and in the future there will be more of that some say that it is all going to be compromized and going to be technical 
the only thing parents could do is to set a limit of tv watching for there children ",17
762, they can be social and hang out with there friends actually that is a thing that every child is going to do in that young age they are going to the kindergarden or to a kita and will only be watching tv in the mo0ments ,9
763, they are at home as you can see there are a lot of times where they do not have time watch tv ,15
764," they shopuld have a time where they are allowed to watch there series or there favorite movie that is what makes the children happy now a days 
furthermore more many child series and movies on tv teach many life lessons ",15
765," that the children will be prepared for life and their social life for example dora or other series there are some episodes where they solve math problemes teach you how to deal with strangers or hoe to treat your friends 
fact is that the series that they watch on tv prepare for school
the only thing that could be held against that statement is that there are ",4
766, horror movies and other bad stuff that children at that age should not watch for that parents can just install a code for those channels ,15
767, the children will not have a chance to watch these also to hold against the ,19
768, that children that watch tv are not interfering with there family anymore the parents could watch the sereies with them and make a game out of it ,15
769," they will make tv watching a family activity

in the end i can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 25 must be allowed to interfier with that in the future there will be more and more technology and we can not forbidm the children to not live that life",17
770,"in the following essay i will show negativ reasons and examples for the statement  television advertising  should not be allowed
in my opinion i ",8
771, with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples the ,6
772, reason is that young children at the age  can not understand the main statement from the television because there brain can not translate or understand the film which is shown as a ,17
773, it should not be allowed my ,10
774, reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours ,17
775, they would  not focus on there future work lives the ,14
776, is that the television is a media which is lying fluently to have better quotes of the public to become famous and rich the children would grow up with wrong information ,17
777, they could understand the truth of the television and its ,15
778, on their there future lives could be mainly destroyed or would stay on the lies of the television my last reason is that children at the age of  are defintiv to young to look tv because of the risks and the ,17

yours jason",6
780,"this essay will be about the ban of advertising spots on television directing to children between the age of two and five

on the one ",8
781, children are not able to think critically about the advertisement they cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant for example children do not need their own playstation ,12
782, they are really young they do not know that it is unhealthy if they use it too much ,0
783," that they get problems with their eyes et cetera  
on the other ",14
784," if the parents take care of them and pay attention the children will not get any problems but they will have fun with their new toy or other things 
but children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them they will be really unhappy for example if a child sees a plastic horse on tv running around and jumping it would think that this horse is really able to do that but it is not furthermore there would be some children who want to get everything they see on tv and for poor parents it would be really difficult to explain why their friends already own these things which seem to be important
but for the industry it is easier to persuade children than adults who reflect their actingthey would not profit of this ban ",12
785, watching tv for young children is dangerous and unhealthy ,17
786," these advertisements should not be allowed because for the children there is no benefit their health and happyness would suffer and the profit of the industry is not worth it 
 



",2
787,in the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices in the following text ,7
788," which speak for or against the advertisment which is directed 

the biggest ",16
789, against the advertisment is that children are very easy to influece because they do not have enough experience to know what is wrong and what is write furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see ,2
790," the advertisment could have negative effets on the children
on the other ",2
791, children are learning very much in this part of life ,4
792, the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products but this ,16
793, is just valuable if the advertisment is supposed for children and does not have strongly influecing parts maby the companies could make an advertisment which gives the child useful information the information could be about important topics in our contemporary society ,12
794," about the responsable thing eith the nature

in conlusion ",6
795, that  a special advertisment for children should only be allowed if the advertisment is controlled by the parents or a kind of institute in the ,8
796,television  young people should  be allowed but the children should watch tv not ,17
797," often like adults because they have not enough concentration to watch an hour a day moreover it is bad for the childrens eyes young children must play with other friends and should not sit at home to watch television but often young children can learn something by watching television an example is that they learn to treat the other children in the kindergarten better or learn to say different words also little children learn what is forbidden and what is right but they should watch series which are made for young children with an age of if they look criminal series it is not good for their evolution and they can missundertand what the people are doing 
televison advertising is not good for the childish brain because they do not know what is important and what is not but i do not think that it is bad if they watch it
i ",17
798, with this statement because it is not bad if little child seeing television advertising in this age but they should not watch it ,8
799,"this essay is about the topic if television advertising  should be allowed or not

companies which sell ",8
800, toys or games are doing much television advertising  children are easy to manipulate and if they want something really bad they often get it because their parents can not stand their cute child so the companies make much money with these advertising ,11
801," at chrismas time so it is kind of good for the industry and the tv channels

but kids should not think they can have everything and those whose parents have not much money should not be shown what they miss besides should the media not be directed to ",15
802," young kids children in this age should go outside and enjoy their childhood and do not sit inside infront of the television or other media 

i would prefer it if the advertising of toys and other childish things would be directed to the parents and not to the child ",2
803, that the parents can choose what they want to buy and the kid is happy about that one thing and does not want every toy in the advertising  ,1
804," the answer for this is very difficult
first off all it seems to manipulate the young children because the things named in the advertisings are used to atract these young childrenthis works because they donâ´t even think about the price and if they really need these things
nevertheless these children arenâ´t allowed  canâ´t even buy these things by themselfe
so ",11
805, the parents are the people who have to buy these things and have to spend their money on this but ,18
806, they donâ´t do this their children start crying and behave absolutly stupid so ,19
807," children and parents are mad
on the other ",19
808," advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television
that is the normal reason to produce advertisings it is the same ",16
809," you see some advertisings for adults like an advertising for some good beer or a new video game also trailers of movies works like this  they have to make people interested in the topic of the movie
nevertheless chilrden are much more open minded for advertisings ",11
810, it works much better with them ,6
811,television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society there are some good ,16
812, many bad ones for the children in this young age children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life television advertising can be good for a children whose parents are very busy and do not have many time for their child many television channels have learn programms for children where children can learn ,5
813, languages or easy vocabulary but it is not good for the children to just sit in front of a tv and watch channels they need influences of their parents and of other kids they need to go out to the playground play with their friends and get social ,4
814, that children who sit the whole day in front of a television will not educate as good as the ones who go out and learn from their parents and from their activities the other children will not learn how to get friends and to communicate with different people they will ,4
815, not have a good relation to their parents because they did not spend much time with them ,14
816, that it is really important for a children to have a good relation to their mother and father the position of parents is ,14
817, important for children because they learn from them and act like them when they do not spend much time with their parents ,4
818, they are young it will have aftermath ,13
819," they are adults when they go to school they will possibly be a misfit beacause they did not learn how to make friends and be social 
to conclusion ",9
820, with that statement because the television advertising is not good for a well education of the children and the relation to family,8
821,"the question weather television advertising  should be allowed or not inst that easy to answer 
on the one ",8
822, small that they arent able to reconize the ,13
823, that they get manipulated plus the ,14
824, that is pretty easy to do it because they dont have th ability to reflect things on the other ,13
825," ads can be an insparation for the kids independet from their parents they maybe get introduces to some different things which show them the diversity of the world 
an other negative ",12
826, is that the childrens arent abled to judge things regarding their quality or the need of it they are simply very easy to impress which makes them making desicions about spending money they dont have and can cause a lot of frustration if they dont get it but here we are at the ,18
827, where the parents take place they are ,19
828, the one who decide weather to buy the advirtised product or not they have ,16
829, the exercise to teach their kids the handling of money the use treatment and importance of things and the moral behind it ,18
830," that they have the powerneed to change their kids minds 
all in one it is a big industry which is interestes in the childs opinion because they are good selling customers it can be seen as regarding to the moral false or as regarding to the industry good 
in my opinion there is nothing bad about directing television advertising to the children because they get into the diversity which exists and learn about the parents how to handle it the only problem which occures is that if the parents dont theach their children they might get too much manipulated and materialistic ",12
831,should television advertising be  this is a well discused question and ,10
832," i try to answer it 
on the one ",6
833, of showing these advertisings in tv is that the products have mostly a pedagogic ,16
834, the child learns new things there are ,4
835, dolls that talk with the child and it learns to speek another good thing about the advertising is that ,11
836, the parents see them and might find new toys for their kids something they might not found without watching the advertise on the other ,11
837, children of this age have a high level of influence the companies could sell them whatever they want if they make the advertise colored and happy enough at his age children can not decide what is good and what is bad ,2
838, war is good they maybe think this is true also children in young years should not watch television too much making advertising for them shows that there is a high number of children watching tv and if the companies would stop it maybe not as much children would watch television watching too much tv is at this age not really good for the evolution last but not least the kids can become mad ,17
839, they see what the advertising offers and what they have in their room ,16
840,"toys they wont be as happy as they were because the children want more and more things but can not always get them from their parents
in my opinion television advertising directed  should not be allowed ",12
841, kids at this age should go outside and play and not watch tv the wohle day and if they do they should not be influenced by consumorientated companies which just want to earn money and do whatever they can do to get it,15
842," discuss the question if television advertising s young children should be allowed or not 
the ",8
843, against ads for young children is that they will probably not understand what the purpose of an ad is ,2
844," they will want to have the advertised item this will be expensive for the parents or the child and the parents are going to fight over it
an ",18
845," for advertising s young children is that they will see new things to play with and maybe they will get a bigger imagination or just new ideas 
but watching too much tv ",12
846, is not advisable for young children because they should play outside and think for their own ,11
847," just getting their stories delivered through the tv
but ",3
848," for these ads is that children can choose a new food they want to try or a new game they want to play because they have seen it in an advertisment they will quicker learn new things
the ",11
849," against advertising is that the companies who make these ads should not use the notknowing of the children to make more money
but the opposite of that ",8
850, fot these ads if you see it from the perspective of the companies who ,16
851, gain money gaining more money because of these ads is good for the companies and following from that ,16
852," good for the economy of the country in which these ads are allowed in
another ",10
853," for these ads is that if the children watch tv they are occupied because with different ads the tv program is different from day to day so the parents can do housework like cooking or doing laundry without really caring for the child for a few minutes
the last ",12
854," against ads  is  
in my opinion the advertising  should not be allowed because the companies should not use young children in that way to get more money ",10
855,"although to mutch consume of digital media like smartphones computer and television isâ´t good at all for young children because it takes big influence on the way their brains develob in a negative way so responsibl parents shold act in a way not let their children whatch all of this junk tv 
but if children of the age of two to fife years whatch tv in germany they are often whatching superrtl and in this childfriendly program they publish many scenes showing violence and there is a lot of advertising to and in the advertisin they show the newest and coolest toys and ",17
856, these young children look at them they emidiatly whant to have them ,11
857, in some famylies they get the new toys as quick as they publish them but some parends would say no and ,1
858, normality of violence showen in tv the children start to behave the same and not just at home ,17
859," in the kindergarden and at their friends homes 
in my opinion advertising should be banned out of childfriendly tv and they should ",5
860, renew and think about what they show in this kind of tv and if this might be realy childfrtiendly ,15
861, televesion towards young children in the age  should not be allowed because children in that age can be manipulated very easily they can only watch it and cannot understand what is shown in the advertisement when there is a happy child in their age which is playing with a specific toy from a specific brand for the advertisement of this brand the child wants to play with this toy too and it will try to make his parents give him that specific toy because it canâ´t really understand that the advertisement it trying to make this effect when an older child is watching television and sees an advertisement it can understand the things that take place in the advertisement and can see that the advertisement is only an child who is only playing with this toy for the advertisement and they can make a differce between toys they really want and toys they only want because the child in the advertisement seemed to be happy ,2
862, playing with this toy but ,1
863, televison advertisement towards young children cannot be forbidden because we live in a democratic state where everybody can publish what they wrote or filmed ,8
864, you can only stop advertisement towards young cildren ,2
865, it is affecting them in a negative way and ,19
866, you can only stop a specific spot but the most advertisements are not affecting the children in a negative way they only make the children want a toy and ,2
867, that is a very important way for companys to sell their products because this is the most affective and ,16
868, the easiest way to reach the children and earn money by selling them specifc toys so ,1
869, advertisement for children sould not be allowed ,2
870, it is affecting them in a negative way and sets them under a bad influence but ,19
871, televison advertisement towards young children is not allowed it doesnâ´t stop that young children can be manipulated very easily and want most of the things they see so ,5
872, advertisement towards young children should be allowed ,2
873,i think children from 1 to 5 shouldnt watch television at all they should go outside and play and not sit inside and watch television in our society today all kids just sit inside and play with their tablats or phones that is very bad they dont receive the experience from playing outside the advanteruse in the forests or the scary dog from your neighbor they just knew the internet my generation ist i think the last who doesnt have phones or something in teir childhood we play outside with our friends and doesnt text over facebook or snapchat its scary because ,17
874, you say to your child stop watching television and go outside  they have no idea what to do advertising in the television is not just bad for kids from 1 to 5 its ,12
875," bad for adults the advertiser are very tricky and they know exactly ho to catch the people to buy things from them advertising should be stoped but  thats impossible because the concerns are too big and cannot be stoped advertising should not be allowed for kids up to 18 because its very dangerous and many kids buying things that they dont knew they really buy
finally i think it should be stoped but its impossible  advertsing is too big in the society today the only thing we can do is to take our kids away from the tv and take our time with them ",12
876, they dont want watch tv anymore,15
877,the following essay deals with the topic of allowing television advertising for young children from age  there are different reasons ,8
878," supporting this advertising or not 
a good ",16
879, of television advertisement is the ,16
880, that some products for children can be presented on tv and the children will talk to their parents about it if the ads would only run on channels for adults they probably would not listen or react to it as much as the young kids do many adults simply do not watch television advertisement having the children informed through television would be specifically great for selling the products ,12
881," as knowing all the products as a parent 
there are more bad things about this topic ",11
882, the children could be annoyed in their young years by this form of advertisement it would always interrupt their shows and they really just would not like it at all in germany there is a tvchannel called kika which does not show any ads it makes watching the channel way better and the kids are not confronted with the breaks for advertisement in addition children would only see the product and what they are worth they would be teached to think about prices and owning products more than thinking about feelings and ethics they would want to have everything and that is a bad thing for our society ,12
883," because it should be all about what you think and how happy you are and not about owning every toy or all the money you can get 
all together i would ",1
884, that television advertising should not be allowed on channels for children and for children ,8
885, it teaches wrong ideas of living in abundance and owning everything it is the parents work and job to teach their growing youngs that things are just that much worth as you think they are and the advertisement shows a different idea just thinking about capitalism and making profit ,12
886,"it would be hard to classify the advetisement is it for children aged  or for older kids the companys sponsering the ads could just claim that theyâ´re not aiming for the younger children but it would be very good if those television advertising would not be allowed anymore because those little children are very easy to manipulate
for companys who produce products for kids aged thwo to five it would be a huge ",2
887," if they canâ´t advertise their product anymore and would damage the financial situation of them 
on the other ",16
888," are the parents the ones who have to pay for the toys sweets etc of their children and the company use the kids because they are easier to manipulate to get the money from their parents using kids as things to get their parents money is ethicly bad
",18
889, it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward young children because they are innocent they cant think of the ,8
890, of their own acting and if they see something they like they want it this effect can be used to advert something with a lot of coulor and shining but the  year olds dont know that the ad just wants them to buy things advertisement for adult people is oaky they know the sence of an ad   ,11
891,television advertising on specific products for children like candys or toys is designed exactly for their younger minds you can find this image ,12
892, inside a supermarket the sweets are placed right ,0
893, to the counter with the reason that the children ask their parents ,19
894, paying their products if they can have some haribo ,16
895," the leaders of the market know exactly that they can play mindgames with younger people and earn more money in this way 
one reason for this is that young children dont have the experience to see if a product of their favour is useful or useless for them they ",18
896," cant tell if its worth the prize of it  it is a skill that a human being achieves together with the process of growing up so adults are choosing more wisely which product they can effort and which not
the only question is if the advert is for children and has no other thoughts behind or is designed to earn more money with a product that ",11
897," the job of the parents to inform their kids to not believe everything what television adverts want to tell them
so i would say that television advertising designed for young children is probably a bad thing for their parents money bag but should be allowed ",5
898, for the reason that adverts for children most of the time dont want to steal your money and just want to show the product like every advert for an other product ,2
