10,"advertising for children aged 

first of all i do not believe that advertisings for children are really useful for ",1
11, advertising for young children is not really a big problem because there are enough possibilities for the parents to make sure that they do not get influenced by that ,1
12, advertising shouldnt be for young children because they dont really understand ,1
13, of the people creating those advertisements could be that children are just younger people ,1
14, the advertising which is made for children is ,1
15, many other advertising that isnt only directed to children aged  ,1
16," a lot of advertising  children aged 
now we have to ask us if this should be allowed or not

if kids see advertising for children they could not know that advertising is often just for making money for the companies and often what they promise in the adverstising is unreal so they get a wrong view 
also ",1
17," children who are that young are not old enough to understand the sense of an advertisement 

in my eyes young children should ",1
18, that makes the advertising for the young children in any kind different from the one for older once for example ,1
19, for kids the content of their advertisement is often not even useful because they are about toys or sweets which,1
20," kids aged  cannot really get what is said to them in television what happens only is that they are like oh i really want that 
children these days are watching tv more than they are playing in the woods making them seeing all these things like toys movies or something which are showed off in the best way possible would make the situation worse they may even spend more time in front of a display
but because of that trend that young kids want to watch more tv marketing functions on television 

my personal opinion is young children may should not be confronted with direct advertising we live in a time where marketing works like that ",2
21," the children are to young to understand the meaning of those advertisings this huge industry is not made for  those young candidats

in my oppinion the children at this age shouldnt even watch television tv can be a relly big addiction 


",2
22, television advertising for young children can be dangerous and confusing for them sometimes in television advertisments things are happening which cant possibly happen in real life younger children may not understand that and ,2
23, you look at the whole picture everyone can realize that the television advertising  children does more harm than good while it can help some people figure out what their children would like to have it usually just leaves the child wanting something that they usually dont get because they cant have every toy they see on tv or because the parents are just not able to afford it and that is not all the advertising often ,2
24, add that television advertising has changed a lot in the recent years lots of them provide us a false picture of our society which has a negative impact on us young children may feel forced to follow a certain goal of the ad ,2
25, doesnt make sense to produce such advertisings because children dont or shouldnt spend more time watching television than their parents moreover children cant really react on the advertisings because they dont have money to buy something by themselves ,2
26, of televison advertising children in such young ages can be manipulatet very easily and many companies do that to make money many children can not decide what they need and what things they do not need and ,2
27, is that they just should not watch television at this age the producers want to manipulate the brains of this young children with this adverts but i think its a money waste and a thing which makes no sense to me generally they wont understand anything or they just recognize the pictures and ,2
28, there is worse stuff in television children could get to see than an advertisement towards them which would be toys and stuff furthermore just by seeing an advertisement it doesnt have to mean that they buy it use it or consume it most of the kids in this age havent even got money ,2
29," children donâ´t get what they want they just watch tv because this is an easy method for the parents to calm them down the parents canâ´t force what exactly their children are watching in some cases the children watch ads which are not really appropriate for them the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed canâ´t be managed but it can be forced by the parents i think with the following reasons

the televison thinks that showing the ad is going to make the children wanting to watch the movie or whatever it was advertised for the children convince their parents to go to watch the movie together because they donâ´t want to miss it in the moviebreaks there are new ads which are doing exactly the same again they get addicted to the television the children watch more and more tv as they grow up they learn a lot from it but ",2
30,concerning the given statement about television advertising toward young children people have differnt opinions some are convinced they should not be allowed ,3
31,many parents said that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed there are many reasons which are supporting these statement it could be helpful for young children if television advertising should not be allowed in the following ,3
32,television advertising  young childern aged  should not be allowed this statement should be discussted very well because children havent built an own opinion ,3
33,a controversal topic nowadays is television advertising some people think that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed in the following ,3
34," good that television advertising  aged  years and if it should not be allowed in the following part i will explain and answer these questions
firstly children get influence by television and specially young children who arent educated or who start to learn are a part of these children aged  years start to speak and to create their own personality 
so that there are ",3
35," talk about is television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
first of all we need to understand why televison advertising toward children coul be a problem in presentday society in my opinion parents who allow their children wathing tv a lot during the day take a big risk about them concerning the own opinion of their children they may get influenced really fast and even stop thinking on their own if they realised that they may get everything they want to know in a simple tvshow this is really dangerous because they probably do not even realise that they are influenced and they may thing that everything they see in a tvshow is totally true this could be a problem for parents if the children get influenced really bad and than want to have everything they see in television advertising or even thing that it is totally necerssary to have like this special toy they showed ",3
36, it should be allowed that children aged  watch advertising in tv but there are reasons for ,3
37,"the statementtelevision advertising  aged  should not be allowed is a dificult theme for the childrens and for the parents an advertising with the television is a good option which every body could see but should it be allowed for young childrens
first you have to say that television advertising  is a reason for the them to watch more television or play some games in the internet because they recognize that somebody directly talk to them they  will sit more inside in the house and maybe dont go outside and play with some friends in there age you ",3
38,"today i would like to discuss the statement which says that television advertising  who are aged  should not be allowed

firstly the children could be manipulated easily children like this age dont have any life experiences ",3
39,"television advertising toward young children is an often discussed topic these daysin the following text i am goingt to state my opinion if television advertising toward young children aged  should be allowed or not
first of all it has become a normal thing that most of the children are allowed to wacht tv a few years ago like back ",3
40, its for them and not for the parents or others there are many adventages as disadventages,4
41, the parents are the ones who ,4
42, a responsibility by each parents that they can find a good way to handle the ,4
43, the parents do what the want the children are able to manipulate their parents but ,4
44, is is the renponsibility of the parents,4
45, the parents are responsible for their children ,4
46, theres the possibility that the parents decide right fo their child and ,4
47," the parents should decide whats the best for their child 
a situation where ",4
48, each parent should can think about that problem on their own and ,4
49, it is the responsibility of the parents ,4
50, young children are not able to decide what is real or what is wrong there are lots of toys in the advertising which are presented in a fantastic way ,5
51," thing is that children are not able to be manipulated from advertisment if they want toys they say it not matter where in the store or if they watch  television 
it is usally for children that if the see something they want in the television they forget it as soon as the advertisement is over so parents do not have to fear that they will not stop wanting that 

the ",5
52, not able to buy it alone so the televison advertising for the young children are more directed to the parents of them and they can decide if they want to buy the thing in the advertisment or not the people dont need this sort of advertising because young people dont watch that much television children  see an advertisment on television about a toy and ,5
53," its not a fair thing to show them something like that and they dont even know whats going on they just see the toy and think it looks cool and want to buy it 
also the parents get into trouble with those advertisments their children want to buy constantly new stuff because they see it on television and maybe ",5
54," your children always desire the fanciest toy so what to do about it
for the advertisors young children are easy to connect with because they do not have such a complex believe and decision making system as most adults do therfore it is quite compelling for companies to make cheap advertisements with good chance to succed on the other ",5
55,first of all there is the main problem that advertising  children has the effect that they ask their parents to buy this toy they are interested in secondary there are some parents who arent able to buy these toys because of financial reasons ,5
56, they end up buying this toy from the advertisements and this results in children getting spoiled and a spoiled child can be a bit of a problem this is why many parents dont allow their younger kids to watch television at all because of these advertisements buts this might not be a problem at all ,5
57," its  them the young children can only understand everything through their vision
when parents see the advertising which often is about some kind of toy that every children wants to have they could take that as an idea for a birthday present or something like that which would be an ",5
58, comes running begging her or his parents to buy him that toy than a lot of parents give in to have at a least a moment of rest of course this is the parents decision wether or not they give in to the nagging but because the children are objected to all these advertisings it encourages them to not be happy with what they already have psychologically it makes them want something they dont have and ,5
59, firstly the advertisement influents the opinion of the children they will annoy their parents to buy the toys and the parents dont have another choice and will buy them there arent only good toys that the children can use in the advertisement they ,5
60, important for the children to have a own view of new things they learn,6
61, the children can learn with other things ,6
62, young children learn very cuickly and ,6
63, learning at young age with the help of their parents would be more effective concerning experience and knowledge,6
64," they look television they learn something and we all know young children learn fast

finally ",6
65, children are learning very much in this part of life ,6
66, raising them up properly obviously the children are confronted with lots of information but because of them being ,6
67, more think to learn for them and it has very much better things to do the children has to learn things ,6
68, the children can learn new things and they can discover a lot but ,6
69," the wont learn the important things and it is ways easier to learn stuff at the age of two or five

after this ",6
70,young children get fascinated way faster than older people do often they see things they like and than they want them immediately they do not consider if they really need something or if they just want to have them because it looked cool in the television so if they see an advertising they like they go to their parents to ask if they could go and by it as many parents can not restist to fullfill their childrens wishes they have to go and buy the stuff sometimes the children literally have to beg their parents to buy it ,7
71, very young they might be that fascinated that they only want to buy the things advertised and at a age of five children might convince their parents buying the things at an age of two they are not as the parents can tell them off and they get used to dont get everything they want to have further in this time now the media plays a bigger and bigger role when the children are used to it and its influencing qualities ,7
72, they watch six advertisings every day they will maybe like the half of them and want to have all those products adults sometimes think longer about what they could buy but children just want to have things ,7
73, they see something that looks nice or toys which other children play with they want to have it they believe everything which is showed in television such young children shouldt be influenced by advertisments it is bad for the children if they are faced with all the advertisment it can influence their learning and growing up process badly young children cant buy things themself ,7
74, is that children in this young age can not understand the advertising completely and they want to have all of it if their parents would allow this here is an example if there is a toy ,7
75, they get in contact with everything which is showed days later they maybe want their mom to buy this delicious chocolate snack or the talking doll which the advertising showed in the best possible way to impress children there are even psychologist which are looking for this best way children in this young ages are very naive they dont really care about the prize the healthiness or the usefullness if the other child in the advertising has fun with it or if it says that the chocolate snack is very yummy they spontaneously feel the need for it as a ,7
76, they beg their parents to buy this specific toy ,8
77, young children see the advertisment they likely want to have this exact toy but ,8
78, their child says he want that new toy if he had seen an advertisement and think its cool to have this toy or he really will play with this toy it is ,8
79, childrem aged  see these toys on the television they mostly want it ,8
80, many difficulties to accept a no so many parents would do and buy everything for their kids and like this the child wants the parents to buy everything they see in the television even if they will play just one time with this toy because ,8
81, they see all that new kind of toy which seem to better than the toy they already have they ask their partents to buy them a new one as we can imagine the parents arent happy to get something new again ,8
82," the have the urge to get this toy because parents like to make their children happy they buy them new stuff 

however ",8
83," the see a toy which looks very awesome and high quality but in real it is like plastic

moreover childrens want more toy and have more whises for birthday when they see something very cool in television the want that and they ask their parents allnthe time to get it ",8
84, they most likely want their parents to buy them that specific toy this    ,8
85, time the child mentioned is in a store with its parents it will definitely want the new toy and because it is in the age ,8
86," they are potential customers  not the children themselves

in conclusion ",9
87, working for my money children should be just children and not manipulated by advertising ,9
88, the children are just an unexperienced source of money and the companies use that to get the most profit they can with that ,9
89," time the will try to make avertything perfect for their children and buy more thing as it needs 

in conlucsion it should not be allowed to advertise directly the children it is unhealty and does not make much sense it would be better ",9
90, the economy use the childrens for selling their products because ,9
91," the children need to learn to get on with this situation that they can not always get what they want 
and if they will never see an advertisement on the television and ",9
92, it shouldnt be allowed to advertise directly to children but the impact of the children depends on them and there parents h,9
93, it is right to say that companys should not make use of the naivity of young children the problem resulting out of this is that children want things ,9
94, children are an important part of todays economy they should not be confronted with advertsing  them in public media,9
95, inform the small children what is new so the companys are able to influence the life of the children which is not good our children are part of the economy ,9
96, it is wellknown that young children talk a lot it could be possible for them to scream for the products in the advertisment to their parents untill they are willing to buy those things i guess that is cleary what the advertisment industry is aiming for they try to influence the childrens mind ,10
97, advertising s young children aged between two and five is not really fair the products in advertisements do not look the same in reality as they do on tv and most of the time the product is not able to do the things it does on tv and very young children are not old enough to see that they can be tricked very easily and that is the ,10
98, are watching those advertisings and are old enough to decide if the product shown is useful for them or their children or not this results in companies trying to achieve the ability to convince parents and not children if they are trying to convince children they want to manipulate them ,10
99," is that a young child thinks that heshe has to have the product and if the childe does not get the product it could be less cool
 
                  in my opinion the advertising directed  should not be allowed ",10
100, the parents who have to grab into their wallet and buy it children may get overwhelmed by all those products and want them all which could turn into some unpleasants row between parent and childall in all i think it is unneccesary to show an advertisment to such young people becaus,10
101, every child wants the thing in the advertisment there are huge parts in industries which are specialisted exactly to manipulate the advertisment and thats not correct at all and in any case the children are most effected of it and the problem here is that the childs parents dont teach the child that this exact thing isnt good yes maybe the parents are the howl problem in this case sometimes the child is ,10
102," 
but critical voices say that children get confused by these advertisings made for them they dont understand if the ad is saying the truth or not they cant make this difference after they have seen an advertising they will go to their parents and ask them to buy the shown product if they wont the child will cry until they do it and exactly this mechanism is planned by the company which has shown the advertising and because this is ",10
103," advertisments try to persuade our mind to buy something the most people can think against that and deside for themselves whats good and what they need but young children are not able to think for themselves and want everything they see in the advertisments especially if it is  the  years old we should forbit this to protect the children from all this things

",10
104, later on the children grows up and does not need it anymore parents should decide themselfs if a young children really needs these products or if they just want if because the televison said it if the advertising is inaprobiate or not desinged for the young crowd it should not be allowed anyway because they can heavily inflict the mental state of the children and manipulate them to do wrong things or buy illegal productsgood advertising is rare but effective ,10
105, it is unfair to manipulate young children to buy products they do not need in the advertisement the product looks ,10
106,nowdays advertisment seems to be everywhere whether in magazines radio or on television companies are always trying to reach for people as annoying as it sometimes seems it is an important thing ,11
107,every day we are confronted with advertising of some sort advertisement has become an indespensible way for companies to make their products visible to potential costomers the aim of advertisements is ,11
108,advertisement is something we all know as we are confronted with it everywhere on the streets on your computer on your mobile phone and ,11
109,nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches tv in the television is ,11
110,advertising is nowadays a big part of many peoples lives and today ,11
111,when you turn on your television nowadays you more often are confronted with ads that advertise ,11
112," advertising on television
but these advertisings ",11
113, regarding the topic of advertising ,11
114,nowadays advertisements can be hardly avoided you see them everywhere on the streets in magazines on websites and ,11
115,in todays society advertising is a big part of television these advertisment target different types of people and interests and as it comes some ,11
116," which makes people think about the new type of situation we are confronted with at the moment

nowadays technology is used and found everywhere and ",12
117,in my generation we often talk about the developement from technology it is no secret that people today are more connected to technologys than ever ,12
118,in our society technology brings big dvantaged on daily bases but unfortunately there are ,12
119,in the society of today children are getting confronted with new technology without much choice of there parents or even themselves technology is all around us it helps us in our everyday life it entertains us ,12
120, i see for this problem is a change in the thinking of the society as a whole todays world is too much s technology which reached a peak with the ,12
121,"nowadays i see more and more children with smartphones and ipads at home they are confirmed with televisionthey can not go outside to play with friends the technic is nowadays a part of society the children of this generation have an issue

television is a particulary part of our society important news all over the world arrive us with tv we get an overview of the situation of the world and this is important for our education but ",12
122, much electronic devices and young children get involved more and more ,12
123," is that they get confortable with the electronic devises of this century wich are important for the whole life like for jobs and the future

124,one of the biggest problem in our todays society is the influence of technologie by watching television or by using your mobile phone in your life and your attitude this ,12
125,electronic rules the world more and more people are connected to electronic stuff ,12
126,"the advertising in television can be seen from everybodey who is watching the right program also childre4n between two and five years old are able to see this advertisment is that good for them

advertisments have an influence on everybody who is watching the adult people are able to know how to work and live with these information but young children maybe arenâ´t able to see the difference between the shown world in the advertisments and the realitiy they canâ´t understand the task of advertisements and interpretate them in a wrong way these wrong understandig can have a bad influense for there coming life they maybe can understand from an advertisment about chocolate or other sweets that unhealthy food is good and makes happy the advertisement gives the children no chance to get informed about the negative ",13
127,"
advertises are often shown in the tv they adress all ages even really young children and that might be a problem as many criticers say 
young children are easily influencable by television advertising so they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour 
on the other ",13
128," to forbit advertising  children on television

first of all it has to be mention that the advertising for children often is very unrealistic because of this the children get a wrong bild of the world and learn things which arent right
but in case of this it must be said that it isnt important which advertising the children see in television they get influenced by each one even if they watch tv and see advertising which is for adults in most cases this is more bad for them than see things which are ",13
129,television advertising is a very strong form of advertisement the main problem with advertisments directed to children is that it makes them want what is shown in the tv small children are very influencable ,13
130," way to spreat advertisations many people talk about the bad affection of the television advertising on young children

first of all children can be very easily be manipulated whatever comes out of the television children take a example of it if a advertisation for toys comes up children mostly go and begging the parents for it till they buy it thats how the producer sell their expensive toys

secondly the advertisation disturbs the children during watching their favorite serie or a film a children should be able to watch tv without any unnecessary breakes

on the other ",13
131, term and conventions of childrens advertisement are not obeyed at the end of the day a tv advertisement will not have a huge impact on children aged between  and will most certainly not change consumption habits of adults in their envirement,13
132," young kids aged  shouldnt be confronted with monipulising ads because children often believe in the things they are told they can be tricked into wanting everything that is advertised on tv
television advertising helps a company to increase their profit and this ",13
133,"about the influence of advertisement on young children

television advertisement has increased in the past ten years the amount of information people are confronted with is crazy companies are promoting their products in the best way they can to sell it but regarding the young children who are often watching television these days we must consider the damages which the streams of advertisement may cause
if we take a look at all the advertisements there are ",13

198, children could learn on the television there are some shows ,20
199, that some television series can be very educational for the children to learn more about the world or to learn for exaple english but in the age of  the children maybe dont understand the educational television series so it is difficult to find the right serie that you can let your children in front of the television the problem which i can see is that in the television are ,20
200, is that they can learn something in the television maybe they can learn to speak an to understand or the watch some learning series for young children also the children relax ,20
201," a possibility to learn something from the television there are a lot of children programmes which have the aim to teach the children 
but there are ",20

203, good things from which the children can learn something on the television are ,20
204,many parents who are out of their nervs or are just busy let their young children sitting in front of the television they are watching series for children and they can learn from the characters which are shown there with series for kids they can early learn how to count numbers or they learn to write a word but out of this is television really good for them maybe they find out how to change the programm and ,20
205, young children learn most effectifly in human contact with their mum and dad or their friends in this way they get their  education in early years by own adventures tv should ,20
206, a toy which they want they can not just buy it like an adult so what can be the ,21
207, toys so they start to beg the parents if they could get it it ,21
208, be useful for their parents maybe the parents are looking for a new toy they want to give the child as a present for birthday or christmas in this ,21
209," parents dont know what they could give the child on christmas or birthday with advertising the child can see different things and say what he or she wants
 
but ",21

215, a special toy they always want to have this and ,21
216," a lot of advertising  children aged 
now we have to ask us if this should be allowed or not

if kids see advertising for children they could not know that advertising is often just for making money for the companies and often what they promise in the adverstising is unreal so they get a wrong view 
also ",22
217, that young children cant think about the advertising carefully whats tho goal of the advertising they can be easyly manipulated by it at the end their parents have to think about it and decide if they would buy something of the advertising for their children ,22
218, children are not able to think critically about the advertisement they cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant for example children do not need their own playstation ,22
219," one has to consider that young children are very easy to manipulate with a less experienced and educated mind they are a easy target for advertising and can more easily fall for subjective and incorrect advertisement
also the children who saw those ads can afterwards be ",22
220," for the advertisors it is a good thing to direct their advertising towards young children when they see something they like in television they are going to ask their parents for buying what they saw and children this age usually keep asking until they get what they want so it is a good strategy to use children for advertising they do not think of money they just want what they like
so we see this statement is not just right or wrong there are always two ",22
221," young children cant decide by their own what they need and whats good for them in this context advertising can manipulate young children realy good because they dont have that much expirience to think carefully about the advertising
",22
222," young children have to learn how to deal with advertising for example that not everything what is said in advertsings is right or usefull if they dont learn that early they may have problems with it later 
on the other ",22
223, children can get influenced negatively from the advertisement ,22
224, adverts towards young children is a great oppotunity for the concerns the kids have a strong will and the parents want to do them a favor and buy the products but ,22
225," is that the kids have to learn beause of the advertising what are important and what are usless informations they learn very fast that they cant guess everything like that the advertise helps the kids to think by themself 
enemies of the promotions says the advertise has to much influence to the kids a child doesnt see just television advertising which is made for his age it is very often confrontated with sloganes with bad influences for example if they see some promotion with pills to lose weight they are asking the parents why some people take these pills like that they are confrontated with this beautyforce too early 

in my opinion the kids souldnt see every advertise but ",22
226," that advertisement aimed at young children should be allowed it wont ruin the childs live and its the parents duty to make sure the child is prepared to face advertisement in the future 

and just because its an interresting ",23
227, of view advertisings that are directed to children should be allowed  the main reason why i am cleary against not allowing it is that it is in every parents ,23
228, advertisement toward young children should not be allowed because the children get influenced too much because they do not understand ,23
229," advertising for children should be allowed in a helping way they should show the real world and not the fictive worlds because it is very difficult for the young children to differ 
but ",23
230, i come to the conclusion that advertisment directet to children should not be allowed because it takes away their chance to develop their own individual charcter ,23
231," a lot of advertising  children aged 
now we have to ask us if this should be allowed or not

if kids see advertising for children they could not know that advertising is often just for making money for the companies and often what they promise in the adverstising is unreal so they get a wrong view 
also ",23
232," its very unpleasent to see advertisement for childrens all the time 

i am clearly against advertising  at the age of  because ",23
233, advertising for young children is not really a big problem because there are enough possibilities for the parents to make sure that they do not get influenced by that ,23
234, it should not be allowed to direct advertising toward young children because they do not have any money and can anyway not buy anything it is very easy to manipulate young children that they want to buy everything they see childrens brain isnt enough developed ,23
235, we should not forbid advertisements for young children because it does not make problems because the children have no  money and it even helps them to see the possibilities in stores and to think about their real wishes and like explained at the end the question has no sense becauese nothing wwill ch,23
236, we should ban the advertising out of the children chanels in the television,24
237, television advertising  yound children should not be allowed ,24
238, television advertising  should not be allowed young children do not ,24
239, we shold limit advertisement in childrens tv programmes ,24
240, the advertising  should get forbidden that would not even get the enterprises in finacial debts they nearly dont make any advertising for children now fact is children can watch tv advertising early enough ,24
241, the television advertising  should not be banned but limited instead children spend their time watching the whole day in the ,24
242, ads on childrens tv programme should be banned but ,24
243, the televison advertising should be allowed to the children ,24
244, children should be allowed to watch television advertising ,24
245,television advertising s young children should not be allowed because they want the things shown in the advertisement they will cry and shout intil they get the things but ,24
246, bad than good because it has important negative ,25
247,there are a lot different positive and negative ,25
248, some against it in the following text ,25
249, give some pro and contra ,25
250, bring up some pro and con,25
251," it can have positive afffection to the children
there are ",25
252, for and against this topic and ,25
253, explain the pro and contras ,25
254, it could give many of negative ,25
255, first of all it influences the opinion of young childen ,25
256, it will be hard for this children to find themselves later on also the children could misunderstand the advertising of the television and become later on very bad people ,26
257, many advertisings to little children like toward adults children would watch more tv and would want more stuff so i think it wouldnt be a good thing for them and i wouldnt be that sure if it would bring more money to diffrent companys  ,26
258, a positive influence maybe the future children can handle money better than we do now over all there are better things to do for young children than sitting around and watching tv and if they are not watching tv they can not see the television advertising problem solved,26
259, theyll keep on watching tv the opponents of television advertising for young children are concerned about more children spending their time watching tv ,26
260," the children become teenagers or adults they would always have to rely on products to entertain them
all in all television advertising targeting children seems to be a very bad idea to me it does not focuse on the buyer but on the user of the product which does not make sense because the parent is responsible for their child and should decide what they play with it has ",26
261, children would not be informed about new products they are keen on playing with this results in less children specific products being sold which eventually can damage the economy also in the advertisment jobs would be lost additionally the channels airing children programms would go bankrupt ,26
262, which means theyll fall prey to the fun advertisements of companies promising them joy in buying their product and small children wont understand their parents and instead get angry at them all over an ad on tv,26
263," they are growing up with doing advertising and suddenly they have to go to school and have a normal way of life it could bring many problems for the children 
it ",26
264, the young children wont be able to buy the products they see in the advertising anyway the whole ,26
265, theyll go back to the couch and keep watching television and see another cool thing they want really badly so with advertising  children companies that sell toys and stuff like that might make a lot of profit because they can sell more things to children which dont really use it anymore but why should it be forbidden for those companies to make advertisments of course if children see something they really want it and they wont let go of it but ,26
266," they dont have any time for them
but ",27
267, they can watch it and ,27
268, they donâ´t really have time for them ,27
269, they donâ´t think about the ,27
270, they could watch something and ,27
271, theyre not aware of it,27
272, they are using it for their ,27
273, their parents are talking to them they can ,27
274, they can do other things ,27
275, those people can make them intersted and ,27
276,as a componie that sells products adressed to children its quite an efficient way to present their products to children trough the television as jung children get those products presented interstingly theiy almost instantly want to get them and as soon as they have heard of such a product they run to their parents and ask them to buy this prop seen in the advertisment the ,28
277, he or she suddenly absolutely wants the thing that is shown on the advertisement and most of the time it is something stupid because nowadays people produce anything to get a lot of money so parents should not even let their children know what unnecessairy things exist but on the ,28
278, that they want to buy all the products the commercial is showing children ,28
279, for a new toy the child wants all this stuff and has high hopes but in realitiy a majority of them wouldnt get it in addition to that the advertising could ,28
280," by television advertising they are very interested in things that move or make noises so television advertising which is about some toys and is  is an extremly clever move from the company when a child sees some of these advertisings it is fasctinating by the object or the product they want to sell right away they tell their parents what they saw and that they want them to buy it most of the time the parents buy it because they want to make their child happy in this case its very good for the company and they sell a lot of their products 
but ",28
281," its  them the young children can only understand everything through their vision
when parents see the advertising which often is about some kind of toy that every children wants to have they could take that as an idea for a birthday present or something like that which would be an ",28
282, is that the young children are the customers of tomorrow and with the advertisemnets they get an overview about the varieties of toys sweets or games in our modern world and if you are realistic they will always have to deal with adevertisement ,28
283,advertisements are invented to get more and more people to buy a specific product young children ,28
284," made for children there are lots of ads which show new toys that seem often very appealing to them

i remember that back in my childhood days i would love to watch tv and seeing these adverts made me want to have that new toy immediatly i would run to my mother and ask her to buy it ",28
285, that the advertising adresses the parents they imagine the joy their children will have with the product and maybe they will buy it ,28
286,"television advertising  should  not be allowed

young children basically grow up with a television in their household nowadays there special tv channels that show a suitable programm for young chidren ",29
287, this really should not be a problem with television advertising young children can learn what different things there are on television and they can even learn something from it maybe they see their ,29
288," the children are to young to understand the meaning of those advertisings this huge industry is not made for  those young candidats

in my oppinion the children at this age shouldnt even watch television tv can be a relly big addiction 


",29
289, there is worse stuff in television children could get to see than an advertisement towards them which would be toys and stuff furthermore just by seeing an advertisement it doesnt have to mean that they buy it use it or consume it most of the kids in this age havent even got money ,29
290, it is unpossible to show advertising in kids tv the advertising in the tv wantthat you see an product and that you would buy itbecause the products were presented niceras they really are then we come to the ,29
291," way also directing advertisement towards children aged  isnt useful because the children have no money so my opinion is that the parents shouldnt let their children watch television 

",29
292,first of all television advertising isnt something you can allow or not it is just there if you want or not there is advertising that is nice for children to watch because it has a lot of colors and cute music in the evening the advertising is a little bit different but i think this is not really important because children aged  dont get it for what the advertising is for maybe they talk about dating ,29
293, advertising comes  only watching a programm for children without any advertising  or just beeing able to watch a certain time of the day where no advertising at all is playing  it just makes absolutly no sense isnt the better question if such young children should be allowed to watch televison at all not every advertising in genereal is bad and true story not every serie or film playing in the television is bad but if parents let their children watch television ,29
294, it is really up to the tvchannels or advertisers todo not advertise for children it is more up to the parents of the children to make sure their children do not watch tvchannels with this advertisment so the parents have the responsibility to care of their child also i do not really see the sense behind advertising  because they are not the generation who buy a lot of things on the other ,29
295,it is very controverse issue if children should advertising directed through the television there are many people which thnik children should not watch television at all because they just get manipulated but there are ,29
296, isnt allowed so prohibiting the advertisement cant be the right ,30
297, advertising should be not allowed,30
298, you cant forbid advertising but advertising which  should be forbiden                                                                                                                                                           ,30
299, this is no reason to not allowe advertising this is ,30
300, that it should not be allowed is that advertising ,30
301,"
some people want that those advertising should not be allowed but ",30
302," it should not be allowed to manipulate them with the advertisment
i am agreeing with the the statement mainly ",30
303, my oppinion it would be the best thing if such kinds of advertising would be not allowed ,30
304,"

in my opinion it wouldnt be correct to forbid to show such advertising advertising is ",30
305, think why should it not be allowed if they wouldnt make the advertising there would ,30
306, that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed it is just a easy way to manipulate parents to buy something for their children by using the children which cannot decide how usefull the product is,31
307, that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed because it is just an easy way for companys to sell a product ,31
308, that the children should not be influenced at such a young age by television advertising because the advertising could have a bad influence and it could be a promise of something the children could never get to firstly ,31
309, that television advertising should be completely forbidden for products that appeal to younger children but it should not be directed only to them in general ,31
310, that television advertising directed young children should not be allowed because they arent able to resist and they havent got the knowledge to decide whether the product is as it is shown in the advertising or it is diffrent and not as cool as they thought,31
311, that television advertising toward young children should be banned generally because ,31
312, that television advertising should not be allowed on channels for children and for children ,31

they could ",39
391, they should go outside and talk to their friends or playing games with them without using electronical toys or something like that ,39

394, the best for those young children is to go and play outside and enjoy their childhood if they are the whole day in front of the television they have never lived their childhood by playing with other kids in their age a reason for this change could be that people work more in a lot of households the mother works too and doesnt have time for her children or she is just stressed about the work and doesnt want to play with the children thats why more and more children just sit in front of the television the whole day ,39
395, play with their parents or with other kids outdoors   ,39

according to the exaggeration and wrong information it is important for children making their own experiences they should see for theirselves that the tv does not always tell the truth and that they are not always protected by mom and dad who watch over them and tell them what is good and what isnt
but at last it is way too early making these experience aged  however the children should ",40
