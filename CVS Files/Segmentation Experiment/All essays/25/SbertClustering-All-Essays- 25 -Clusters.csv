0,advertising in television is becoming more and more clever lots of those ads invade our subconsciousness and try to make us buy the product ,10
1," we do not actually need it 
when it comes to children lots of them dont have enough money to afford these products they dont even understand the concept of money even if they wanted it they can not get the thing they were told they need
also lots of children that age are prohibited watching television by their parents that way they dont even see the advertisements ",2
2," the feeling of needing the toy is not created
and ",20
3, children of that age do not have any intentions of actually buying these things for example ,24
4, i was little i used to watch an advert of a lego set all the time and ,20
5," choosing another toy for my birthday i was not influenced at all by the ad
those were some ",20
6, pro advertising although they seem good and reasonable there are ,11
7,"
for example if the feeling of needing the toy is eventually created the children will harass their parents until they get what they wanted or they got somehing else this is quite annoying for any parent as my mother herself can ",20
8,"
even more convincing of a ban of such advertisements are that ",11
9," the child does not get that thing and other children get it it creates the feeling of missing out something that should not be missed for example i always wanted to have a scooter because all the other kids had one and i thougt i would have such a great time had i had it
and even more ",20
10, is that children this young are much easier to influence than adults are they can not see past the triks these people are using their minds are ,7
11," developping and should not be filled with unnecessary ads
in my opinion advertising towards children should be banned the adverts should ",16
12, be directeed towards the parents of the child,9
13,"should it not be allowed to produce television advertising  at the age between two and five
on this question is based the following text which shows ",13
14,"  including my personal opinion

first the main time a person is watching tv is during the evening
some people ",17
15," they want to have a short sleep
at this times a child aged  even sleeps too or it is playing with friends ",1
16," that the child can not see advertsisings
however the television can be nessecary because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep 
but during such a movie there is not more than one time advertising 
the most children are not interested in this advertsing and do not watch them ",14
17, that it is unnessecary to produce television advertising directed  ,15
18," they do not see them
the most important ",3
19, is that children aged  will never understand television advertising ,14
20," you show toys or pets because they do not know the reason of advertising

at my own opinion ",11
21," say that television advertising for young children can be allowed but it is not nessecary because they do not watch much films 
besides they do not care about the advertising and would not understand the background reasons for it  

",13
22,"in the following text ill discuss the statement about the programm of television which is directed to very young children by the age of 

for me itâ´s an important theme to talk about because the medias in our time can be very dangerous for the developement of children and ",17
23," teenagers but in this moment the age of the young chldren is important for the statement
",8
24, television is something which is fun and free time for you but it ,17
25," can change your opinion about some topics and meanings which you have
young children are very influenced by everythingwhich they see and hear ",8
26, the television can be dangerous or bad for them but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias but itâ´s not the right way ,17
27,"
itâ´s better to show them how to handle with television or games or something like that because the children are learning for their lifes and not just for the moment

in the statement itâ´s described that very young children from the age  should not watch television and ",17
28," it has something true because in the age of two or three years you should not watching televeison
a little kid should play with its toys and parents and not watch televison the whole day because it can be a negative ",17
29, you canâ´t say no with a law ,19
30," itâ´s difficult to handle with this topic

a ",21
31," can be that the parents of the children have to handle right with this topic because itâ´s important for their children and their developement
older children like with the age of five or six or elder it is ",12
32, right and possible to watch television with a time which is given by the parents ,17
33, that the cildren can watch a serie for one hour and ,6
34," itâ´s finished for this day

so ",18
35," at some parts with the statement but not at all
the main thing that is important is the bad influence by television for too young children ",17
36, it could exists problems in future which are developed by the television,10
37," would sure make sense if you want to protect your child against the capitalistic system were living in but it honestly makes no sense to let your child watch tv if youre against advertising further it doesnt really makes a different if the adverstising is  a two year old girl or a 85 year old man in any case the young child will get influenced by commercials the only difference is the way of how the child gets influenced
another ",14
38, against this statement is that ,21
39, the advertising in television influences the children in ,14
40," the show theyre actually watching is far more influencing than the commerials 

but in the other way you have say that this can be really bothering young parents ",14
41, their little son is coming downstairs and all he want is a new playstation because the television said only cool kids got playstations sure you want your child to grow up without tv but sometimes ,20
42, the best mom needs a pause and places her son near the television ,1
43,"

my opinion is that this statement doesnt really makes sense if you want your child to grow up without beeing influenced by tv commercials you dont even buy a television in ",14
44, you can buy your child an mp3 ,20
45, it can listen to good music witch is much better and as highly entertaing as spongebob squarpants,18
46," for the question if the advertising  shoul not be allowed you can think on some opinions for and against it
 the television advertising is sometimes very funny and beautiful for the kids so they can lough and be happy they show some carracters that show the kids how they can do something and the children are learning something but ",14
47, there are some advertising that arenâ´t very helpful to show children how they can do something or they can behave sometimes the children learn something they shouldnâ´t learn a situation ,16
48, a child is sad because another child took his car for playing away ,9
49, the kid is really sad and donâ´t know what he could do he saw an advertising where this happend and the ,9
50," was that the child hurt the other one and that is not ok in reallife the kid who is sad because he want his car back knows that he can hurt the other one to get his car so itâ´s not ok to show them this kind of stories because they learn from it 
they should show how to play a game or to take part in other plays where he can play with other children
also ",8
51, that children who are at the age of  shouldnâ´t be allowed to watch tv because itâ´s not good for their eyes itâ´s better for them to play in the kindergarten or to play with their mum there are some little things that could make them happy for axample spending time with their mum ,8
52," they can build a better feeling for each other because they get to know each other better
how i said in the begining there are some funny and beautiful advertising which make the children smile and be happy but ",0
53," that they can do other things for being happy 
so all in one ",21
54," that the television advertising should be allowed but those who make the children learn something they shouldnâ´t learn shouldnâ´t be allowed so the advertising should be controlled by some people that know what is right for children aged  
 ",13
55, today where the kind of advertising that is showed isnt really childfriendly as an example little time ago my little sister and i watched a kids film on a regular channel and suddenly a advertising about sex toys came up of course they didnt know what this kind of toys are but honestly it is a shame that the television allows that kids ask questions if they didnt understand  something ,14
56," maybe the parents wont tell them what it is but the bigger brother could explain them really well what the practices are that you do with these toys through this they get much more involved in things that are subject of grownups 
the whole fashion and cosmetic advertsing is ",20
57, a huge problem the skinny beautiful models present their products in a sexual way and talk in a seductive voice this can lead ,11
58, boys to think that this anorexic women or muscle men are the beauty ideals because they are in an age in which they are really manipulative and dont think for theirself they are likely to  take over the opinion of the people and things that are around them or are shown them they want to be just like the models that are in television ,3
59, beautiful but to reach such an supernatural body image they have to lose unhealthy weight which is achieved trough eating disorders and ,19
60," it can lead to psychic problems and suicide because they didnt see themself as good enough
in general children shouldnt waste time on electronic devises which arent the real world they learn much more about a good life ",4
61, they are in the woods or playing games with their friends so they learn to socialize and to respect each other this are two much important ,8
62, to have as happy selfemployed and honest grownup ,18
63,in the following text the question is discussed if television advertising  young childre aged  should not be allowed there is a conrtoverse discussion about that subject for long now but is that really ,13
64," unresponsible from the advertising industrie
as capitalist and ceo you have the absolute right to advertise like that because your goal is  to catch eyeballs and to sell more of whatever product as a mother of 4 young children and not too much money ",11
65," your children always desire the fanciest toy so what to do about it
for the advertisors young children are easy to connect with because they do not have such a complex believe and decision making system as most adults do therfore it is quite compelling for companies to make cheap advertisements with good chance to succed on the other ",0
66," it is exactly that that young children are not able to distinguish useful and not useful information that makes advertising toward this group questionable
for the companies it is an easy way to get new customers because ",2
67, the children are growen up and might have themself childern they ,9
68, will remember what they wanted in their childhood and ,8
69, will buy it for their kids it is almost at the level of some kind of indoctrination ,3
70," to speak which makes it moraly unatractive to advertise towards young children
in my opinion the resposibility lies by the parents of the children and not by the advertisors it is their problem ",16
71, they just let their child watch tv nine to five a day so they have to take responsibility for how their child develops and to control the input it gets from the environment therefor i do not think one can prohibit to advertise toward young children,16
72,the following text is about the named statement television is today more impportant than in the past in the past the children go outside an play with other children so its different than today most of children watch television ,21
73, they are at their own i ,19
74, with this statement because young children aged of  should be learn to play with other children at their age when they look tv the children are independent of this media ,17
75, they cant live without watching tv so the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they arent be alone and ,17
76, they meet new people the reason is that they are in contact with others and thats better for their future it ist ,3
77, important because later they can meet new friends easier than without playing with others the children without playimg with other children dont know the contact with others so the relationship to other children is better ,8
78," the children play with other children 
an arguement could be that the television shows pograms which arent good for young children also the pograms are for older children aged seven many pograms arent real but the children watch them and think they want do the same so the television isnt real many pograms could be dangerous for young children ",17
79," they dreams bad and thats not good for their little life 
much peeple say that television is good for their future and its is the real life b ut it isnt it the shows are played of actors who leatn their text and ",17
80," play it for the camera and the pproducer so it isnt the real life 
the children can learn of watching tv that isnt right because the children learn more in playing with toys beside they learn the rules of their parents and they know in which their are allowed to something and what it isnt allowed to do 
so the children shouldnt watch television because they are things which are better than that also the independence of watching television is tall ",17
81," they are older they want watching tv all the time then they dont meet friends or do a hobby
the age of  is ",24
82, time of the life of a children because they learn ,8
83, much about the life and deleope in a fast time the developement of a child in this age is ,8
84, for and against the prohibition of television advertising  younger children which ,13
85," text 

first of all it is wellknown that little children are heavily influenced by their surroundings ",8
86, that they can get manipulated easily ,3
87, this can be used effectively by television advertisements which portray them a false picture of reality causing children to ask their parents for things they dont actually need this is often the case with toys that are shown to be really fun in advertisements ,2
88," in reality they often are quite lame
additionally children cant even realize ",24
89, they are getting baited by a company ,3
90," that it is up to the parents to explain why a particular product is not as good as portraied in the tv which most of the time cant be understood by children which might lead to some sort of unhappiness

nevertheless one can argue if this is reason enough to prohibit advertisements  ",13
91, it would be pretty hard to establish nowadays it is common that even little children spend some time in front of the tv and ,17
92, there has to be some sort of advertising between two shows that are made for children it wouldnt be too clever to put something in there that isnt  children ,6
93,"
furthermore there are some advertisements that might have a positive ",11
94, if an ad promotes physical activity like going outside and playing with friends ,11
95," this is quite rarely the case

eventually ",19
96," that it really depends on what sort of advertisement it is and what product is getting advertised as for the previous example with toys if a false picture of the toy is portraied to bait consumers into buying that is obviously not the right way to do it
however an absolute prohibition is ",11
97, nearly impossible to to happen because tv companies have to earn their money and companies that produce shows for children are no exception but as just mentioned its the quality of the advertisement that really matters ,14
98, wanting to prohibit them all one should ,12
99," ask for more appropriate ads that dont damage young children in any way
",16
100,"the following essay deals with the question wether telivision advertising  aged  should be allowed 
for children the ages  are ",13
101," year of development they learn speaking and walking and a lot of other important things

the young children should play outside or do other stuff than sitting in fornt of a television and watch some strange series later in life theyll watch a lot of tv and in childhood they shouldnt spend their time with this
if they watch series ",8
102, the krã¼melmoster they may have the same ideas as the actors and do things they arent allowed or get hurt ,19
103," doing this
the development in this young age is very importent one cant really tell them what to do ore not they will experience this themselves but without watching tv they will meet some friends and are outside in the natur they create other ideas without the influence of television they get social contacts which they cant make if they only spend their time infront of the tv
for example i got to know my best friend with the age of 1 because our mothers are friends and we only spend out time outside and played with the dogs or by bad weather we built thing and played memories we werent allowed to watch television and later the only thing we watched was the sandman this only goes ten minutes and was nearly ",17
104," our bedtime
the age of  is the time for children in the kindergarden and there they learn how to behave with other kids ",8
105," its important not to destroy this at home
in my oppinion television advertising shouldnt be allowed",15
106,"television advertising  should not be allowed 
with this statement the following text is occupied iâ´m going to compare ",15
107," 

an arguement why children should not be allowed to use television with the age of  is that they are to young to understand a lot of things which are told there parents should make sure that their children grows up with things which are important fot theier future for example children with the age of  should reed some books or play games like football also they could draw some pictures or learn how to spell theier names if children with young age only watch tv they will do this ",17
108," is that a children with young age often has to be alone because the parents have to work the whole day or must have to do something where a little children is not usefull than they could watch tv with the result that their fixed on the television also if a children watch important politically soaps earlier it grows up with a better knowledge of the important things of life but it does not make sense that a young aged children is able to get important information 

a young children with the age of  has to learn the calours or how to differences animals with other animals ",8
109, it is better to show them books with a lot of picures than to let them whatch tv young children should ,17
110," play outside with friends because they have to learn the difference of the real world and the world that is showed by the medias

as a result ",1
111, with the statement because there are a lot of ,21
112, there are a lot of more things children with young age could do much better than watch television in my opinion children who look at pictures or learn the colours with young age have a lot of knwoledge more than children watching tv ,17
113,television advertising is often directed to certain groups of people one of them are children who are between two and five years old there are some people who say that this kind of advertising should not be allowed in the following ,14
114," present my opinion on this topic

in my opionion there are two ",21
115, to this statement i can ,21
116, with the people who are saying that this kind of advertising should be forbidden children who are that young dont know how to compromise it the ads are making everything more colorful and brighter and they do not necessarily show reality the children really want to have the product and might annoy their parents until they buy it its ,16
117, not fair of the marketing people they use young children who might never had contact to any kind of media ,16
118," just to make money they know exactly what the children want and they use this knowledge just to make themselves richer 

but ",9
119, there are some reasons why i ,18
120, with this statement even if the child really wants the product that was advertised on tv the decisions if its bought or not will be made by the parents the child cant just buy things on its own the role of the parents is another reason why ,2
121, commercials should be allowed the parents can decide ,13
122, and how often children watch tv and it is their decision if they want a two year old boy or girl to watch tv the other reason why it should be allowed is one simple thing you cant hide advertising sooner or later the kids will be confronted with ads and it could be good to let them know early enough that it is out there when they become older they will know better how to handle advertisment children will know that they cant have everything they want and that not everything is like it is in tv the things shown in the commercials arent reality but it is the reality that commercials are out there in real life and if tv advertisment towards children isnt allowed commercials in magazines on the radio and ,14
123, on the internet shouldnt be allowed ,12
124, children get a phone earlier every generation and with that they have the connection to everything that is out there and the internet is even harder to control than tv one decision must lead to other decisions ,17
125,"

allinall i say that i ",18
126, with the ststement television advertising  younger children should not be allowed the parents have the chance to decide what the child does and what is bought ,13
127, and children will  be confronted with commercials anyway it is not just on tv,14
128, thought was that this schouldnt be a problem when children see advertisement it has an effect on them but they arent able to buy something on their own when the kids get older they are ,16
129, able to buy something but at this age ,9
130, the kids should be more ore less informed and dont let themself manipulate to strong from advertisement but here i am talking about children who have an average tv consume when a kid spends more time infront of the television the effects could be worse the influence of the mother is important ,14
131, when the  tv cosume is regulated and ,10
132, the mother dont just leaves advertisements uncommented in general ,11
133, the kids are confronted early with advertisement because it is a part of the television programm when they see commercials at an older age they they ,0
134, have to learn how to handle it an important ,18
135, is what is advertised if its for food an action park toys or other tv programms as is said food advertisement shouldnt be a problem because here the parents can decide wheter to buy something or not  when there is advertisement for other tv shows or films it will probably affect the kids ,14
136, here the parents can help by just regulating the time her child is infront of the tv important is that an advertisement dont scare kids ,14
137, the reasons why you should show little kids advertisement overweigh and i actually think that isnt a big problem too much more important is how the parents educate their kids  ,16
138,should advertising toward young children be allowed in this essay ,16
139," of this topic and comment on it

of course it is interesting for a little girl to watch tv and see a doll in the advertising that wants to play with her but what if the mother of the girl is ",20
140, poor she works everyday to be able to buy food and has no money ,9
141, doll the girls wants the doll ,20
142, bad that the mother doesnt know how to react the doll can even talk and dance but ,20
143," expensive now imagine the girl never saw this advertising she wouldnt talk about this doll and her mother wouldnt be in despair  

in my opinion advertising toward young children shoulnt be allowed children dont earn money and cant buy things on their own many children spend too much time on watching tv people go working and people have families sometimes it is hard to connect working and having a family exspecially if a mother thinks that she cant make her daughter happy because of not buying a doll she saw ",2
144,"the following text discusses the statement if television advertising  in the age of  should be allowed or not

imagine young children sitting infront of the television if those young children see advertising for the necessary or the right stuff it might be usefull that they watch this advertising although they are  the children the ads can be usefull for the parents 
but ",14
145, they are just kids and ,24
146, they would be totally influenced by this even adults are influenced by advertising because it sticks to your mind and you cant influence which advertising you watch so young children who arent grown up at all would be victims of those advertisings furthermore if the parents dont control their kids they watch many of those ads ,14
147," the children have a complete wrong view of the reality because they think thst those ads show the reality 

in my opinion i would forbit those ads because ",16
148, that children should grow up without all the influence and should do other stuff ,7
149, watching the tv so i as a mother would not want that my kid watches all the ads which show my kid a different way of the reality  ,1
150,"did young children bacame addicted to modern technic 
in the following text ",24
151," discuss the question and will give my own opinion about the statement wether television should be allowed  or not 

i recognised that many children grow up  different ",17
152, i bacame older some of them does not know the old classics like playing outside i build my one garden or games which have to do with fantasy and your own imagination they replace their imagionation with a cartoon ,24
153, it is important that you as a parent support the devolpment of your child many young children are not really recognised by their parents instead of spending their time with them they make their life easier and put them infront of a television i know that it is not easy to raise up a child but you decided wether you can handle the stress and work or not you know that a child will bring up problems andverantwortung   it is not bad for the child if it watchs tv a few times a week but it has to be controlled the time and easpacially what kind of tv they are watching otherwise ,17
154," it is not possible to forbid television for children under five years because each parents have their own way to let their kid grow it does not mean that television makes you child uncreative or stupid but showing your child how to handle all these unreal and given impressions is important for his her following development 

finally i can say that ",17
155, with the given statement bacause if you forbit something it bacomes more interesting you have to know how to handle the modern development of technic in our world and not to allow something is not the right way prepare your children right for the modern world,8
156,"in the following text i will discuss if television advertising aged  should not be allowed
general television advertising influence ",15
157, young peoplebecause the advertise is always shown in a perfect way without faults because they want that everybody will buy the product,2
158, they will earn a lot of moneywhen young people see something very special for them on the television they tell their parents that they want it but they only want it because it was shown ,6
159," perfect and not because they tried it at the most time the products are very expensive and the parents do not want it to buy for the children
but i ",2
160, think that children with two years do not recognize the advertise ,16
161, well than children with five years the two years old children will not react like five years old children maybe they will strike or something like thatif they do not get that product but the two years old children will forget it and maybe their parents will buy another toyproduct which is better and cheaper and the child will ,24
162, that the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is right in a way but i think that children until three years do not have the knowledge about that stuff ,13
163, thatâ´s why i think young children until three can see television advertising but for older young children until six or seven ,14
164, they come to schoolit schould not be allowed because they have the knowledge and can discuss withe their parents about it ,12
165,many people dont like advertisements for young children ,16
166," for children 

first television is not good for young children and many of these young children arent even allowed to watch tv 

and if they are allowed to  for  example half an hour the parents and the children too doesnt want to have different advertisements in tv the parents because they think its not good for the child it may want something it doesnt need and the child just wants to watch its series on tv advertisements would only steal them their expensive and very short time 
theres ",14
167, against advertisements towards young children imagine youre a children at age  would you be interestet in buying stuff to play with yes ,16
168," you would be so you ask your parents to buy these toys for you and as actually everytime you ask they say no this is sad and depressing isnt ist so some companies may save the children from being sad and do the advertisements towards the parents maybe with some deeper information for them

but there are ",20
169, some reasons for advertisements towars young children for ,16
170," many children its too difficult to learn that parents often dont allow them to be outside until 9pm or like in this discussion buying some playing stuff from the advertisements for them they must accept that they cannot have everything and if they werent confronted by advertisements and the no of their parents they never learn it 
another important thing is the knowledge of the children they actually never get to know different toys like barbie lego or even playmobil probably the parents dont go to a toy shop with their kids very often ",20
171," an advertisement is a good way to get to know some playing stuff and some of these different toys will show them tecnical and motorical skills 

so ",0
172, advertisements for young children are a good thing to get them learn to hear a no and to let their skills grow the only important ,16
173, is the behaviour of the parents toward the children they are supposed to look for their children to not let them too often watch tv and espacially not too long  it would be bad for the child buying some ,17
174, not everything they want toys for the children and let them play with them or reading a book with them are much better opportunities ,20
175,should television advertising  aged  be forbidden in  the following text ,15
176," name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion

in the television there are several different ways of advertising for a product or an campaign for example songs that you will remember even four weeks later or situations out of daily life besides you can watch advertisements in tv that show people who do embarassing things ",15
177, that the spectators laugh about them thats why there is the problem of advertisements  little children in the age  as they are able to sing the song that they listened to in television or want exactly these cookies that their star is eating in the advertisement too that these little persons are influenced by such advertisement is a sad ,0
178, one can pretend them from that by forbid them to watch tv apart from television there are ,17
179, much interesting things to do and let them know how things are working ,1
180, showing them how to bake a cake drawing pictures or doing other creative work but there are ,24
181, reasons that are for the idea of allowing advertisements toward little children in tv the earlier they are confronted to advertisements the better they can resist them ,13
182, they are older that would cause not buying the things that one has seen in tv but ,2
183," that being independent from the advertisements 

all in all ",11
184, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed because ,15
185, that there is nothing to worry about if  little children come in contact with television advertisements so nobody cares ,13
186, it is clear that you are going to watch them ones and it could be a way to make people resistant to advertisements ,11
187," with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed

usually ",15
188, that it does not matter to me what kind of advertisement they are showing during different shows or films but this statement made me think about it and ,11
189," now this is waht i came up with
advertisement is something that we all hate i guess i can say that but sometimes ",11
190," the ones for little kids are just funny and entertaining to watch furthermore it is brilliant to see how happy kids can get just by watching the little clip of maybe just 10 seconds also isnt it just really nice to see all the new things they are inventing for them and sometimes you even feel like you want to be a little kid again just to be able to try all these brandnew amazing things

but there is ",6
191," of the problem
first of all ",21
192, that children in that age should not be watching as much television at all i feel like if they are watching all these advertisements between their movie they are going to want these things really bad most of the times we all know that situation dont we there is a new advertisement on the tv showing something really nice you are going to get the feeling of really wanting to be owner of this so it can start to be really annoying ,14
193, for parents if kids will never stop talking about wanting what they just saw on the tv the parents or somebody else eventually has to buy it and ,2
194," it gets boring or they are going to start wanting something new so people just keep spending money and more money on things their kids see in an advertisement
moreover industries invent toys or other things that are dangerous for kids if they are going to see that on the tv they are going to really want to play with something like that
in addition to that i can say that advertisements are rarely showing the truth sometimes the toy or whatever isnt as fancy as it seems or people in the advertisement do not show the right behavior that the parents taught them ",14
195," kids are going to question everything and we all know how annoying this could end
also did you realize that we barely even have conversations in this time anymore we barely talk to each other and that is ",1
196, because of people spending too much time with social media and other electronical devices ,23
197, the little kids from today should go outside and ask their friend about their new toy better than watching tv and seeing all the new things there i ,1
198, remember me having fun to go outside and not having to worry about an television advertisement but i sure have to say that i remember me really wanting something from an advertisement ,11
199,"

as you can see this is a topic people could probably discuss about all day but ",21
200, i have to say that i do ,18
201, television advertisement toward young children should not be allowed because there is ,13
202, many more exciting things in this world they should see and they shouldnt get jealous of other kids because they have something new from the advertisement that they do not have and ,0
203, have a much easier life,19
204," for and against the statement telivision advertising directet toward young children should not be allowed 

may one can say that advertising  should be allowed because it is allowed to be  everyone in every age of course it is a weak ",13
205, but at least it is one also one has to add that young children aged  normally do not watch tv that often therefore it does not really matter if there is that kind of advertising or not but in case that the children watch tv nearly all day it could be helpful for later maybe the children are not interested in this advertising in a way and do not listen to it or watch it so there is the chance that they wont be interested in advertisding later ,14
206," they wont be easily influenced

but that is only guessed one ",19
207, that is against television advertising  young people is that it is not good to get influenced in this young age and if one thinks about it in a rational way it becomes clear that children are interested in advertising especially if the advertising presents new things to play with also they do not really have the chance to have or to build an own opinion because they are too young as a ,14
208, with the advertising or at least to believe it is true for example if it is about a new snack that is ,11
209," good for children because it suppports them in becoming large and stong but actually its main ingredient is sugarl so they believe in wrong things and regard lies as true this could be a problem for their later life because they wont be able to see the difference between lies and  the truth 

all in all television advertising  should not be allowed ",14
210, that is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children,7
211,"in the following i tell you my oppinion of the question if television advertising  between  years shuold not be allowed

in my mind it is not a question of the age of the children because i think that television is not good for anybody but ",14
212, everybody has to chose for his self because it is his or her life and not the life of the anyone else so ,21
213," that the parents have to chose if there children are allowed to have a television
the children hast  to learn about the politics and know what is beeing in the world but kids under five years would not be interested of the politics and the other things to learn in the television ",17
214," the films and series for kids have to be kontrolled by the parents so they can not whatch films and series which are not allowed for them 
the kids have to whatch films and series to learn ",6
215," from them  who made for the children but they dont have to have a television for him or herself
it is a part of the the youth of many kids they not have to have a television to have a good youth because if the parents spend time for their children they can ",17
216," have fun without an own tv so if the parents dont want to allow a tv for the childs they have to soend time for them
but if the parents can say stop if the child whatched to much tv or watch movies and serier which are not allowed to whatch for a child in  his age ",17
217," the child should be allowed to have or watch tv 

to sum up ",17
218, this toward because not every parents have time to spend time for his or her children and the tv is a good alternative to entertain the children so every parents had to chose for his own child and ,17
219,"chlidren form the age of  have not been able to develop their own charcter jet that makes them an easy target for advertisement because they are easy to influence the question now is should advertisement directed to children of the named age not be allowed  


children of the age  are the future of the human society ",16
220, they are the ones that will determ the things that will be bought in the future and the standards that will define our future society advertisement for children does not have to be a bad thing it can be used to influence them ,0
221," that their behaviour will have a positive effekt on society and nature
the promblem with advertisement which is directet to children is that it does not aim for a better futer the people that make the advertisment aim for money they mainly see their own profit and not the negative influence they have on children by trying to sell their products they can set unrealistic standars of beauty or material things that children may want to own one day the ",0
222," of this can be depression because nobody is happy with their body or with the stuff they own and they will simply be unhappy
children should have the chance to develop their own character as isolatet from advertisement as possible ",2
223," that they can find out for themselves what they want to look like and what they want to own and in which way they can find pleasure and happines

bacause of these given ",8
224, i come to the conclusion that advertisment directet to children should not be allowed because it takes away their chance to develop their own individual charcter ,16
225,this statement is a very important question for the whole world it contains the whole earth and everybody is guilty ,21
226, that television should not be allowed  because they are to young and they should not sit ,17
227, to the television the television could damage there eyes and thats not healthy too they should go out and playing they have a lot of time ,1
228, years to watch television or to work with the computers they should enjoy there childhood without the electric things but ,24
229, they can learn a lot in the television they can learn some new things with fun especially with cartoons you can learn lot of new things theres no child who didnt likes to watch cartoons on the television you can learn something about the live and you can be prepared for school surely they are contra ,17
230, the children can learn with other things ,8
231, with puzzle or card games there are lot of other possibilites to learn something new at the age of  you start to explore the world you want to learn new things and you ,24
232," like the colours of the television

my opinion is that the children should watch television because ",17
233, you are at the age of  you start to explore the world and the television is a really good possibility for do that you can learn a lot in the television ,6
234, with cartoons every child likes cartoons as apes bananas surely it isnt ,6
235, to the television all the time but ,1
236, you watch it regullary at many periods of time than it can be really good for you i am definitely not ,4
237," on the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
first i will write the ",15
238, against the statement children should decide themselves what they want and advertising helps them to gain information about the things they could possibly need in this age they are  already able to show us what they want the children probably dont even understand the television advertisment but the parents like the advertisment more ,14
239, it is a well made advertisment young children should not watch too much television anyways ,14
240," the parents have to control what their children watch
second i will write ",17
241, for the statement the advertisment has an influence on the children and in this age they dont know ,0
242," they are under an influence additionaly only the parents know what they can afford and the children dont think about the price of something they just want it or not the children might even get unhappy because their parents can not afford what they want and the children dont understand why their parents dont buy them what they want because they dont understand the use of money 
",9
243, that television advertising that is s young children should not be allowed but young children should not watch much television and the parents should control what their children watch,13
244,"televison advertising  in the ages of  years should be allowed because they learn how to use the medium in a good way they should know which programmes they are allowed to see and which ones arent good for their ages

televison adevertising can influence the children in a way ",14
245, they would like to see all the stuff they hear and ,3
246," see and have no feeling for a good amount af time they watch tv

the televison can make dependant ",17
247," the childrens have no feeling for how long it is good to look at the televison they only know the virtual world and havent got an idea what else there is in the world the children havent got lots of social contacts later in school this can be a problem beacause they arent able to work and play with other classmates or friends in the same age 

the televison ",17
248," can make that the childrens which are often watch programmes suffer at being concentrated and have no feeling for a good amount of watching tv

but the televison is usefull to learn important things like the colours or how to count or to learn the language but it is only good ",17
249, they look at specific programmes which are ,23
250," made for childrens when they look at programmes which arent allowed for their ages they can feel frighten


in my opinion it isnt a good thing to advertising toward young children because they dont know which damage it can make ",16
251, they look all the programmes which are directed to them but it can be a good thing if they watch at programmes which are ,6
252, made for them so they can learn to count learn the colours or only to sleep better at night ,8
253, there shouldnt be televison advertising directed s becuase ,15
254, the parents have the responsibility to their children if they are allowed to watch television and which channel their children are allowed to watch,17
255," write a text about the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed 

first we live in the 20 century an it is impossible to use nothing technoligy young children get up with new smartphones or other things the children in the age  get up too with the new technoligy 

second ",13
256, young children havent a own opinion and look at the persons at the television the persons give us a wrong ,17
257," of view 
on the on ",18
258, parents have more time for oneself or other things and the young children watching tv and have fun on the other ,17
259," the young children need fresh air and the conversation with parents or friends wehn the children watching tv all day they are allone and havent activity

the televison has positiv ",17
260, because young children learn at the television colours or other things but a negativ ,17
261, is that she learn things that she dont need ,8
262," that it is important for young children watching television but it is important what they watch and how long because they need conversation with other persons and activitys  
 ",17
263,"the question if television advertising  should be allowed or not is not very easy
on one ",15
264, they might want to know what they could put on their wish list for their ,3
265, these young children do not have much money or their parents guard it for them ,9
266," they are not able to use money properly
personally ",3
267, much of the idea of television advertising  aged betweent  firstly i am convinced that these children wont know how to cope with the advertisings and they will want to have everything that the advertisements show them furthermore ,14
268," that children aged  should watch that much television and if they watch there shouldnt be advertising in between the series they are watching
if there are posters on the street advertising the new legos that will be enough if they are intrested they will have a closer look at the advertisement and tell their parents that they want to have this new toy but i do not think it necessary to do television advertising for this young children ",14
269," they will be confronted with advertising on computers and television soon enough
in addition there are always pamphlets advertising for toys or something a small child would like to have if this advertising is ",16
270," on television no one would dare to look at the pamphlet which is not the best version of a book but it is something physical you can go through at any time
i am ",6
271," convinced that there would be some advertisements that are bad and could harm children psychologically because the advertising of the one who pays the most will be shown the most
to conclude ",14
272, it is  a good idea to do advertising  children aged between  because they are simply to young to understand the meaning of an advertisement in order to benefit from their childhood they should not be watching that much television and my opinion is that there shouldnt be advertising interrupting their series,14
273,there are different oppinions to the statement television advertising  aged two or fiveshould not be allowed in this essay ,13
274," pro and contra this topic
 as children have tv channels that are directly presenting shows for their age it is logical that they have to get money tv channels like nickelodeon or kika are very common and the children like them very much ",14
275, it would be sad for them to turn them off because the channels are not allowed to show advertising so it is important to show advertising  ,10
276, the channels can stay alive another ,10
277, is the industry that produces toys and other things for young children they really need to present their advertisements to children and ,16
278, they would not sell nearly as much as they do now children see the toys on the tv and ask their parents if they can have it when only parents would get advertisements for toys most of them would not really care about it and they probably would not buy the toy the kid would have chose  ,20
279, the more expensive ones so the toyindustry needs the advertising toward young children to sell their products and get money another ,0
280, for the advertising is that children always want to be treated as grownups ,2
281, they like to watch advertising on television because it is a thing that is ,10
282, on channels for older people and ,6
283, they maybe feel more accepted as a child in the world of adults but there are ,7
284, against showing young children advertisings on tv the most important one is that the kids can be manipulated into buying things they see if a advertisement is really good and adresses the child with  ,13
285,  bright coulours and a catching name the child is most likely going to want the toy or other thing it sees they will ,20
286, ask their parent to buy it but a lot of parents cannot spend as much money at toys ,20
287, they want to some parents will maybe buy the toys and ,20
288, do not have enough money left for other things if they would not buy the toy the child would be very sad or angry about his parents and probably ,20
289, be bullied by other kids because they do not have the newest ball or other kind of things besides that these toys can be really expensive they ,20
290, tend to be useless especially kids at a very yound age really want to have a toy ,20
291, play with it for a ,18
292, lay in a cupboard and be forgotten after a ,18
293, the child will fill its room with things it does not play with anymore and does not need it that might be not as bad at the ,24
294, the child grows older it is going to want a more adult room and ,24
295, has to throw a lot of toys away or has to donate or sell it if possible in my opinion it is a very controverse thopic and i cannot say if ,20
296, or for it i would ,18
297, that we should allow companies to show their advertisements  and ,15
298, should let the children watch it but ,6
299, they should keep the amount of advertisements they show between kids tv channels to a minimum and they should ,13
300, just play the advertisement at the end of a show ,10
301, the kid does not get interrupted by it and ,8
302, waiting the show to go on finally ,18
303, the parents should keep an eye on their very young children ,12
304, they do not spend all their time watching tv because tv itself is not very good for them ,17
305,"is television advertising  useful unnecessary or should it even be forbidden in this statement it says that television  should not be allowed

",15
306, there should be an equality between all advertiser and no one should be disadvantaged because of the ,11
307, that it is  almost everyone can advertise his products ,11
308, why should these type of commercials be forbidden there are even commercials for healthinfluencing products ,15
309, cigarettes or alcohol this prohibition would cause an immense disequality which is unbearable fr todays society although i must say that ,21
310, that these young children will be affected or influenced by these ads but ,16
311, its in the advertisers own right to advertise their products the young children will see it on the television but most of the time they wont think about it for too long or they arent even interested in what is shown to them it could be that they like the color or sound of it ,2
312, its a toy but even ,20
313, they like the product its ,3
314, in the parents right to buy it or not to buy it the parents will decide if its good for the child or not because children aged  arent ,2
315," able to decide for their own but the grown up people nowadays are able to decide for their own if they need the advertised product and if they want to buy it or not you cant take away the rightful freedom of these people mostly parents to think and decide on their own 

to sum it up ",2
316, because of these following main reasons the equality and freedom of advertisement and the peoples right most of the time the parents right to decide for their own whether they want to buy the product or not i ,23
317,the statement is about television advertising toward young children and is a very complex topic with a lot of pros and cons ,13
318, start off with the pros come to the cons ,21
319," that and give my opion at the end
at ",21
320," at a very young age are very easy to influence that is why parents always should pay attention about what they are watching they could get bad dreams about scary things they watch or develop a fear all of the sudden 
as they can be influenced ",7
321, might want to have every new toy they see on tv and ,20
322," look at these new things on the tv than go out and play with the toys they already own
now ",1
323, talk abbout the pros of this statement when the children see ,8
324, the toys that they want to have on tv it is easier to buy them because their parents do not have to take them to the store if the child would come with them they would probably find other toys and would want to buy them all another reasons is that they would not even unterstand everything ,20
325," it is not important if they watch it or do not

in my opion ",6
326, children are protected from adversiting because they are ,7
327, easy to influence and probably believe the things that are said ,3
328, that the channels should not be too influenced by that and that the always have to keep an eye on their children to prevent them from seeing something bad,17
329, about making money in any possible way and ,23
330, the advertising towards the costumer plays a big role ,11
331," but should there be an age limit that forbids it that younger children stand under the influence of the companies

a well known strategy to make profit is adressing the costumer directly and in buisness all tricks are allowed ",16
332, why not make the product attracting to little children who are an easy target ,2
333, they donâ´t think about the ,3
334, if they really need it obviously itâ´s just an easy to make the commercial colorful and interesting ,11
335, that the young kids get the feeling they despretly need that certain toy of course itâ´s the parents that pay but the children are being annoying and loud for ,20
336," get what they want
so some people might say those children are too young and shouldnâ´t stand under that influence because they canâ´t decide wether that toy is actually that much fun and laugh as it is presented on tv but that ",20
337, the children might want something for the outdoor fun like a new special ball and ,20
338," they want to play outside and stop sitting in front of the tv and that canâ´t be bad at all

finally ",1
339, the opinion that television advertising towards young children doesnâ´t have to be forbidden because itâ´s not just the influence of tv commercial even ,13
340," they go to the shops with their parents the companies always try to get the young ones to be interested in their products so it wouldnâ´t make a difference at all for the children themselves just for the tv channels to reorganize the programm
",2
341,the statemant above leads to controversial oppinions so there cant be only one right oppinion is varies from person to person because not everyone looks at this the same but i ,21
342, nowadays advertisings influence us a lot ,11
343, we think they dont and young children are the ones that can be influenced easily ,7
344, of that and making television advertisings to in a way poison young children and make them believe they need something only because it is said in the television because ,13
345, children dont know what they really need and what is only a waste of money but ,2
346, not a lot of parents can refuse a wish of their children and ,9
347," the winner is again the money industry which manipulated young children with the help of this advertising in case to reach their own goal 
it could ",0
348, be the case that some parents just cant afford expensive new toys for their children but young children ,20
349, dont understand why they didnt get what they wanted and that makes them sad and angry and if other children get what they wanted and ,9
350, play all together with it it could be the the child whose parents couldnt afford a new toy gets left by alone and doesnt feel accepted and all of this only because someone made them believe they need to have this certain toy ,20
351, televison advertising  should not be allowed because only the money industry takes ,15
352, of it and the manipulated young children and their parents are the only ones who could suffer from that ,7
353, theyre not aware of it,3
354, television advertising  should not be allowed because its unhealthy for them to whatch television too often ,15
355, that could cause that they dont move enough its important that children go outside and move ,24
356," sitting in front of the tv the whole time
moreover they could get used to technic too much ",1
357," they already whatch tv in that young age too often they want to use computers smartphones and tablets etc in their future way too often because they think its just normal and everybody does it because television advertising  was allowed so they stay in their room all the time and dont go outside because they can have contact with their friends by using their smartphones which is very unhealthy
on the other ",17
358, television advertising  should be allowed because its very interesting for them because they can learn something for instance there are many shows on the tv that are ,15
359," for very young children and that try to teach them something by having fun which can be very effective

in my opinion television advertising  should be allowed but the parents shouldnt let their children whatch tv too often because its very important for their health and social life that they ",14
360, that the parents should make a rule that says how long their children are allowed to whatch tv and what they are allowed to whatch ,17
361, half an hour a day and just the programm thats ,18
362, that it cant happen that the parents sit their children in front of the tv ,12
363, that they dont have to care about them its very important that they undertake something with their children ,9
364," they could go to the playgroung
in the end ",19
365, say that young children should be allowed to whatch tv because it can be interesting for them and they can learn something but their parents have to whatch that they dont do it too long  ,17
366," write an essay discussing the prohibition of television advertising toward young children

on the one ",13
367, there seems to be no need for a prohibition of ,12
368, most of the children aged 2 to 5 are allowed to watch television anyway and are ,17
369," confronted with other advertisements that might have an even more negative impact on their development eg alcohol advertising

on top of that there is the chance that these advertisements create an interest the children can dedicate their life to eg playmobil toys of ancient rome may create a passion for this epoque nevertheless this includes the risk of bad habits that may have a negative influence on their ",0
370, we have to consider this kind of television advertising as dangerous as parents cannot realize their ideas of education anymore if they allow their children to watch televion for example they might consider a close contact to nature as necessary but ,14
371," an advertisement their child is completely fixed on the advertised toys and does not want to leave the house anymore

all in all ",20
372, that it is necessary to differentiate advertising addressed  can create ,11
373, a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing ones life eventually it depends on the content of the advertisement and how the parents can include this in thei ,0
374,first of all what is declarated as a television adverising tv ,10
375, that was not that hard but what about smartphones computers consoles and ,18
376, on theres basically no difference young children sitting in front of a screen or a monitor the main problem is that you cant really stop it because everybody else is doing it elders have a bad influence because we watch tv and use smartphones ,17
377, the children want to have this ,20
378,"
theres no international limit for tv or other electronic devises ",10
379, how can you say it should not be allowed sure its sad that theres basically no longer a childhood without those things but ,12
380," today its normal that you have a tv at home dont get me wrong its sad to see like two are three years old children just sitting there and watching tv all day and for older generations that not normal but the world and technology are changing
today you plenty more options that you havent like 30 years ago or even 10 years its normal that todays activities are different ",17
381, those back years ago the main problem i see is who controls whether the  years old are watching tv or something like that or not and what is the penalty if they do its really hard to control that nearly impossible because almost everybody has those television devices at home and its really easy to ge them ,12
382," you cant just stop it
in my opinion this statement is just silly because you cant execute it and in todays world television advertising is a part of our life some people dont like this but it is what it is you cant really do something against it i see the ",15
383," a seven year old already has a smartphone and three year olds watching tv all day but today this may be declarated as normal
",1
384,"young children can be easiliy influenced by everything so if they watch tv an advertisement could easily make them want to have the product shown in the advert so there comes up the question should tv advertising dirceted towards young children be forbidden 
there is the question how far we are gonig to go to protect our children and ",13
385, an advert could heavily influence them they are most likely not going to grow up if they dont get in contact with adverts because if they dont get adressed ,0
386, they are 25 they are going to be ,19
387, they are 6 so how is there any difference if they dont get the experience of watching adverts they will not be able to deal with them ,16
388," they are  older 
furthermore these adverts dont damage the kids at all they are just showing new toys of cereals and ",16
389, they are trash why ahouldnt the companies have the right to show the world what they created there the children have to learn that not everinthing is like it looks in the advert and ,2
390," it makes them cry it will form their character 
finally the adverts might want to make a child force their parents to buy a toy for them and if it cries because they wont ",0
391, it will have to learn its lesson and if the parents want to give their sweetie anything it desires and they have to buy every fing toy it sees in an advert ,20
392," dont blame the advert but blame the parent 
in my opinion there is no real reason to forbid such tv adverts because the experience of such things are very importat for children of that age there are no convincing ",14
393," for this ponit and i am sure that this is never going to happen because it doesnt make any sense at all but  
   ",19
394,concerning the given statement about television advertising toward young children people have differnt opinions some are convinced they should not be allowed ,13
395," others dont mind them in the following the statement will be evaluated

on the one ",21
396," children are constantly confronted with all sorts of advertising as they watch television ads that are  people their age would be better for their intellects than those that are meant for adults only to keep them safe from sexual and violent subjects it would be helpful to show the right ads on channels they watch
on the other ",14
397," chidren aged  should generally not be allowed to watch television regularly if parents are responsible with their childrens time management there is no need for tv companies to show ads  them
it is important to mention that children do have a say in what their parents buy them having seen an interesting ad about a toy ",14
398," can have them begging for it 
but actually those children are not customers ",9
399, they dont have a say in what their parents buy them therefore advertising about toys and other childrens products should ,2
400," they are potential customers  not the children themselves

in conclusion ",9
401, children are an important part of todays economy they should not be confronted with advertsing  them in public media,13
402,advertising follow us through our whole life even young children are used to listen and see advertising but is that right should young children be influenced by television advertising in the following ,14
403," discuss this statement

on the one ",21
404," young children have to learn how to deal with advertising for example that not everything what is said in advertsings is right or usefull if they dont learn that early they may have problems with it later 
on the other ",16
405, advertising could be an bad influence ,11
406, if young children are confronted with ,7
407," much advertising that they didnt even realize that the things in advertising arent real and in cause of that they will believe in things that aren real and build their world on wrong thoughts for example that little girls could think that unicorns and elves are real because they saw that in tv it could be hard for the parents to explain their kids that the unicorns are only animated and that they dont live in the real world such a statement could be shocking for a young child
but it is normal for kids to believe in things that arent real like princesses or fairytales if they grow up they will realize that they lived in castle of fantasies it is a normal experience for kids and nothing to worry about because it worked for generations of children
furthermore the parents could prepare their kids for example it is necesarry to talk about the advertising and the parents should explain their kids that you cant buy everything just because it looks fantastic in the advertisement they could make a trip through the supermarket and show their kids the toys of the television advertising and show them ",2
408," that they arent that fantastic 
besides they are confronted with advertising anyways ",11
409," in the supermarket or the streets or magazines it is hard to completly isolate children and protect them from advertising

to come to a conclusion i am of the oppinion that with the right leading from the parents even young children could navigate through the jungle of television advertising and they will learn how to deal with it it is the best way to prepare kids for the future it isnt nedded to forbid television advertising for young children because it isnt needed to protect them from anything if they know how to protect themselves ",14
410,"television advertising has a big role in modern society cigarettes snacks or smartphones almost everything has its own advertise but what about toys for kids do they need advertises directed to them or does it has a negative effect on them should television advertising  not be allowed
advertising has an effect on everybody no matter if he or she is young or old nevertheless its not a secret that little kids are likely to be influenced by such things if a kid sees that this toy is the best like it is said in the advertise it believes that it is tne best but sometimes things are to expensives to affort for some families a kid who believes only this toy is the best could be frustrated or sad if it doesnt get this toy a situation that could be strenghten by other children who have this toy furthermore could the other kids begin to bully a kid who has not got the best toy like they said in the advertise 
anyway the modern world is full of advertises not only in tv ",14
411," in the internet at train stations or on walls in cities so where is the difference between an advertise that says parents buy this or that for your kids because its the best or if it sayskids look thats the best toy in the world the message is the same for children they see this toy is the best and they want it especially kids aged  can not differentiate between advertises directed to them and advertises directed to other persons
moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids they have to make them clear that not everything said in television is right on the one ",16
412, a confrontation with this kind of advertising could be bad ,11
413," children can only learn from it if they are confronted with it and learn to spectate advertising from other perspectives
",0
414, than ban advertises directed to kids from television it is more important to teach the kids how to deal with advertises if theyd just be abandonned the kids would never learn how to deal with things or persons that try to manipulate them maybe they would even be easier influenced by populists than other persons if they did not learn howe to say no,13
415,"nowadays many advertisments on television feature cute toys aiming to attract young children to want them because these children are usually at a very young age it is discussed whether to ban these ads or not

many parents know the struggle of their kid seeing something quite expensive and useless on tv like a flying barbydoll or a selfdestructing car the kids might be sad if their parents decide not to give these items to them they might even become angry at them throwing a tantrum if they want something really bad this is not just bad for the atmosphere in the family itself but could ",14
416," affect the childs mental health if they feel like they never ever get what they want the most

on the other ",7
417, if the kids stay nice and quiet they might have the chance to get the thing they want for christmas without the ad about it on television they maybe would have never known that this special thing existed in the ,20
418," place and if the parents decide to give it to them for birthday or christmans the child will be very happy

one cannot forget ",9
419, that children aged  may not have a sense for rational thinking or are conscious about moneys worth at all ,7
420, they might see some completely useless and easily breakable item on tv which they ,3
421," want to have for christmas and if they parents dont look up details about that item and just trust their child because it makes it happy the child might end up with a broken toy which will make them even more sad

by far the best ",20
422, to make is that no matter what the child wants no matter how sad it will get everything is always up to the parents if they decide not to buy something their kid will just forget about it ,9
423, weve all been there and everythings just fine and if the parents have a lot of money and dont care about what they buy in the ,9
424," place why not show these children some cool toys on tv to make them happy

concluding id say that ads aimed towards young children shouldnt be banned because as one can see really no matter what its always up to the parents if the kids throw a tantrum theyll get over it sooner or later the ads are perhaps the best way to get to know new products and ",16
425, the children deserve to sometimes not always get what they want ,9
426, it is not the best thing to buy this way they can ,3
427, learn from it and maybe develop a sense for whats good and whats not ,18
428, they can better decide what to buy for themselves ,9
429,"as technoglogy evolves more and more product selling companies find more ways to advertise their products and trick people into believing they need those products this being achieved by making use of several psychological tricks and methods
and ",23
430, there arent only products for adult people the focus is ,2
431, on teenagers and children in ,8
432," a lot of companies only sell toys for children making this an essential part of our economy
but keeping in mind how companies find ways to manipulate their potential customers the question arises whether or not advertising ",0
433," on television directly addressed to children should be prohibited

in order to support this statement one could argue and say that ",13
434, their childish minds and behaviours kids are much more easily tricked into doing an believing things than adults making it much easier to make them want to have certain things someone may take this to an extreme and say that kids childish natures are being abused which is highly questionable from a moralic ,7
435," of view
furthermore children influenced by tv ads are going to to try and make their parents buy those certain products which they most likely wont ",14
436," causing unnecessary tears

despite having taken the negative ",18
437," should have jusgt as much attention
so ",18
438, tv advertising might influence children there is no sign that it causes any major negative effects or even damgage to them it does not hurt them ,14
439," all has there ever been a child being seemingly damaged by wanting a new toy car doubtful
in order to answer the question as to whether or not such tv ads should be banned or not the companies perspectives should ",14
440, be taken into consideration from their ,21
441," of view advertising is essential to find potential customers
and ",11
442, if they suddenly werent allowed to show ads on tv anymore theyd ,10
443, find another way to advertise their products ,11
444," via smartphones

giving attention to ",18
445, we can conclude that tv advertising should not be banned,15
446,the statement tv advertising  should not be allowed is about what impact ads can make to humans ,15
447," 

it depends on their parents if their parents are strong and do not buy their kids everything they want to have ads will not have a big impact it ",0
448, depends on which ads are showed if there are only advertises about things that kids do not need like insurances or cars no one will bat an eye it will get interesting ,16
449, advertises are shown with kids as target the children will try to force their parents to buy them the things they have seen on the tv but if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine so it is very important to show the children who has the power in addition children  are not that good in arguing they will just say something like i need this toy please buy it daddy and if the parents are smart they will tell them that they do not need it ,2
450, the parents will not buy it the children have no other choice than accepting this except for begging or crying but if the parents stay cool and maybe ignore the children ,9
451," they are crying they will soon stop doing it
another ",3
452," is that some ads which children should not see are shown at night or in the late evening so there is no danger that children could see ads they should not see

so i ",16
453, with this statement because smart parents are stronger than any advertise and if they are not they should think about their role as a parent,9
454,if youve ever accidently switched to a tv channel for kids ,6
455, watching television or have children yourself who  watch these channels youve probably encountered the high amount of long advertisment blocks in which products like expensive toys sweets or lemonade are being presented in todays world a lot of parents use modern media to entertain their kids because of what it is important to question the effect of these advertisments on the younger generation ,14
456," developed children aged 

these ads are a big part of the marketing campaign of the toy and sweet manufacturers banning them for being inappropriate would seriously harm these companies as there wouldnt be many ways left they could reach the kids there target group the ways left would be the internet which is ",16
457," often used by young children and the direct advertisment in the streets

yet one should consider that the advertisments are always flashy and show the happy children who use the product they never show what effects the lemonade has on their health if it is unhealthy and full of sugar their effect is always hidden as the parents wouldnt allow their kids to buy the advertised product it is wrong to sell an unhealthy product to innocent children

also important is that the children arent really developed ",2
458, they havent had many experiences with money and arent able to decide whether the board game they want ,3
459," badly is overpriced often the parent would give in on their child which is not going to give up on that toy

considering all of these ",20
460, it is somewhat clear that the target group of children aged  isnt ,7
461, ready to be influenced and ,18
462," manipulated by the toy companies i
",20
463,"advertisment has an big influence on our society it can have a big impact on how we behave and what we spend our money on so should young children at the age of  have contact with advertisment for their age already

first advertisment  would be very effective because it would reach ",16
464, the children but the parents ,9
465, parents are often not able to resist the wishes of their children that is why the profit of companies selling ,9
466," toys would rise
futhermore advertisment is needed to inform the public about new products it is important to inform the customers buying toys clothes and everything else for young children about new products and innovations too

on the other ",0
467, young children at the age of  can not make their own buying decisions and they are not able to handle money becauso of that it may be more effective to publish advertisment directed to middleaged people because they as parents decide ,16
468, young children have contact with advertisment every day advertisment directed to them would have a bigger impact on them and their behavior they ,16
469," do not know about the risks in our society and whether something is good or bad because they are just at the begining of their developement that is why they can be manipulated very easily advertisment can be developed in a way that may have a hidden influence on their opinion later

summarising all ",7
470, i can conclude that television advertising  should not be allowed because of the negative impact this could have on their development and because of them being not reasonable enough to make their own decisions and to realise whether something is good or bad,13
471,advertising has always been a very controversial topic even in the early days of printed media there have already been provoking and oftentimes ,15
472, strange means used by certain companies to advertise their products but ,11
473, the implementation of television in the last century it has quickly began to develop into an even more pressing issue mainly because the audience who is exposed to said advertisements is growing ever younger with children as young as two years of age already actively watching television this ,14
474, raises the question whether or not these children should ,12
475, be considered a potential target group by companies with advertisements directly targeted at them or if this process should be strictly banned ,11
476," protect those children
certainly one could argue that advertisement has no measurable impact on the behaviour of children and ",13
477, that might be true it is ,19
478, that the exposure to advertisements requires a basic understanding of the market of being able to manage your income carefully determining whether or not an investion really is worth it young children obviously have in most cases not ,0
479, they cannot make an informed decision on whether or not to like a certain product but ,3
480, are lured in by the most mesmerizing advertisment and this isnt really what the free market should be about ,11
481, it may cause great profit to certain companies it undoubtedly exploits young human beings for the sole sake of earining money which i ,23
482," would deem immoral
of course it is now possible to state that ",19
483, the advertisements might be directed at children it is ultimately their parents who are at fault ,16
484, for exposing them to television at such a young age and ,7
485, for letting them spend their pocketmoney on everything they want without supervision and this is ,9
486, only partially because parents cant be blamed for exposing their children to something they had no prior knowledge of that it even existed they simply were naã¯ve enough to trust the advertisors ,2
487, they would never resort to such despicable means but it ,19
488, has to be conceded that parents should at all cost supervise their children ,12
489, they are spending their pocketmoney ,3
490, at such an early age and this has become a problem of quite some magnitude as many parents no longer show real care for their offspring ,7
491," shopping a phenomenon which can easily be observed by visting a store of choice at a busy hour of day
in conclusion i ",23
492, the partial irresponsibility which can be attributed to the parents companies should be strictly prohibited from directing their advertisement towards a audience too young to understand even the underlying meaning the concept of advertisement and ,13
493, it might not have an impact on them directly it ,19
494, exploits them thusly i would describe companies directing their advertisements towards young children as being exploitative driven by greed ,16
495, than compassion and downright disgusting,19
496,i can understand that companies direct their advertising towards young children because in that age children can be manipulated very easily and ,16
497, adults and other children are better able to decide wether they actually need the advertised product they only care about the great video and not about what the product actually is and ,2
498, they usually are not able to actually buy these things they are often able to heavily influence their parents ,9
499, insistin on wanting to have something this means that this kind of advertising can be very efficient because more and more younger children watch television on a regular basis ,0
500," more and more companies direct their advertising towards this age group
this means that children are manipulated more and more often and ",2
501, that should not be allowed when children are heavily influenced by advertising ,16
502, children trying to convince their parents of buying a product much more often as they already do and this habit puts a much greater strain on the parents who will probably give in to their children more and more often because they have not got the strength to have similar fights over products over and over again as probably mostly sweets and things to play with are advertised children will probably eat more sweets which could lead to more children being overweight and as people often keep eating habits ,2
503," growing up this might increase the already big problem of obesity in the future
additionally parents will spent more money on sweets and mostly unneccessary things which can be a problem in families which are not wealthy
therefore i completely ",4
504, with the statement television advertising  should not be allowed because forbidding this kind of advertising could reduce many problems in families,15
505, itt sometimes important that children can watch television to learn something about the wolrd or our culture ,17
506, the tales from disney are full of important things like moralism and that the feelings are more important than good looking ,8
507, how it is in the beauty and the beast but there are some ,19
508, with the statement for children its very important to go outside and learn something from our nature and maybe to get dirty is ,8
509, a part from being a child they should find some friends and play with them to improve their social life and ,24
510," their outside the children learn more from physics and their see with their own eyes how the world functions
chidlren can watch television maybe ",8
511, the wheather isnt optional for playing outside or ,18
512, theres no one who they can play with and there should ,19
513, be a maximum given from the adults they shouldnt watch television for more  than four hours a week for children from this age it is ,17
514," very improtant to have a lot of contact with their adults to make a good relationship the children have to learn how to feel and how to react to other people feelings
this is why im ",24
515, the children would get some squared eyes,19
516, with the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed because ,15
517, that televisions for itself have a bad influence children dont learn anything useful ,17
518, they watch tv they get lazy and television advertising  them is very bad aged  are not able to think like adult people and they could get the advertising wrong it is likely possible that they are ,24
519, they have seen it several times convinced that they need to have ,3
520, this little car then parents are pressurised to buy the child the car or the child would be very sad also his or her friend could make fun of him or her because the child does not have the car the marketing industry takes ,20
521, of the normal behaviour of young children and ,8
522, that this is not very human friendly the only reason why i could ,21
523, with this statement is that the effect of televison advertising direced toward young children is not very well known maybe there is ,14
524, a positive influence maybe the future children can handle money better than we do now over all there are better things to do for young children than sitting around and watching tv and if they are not watching tv they can not see the television advertising problem solved,14
525,television advertising is as popular as never ,10
526, as we know advertising wants to make us buy products what most people dont know is that they create ads which stay in our mind unconsiously this means that we can think of a product which occurs to be silly but ,11
527, we buy it because one saw it in an advertising ,23
528, this strategy is dangerous espacially ,19
529, it is s young children they are influenced easily and get obsessed with something ,24
530," you know it should it  really be allowed to play with childrends minds just to enhance the profit of the industry

advertising is probably one of ",13
531," in terms of selling and promoting a product if one set boundaries for certain companys it would create an unfairness a free market is what most of the people are looking for 

we must consider that we already have some products which are not able to be advertised in televison ",15
532," cigarettes why is most certainly obvious it harms people directing advertising to children could be harmful too doesnt it maybe not physically but mentally it gives them an unrealistic illusion and can lead to problems for parents too they have to deal with their needy children 

in my opinion advertising s young children mustnt have a greatinfluence it is the wrong way to make people buy their products the causes of this should be taken into consideration 

",16
533,"especially young children are getting easily influenced by television nowdays advertising is a normal part of the television
the question is if this advertising should be forbidden because of the influence that it could take on young children

a lot of children may not be even able to understand advertising in normal television ",14
534," nerved as influenced
there are some products that may not be shown to children for example alcohol children should not think that alcohol is as cool as it is getting presented
advertising on channels who are made for kids are something else  the way the product is getting presented will be a lot more interesting for a kid than for an adult
an easy way to prevent children from this danger is a regulation of the time a child is watching tv too much tv time leads to a bad eyesight and maybe to a bad social abillity because of the ",14
535," that a lot of kids are watching tv for hours and hours without speaking to everyone or to get in contact with new friends or kids

for me advertising towards young children is not a problem the parents should care about the time their child is sitting in front of a tv and if the child is watching something that is meant to be for his age
imagine that there would not be advertising anymore  where is the money for the channels coming from  some channels would not be even able to exist
advertising is one of the main money makers for channels and it would be a really hard challenge for some of the smaller ones to keep showing the same content as ",14
536," that can be discussed wether good or bad is that children get inspired for their whishes on christmas
",8
537, this is something that can be as good as bad,21
538, arguement regarding to the statementtelevision advertising  should not be allowed ,15
539," lines

the television advertising  children could confuse the children because they dont know how to deal with the situation there could be ",2
540," a bid teddy bear on the television who tells the children that they should buy him and that he is the best teddy bear that they will ever have young children aged  wont notice that thos is just a pr strategie and that this teddy bear can not speak with them

but it is ",2
541, a good train for children for learning how to deal with treat from the internet or the television ,6
542, they learn how to handle in situations like these most of the time the parents can tell them that th eteddy bear can not speak and that the things he says in television are just a lie ,24
543," want the teddy bear the spreadings from the parents are mostly deeper and more respective for the children than the ones out of the television

there is ",20
544, a problem given by television advertisement because a lot of children are feared by the figures or symbol in the advertisement spots clowns big bearslions etc ,0
545, they cant sleep at night and are scared to go outside this is a problem for their process of growing up because theyll always have the picture of the big clown they saw ,24
546, they where four inside their head ,19
547, they dont notice it specially anymore but it will ,19
548," be on the inside

but television advertising towards children with two years is not a big problem because the children with two years will not notice that it is towards them and they wont notice what is going on in these advertising spots ",16
549," the parents can be calm beecause it isnt a big problem to deal with

furthermore these advertising spots can bring the children to bad ideas ",16
550," their parents will not buy them the bid teddy bear they just go inside the shop and steal it because the teddy bear said i want you to own me or cuddle me there are a lot of children who get treated by those spots this can be a start for an criminalisation of the children

all in all i can say that these advertzising spots towards children with  years are unnecessary and lean them to do criminal things none of the children in these ages will have enough money to buy these stuff ",16
551," these spots should not be allowed 

",19
552,"kids in this age canâ´t buy everything what they see on the tv but they want to have it and talk to their parents and they will buy it 
also ",20
553," that parents have to told their children that it isnâ´t everything real what they see on tv
 but ",6
554, children are very easy to manipulate ,7
555," on some tv channels for children there isnâ´t television advertising for example the german tv channel kika 
also children donâ´t know the risks of television advertising they have to learn it ",14
556, they will grow up another ,24
557," is that children believe in everything what they see for example they see on the tv that you are cooler if you eat fruchtzwerge children want to have fruchtzwerge 
in this case parents have no choice and will buy the thing the children want to have
so ",7
558," that television advertising toward young children should be not allowed because they are too young and can be manipulate
but companys earn a lot of money with this television advertising ",13
559, it would be hard to forbidden televison advertising toward young children,13
560,"sould advertising directed  aged  be allowed or not
this is a very controversial question and it is hard to decide between yes and no ",16
561, evaluate the two options and come to a conclusion answer or ,21
562,"

a lot of people believe that it is unethical to introduce children to the world of this kind of economy at the age of two years these young children should not bother about whether they want a pink barbie doll or a blue pegasusunicorn just from looking at television advertisements because they could have been influenced too much it might be possible that they donâ´t even want some of the things shown in the advertisement but beg their parents anyways just because theyâ´ve seen it on tv sure there are other people who say that thats the concept of advertising but most people do not want to buy some things to their children and experience that they donâ´t use it or play with it
another ",2
563," against advertising directed to children is that it might not be worth it for some companies to direct it to children not many children watch television at the age of two or donâ´t understand the content of the advertisement that sounds like the companies that make adverts for children lose more money by putting the advertisement on national television than for actually selling the product
however the parents of the young children might want to buy some of the products because they believe that they are good for their toddlers and that they might enjoy it seen from this angle those television spots arenâ´t directly produced for young children but more for parents of young children

i belive that television advertisements should not be  because i believe that it is just a waste of money and time for the companies that decide to produce a  television advertisement because i belive that young children donâ´t need to watch television and they shouldnâ´t be talked into  things they donâ´t truly want
in my opinion advertisements can be directed to children aged five and older because i believe they can handle the input of information better that chikdren younger than five",13
564, talk about the statement television advertising  aged should not be allowed ,15
565," essay
 in our generation it is normal that children have a mobile phone and a i pad or something like this when they do not have the best of the best they were uncool and sometimes they get bullied by other children the parents try to get them back to the old times like playing in the garden or reading a book when i was 5 years old id love to play with my friends or with my babybornfurthermore i do not even really now what happens around the world or what televison can be sometimes i watched movies for children but never a ducumentary nowadays children at this age have their own tv in their room and there are many shows whitch are not good for them or things they can not understand at this age moreover they here something about political stuff in the trash tv and they think it is right if its not adressed to them
so ",17
566, the positive thing is that the children can learn something about the world very early and they do not need to talk to their parents or read a book but thats really sad ,12
567, indeed the show were adressed to children and ,6
568, there would be a lenguage for this age to understand and the surrounding would be great to see but children will watch this the whole time and do not even know how to read a letter or a book likewise ,6
569, that it should not be allowed yes children need education but in the age of  they are to young they do not must know this stuff and they do not buy anything so they should play or read and ,12
570," this tv advertisings should be allowed at the age of 12 because there you can start to think about what they talk about some people say that children need as much education as they could get but not at this age think about your childhood  can you imagine to watch and important is to understand what the people what from you in this advertising
 at this moment i totally ",14
571, with this statement and it should not be allowed everything else is to much for this children also ,12
572, it is adressed to this children we do not know if they show bullshit there ,6
573, the parents were not happy ,9
574, they see the trash but i must tell at least that the children would only watch this shows and not everything else what is badly for them to see like a horror movie but that did not change my opnion ,6
575,medias have become a big part in a humans life almost in every corner of our life there are machines and ,10
576, displays as we know the influence of medias begins in young ages because children like to watch tv but what do  children want to see of course the program but between the end and the ,17
577," of a new program there are breaks  advertised breaks so is it a good or bad for a children aged between two and five to see these advertisings

first of all it can give the children a sense for technology they start to understand that technology is important and that this has to be improved during the advertisings they get to see other machines like planes computers etc other machines than a tv this can support their interests
secondly even they do not realize it they start to learn they learn how many interesting things the world has to offer therefore later they are motivated to learn more about the world and its cultures toys and people for example there is a chinese toy on the tv later the kid asks itself where the toy comes from because he could not find the toy in any stores in its country 

in addition to these ",0
578, there are far more negative ,21
579," about the television advertising 

in young years the creativity is very important for a child they learn to understand and discover many things by doing things for example transforming a wooden stick to a knife of a king they can create their own ideas and have fun to do things because ",0
580," the tv there is no one who says them with which toys they have to play in their age 
secondly the influence is too strong and kind of dangerous for them there are girls and boys toys and these are presented by very smart kids sometimes by unreal kids that means that even in young years they start to doubt in themselves and ask themselves if they are good enough for the world as it shows it can very dangerous for children 

finally television advertising should not be allowed because the danger that children start to doubt in themselves is too big they are not secure about themselves any more this can lead to very big problems in their entire life therefore we have to protect the children from this kind of bad influence and stop television advertising ",14
581," it should be said that a directive like this propably never will happen to the television because would getâ´s more and more digital
but thinking of the consequenses of some kind of television this might be a good way to keep that kind of stuff away form this young children for example psychomovies ore some thrillers or actionmovies this basically has nothing to do with the normal programm young children watch today but if they get used to watch tv every days ",17
582, they are maybe 3 years old they might start watching this kind of movie ways earlier ,24
583, they should another problem could be that this children might have some problems to make friends later bcause they are ,12

in my opinion there is no way that the gouvernment ore anyone else ",12

590, there children are allowed to watch tv i  do think that there are to many children watching allot to much tv nowerdays but as i said the important thing is to show the maybe futural parents what could happen if they do not handle this problem but according to the specific statement from the adversiting i say no it should be allowed because if the parent regulate the tv usage of there children right it has allot of ,17

592, the small children should get to know the real world and how it works ,12
593, the moment they were born it might be quite a good lesson for young children to consider diffrent options of living in the young age its essential to learn many diffrent lessons about life one of ,8
594, one is to understand that there are milions of people living in this world and that there always will be different thing you wanna buy the lesson to not always get what you want is quite important and necessary for life a television advertising toward young childern might be an amazing help for specific lessons in the education on the other ,0
595, television advertising toward children can be followed by extremely deep familyproblems if children not having a big amount of money in the family everyday get to see this advertising with happy children playing funny games they really get to  belive that other kids might be much happier than them they get to see how money leads to positiv emotions the good thing about children is to see how happy they are and how much fun they can have requireing nothing if childern in their early age get used to see people beeing happy because of investigated money they will always in life tend to think that richness leads to happiness  a young kid will never understand that advertising hasnt anything to do with real life  ,14
596,"many of aus us it every day the smartphone the tablet the computer and there are critics an people which see a chance in the using of this new technology but is it ok to give that high technology devices to children aged  or shouldnt it be allowed to give them 
i can see this situation very often ",24
597, on public places the poblem with this is that the children cant imagin that its not real what they see and its the same with tv advertising when the children with two years lern to do the things from the tv advertising they maybe start smoking with twelve years on the other ,16
598, the advertising could help the parents find out what the children want e g for present for the birthday or christmas but there are ,0

601, teh children see something the parents decide if they buy the product or not because they are in the need of paying it personally ,2
602, that the television advertising directly towards young children should not be allowed because the children are in they own developement aged  the advertisment should ,13
603, expect the consumer to buy and that are in this age the parents ,23
604,"in the following essay we are going to discuss the statement whether it should be allowed to show television advertisment which are focused on children between two and five years old or not

on the one ",13
605, it should be allowed to show ,19
606, these advertisments because the children are more informed what is in trend and can compare with other children they usually dont read newspaper or magazines ,0
607," they can see things from the televeision
but there are many problems if children see advertisments which are focused on them the brain of children in this age is not ",17
608, developed like a brain of an youth or an adult they believe almost everything children can ,7
609, be influenced more easily by different things if you tell a child that santa clause exists it will believe but an adult knows that it is not true they ,7
610," do not have this critical thinking of things that adults have     

in my opinion it should be not allowed to show tv advertisments for children between two and five they see something colourful beautiful etc and for them it seems to be the best thing in the world they will annoy their parents to buy this thing tv ads are just made to manipulate a childs brain because of the straightforward thinking in todays life it is very difficult to keep children away from electronic media because everyone has a tv or something similar in his home so the advertisment companies use this as an ",14
611, and manipulate a childs brain,7
612,now i will count on some ,18
613," for the statement
television should not be allowed for young children because they would see pictures they dont understand and which are not made for young childs they shouldnt see that pictures because they could be afraid of things they should not afraid of like zombies in a horrormovie additionally they need the time to play outside and experiance the world and they cant do that because the tv is always more interrestic for young children it normal furthermore young children could start of having an unreal view of the world because they just see the suggerested pictures in the television and dont try to find it out themself so in this important time for a child to grow up and learn things they should do it without tv because its an lonely live with just watching tv and they need the social links
otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching tv they just need to switch it on and they are in a new world where they can see what they want and expriance what they want the television is part of our future ",17
614, why dont tell them early how to use it the televison ,6
615, could make friends or link familys because it connects people if they watch a funny quiz or if the watch a dramatic dokumentation they do something together and thats the ,6
616,"
in my view young children aged  should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents for example once a week an doumentation which is specially made for young children is good to learn something and learn what the tv is anything more than this makes the ",17
617," i wrote about the bad things on tv come true
  ",18
618,sure ther are some pedagogical helpful series for children but there is just to much crab on the program and sadly this part overweight sure for parents it is quite comftable to just let their children hanging arround infront of tv they do not make any work and they are silent make and may the learn something from a pedagogical helpful serie but hardly most of the shows or movies they watch are not and there are many other bad things about let children gamble in front of a television i know that they will enjoy it at this moment but some years later they probabely will not adore anymore a life like this because it brings many bad ,17
619, with it it is really unhealthy to watch television too often because of your all day long by your own and just sitting there is not any possibility to make friends or to get a social life those children who sit at all the time in their childhood will be inivertal and lonely and thats a really bad thing for mental health the human is a social species and needs other idividuals around him also for physical health it is terrible the children are just sitting arround and likely are eating amounts of snacks mosetly unhealthy sweets there can not grow any muscles which would be necessairy for a healthy body ,17
620, for the higher age instead the amount of bodyfat would increas and those children will get overweight and may get worse health issues thei should not sit all the day in a room and just see the world on a screen they should learn the world know through their experiences with all their sens and not just join via a screen ,24
621, television can forming minds and ,17
622, the children will not get the chance to develop their owne thoughts about anything,7
623, with this statement  becouse young children shoud go out ,12
624," and not in the houswhen a young child often befor the tv sithe donâ´t  can do frendchips  with other children  in his older 
the sozial aspekt is in this  moment very importent because ",8
625, your child is the hole day in the hous becaus his tv show  is there  and ,1
626," he donâ´t know  how he shold speak with other people in his older 
maybe they could watch tv but not the hole day and not ",1
627, the weather is goog and you go outside but ,18
628, the weather is bad an you donâ´t can go outside you musst play with your  playtoies and ,1
629," he is older he know a litle bit what is good and what is bad
",7
630,there are various reasons why television advertising  should not be allowed nevertheless ,15
631, a prohibiton would have more ,19
632," of not allowing television advertising towards young children children aged  can be manipulated very easiliy this leads to a wrong upbringing they learn to have a constant need for new products as adults they may not be able to destinguish between what they realy need and where they have been manipulated by advertisements

on the other ",13
633," a big part of the income of tv channels for children are the advertisements without them a lot of tv channels can not survive in addition a fewer number of tv channels decreases the growth of the economy furthermore it is the job of the parents to protect their children of the harm an advertisement can possibly have on their child the parents must not buy everything the child wants is this the case the child will learn that it is not possible to recieve every product is likes

eventually ",14
634, that television advertising  should be allowed the probability that a child is harmed is too small ,13
635, it would cause for tv companies,10
636,"now i will discuss if television adversiting  should not be allowed 
today there is a television in each family and the parents and the adults in the family are watching tv children in the age between two and five spent almost all there time ",17
637, the kindergarden with his mother or father in the evening adults often watch tv and if the children are not going to bed ,1
638," early they are sometimes watching tv with their parents 
in the programm for adults the tv often adverts direct to the audience but today ",6
639, the kids channel do that the children maybe see a new toy and happy children says that it is ,20
640, cool every child would want the toy that is a problem because parents do not want unhappy childreen and ,20
641, they have to say to their child he would not get the toy a nother probolem is that often the werbung manipulates the audience for example playmobil there is a child playing with the new playmobil castle and there is a dragon which can act it can spy fire or is flying in the clouds in the reality that is not possible but younger children would trust the television and think it is real then ,20
642," they get the new playmobil dragon and want to the it spying fire they are sad becaus they thought it works

",18
643, with the statement because i think if young children are watching tv the television should not adverts direct toward to the chidren ,13
644, that we should vorbid this because it doesnt hurt somebody if the content does not match what the parents think that their children should see ,12
645, its their job to prevent them watching tv normaly if you watch tv on a normal time not at night the advertising is pretty childfirendly advertising has always been and will be to leed us buy somthing to do that they will try to enfluence us and ,14
646, that it doesnt harm them ,3
647," they maybee learn even to not fall in the traps that the advertising company do 
an other ",11
648," is that children at that age should not have enough money to buy their own toys or at least their money should be managed by their parents so you can prevent that children spend to mutch of their money
finally i remember ",9
649, i was a child my parents asked me for every birthday or christmas what my wish was ,9
650, if i didnt saw some interesting toys on tv or in a magazine ,20
651," i wouldnt know and this is probably pretty annoying for the parents to find every birthday etc somthing new that their children like

because of these ",20
652," we shouldnt vorbid television advertising toward young children




































































































































































d





















i need healing 3 genji",16
653,"television advertising  can be allowed
on the one ",15
654, there are many reasons to support an advertising free tv programm first children in this age even do not understand what advertising means and how it can influence them in a bad way thats why parents have to keep an eye on their children during their watching period not every parent is able to do ,14
655," because they can have lots of work outside the living room
in addition to that there is the question wether showing advertising and influence them is moralic right or not because it isnt not really neccessary for the once who want to advertise their products and why should someone pay ",11
656," much money just to show such things like toys to children who sometimes even cant talk in their age
but one the other ",20
657, they can learn new things like new words or something about food just by seeing it because they do not see such things in their movies advertising keeps contact to the reality ,6
658, fictional movies dont also there is the chance eg ,19
659," there is tv advertising for a specific toy that the children like it and the parents can buy it to them and it helps parents to confirm their young children to turn the tv off because there will be a five minute break full of advertising which is boring to see anyway
in my opinion its not neccessary to show little children television advertising but it doesnt have to be canceled the parents have to decide what is the best for their children thats enough",14
660,"essay

in our technical world the television in a big part of our life espacilly younger children get influenced a lot by these media so is it a good idea to confront this young children already in this age with television advertising

as in verios studies proven young children get more influenced by any kind of adverting than young adults or older people these young children are very naive and ",14
661, it is very hard for them to understand what is the truth and what is not in the tv also would a children try to buy everything which is showen in the tv because they just want to have everything and this were the parents have to do their work and sometimes have to say no to for example ,17
662," the children wants to buy a knife

but as alreday mentioned ",9
663, we life in a techinical world and to understand and to life in this world every people need the skills on how to handel advertising because it is such an important skill it is important that the ,11
664," generation lears this skill very fast and there is no place better than in your family over a long period of time 

of cause some content is just not right for children like zigarets alkohol or other kinds of violent games these advertisements should not be allowed to see in the television befor eight at night 

so ",17
665, i say that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed but advertisement is a allday thing ,15
666, if they would not see it on the tv they would see it in the streets radio and big city so ,10
667, banning direct advertisement is not the right way ,15
668," discuss the statement that it shouldnt be allowed to show advertising content to children below 5 years of age
if you look at the statement you can see that it only means television advertising the most advertises are related to the content that is sent between those advertises ",13
669, in a show for young children there wont be a car advertise ,16
670, the people making this advertising will try to guess what kind of people will watch their content ,11
671," they catch the right crowd which probably buys this kind of things
if you look at the financial part the tv channels ",10
672," have to make some money to run their business and the content shown 
if i combine those ",11
673, and if the advertising content shown to the children is nothing harmful my opinion of showing television ads to younger people is that they are okay in a way of financing the channel but i ,14
674," think that if kids see too many nice things on tv they like they may will be way too greedy on those things which their parents might not even be able to afford they shouldnt be teached to that much consuming like its often shown on the television but its not that bad if they dont see too much tv and advertising at all 
so if their parents are sitting right beside them and are ",17
675, looking at the stuff their children watch the tv can be switched off ,17
676, an ad comes and parents can protect the kids from unsuitable content or advertising but they should keep in mind that if they dont watch it between the ages of 2 and 5 they might watch it ,14
677, parents cant keep an eye on everything their children see the modern world is just too full of that not even on tv ,12
678, at the streets radio or newspapers,18
679,our life includes more and more technic it brought many ,23
680, but it has a negative ,21
681," too
technic became a big part of our live and with it television so a ",10
682, for letting children watch television at young age is that it could be good to confront them with it already in a young age there are ,17
683, themes in the television where children can learn from for example a film about animals or other cultures on the other ,6
684, the mother or father could ,19
685," showing their child this film look with it at a book about animals in this case the parents could spend time with their child and be interactive with it
but if a child only sits in front of the television it will have less time to go outside play with children of the same age and do what children are supposed to do playing running and use their creativity that brings us to the ",6
686, the evolution of the creativity of a child could be more difficult and ,8
687, that is the worst part about this if the child has never learned to occupy himself it wont be able to ,24
688," its olter too it will continuou sitting infront of its television or computer to build relationships will be more difficult
so ",19
689, you deffinitely cant forbid children in young age to watch television because their parents are responsible for the education of their child but ,17
690, one should give the parents more informations about the effect an overdosed consume of television could have in some cases ,17
691,"the question if children between two and five should be the audience of adverstising is difficult

young children are very easy to control and to influence if they see something they are not capible of nmaking up an own opinion that is why advertising on telvision in between kids program is not good children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents if they do not get the product then  the parents are in the situation to forbid their children something the television says they are allowed to get 

but in the most televion channels for kids there is less advertising in the morning ",14
692, espiaclliy children age  watch teelvision there is less of an optertunity for them to see advertising ,14
693," the question is if there really is television adcertising direceted to only this age group

still there is the chance of seeing advertising and the wish rises of getting more and more toys the value of one product gets less because of the high onsume ",14
694, it is not right to manipulate children through advertising even ,16
695," they might get the product advertising is not all about reality and the child might get disappointed

on the other ",2
696, children get conftonted with advertising daily even ,16
697," the television is turned of there are enough adverts in kids magazines or on big posters wich are hung up all over the place the child can not not see the newest products that his parents should buy

but the problem with television advertising is that you do not have to know how to read the posters or buy the magazine it is free to turn on the television and watch at all the concerns wich try to sell their newest and best product to little kids wich do not know better

",14
698," that not allowing television advertising directed to children aged  would not make such a big of a change our whole society is about buying and selling  consuming you can not protect you child fully and forever but i do think that we have to start somewhere we can not ban all posters and magazines but we can decide wich shows and programs our child should watch in shows like toggolino or  zdftivi there is no advertising in the morning as a kid i watched sandmann in the evening and there was no advertising aswell

so no it should not be a law or a rule for all channels to not show advertising but in the primetime for younger children to watch television it should be at least reduced that would be copmromise to ban it completitly will not stop the child from beeing influenced by adverts",13
699,children between two and five years dont really know what they want they see something and if they like it they want it but often ,24
700, a few days they forgot what they wanted and ,3
701," they want something new because of their kindness they cant assess what they need 
for the enterprises which produce specifically for children its perfect that the children dont know what they really want 
",2
702, with this statement because chrildrens are the stakeholders with the lowest influene of their buying behavior if they like the product they want it often the parents of the ,23
703, child wants to make their children very happy ,8
704," they buy them everything they want in this age it important to say that the kids cant assess if the toy they see is really interessting the toy loss on value with the time this time is often a short period of time
from the perspective of the enterprise the children are the perfect target group especially because the parents wants to give presents to their children they are extremly attentively in case what their childrens want to play the parents cant assess if a toy is a good toy or a bad toy its difficult to recognize if their children could have fun with this toy often the advertising dont expect like the reality it the advertisingthe players walk to a farytale and experience a lot of things this is the childrens imagination but in reality its just a boring game which you can play on the table and with this phenomenon childrens dont get what they expected",20
705,in hour time are the technical abilitys in a very high level whil our parents and we ourselfs are grown up without a mobile phone the children which become teenager now know ,8
706, they were 4 how to handel with cellphones and  all the other technical staff they watching tv at least every ,1
707," day but is it good for them that they are all the time confronted with the advertisment on screen

the children in the age of two are to young to watch tv they cant realise and canalise what they see all this advertisement they watching is influencing them without notification if they see a brandnew teddybear in the television they want to have it if the parents now buying them this teddybear the children are thinking that the can have everything they want the ",14
708, time they are seeing something new in the television the partens may dont buy the thing for them and the boy or the gir lwill be sad they were thinking if i want something in the world ,17
709," it is impossible my parents will buy it 

an other argumet could be that the children cann become hoocked on watching tv and as an effect they will ",17
710, watching the whole time advertisment in our western world we are ,11
711, previliged we are having everything and if we want something we can have it but not the whole worl is such priviliged as we are there are ,21
712, many wars at the time ,21
713," many children who are starving because they cant effort they money they need to buy food 
but our children dont see this if the are watching just advertisment the think everything is given and the world is pink

so in my oppinion it is not a good idea to let our children watching the whole time tv because as effect theyre ",17
714,nowadays our world is full of advertising we see it everywhere at anytime of course one of ,11
715, ones is the television advertising everyone has a televsion ,10
716," the most efficient way to catch their attention is showing them on the television but how does this influence our kids minds would it change a thing if we prohibited 

first of all this kids live with their parents who are responsible to look ",24
717," them and the usually know what their children need so why would it be necessary to shot down this television advertising if the people who are responsible of this children allow them to watch it why should people lose their job because of something that even their parents watch we should let the parents choose what they want to allow to their children or not they are called parents for a reason

another ",14
718, the kids try to get whatever they want because they saw it on television or outside if the parents dont ,2
719, with it and dont want to buy it this kids wont be able to buy it by themselves so dont matter what the advertising shows if the parents dont want it this kids arent going to have it and i repeat myself by saying that the parents are the people who control their children and are responsible for their education by prohibiting television advertising we ,2
720," control their way of education their children 

in the other ",7
721, we know that children between two and five see adults as idols and they want to do and to have whatever the own so there is a big probability that their minds are influenced by what they see on television and will try to do it or get ,17
722," it goes in order to be like the others because they dont like to be different

to sum up no matter what children watch on television or outside they will always want it but what is really important is how the parents react to it and what the do to educate them in my opinion we should let the parents choose if their children should watch it or not we are all free to choose what we 


",17
723,our society is made of consumers and sellers we have the urge to make economics we ,23
724, seem to be in a battle with other people who earns more money who is better at selling we are living in a world where technology affects our daily life and where we are dependent on it this could  be the reason why we create televion advertising however ,10
725, adults are effected by advertisments ,11
726," young children who cannot differ between information and manipulation so should television advertising  be forbidden
in this paragraph you will read ",13
727, why commercials for children should be unallowed at the young age of three or four children are starting to develope the conciousness about themself thex figure out that if they say i they are meaning themself at this age of confusing realizations children can be manipulated very easily because they are unenlightened they obey what the growns ups say even if they are in a television that is why it could be unmoral wanting to convince children to buy a product or even be something they later would not chose to  be furthermore children cannot make own decisions ,14
728, they are controlled by their parents or adults ,7
729,  so what sense would it make to advertise towards children if they cannot determine to buy something if the intention is not brainwashing especially advertisment about special group of people like parties or organisations could be dangerous for children ,16
730, adults gets convinced by them and start to think that it is not bad to treat people with certain skin colours or religions ,7
731," other people
however there is a reason why maybe advertising toward children should not be forbidde although children cannot decide what is good and what is bad for them they have opinions by forbidden television advertising one would take a away the right of children to make up their own opinions and discover a capitalistic world if that is not enough reason one could ",13
732," claim that companies should have the right to advertise everybody should have the freedom to be what they want to be unless they harm other people yet they do not harm children by advertising their products they only show them a possibility and every children should have the right to have possibilities and chances by hiding commercials it would mean to hide a whole society and that could be even worse
to put it briefly television advertising can be dangerous for children ",13
733, they cannot decide what is good or bad for them they are unenlightened and do not question absolutes however companies should have the freedom to promote their products no matter what age the consumers are as much as children should be seen as person with own opinions moreover people should stop wanting to hide the possibilities that are offered and this does ,2
734," refer to television advertisements
in my opinion people should not have the urge to protect children from everything it sounds harsh but we have to accept that there are people in the world that will use us they will manipulate us but it does not make it any better if we try to hide it in front of children we should ",13
735, inform them television advertising directed tword young children is a little step into a world that acknowlegdes problems and give every one the choice to believe what commercials say or not ,14
736,we live in the 21th century the century where electronic stuff and internet media gets more and more important the ,23
737, generations will grow up with this media like its for them such a normal thing but is this right in the following text ,17
738," discuss the thesis if television advertising directred toward young children should be or not be allowed

if wed go 50 years back in the past we would see that kids and young adults had more complications to look up things they had to go to a library to look up informations also for young aged children it could be helpful in the past and ",13
739, in my generation we learned things very early with plays or childrenbooks the coming and existing media will open new and in a few things much easier oppurtunities to get something in mind of a young kid apps are a good example ,8
740," there are existing lots of apps to let the young children understand few things that they can bring in experience in their age and this the apps try to message in a way of playing games

but do we need that do a children in the age of 25 need media or apps to get something in his or her mind just ten years back in the past the young children went outside to meet the nature and learn things about it they played outside and had toys to understand some ",24
741, easy things also social contacts are very important vor allem ,18
742, youre a young kid the ,18
743," steps are important to know how you deal with your social area familyfriends

",19
744, with the statement that television should not be allowed toward young children sure the media brings new oppurtunities and easier ways to bring something in the mind of somebody with it but ,17
745,2years old children need media to understand the ,8
746, things of life it is more important that it can get the ,21
747, social contacts can go outside and play with other kids,1
748,"in my opinion the television advertising shouldnt be 
the thirst reason is that the children in this age are very influencable ",14
749," the advertisments just have to put a few good looking pictures in the television and all the children want these things this is very bad for there parents because they can say that the thing isnt as good as it shows but the child wont believe it
so the parents can buy the thing to the child and loose money ",0
750, that the child is happy for about one or two hours or they can say no and the child will feel bad ,8
751, it wont get it but the ,18
752, one is that the parents dont have to loose lot of money and ,9
753, that the child learns that he wont get everything he wants the child in the thirst example will ,8
754, two hours be as happy as ,18
755," time he sees an advertisment he will again want the thing in it  because he know that he will probably get it
this problem is very big for many problems if i give the thing to the child it will be quiet and content but it costs money and the child learns out of that ",20
756, it think that it just have to cry to get what it want but at the other ,19
757," if i wont give it to the child im maybe a bad momdad and the child doesnt like me
one ",9
758," for the opposite is that it would be unfair if all labels or shops could make television advertisment but not the one for children
",13
759, its a difficult question but i have the meaning that it isnt correct to sell his product just because the parents wanted to be good to there children ,9
760, the children didnt really want the product for real,2
761,in the follwing text i deal with the topic of adds for young childrenaged  and at the end ,8

all in all i wouldnt allowed advertising in tv for young children becouse of the strong ",13
768," write a discussion about the statement if television advertising s young children aged  should not be allowed

on the one ",13
769," you can say that it should be allowed because there are many products or toys that are helpful for children in this age they learn things from them like how to behave in some situations
on the other ",12
770, you can say that some of those toys and products are extremly fictional because the children learn ,20
771, much from them and sometimes want to be just like the character they are playing with they often try to do thing like them but are not able to do ,3
772," because they are humans
another example why television advertising  should be allowed is that those children can choos which products they want to use or which toys they want to play with

all in all ",14
773, that television advertising toward young children aged  should be allowed ,13
774, the products or toys are helpful for children in this age ,20
775, they can learn from them,19
776,televison advertising to children between   a controversal topic which is often discussed in the following text ,14
777," in favour and against the topic to get an answer 

first of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us

but the influcene of advertisment  younger children is probably even higher they do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use  convincing people to buy the product for example a young boy who maybe already has a lot of cars sees advertisment on a new one the advertisment tells him that this car is way better ",14
778, all others  the boy will probably believe that and will feel the need to get this car while an adult is maybe going to understand that there is no need for this new car because the boy already has a lot and the new car is not better at all another ,9
779," young kids see advertisment about new products everyday they will not be satisfied about what they have because they always see that there are new and better products 
one ",2
780, is that this unsatisfaction and the feel to need the new product is not just by young kids ,2
781, grownups can feel that way because of advertisment another ,2
782, ist that there is not just advertisment on television ,10
783, in the shops or by games on smartphones for example at a game with little monsters there maybe is advertisment for the monsters as figures to buy such advertisment is ,11
784," not directed to adults but to younger children and in our society it is not unusal to play with smartphones even at an young age

summing all up ",24
785, it is clear that advertisment is not good for younger children but we cannot do a lot against it advertisment is everywhere and ,16
786, parents do not let their kids watch tv or play on smartphones the children will get in contact with advertisment you cannot protect children from it the only thing we can do is to teach younger children that they do not need everything shown by advertisment and to think critical about the ,14
787, told by advertisment and maybe for this it is even better to start at a young age because advertisment belongs to our everyday life,11
788,"advertising  essay

nowadays a lot of young children are sitting on the sofa infront of the tv and watch cartoon serials suddenly an advertisement pops up which is s those little kids in those advertisements most of the time it is about a toy with unique features on it and the reaction that every child is probably that they want to have one of these toys so the question is  if the television advertising s young children should not be allowed or should be allowed

obviously little kids are very influential and through those advertisements they can get influenced very quickly just by watching it once so the creators of those advertisements they put many special effects  a good backgroundmusic in the scene to make the kids think this looks very cool i want one of these 

the ",0
789," is that young children should not sit infront of the tv for a long time this kind of habit can make them to become more lazy their body gets more stiff and your eyes can feel tired cause of watching tv for a long period in their young ages they should be playing outside with friends or spend some time with their parents 

the thing is those advertisements are getting used more because of the popularity it has young kids are sitting more and more infront of the tv and it reaches them a lot faster ",14
790," the technological progress we have made throughout this time

personally ",21
791, television advertising towards young kids should not be allowed because the ,13
792, young childrens can easly get influenced by television advertising because in the age of  usually they believe everything they see or hear so ,14
793, they see other children playing ,24
794, with a new barbie they want to to the same some of them will always tell it to their parents and ,20
795," they dont get it they will cry for their parents this can be very annoying 
but ",24
796, television advertising directet toward young children can ,14
797, be good because sooner or later they will get in touch with television advertisning its better ,10
798, they learn how to deal with that ,19
799, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed in my opinion they parents have to pay attention on what their children watch in the television if they dont want that their kids see the advertisment they can buy ,13
800,nowadays a lot of the global advertising is being done in the visual sector which include printed and digital media the way how children spend their free time has changed ,0
801, the invention of the television children tend to watch television more frequently than 30 years ago the advertising segment has adapted to this change and ,14
802," towards children there are a lot of adverts advertising children stuff should adverts targeted towards children be banned

first of all children aged  are usually not able to read thus they cannot inform themselves about the product of desire the only other way of receiving information is by hearing or by pictures it seems obvious that the best way of presenting a toy to a child is through the television

on the other ",16
803, children cannot judge a product as an adult or even a teenager would they do not understand a lot about the price the usage and lots of other ,2
804, which are taken into account ,21
805, buy something furthermore the children will eventually produce a desire ,9
806, a certain product or toy and will not stop asking their parents about it just because the child has seen others at his or her age playing with it in the ad sometimes ,20
807," they have something similar already

in my opinion television advertising should be banned because children are not able to make a smart decision concerning the worth of buying something and ",13
808," an unnecessary preassure on the parents 

",9
809,television advertising is something that nobody really likes but is is essential for the income and survival of every tv channel if there wouldnt be any advertising on tv we would have to pay a lot more taxes ,15
810," support the national tv channels 
a ban of advertising s young children is complete nonsense children aged  shouldnt be watching tv all day they should be doing something useful and learn something but parents nowadays just think that having children doesnt take ",13
811, much time and effort thats why the ,18
812, want to give their kids away during the day to a children daycare ,9
813, they are working from 9 to 5 they ,19
814, want to make the taxpayers pay for it just because they didnt think of all the ,3
815, that having a child includes but ,9
816, spending time with their kids they ,1
817, just put a screen in front of the childs face ,24
818," they are occupied
these are the people that dont think of effects that their behaviour and actions have they just do what sounds pretty and feels good for example letting all asylum seekers stay in the country and generally letting everybody into switzerland it may sound pretty at ",19
819, because we are such openminded people but you know what i dont care if we would all support and share this opinion our home country will go down the drain we would be foreign in our own country when you look at the birthrates of a swiss woman and a ,19
820, afrcian woman you see that soon there will be more foreigners than swiss this scenario really scares me as a proud swiss i dont want our home country to be invaded by africans i sure am openminded but the idea of the global citizen gives me nightmares being swiss is part of who i am not feeling welcome in your own country is a horror scenario it seems like this is far away but already now i can hear fuck switzerland and ,19
821, on from immigrants who should be grateful to live in this country switzerland will soon be the country of foreigners if we dont stop this ,19
822, with the statement that ads shouldnt be directed to little childern there are a few reasons the ,16
823, to most important is that the childern dont really understand what they are seeing they can be manipulated easy even easier than adults if they see an ad on televison they probably will go and stress their parents and thats sure not what those ads are for but the conflict isnt only moral conflict its ,2
824, a simple financial conflict because most companys wont make ads directed to young ones because they simply dont sell off there is a too small target group and the ad will probably cost more than it earns but there are ,16
825, a child series comes on television what kind of ads are they supposed to broadcoast i dont know if it comes out good if they will broadcast ads from parfumes or stuff like that because the small childern wont need it and the contents of some ads isnt supposed to be watched by 3yearolds but ,14
826, with the manipulation again i dont like it ,18
827, small childern are raised that early as a perfect consumer they should learn to have their own opinion and not to listen just what the television tells them like sadly a lot of young people do actually im completely against the idea of young people watching tv ,17
828, it isnt good for their later life of course ,4
829, they start to understand what they are watching ,6
830, its completely fine but i dont support the idea of sitting young people and babys in front of a tvor a smartphone just to keep them quiet there needs to be another ,12
831, we wouldnt have to question us if we should direct ads to babys and childern,16
832,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed


nowadays the television has become a much more frequently encountered household item hence its not surprising that companies and marketing experts adapted their advertising tactics and now mainly use tvspots to promote their products there are advertisements for all theage groups but the mainly targeted audition are kids but is it morally suportable to manipulate our youngest or should advertising  be banned

out of the ",14
833, a toycompany it would be a fatal blow if advertising  would be banned because quite frankly less and less people nowadays read magazines or other printed media ,15
834, by not longer being allowed to advertise their products on television they would lose their most important platform besides ,23
835, a tvspot doesnt really do any harm to anyone sure little kids are naive and easy to manipulate but ,17
836," their parents dont always give in on their demands for new toys i dont see a problem with these advertisements

on the other ",20
837, its quite easy to understand peoples concern about the whole situation the advertisements could manipulate young children ,16
838, much that they wouldnt rest until they get what they wantplus like i allready mentioned children arenaive they believe what they see on television and being tricked into buying a product that doesnt keeps what the advertisement promised can b,3
839,"television advertising  should not be allowed 

advertisment is everywhere in our daily lifes its trying to trick us into buying stuff we actually dont really need but is it right that we let advertisment influence our youngest children

in their youngest years children can be manipulated and influenced very easily if they see an toy ad ",14
840, an ad full of colors and other kids having fun with a toy they want it they cant ,20
841, assess if they need it or have the money to buy it they just want the product so they go to their parents and beg them to buy the toy for them and somewhen the parents ,20
842, so television advertising  basially forces the parents to buy useless toys its taking ,2
843," of kids to make profit

secondly avertisement often goes specifically ",9
844, gender roles girls should play with pink puppets ,19
845, boys are shown with cars and weapons this influences how the kids see themselves how they think their life has to be this is very harmful for such youn kids which ,6
846," have to develop their identity

another important ",3
847," is that this toys are often produced in poor countries under bad circumstances and horrible working conditions so with making the kids wanting those toys and the parents buying them they support this terrible circumstances

a ",20
848, in faviour of television advertisment is that it ,10
849," creates jobs and helping the economy but at what cost

to sum up ",23
850, television advertising  shoud not be allowed as it is manipulating influences their development and harms the environment,15
851,"advertising is a part of television any child who is waching television will watch advertising today in the 21th century is advertesing a part of society its not just in televison  
chlildren have ",14
852, a right to know what they could by or what is possible to buy even if they dont have pocket money they could ask their parents to buy them the things which they have seen on television young children could ,9
853," theyre watching the advertising most of the advertising are made funny and dont just informate about the product for example advertising for toys is made funny that the children want to play with it then the children will ask their parents for the toys if there arent advertisings for toys most of the children wouldnt know about them and their parents would have to search for them specific in the internet or in a toy shop with the helping advertising they know what and where to buy it
but if you look at this theme in an other context you would ",0
854," young children cant decide by their own what they need and whats good for them in this context advertising can manipulate young children realy good because they dont have that much expirience to think carefully about the advertising
",2
855, that television advertising   aged  should be allowed when i was a young child i liked to see the television advertising to know which new toys are in shops to buy sometimes i get one of these toys from my parents but ,13
856, that young children cant think about the advertising carefully whats tho goal of the advertising they can be easyly manipulated by it at the end their parents have to think about it and decide if they would buy something of the advertising for their children ,16
857,advertising is nowadays a big part of many peoples lives and today ,11
858," discuss in this essay if it should not be allowed to make television advertising toward young children
in our daytoday lifes advertising has become a big part even for the children every company should have the right to advertise their products it shouldnt matter how old or young their audience is
but children with the age of two until five are easily manipulated and many companies will take ",13
859," of that to sell their products the companies can easily make the children believe that they really need their product that leads to the children crying about that product until the parent feels forced to buy it for his child forbidding television advertisement toward children could prevent that from happening
but prohibiting advertisment is against the freedom of speech which ",14
860, isnt allowed so prohibiting the advertisement cant be the right ,15
861,"
another proble with advertisement toward children ",16
862," is that materialistic thinking is allready taught at a very young age which can influence their behaviour in the long run advertisements showing that having the newest or the best looking toy is good can lead to the children thinking the same about other human beings
in general ",2
863, that advertisement toward children shouldnt be banned but ,16
864, it should follow clear orders and rules ,21
865, the children dont get influenced mentally,7
866,every time we turn on the television we can watch a lot of interesting films ,6
867, a lot of advertisments these are influenicing us in every age ,11
868, we are young children who are aged  are in a period of life where they learn a lot of things which they need for their ,8
869, life and its not that unusual that they ask questions ,3
870," talk about the question if television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not 
young children can be influenced easily many of us remember the series we liked as a child ",13
871, the other things we saw in television so ,6
872, we saw something we liked we wanted to see more and wanted to have it so its not a surprise that the toys we saw in the advertisments were laying under the tree on christmas or were given to us on our birthdays children want to have many things they see even more ,20
873, they are looking exciting and interesting and many parents want to give them what they want to make them happy or just to stop them being annoying and exhausting the advertisments are manipulation the children by attract their interesting and showing the product as a great and exciting thing which it needs to have for this reason id forbid advertisments for children in a young age but one the other ,16
874, have to decide what they are going to buy and ,9
875," they are letting them watch television 
especially around christmas are toys advertised very much because the people need presents for their families and friends and ",2
876," a child see toys and books and computer games everywhere its not surprising that asks its parents for more than one christmas present this time is very good for the economy 
summarized i can say that young children can be influenced easily by advertisments ",2
877, they want to have more and more but ,3
878, deciding what they are going buy and if they are letting them watch television at all and in the most cases the children have to accept their decision also its good for the economy if they are buying toys and other stuff for their children for this reason i ,9
879,"the other day whilst watching television i saw an advertisement which was directly telling children that they should go to a certain water park i was quite apalled by it and thought about the reasons for this ad for a long time i came to the conclusion that television advertising aimed towards young children should be prohibited children are very suggestible and if they see an ad they are very likely to believe it the might pester their parents about beeing alowed to buy a certain toy or go to an entertainment venue
through advertising directly to the youngsters the advertisers bypass the parents and get the children to want to do something that the parents are against one might say that it helps children make their own decisions or that parents who dont want their children to  be influenced by the media shouldnt let them watch television i ",13
880, think that television atleast certain channels should be children safe they should not in any way strive to influence or scare a young child children under five may ,17
881, not understand the difference between a normal television programme and an advertisement this may lead to severe misinformation even ,10
882," an ad directed to youngsters will not be of a scary or harmful nature it will be ingrained in the mind of a child and through this influence its decisions till adulthood 
parents confronted with a whiny child or even a tantrum may forget all their education values and buy the item this sets pressure on the parents and the child as children may not learn that no means no it can ",16
883," teach them that everything materialistic that hey want they can get
because advertisements can greatly impact a child and the family dynamics i came to the conclusion that telivision advertising s young children should be forbidden",14
884," show the pros and contras to the topic television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

first of all ",15
885, say that this is a question of faith and ,21
886, of the way parents raise their children for exemple there are a lot of diffrence between the moslems and the christans in the way of what they eat or what clothes they wearment could be that its important for the kids to learn early about what life is really about but in the most of the hollywood films a situation is shown too bad or too good than it really is the only thing that matters is having a big audiance the problem is now ,7
887, kids are watching television or making a film they dont know what is realistic and what not in this case it would be good if television advertising  were not allowed but ,14
888," if it would be allowed the young children can early learn the language corretly and this is a thing they thankful their whole life

",12
889, the environnement around the child is the thing that matters the most that means that the parents can influence the child significant if the parents think it is a bad thing giving their permission to the kids to watch television it should not be allowed and ,17
890," is should

in my opinion television advertising  should be forbitten because it effects the child in this young age of only  age badly",14
891," with the following statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
young children must not the advertising ",13
892, they are watching a movie or something like this it is not good ,1
893," young children watch too much television
so without advertising the movie is not ",6
894, long and the kids can play outside for example the child watch always television and is in the house it can get ill because the body is not ,1
895, a disease is in school or childgarden in the garden they can get stronger often the advertising is full of crap from electronical stuff like a flying barbie or something lika that when they watch television and there comes an advertising they see something and the parents have to say no you cant get it but it can be useful if young children have no idea for birthday or chrismas so they can inspire their selfe with the advertising any child know this chrismas is coming but their is no idea so they can watch one hour television and ,0
896, they now many things but only children who are older than four should do this for younger children television is not good it is okay ,6
897, they see a little passage from a movie but not longer than ten minutes without advertising later they get bored from adverts and eat some chips in the break because they dont enjoy the advertising and they become too fat in my opinion too much television or advertising is bad for young children they become stupid and want all things from advertising later in school they want watching always television and all the things from the advertising and they get bad marks at school so it is important to regulate the time sitting in front of the tv and watching adverts while their is advertising the parent have to talk with their children the advertising in television should be regulate from the people who make the tvprogram the best way is ,14
898, the parents regulate the watching time and ,1
899, what they watch not too much advertising,10
900,concerning the question whether there should be television advertisement s young children ,13
901, believe that they should not be made this is ,12
902, that young children are not ,7
903, able to tell apart between an advertisement and reality this problem has already been adressed in the film and gaming industry ,11
904, by introducing age restrictions while the problem in advertisement is not mature content it can ,16
905, that which is s young children those ads are mostly colourful and show the product to be far more alive than it actually is ,16
906, giving it abilities which their real counterparts do not have while an adult knows that the things depicted in an ad are only big exaggerations of the truth a child might think of them as true this is simply because of a childs nature of ,2
907, having lots of fantasy which only adds onto the graphics shown in the ad companies ,11
908, which is the reason for creation of such ads in the ,11
909," place meaning they willingly exploit the childrens fantasy for personal profit lastly a possible threat those ads may pose might be that the ads might lead children to believe they had certain abilities which could cause them to unknowingly kill themselves

to sum up ",16
910, that adds for young children should be prohibited from being played on tv as they exploit the missing characteristics in children to make them want to have things the reason why this is ,13
911, important for tv adds is the ,10
912, that the medium of television allows creators to manipulate children into thinking a toy has way more abilities ,20
913, with the following statement that television advertising dircted toward young children should not be allowed in my oppininon television in gerneral is not good for kids betwen the age  watching television in that young age could not be good for them they can do better things in that age like playing games outside on the other ,13
914, you can say that they have to decide for themeselve but arent they too young ,24
915, i havent watched tv in that young age and i think that it is not an ,17
916, i see more advanteges by not watching television my parents took that decision ,17
917, and they knew what was good ,19
918, at that time the most things you cann see on tv at are things you can discover for your self you could collect your own experiances but you can not see that ,6
919," if you take other familiys you would find other oppinions perherps some familys would think itâ´s good they could argue with the creativly of the kids tv could make theme more creatively so they could have an bigger horizion 
all in all it could have two ",6
920," of view in my oppinion it is not good for young children to watch television advertising 
",14
921,"televiosion advertising  aged  should not be allowed


more often parents of young children hear mom can i have this new toy which was shown in the tv or wow dad look a this cool toy do you buy it ",14
922," these children who watch tv get influenced a lot by television advertising should it be allowed to manipulate them with these tricks or should it be forbidden here we go

important is that young children dont go often or probably never in the city for shopping just the parents and they decide which toy the little boy or girl will get so it is totally clear that we have to bring the toys to the childrens home by television advertising so they can decide themselfes what they want to play with so they will have a happy and exciting childhood

but more important is that the children are a lot influenced by tv or smartphones already on this age they are addicted to this toys so it is now our job to bring them real toys to home and help them to not be ",14
923," hoocked on technic

but there are a lot ",18
924," which want to disallow television advertising important is that such little children are too easy to convince they cant really decide they get manipulatet and cant decide themselfes the advertising decides for them is would be better the parents decide what is good for them and what is bad the parents anyway just want the best for them didnt they

most important is that the children shouldnt anyway watch tv at these age they should go outside and play with real friends the television advertising makes them even more addicted to the technic and at this age it isnt healthy

now it is totally clear that television advertising shouldnt be allowed never",13
925,"i would understand if someone says that there is no differance between advertation and manipulation but it is not that easy you need to check many other factors which influents opinions 
one stong arguement againt advertising towards young children is that they dont realise this manipulation if they watching theese ads theyre just like oh mama i want this they dont think about specific stategies which companys could use to make the people buy their products another opinion could be that the eventually decision is made by the parents they decide it but there may be parents do everything for their children and really mean everything but ",16
926, thats part of our economic system everbody need comercial at least someone who has an company whitout advertation its very difficult to get new customers but there is not just the company lead ads there is oral propaganda too ,11
927, its okay if children want to watch television but its ,17
928, important to think about the ,21
929, when i was in the age  ive loved to watch it but ,6
930, the main reason was that my parents didnt allowed me to watch it me and my siblings were allowed to watch from 700 pm to 750 pm it was a tradition and everyone looked forward to these fifty minutes all in all id say its okay if children are allowed to watch tv but its ,17
931, important to think about what could happen if they watch too much in my opinion its not that intelligent to let kids watch tv the whole time but why i know that children have to play outside and do things without any technology im from the generation where the media got important im lucky that i had a childhood without a phone or a computer  all these things were something my parents didnt allowed me to play with i remember the happiness ive felt ,17
932, my father gave me his phone for a minute or ,18
933, my parents said that i can watch a movie thats longer than fortyfive minutes in ,6
934, im lucky that i wasnt in the gerneration where phones and other technologies took over now ,18
935," i see all these fivegraders with a cellphone bigger than their heads im happy my parents forced me to play outside 
back to the question  ",24
936, there are positive things if parents let their kids sit in front of the tv but they have to watch over them one hour is totally fine for youngaged children in my opinion parents have to  ,17
937, nowadays  be stricter with children or young teenager you can see what phones and computer did to them the only thing they care about is what their new profile picture should look like or why they have not that much likes at their instagrampicture it all started with the television because its the ,17
938, technological thing young children can work with if parents dont watch over them they dont stop watching the tv and ,6
939," thats not far away from using a mobile everytime 
all in all in think it should be allowed for youngaged children to watch tv but parents have to take look if its not too long or what movie is on the tv thats ",17
940, many parents dont care about what their child actually watch it could be a documentation ,6
941," a movie thats not allowed for children under eighteen
so my opinion is that tv is okay me and my family always enjoyed it and i want this for other families too but there has to be a limit if parents know whats good for there children they can say how long theyre allowed to watch im sure that parents who know the ",6

947," children and adults is increasingly high
especially kids should not be raised in such a materialized society they cannot differ between the appearance of the product in the advertisement and the realistic relation between price and quality
that will lead parents to buying products they would consider too expensive or not appropriate under usual circumstances
why should a threeyearold girl want anything else than the new robotbarbie that is praised to be the one and only toy in advertisements
these advertisements are created and designed for one purpose only theyre supposed to persuade children to want the product bad enough to beg their parents to buy it
in my opinion parents should keep their children away from tvadvertisements ",14
948," they cannot differ between real quality and the quality the products are promised to have
otherwise advertising will overcome rational consumption


",23
949, in television is prone to be controversial its goal is to show the best ,10
950," of the product which is tried to be sold even if the product has many drawbacks the advertisers and marketing people try to hide them the audience has to develop an own feeling which statements can be trusted an which you should maby overthink should children be exposed to heavy marketing in a young age
it is freedom of speach and general freedom to be able to make almost every advertisment even tough in some peoples opinion there should be more control over what ads are on ",2
951, national tv to sort of lie about a certain product is not considered illicit every person exposed to advertisments today you cant escape the pr and marketing should have developed a sense of whom can be trusted in advertising and who just tries to sell you a bad product in the early stages of life my parents decided ,15
952, what was good and bad to be influenced with ,7
953, if a toy is  and ,20
954, my parents did most parents try to protect their children in this age of course they have to develop an own sense of justice and own view on things but because young kids are ,7
955, easily influenced for good and bad its not wrong to want to protect your little kid and want to give them your view on things on their way its the parents decision what their kid is exposed to and influence with but advertising ,2
956, for kids is like exploiting even the youngest generation ,24
957,in our generation where were  srounded by media there are different ways to make advertisements to  increase the selling of a product one exempel is the television from this media we constantly get informations ,10
958, from brands that are trying to reach the highest sellings not only adults are confronted with this type of aim ,2
959," children are not save from people who want every little space to fill it with their advertisements but is it okay to speak to children this sort of message
in the one ",16
960, that this is the right way because than the children learn in their smal age to consume and to spend moneyfor instants ,9
961, the marketing manager are advertising with barbie than they do it in a unhealthy that means that they put barbie in a better spot from her body till her image there are many  ways in the other ,11
962," the children learn to get used to this stuff and they learn with the help of their parents to be wide awake of manipulation

",7
963,"the topic of advertising in the tv  is difficult children shouldnâ´t watch tv often in that age thatâ´s clearly for the concerns itâ´s very lucrative to do advertising to young people because they watch it they want it and they go to their parents to talk with them if the children are allowed to get it but itâ´s the wrong way to use young children to make profit maybe it isnâ´t wrong to start in a young age with that things so the children may know what will happend in an older age everyone is controlled by the media at all in the digitalized like tv or radio and in the undigitalized way like newspaper
finally ",14
964, that shouldnâ´t be allowed because the children have to play outside with friends or get wet from the rain without any problem they should not controle by the media ,12
965,watching tv can be truely upsetting everyone can relate to the moment during a movie or a season of your favourite show ,6
966," there is a interesting moment and out of no where the advertisement starts we have gotten used to it but what if the advertisement ist directet  should such advertisement be banned 

advertisers are very free in their doings and controlling every step they are doing would not be benefitial because too much regulation and control is never good the parents can always say whether or not the child shoud be watching tv and if a child sees a toy he wants the parents are free to decide whether to get them the toy today almost everyone has the possibility to just fast forward ",15
967," theres advertisement or you can just change channels and not watch it it is always up to the person to decide and a  year old will not be watching tv alone anyways

on the other ",17
968, children aged  should not be exposed to suggestiv advertisement if even adults can be highly influenced by different advertisments what about brains that are not fully developed ,16
969, and with a high possibility do not even understand the construct behind advertisement it can ,11
970," lead to a even larger consumption community with children as young as three years old always wanting the newest toys they see in advertisements

in my opinion it is the parents task to decide whether they want to expose their children to direct advertisement because advertisers are only going to play ads ",2
971, there are people watching it and ,6
972, there is a demand for it ,23
973,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

television advertisments s young children serve but one cause causing the child to be excited enough for it to bother its parents to buy whatever the product may be the child ",13
974, is not able to tell wether the product is something it really wants or needs it solely decides based on the emotions conveyed through the advertisment it is very simple to manipulate a young child into being excited about something the use of a few simple elements ,2
975," catchy songs or cute mascots can be enough to convince a child of a product without them even caring about the product itself therein lies great vulnerability for the parents who are often cornered to buy something by their children without being able to tell wether the child was manipulated into liking said product by an advertisment or wether they actually like it for its concept

children being manipulated into  wanting certain products is obviously not optimal the question that needs to be asked ",2
976," is wether the responsibilty towards the protection from such manipulation lies within the government which would have to create regulations about the advertisments or wether it lies within the parents

it would be a possibilty for the government to create regulations which would stop marketing agencies from creating advertisments that are directly targeted towards young children such regulations would be very complex ",16
977, the distinction between what is and what is not s a child of the age of 5 or 7 is most likely not accurately possible therefore most advertisments concerning anything that has to do with kids would most likely be influenced ,16
978," that there would be no risk of violating the regulations 

placing responibilty in the parents ",12
979, would probably be much easier and ,19
980, more reasonable a parent should not let a child as young as 25 years old watch television on their own anyways ,17
981, it should not be a problem to change channels whilst advertisments are on or to stop the development of excitment in its tracks should the child ,14
982, get to see such an advertisment,11
983,more and more little children are used to watch television hour for hour ,17
984," used to advertises but should these ones affect them directly

it has to be said that some advertises could have a really bad influence on the thinking of a little child we have to consider that a child at the age of  years is not able to make a difference between reality and the world of the television it believes that which an adult or whatever tells him and if in the advertise someone says that coke is very healthy the child thinks that this is true such influences on opinions of little children can have really bad ",14
985," which could actually become a global problem

but ",19
986, bear in mind that advertises could ,11
987, have a positive effect if a advertise is made well it teaches the child somethingor it helps him to build a one opinion which would be great for the following years and its whole life mostly children are not interested in advertises ,0
988, and they prefer to watch cartoons and ,1
989," one in that case they would switch the channel so why should it not be allowed

my own opinion is that it should be allowed because if parents think that advertise threatens their child they should not let it watch television ",14
990, at the age of 2 to 5 children are too young to watch television by their own anyway and if adults are there they could change the channel if there is a bad advertise or a terrible scene and if it is allowed each person can decide by his own if he wants to let his child watch advertise or not,14
991,"the television is on a random movie plays and in an intermission there are some advertisements probably one about a new and shiny toy for children of very young age but couldnt that be a problem to show advertisments to such a young audience to be more precise to an audience aged 

because these children are very unexpierenced in life they can be easily manipulated thats why probably want the advertised toy ",14
992," they have seen the advertisement but simoutaniosly thats a positive too if young children woud never be confronted with such temptations they probably wouldnt learn to resist them

another opinion is that it woul restrict our economie that is based on consumption in addition its up to the parents of those children to from that advertisement its ",2
993," said that the range of the age  was complete rubbish because two years old children would not even realy realise what a commercial is

",16
994, that it shoul not be resitricted because it helps the children to develop a healthy commons sense to distinguish between things they need and things that are unnecessairy secondly if a child would show any issues concerning advertisements ,13
995, that it is the parents responsibility to look ,12
996," their child and maybe dont even allow it to watch television
",1
997,"television advertising is a big industry in our generation people see products in these advertising and they buy it because they see the product in the television but is it a problem or a risk for young children which advertsing could influence children in a bad way
today every child watchs tv and as a ",14
998, the advertising there are many advertisings of really thin and beautiful puppets ,11
999, barbie and other dolls they are very attracted by this puppets and they want to have one of them because of this unrealistic ideal of the women it could be that the child want ,20
1000," to look like this and that causes depression or other selfconfidence problems which are very unnessersary in this age 
another ",19
1001, is the costs the parents have if they have to pay there children what they want because they want to have there child happy and the child stresses them ,9
1002, much that they think it would be better for themselves if they buy the toy to have a silence toys arent cheap the price is rising and i could imagine that not every familiy has enough money to pay for a expensive toy also there is the trend changes very fast it isnt a very economical way because every day there is a new toy on the market and the old one isnt good enough ,20
1003," the parents have to through away the old toys because of place problems  
on the other ",20
1004, why should we ban the advertising towards young children its not proven that advertising influences the life of a child children watch tv because of the series they want to watch and they go on the toilette ,13
1005, the advertising comes in addition the advertising isnt ,11
1006, the children could remember what they saw and ,8
1007, there a many other ways to influence children to buy something other children in kindergarten who all have the same toy or nower days every child has instagram or other social medias who have advertising which fits on your age or the things you like ,20
1008," if we ban television advetising we shouldnt allowed any kind of advertising for children 
in my opinion its a realistic problem the number of advertising per each televisionshow is rising and the advertising show ",13
1009, for our daily problems when i was young i ,21
1010, wanted to have every thing i saw in television but i didnt get anything my parents resisted nower days you have to have the trendy things to be cool but ,20
1011, you cant solve the problem if you bann television advertising toward young children you should do praventition very early so ,14
1012,the statement that televisions should not be allowed  between two and five years is sometimes correct children in these years are in an important part of  their life for example to learn the ,17
1013, things for school some kind of them have to find new friends ,18
1014," they begin the time in the kindergarden now its important to concentrate to get a correct circle of people 
in this chapter of their life they normally have to play outside with friends and dont have to sit in their room and watch tv its bad that they maybe see things they souldnt have to see maybe some scenes of terror or something like thatthey dont understand it and they get fear itâ´s important ",8

1016, is that some kind of them show news for children ,6
1017," they can understand it or show some series with animals
",6
1018," itâ´s important to draw a line between playing outside doing homeworks and watching tv i share the opinion that children in this chapter of their life have to play outside after the kindergarden or school if they finished their homeworks or other things which they have to do its okay to watch tv in a cutted time
in my opinion its sad how much children in this chapter become bad in school or cant speek very well because they only watch tv all in one ",17
1019, its okay that children watch tv in a small part of time if they dont forget to do important things for school and playing outside with their friends,17
1020,many children spend a lot of time in front of the television television inclueds advertisments and children can be strongly influenced by them ,14
1021," in a very young age thats why commercials which are s children should be forbidden

advertisments are all about selling things childrens advertisments are often about toyswhen a child sees toys shown on television it probably wants to get them all because the chidlren in the commercials always seem to be happy and having fun now the parents ",0
1022," buy them those toys and spoil them or they dont and the children end up being sad

the picture which a child has of the world can be influenced by those commercials too for example ",0
1023, there are only people with the same nationality shown it keeps them from being openminded or ,19
1024, the girl in the commercial always has long blond hair children may think thats what girls are supposed to look like,0

on the positive ",15
1026, that companies make a lot money from the parents which got affected by their children to buy them their toys candy and ,2
1027, make a lot money with advertising too which is ,11
1028," a good thing in the end advertising directed to children is a big and important part of the economy 
on the negative ",0
1029, stands that young children between the age of two and five are easily affected by what they see in tv so they want almost everything they see and they get it because theyâ´ll bag for it until they get what they want in the ,17
1030, time that does not sound really bad in any way but if you really think about it it is because the ,19
1031, years of a humans life are probably ,18
1032, ones we learn the most in this years and if we get anything we want if our parents always buy our favourite candy at the groucery we learn that it is normal to get anything we want and that it is normal to always get and eat our favourite candy out of this ,8
1033, are resulting a lot of problems like people which think they always get what they want and people which instinctively think it is okay to eat a lot of bad food and ,4

all in all i donâ´t really ",18

1038," for the children their parents and those buisneses
in my opinion young children should generally just spend a small amount of time watching television they got easily distracted by it and they ",17
1039, got influenced by the advertising in television little children cant understand that the toys or sweets that are shown are rarely the way as we see them in tv  they start asking their parents if they may have all this too expensive things often the parents wont allow them buying those things but ,2
1040," children get confronted with this cool stuff their friends in kindergarten may have they get sad and wont be part of the group
buisneses are spending a lot of money on advertisings ",2
1041," and they know exactly in which way they can reach everybody from small children to old people for their younger audience they use bright and shiny colours and cool effects they often know in which way they may influence the parents of the children too they make them believe that those things are good for their children

1043, influence everyone of us and how they affect our daily life,21
1044, for and against the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed a point for con ,15
1045, is that parents could find out what there children like and dislike playing with they could look at the reaction of ther children an angurment that it should not be allowed is that the children like the television advertising ,12
1046, much that they dont want to leave the television and look way to much of it my ,10
1047, point against that statement is that children could enjoy the advertising between ther series they dont have to upset ,13
1048, ther serie is ending because ther is an advertising adressing them and not just ther parents another point for the stament is that children could like every spot ,6
1049, much that they want everything what they see and ,3
1050, the parents have to tell the children why it isnt possible to buy them all what they want to have the most important ,9
1051, against the statement is that the children could enjoy what they are seeing they could even have fun during the advertising the most important ,13
1052, for this statement is that the children should not sit in front of the television all the time they should go and play outside on a playground whit ther parents or ther friends so if they like the advertising to much they could forget playing outside and ,13
1053, the children are young you could bring them much more easier on your ,9
1054," that they do whatever you want 
i totally ",19
1055, to this statement because it could bring the young children to much to the television and could them let forget to play outside its much more important that young children learn something in books or outside ,17
1056, watching television advertising just made for them and in the young age its easier to get in that children mind and to let them think what they should think about ther product ,0
1057, that they want to buy it or the parents should buy it and ,9
1058, they dont buy it the young children are sad and  years is way to early to watch much televisison and television advertising ,2
1059,today children are already confronted with the permanet influence of social media and technology at a very young age which seems to be a chance for companies to sell their products by using advertising in a clever way thats why ,0
1060," discuss the following statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

on the one ",15
1061, against such a law for exemple one can say that permanent advertising is a part of our time today ,15
1062, that children have to learn how to handle it also adults and teenagers are always confronted with advertisemen  ,11
1063," last week i saw a new car in the tv but i wasnt able to buy it because of a lack of money
furthermore getting to know many toys they would like to have by television advertisings could help little children to accept that they wont get everything they wish in their life and that they have to be happy with what they get
but ",0
1064, for television advertising toward young children not to be allowed a law against it could be understood as resistance against the moneyruled society we have got today critics say that children have to be protected from this bad world to enjoy their childhood and develope in the best way they will become an adult fastly enough for example its seems to me as if my childhood has just ended and now im already confonted with the force of earning money ,13
1065," leaving school  to become independent and live the life i want
in addition parents might be happy about tv programm without advertising  because they wouldnt suffer from an annoying child who really wants to have the toy car it has just seen in tv and cries now the whole time because his parents wont buy the mentioned car

especially because of the two last ",10
1066, im agains television advertisement for children,0
1067, years of your childhood you creat your future parents who are working a lot and dont have much time to look ,9
1068, the childern are using the television to entertain their children by watching television you can learn a lot and its good for your mind to educate more things you have to plan it ,17
1069," they will have something to look forward to 

in the age  your child needs love attention and time with his parents this three things are more important than anything so spend time with your children outdoor to have fun and make some experience they will remember this and it will make them happy sure you dont have to look to good ",24
1070, need some time to figure out things by themselves and have fun with friends but they need you as a parent and in this age they learn to walk to eat to talk and in every way theyre making their ,24
1071, steps its important you are there with your kids ,1
1072, that it should be allowed but you need to plan it so that the kids have regular sleep times if this is possible and eat a lot its important that you spend as much time as you can with your children because the time will be gone and soon the will be 17 and have their ,12
1073, boyfriend have sex their heart get broken and all that stuff time runs fast ,19
1074, you have to live in the moment and enjoy it as much as you can some day they will leave your house and sure they will always be your children but they will be gone not forever ,9
1075, but youre no longer directly responsible for them they bild their own lives and you have to be proud of them teach them as much as you can they will remember the important things you said to them and maybe they will take some things with them and do it just like you  make the time that you have with them memorable and give the best you can give ,8
1076,if you turn on your television you usually see at least one channel on which there is advertisment running there are ,10
1077, many different typs of advertisment ,11
1078, that can be sort them by the things they present or by the possible future client who should buy the promoted thing nowadays even young childeren aged  used to look thier films or soaps on television the television channels exactly knews who is watching to them ,10
1079," that they can show adverts for the watcher in this case for young children but isnt it manipulation should adverts towards young children should be prohibited
firstly even enterprisies who produced stuff for children should have the right to show their products on tv they ",13
1080," need a good reputation for selling thier things and how could you present your things better than in an advertisment 
on the other ",23
1081," we must say that children dont have a feeling for things they really need so if they see something on tv they really want to have  they are unstoppable
an other thing is that children often look television with thier parents so the parents could see what they could buy for the sons or girls ",17
1082," birthday or christmas
however at the end there are almost everytime the parents who decide what they would or should buy the biggest problem would be the child whos crying until he or she has seen something better maybe in the ",9
1083," advert
finally it may be a problem ",11
1084, for the parents in my opinion advertising s young children shouldnt be prohibited the children could learn that they cant always buy the things you want and at the end there are always clear thinking parents,13
1085,"pro
in the 21th century a big amount of people have a television at home it is more and more likely that young children watch television and that they are used to electronics there are a lot of films and series for children and babies so why not television advertising s them
its more fun and interesting for the children to watch advertisings about games and plays than about mobile phones or restaurants
with advertisings its ",14
1086, easier for their children to make their birthday wishes or christmas wishes ,9
1087," they see new stuff on television

contra
television advertising  should not be allowed the children are too young to watch televsion they should go outside and play with their friends or someting like that the society should not treat them like adults they should have a different life they are too young to be influenced by the media

my opinion
",17
1088, that it should be allowed to do television advertising  but i ,15
1089, think that it isnt necessary these children are too young to realize and remember what they see on television children dont make their opinions about the media they enjoy watching films but afterwards they are not interested in the advertising if they want something new to play with they see it in a store or at a friends house so on my opinion it is not very useful to make advertising s young children,14
1090,"in television there is a lot of advertising from food to computers and everybody sees the ad each ad has its direction toward a specific group but shold it be illigal to make ad  young childern aged 
first of all i have to ",16
1091, out that these young children do not even have the money to buy the advertised product so the danger of young children buying products only because the have seen it on television does not exist the only thing they can do is asking their parents for buying the wanted product and throwing a tantrum if they did not get it so that is the worst thing i can imagine that could happen if a toddler sees an ad so in that case ,2
1092," say that advertising  who are aged  shold be allowed
but ",15
1093, children could be tempted to steal money from there parents ,9
1094, buy the productwhich was mad ad for on the television so in other words children could be criminalized through ad but this has ,16
1095, to do with the ad it has something to do with education too ,11
1096,young children should live their lifes and should not have to build their own opinion about something ,12
1097, they dont even care they are ,19
1098, focused on their playing that they dont even see those advertisings if a bank hangs up their poster to get people attached that they open up an account at their bank and they specialise the advert for children if the grew up they do it at this bank it is too much children at this age dont care for this there is no reason that they get confronted already with such econmic things wich they ,16
1099," dont understand

but if its for a good reason ",19
1100," wwf why should they not get informations about their environment its good to know in this case now that there are animals whose species are in danger most of the children love animals thats why it is easy to attract attention only with a poster the children grow up and have memorys at these posters and go spend their money for organisations like that 

in my opinion it depends on the field for what the advertising wants to get a look on it if its something with that children have nothing to do about the advertisings shouldnt direct towards people who doesnt even have to know about such things ",16
1101, if it is easy to understand and it is for a good reason,21
1102, it is okay to influence the children a bit that they know about it later,7
1103,there are a few different reasons why television advertising  should not be allowed first of all young children aged  arent able to recognize if its true or not what they are told and what they see on televisionon television advertising there are used many tricks that make the people believe they will be happier and their life will be much better with the product that is shown the children believe every word and can get a wrong image   of what is realy important in life because they do not have any experiences like that ,14
1104, learn something within watching television advertising even on such a young age they can ,14
1105, make their own experiences with consumit could be a way for them to experience that advertising is not always the truthin my opinion it would be good if children learn the difference between what they are told as a zielperson and what things are realy likeon a young age it would be important to take care that the children are not confronted with advertising too often otherwise it could have a negative influence on they,0
1106,when it comes  parents tend to protect them from outer influences ,7
1107, you could say parents are overprotective children must learn about the actual reality and have to deal with the triggers people send with advertisements parents themselves often cannot recognize the triggers in advertisements and watch them daily without fearing an influence by media so you can question why there would be a potential bad influence for their children on the other ,2
1108, the young childrens brain must ,8
1109, they can be confronted with advertisements which influence childrens thoughts television advertisements manipulate the brain by sending out triggers often not recognized by the mentality children cannot tell if people tell the truth or a lie at such a young age to not leave children with this manipulation is not overprotective it is good parenting which protects young children from problematic influences until they can do it themselves ,14
1110, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed but only until they do can tell truths from lies or triggers they cannot be cut of reality because of potential influences for their whole life,13
1111,there are several reasons why television advertising toward young children should or should not be allowed ,13
1112, that children in the age of  are too young to understand that they are manipulated by the commercials they will believe everything they are told and by that are easy to manipulate ,2
1113, that they want to buy all the products the commercial is showing children ,0
1114, cant judge if something isnt worth the money it costs ,23
1115, they would want to have the item no matter what and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they cant afford a new toy for them thats why televison advertisement thats  causes trouble on the other ,20
1116, its good for the economy if many things are sold but ,23
1117, that children dont understand the advertisement and just want to have the newest best toy and in the advertisement every toy is shown like its the best of them all thats why its unfair to show children these commercials the advertisement could ,2
1118, show the children the variety of items and make them understand that they dont need everything thats shown in the commercials but ,0
1119, that they are just too young to judge,3
1120,in the social media television is really present so there are people which think that television has a bad affect to young people athor people say that theres no danger to people if they consume a lot of tv so ,17
1121," explaine should tv advertising toward young children not be allowed 

",13
1122, begin with a really important theme in case of television the biggest probelm is that experiences over years showed that the consum of television can be affected to young people the reason is that they are too young understanding making a difference between the reality and the ficitonal history as i mentioned ,17
1123, there is a risk that young people can be addicted to television now we are talking about the television advertising the series films itselves are a potential risk for young people if we now ,17
1124," watch a lot of films in the television there is a potential risk that the children are getting addicted by the television 

despite of the ",17
1125, that many scientifique researchs showed that its possible to be addicted to television advertising ,10
1126, there is no risk at all i ,4
1127, i was a kid but my parents told me if i can watch or not so if there are parents which are looking for his children i dont see a problem i ,12
1128," think its a bit too much if the state wont allowing the television anymore 

an other ",17
1129," against the question is that you have to make a difference between a seriefilm and a documentary television isnt bad at all it depends on what you watch on tv i can remember that i watched many documentaries about the nature the sun system the danger of plastic in the sea etc so i learned more on television than in the kindergarden

so ",17
1130, which i thijnk is important to take care of them that contains the addiciton to television loosing contact with your friends and others but ,17
1131, you shouldnt disallowe the consume of television because its ,15
1132, a big part in the world today ,21
1133,"
advertises are often shown in the tv they adress all ages even really young children and that might be a problem as many criticers say 
young children are easily influencable by television advertising so they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour 
on the other ",14
1134," we could say that it is part of the parentâ´s job to decide if and what their children watch in the tv to give them the right values 
another ",17
1135, might be that children aged  are not interested in advertises and ,16
1136, they are they have no opportunity to get what they want without their parents so the parents can control their children ,9
1137," 
and every child has to learn that not everything what is said in the tv is good and that they can not get anything what they want this is a really important process in the life of a child and the understanding is easier ",6
1138," it starts as early as possible 
so ",18
1139," that television advertising toward young children should not be forbidden but the parents might know that they have to control the tv activity of their children








































































































































































































































































































































































",13
1140,television is in our time an important source for news for adults or teenagers but ,17
1141, young children use it for education there are many movies or series with an educating backround but the question is if it is ,6
1142," good that television advertising  aged  years and if it should not be allowed in the following part i will explain and answer these questions
firstly children get influence by television and specially young children who arent educated or who start to learn are a part of these children aged  years start to speak and to create their own personality 
so that there are ",14
1143, bad influences what have follows for the future life of these children for example if young children watch teletubbies who arent speaking with words the hole episodes they maybe ,7
1144," wouldnt speak this discussion about the teletubbies are public in the world and politiciens think about stopping the production and to stop selling the dvds
but an important thing is ",6
1145, that there are lots of educating movies and series which help the children to live or preparing their life they can learn about the right and the wrong what is easier to understand ,8
1146," you watch it how to handle with another children or how to prepare for school so that television is an important source for young children for preparing their future life 
so im ",17
1147, with the statement that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed television is a too important factor of the life of a young children these are a too important education source for them there are more positiv follows for young children who watch tv than negative ones,14
1148,in the last five years more children in the age of  started watching televion for more than three hours a day the reason ,17
1149," is that the television advertise directly toward young children
on one site children can learn from some of these chanels for young people many chanels started producing movies and series for young children where they show how to learn ",6
1150, languages like english or french as a ,18
1151, of this children already learn even in a young age how to speak an other language ,8
1152, they will may be better ,19
1153," they will come to school and started learning this language there
on the other site if children started watching television in their freetime for more than one to two hours a day they have no time to do other things like going outsite and playing with friends but in the age of  it is very important to have social contact to other people in their age
so ",24
1154, television advertising  in the age of  should not be allowed because in this age children started making their ,13
1155, social contacts which is very impotant for their growing up but if the children are just sitting in front of their television they have no time to make these contacts ,17
1156," it could be that they later may have problems making friends with other people

",24
1157,all of the younger generations are often seen as the generation of the internet and social media but many children nowadays ,24
1158, playing with their friends in ,1
1159," more and more parents plant their kids in front of the television to have some rest or because the child is more calm
this effect is often used by huge companies directing their advertisements towards younger children ",17
1160, raise their sales figures this can be seen as exploiting the childrens innocence ,2
1161, they tend to wish for things they saw and that excited them the companies actually manipulate the children because ,2
1162, the younger ones aged  cant decide whether it is something they really need or if it was simply shown in an advertisement so should as a ,2
1163," this advertising be forbidden
personally i dont consider this ",11
1164, children are nothing but the medium to their parents money enterprises have chosen this method of advertising because they are on current with nowadays methods of raising a child and that televisions are often a part of it if the parents now think of this advertising as ethically wrong one ,14
1165," has to think about who is letting  year olds sit in front of the tv so it is actually the parents duty to raise their kinds sensible to what they are seeing or hearing for sure children are manipulated by exciting advertisements and are used to make their parents buy these products but if parents are upset with that they shouldnt allow their child to be manipulated instead of blaming companies of their poor skills raising their child they should put more attention to what they are transmitting their child and enlighten them about possible manipulating advertising even at that young age
letting a two year old sit in front of the television is not the right way to silent them and there are a lot of other methods to use ",14
1166, excite ones child so play with your kids ,8
1167, telling media to stop such advertising you dont need to worry about something that has no impact on you or your children,13
1168," with the following statement that television advertising  in the age between  should not be allowed

in this case you have to know that television advertising can be negative for the growing up of little children because in many television advertising there are bad stuff its right that little children in the age between  dont understand much about a lot of things but ",13
1169," that the television advertising would influence them indirect in their growing up
on the other ",0
1170, its alright if there is television advertising ,11
1171," for their age group but if theres television advertising for teenageradults its not okay anymore 
television or any other media stuff is a big factor and influence in our world for all people you have to think how little children feel aswell but not many persons do that they only think they are small they dont think they understand nothing in their age and for them it doesnt matter how they feel but you have to see it in a different view little children maybe know whats going on in this situation and television advertising is sometimes not always a part of their growing up  maybe they dont understand a lot but they know or better to say they feel all of that whats happened 
in my opinion the worse thing and you cant do it aswell is that nobody asks them how they feel or if they want that all people think of themselves and this is in character very egoisticselfish
in conclusion you see sometimes it is important that television advertising  little children in some cases if its not television advertising for adultsteenagers but summarized it should not be allowed
  
     
  
",14
1172,growing up in the times that we live in its not unusual to watch television by a very young age thats ,17
1173, the logical reason why producers initially created some series only aiming at very young viewership but unluckily theres more to watching tv than just having fun or even learning from of the series small children watch they are already and i mean at a very young age forced to see advertisement whilst the small breaks that the tv producers need to get back the money that they initially burnt making the series in this essay ,6
1174, argue wheter or not advertisements should be sent on channels which directly ,15
1175," at a very specific viewership of very young people

the ",6
1176, already mentioned in the introduction above is that the producers of certain or ,23
1177, all tv shows for children have to get back their money ,6
1178, the movies films series etc that they show to the children werent made for free ,6
1179," it is necessary for them to even produce content for the children however it would make no sense for them to show them advertisements which are produced for adults because it would not make any economic sense to let children watch advertisements the producer of the advertisement cant profit of  the children arent interested buying in

the ",16
1180, to this whole question despite of producers having to make money the series for children should be made for education learning or even entertainment purposes at the age of  years many children are very unconscious of what they are watching it should  not be allowed for tv channels to show advertisement which is directed to such young children because they dont usually have the awareness of what advertisement does to them ,14
1181," by showing advertisements they influence small children which mostly dont have their own opinion and because of that are very influencable taking influence on them that they are unaware of should not be aloud because its taking a huge impact on a childs thinking without the child even realising it 

having watched tv for a few years now i can come to the conclusion that there should not be advertisements  for me its ",14
1182, and the psycological influences that let me come to the conclusion that they should not be allowed its just not right to influence a child of this age not being able to make their own opinion ,12
1183, and unaware of what the advertisement tries to do to the child so ,16
1184,"they controll our childreen
nowerdays childreen spend lots of their time watching television as many smaller childreen aged  believe in evrerthing they hear or see because they are not able to bild their own opinion ",7
1185," they are a popular victim of advertising companies
  there are ads for toys kids food and the newest sport articles the ads are often  straight s young childreen with the use of childish language and by creating a happy and concsious atmospere with backround music and certain matching colors in the spot 
it leads to different behavior of your childreen as they want more and more because they get to see the newest and hottest toys erveryday ",2
1186," soner or later nothing will be good enough for them anymore
on the other ",19
1187, your kids are always well informed about the newest trends therefore it is possibly the best way to find a way between getting your childreen some of the goods but not always and ,2
1188," ever they want 
but advertisement ",11
1189, creates a wrong image of reality articles shown in ads ,11
1190," their real quality and outer aperience often contains a big differnece in the ads everything looks perfect ervery girl or boy is smiling and ervery product is shining as the products are are made looking perfect for the ads with the help of modern computer technology like photoshop
thats why ",11
1191, there should be certain rules for the advertising companies which they have to follow ,15
1192, to downgradse the use of photoshop to influence the childreen because they bring parents into difficult situations where it is hard for them not to upset their childreen ,12
1193, they see the actuall product ,3
1194, the image which was presented in the ads ,11
1195,"this text is about my meaning about the statement television advertising  yound chidren aged  should not be allowed
",15
1196, that young children cant even know and dont understand what the meaning of the advertising iswith the new technologys the most televisions can skip the advertising because nobody cares it ,10
1197," it isnt that dangerous for children aged  because they cant deside something for example there is an advertisnig of an barbie in the television and my ittle sister want to have it my parents can deside if my sister get this barbie or not also they can play outside and dont have tobe the whole time inside and watch television
at the other ",17
1198," little children can cry about something they like and maybe the parents have to do what the childrens want because it isnt that funny to have a child who always cry 
for me it doesnt matter if there is a television advertising  or not when i dont want to watch it i can just skip it but maybe ",14
1199," i get older and have children by myself it can be bad to always have unhappy children because they see something better in the television that at home
",1
1200," it is a stupid desition to make that not allowed in the world we have bigger problems instat the television advertising  youing children 
",13
1201,children should not get in touch with televisions too soon a television is nothing good at all it is a waste of time that does not mean that i do not watch tv in my spare time but you do not have to start in your early ages if you do ,17
1202, you will most likely get used to it but there are a lot of other things you could do in your young ages which you will not do if your grown up parents should help their children to have a happy childhood that means ,24
1203, motivate your child to go out and play with friends ,24
1204," that this is importent for the development of the personality a child has a lot of power avaiable and it should make use of it if you are sitting in fornt of the television you do not move this could lead to overweight as we all know there is a big chance that people with overweight get diabetes this is very tragic because those people have this illness for the rest of their lifes in america there are a lot of people diagnosed with diabetes type 1 this type of diabetes you get from eating food with big amounts of sugar and fat in it if you do have bad eating habbtis and you do not move enough because you are sitting in front of the tv you will become overweight or you even might get diabetes 

",17
1205,"my opinion to that statement is divided
on the one ",21
1206, that the television advertising which is  could lead to a higher television consume at a younger age because the young children are willing to watch the advertising which is meant ,14
1207," for them in this case they would spend more time inside the house and not in the nature playing with their friends the parents have to keep an eye on their children to protect them against too much television advertising and television consume
on the other ",17
1208, that it is not that necessary to not allow television advertising  because it is in the ,15
1209, of the parents or everyone else ,9
1210, how to handle this situation in our modern times and the technical improvements it is clear that companies search for ways to improve their advertising aswell that is why they use the televison to spread their advertising for their products all over the country on the easy way with putting it into the televison in my opinion the companies hope to reach with that kind of advertising with cute little children in it the parents and make them buy that product for their child too or to buy it just because that advertising make them feel in some way ,10
1211, parents identify easily with televison advertising which is set up like this because they think about their own child directly but ,14
1212, everybody have to think about that statement on his own to have an own opinion about it i can not make a ,21
1213, in that case because i can understand the companies acting in that way but i can ,23
1214," think of the fears people might have about television advertising  
all in all it is a exercise for all of us to find a good way to handle this situation because the technology will improve and improve and there will be more and more companies using this way of advertising",15
1215," that it would be difficult to stop televison advertising which is  in the ages 
televison advertising could be helpful especialy for parents if they donâ´t have an idea concerning to give a present to their child 
but ",10
1216, watching telivison advertising in these ages can lead to the missing ability to appreciate things which are advertised in the tv ,10
1217, toys or electronic devises to play with if they always want more toys the parents maybe will follow their wishes to make their children happy and make these wishes come true which can lead to the missing abilities mentioned ,24
1218," wouldnâ´t know the value of these things
my opinion to this topic is that televsion  advertising directed  should be stopped furthermore the parents have to have an eye on their children if they watch tv watching tv in these ages can ",14
1219, be discussed whether itâ´s good for them,4
1220,in todays society mostly every familiy watches regular television its not unusual that young children are ,17
1221," there watching so why shouldnt be these companies be allowed to send advertisment directed directly to these young children
first ",16
1222, say that the parents have to watch their children this means that they have to figure out if the program and ads are harming their children if ,13
1223," they must switch the channel or better let those kids play outside 
but if the parents cant stay with their kids checking what kind of programmms come then we should take into account that those small kids cant ",1
1224," figure out if thos adverts are misleading so those kids are unprotected strayed to those companies this means that those companies can influence the evolution of their personality for sure we dont have to think now about a society like in brave new world but it can be dangerous
i am a supporter of the free market ",16
1225, i think the best is if we let the companys do whatever they want because the custommer ,23
1226, can chose if he will buy the product and consume it,9
1227,nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches tv in the television is ,10
1228," and even small children watch television so it may occure the question whether tv advertising  aged  shoud or should not be allowed 

first you should allow this kind of avertising because it helps the parents to buy things which fit with the specific wishes of their children so the little child can watch tv and ",14
1229, the adverts it says that it likes to have this and that therefor the child doesnt have to speak well its enough to say i want that and it ,20
1230," on the advert then the parents can simply buy the object 
next this kind of advertising helps the companies to improve their sales and adress the specific group of people which the products are made for so they would do babytoyadvertisments only for young children aged 

on the other ",0
1231, this adverts shouldnt be allowe because these young children cant do anything with this adverts the children get irritated and dont know how to react as an adolscent you know how to deal with adverts and that their content isnt always the truth but children ,16
1232," young children dont know 
more important theses adverts influence the childrens mind and their psychological development thats not good children may believe whats said in the advert plus the strategy of advertisment is to create needs and children cant deal with that 

all in all adverts for children aged  shouldnt be allowed because of their negative effects on the children they create wrong needs and slow down the psychological development they only help companies to improve their profits and this is not good we shou",16
1233," inform you about television advertising
i am ",10
1234," with this statement because the televison advertising have many negatives effects
the ",10
1235," one is that the children often want the object in the televion they think that is cool and they often try to convince their parents if they dont get the object they start to cry or they are sad about the desission of their parents the parents dont like to see their children cry and they bought the object for them
forthermore the childrens often dont need the object the seller push their object in the advertising because he know what he have to say he only tells the posi and the children see that and in result they get it from their parents
in addition the parents should explain theire children how they have to handel with advertising the children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money if they dont learn this they could have problems in their life 
all in all the advertising isnt good for the young people it stress the parents and it could destroy the entership between the family and friends 
",0
1236,in my oppinon its not a problem the make advertisment on tv for young children i mean they ,13
1237, see new other toys they would like to have ,20
1238, they are playing with an other child that has the same influene in my view the parents have a big influence on their child and they can controle what their children are watching so its in the hands of the parents what they think is the best for their child and yes it can ,24
1239, their child wants to have something that it saw in an advert but you as a parent can use it wisely and can show their child that it cant always get what it wants and that it has to wait for something ,2
1240, for the economy its really important that they can advertise on tv because thats the most efficant way to advertise in these days not many people specially childrend are looking in a magasin to choose their new toys in tv you can ,0
1241, choose exactly who should watch your advert and who doesnt ,11
1242," the advertisement is very efficient 
on the other ",11
1243, children cant filter the information they get so if in the advert a plane is flying the child thinks that the plane is actually able to fly and thats not fair if they ,16
1244," get the plane and realise that the plane cant fly they will be very disappointed 
",18
1245, that we cant say that advertisment in tv is not allowed towards young people we should make strict rules on how the advertisment for young people should be made an imortant rule ,13
1246, would be that there should be no lies allowed or graphical tricks the rest should be in the hands of the parents there are tv channels just for children without any advert in it if parents ,13
1247, with it they can just make their child watch one of those channels ,6
1248,"television advertising  should not be allowed thats the way many people think about the influnce of media like televison on young childreni dont think it should be not allowed but i am not the opinion that its positive for them

 every parent should decide if he lets his child watching things  which can be dangerous for the development of his own child not everybody sees that as negativ because a lot of people doesnt believe that children ",14
1249, aged  understand the things they seemany parents cant even imagine that many ,24
1250, the growing process can have an influence on the futured personality of the kidsfor me its the biggest problem in todays community and forbiding of television andvertising directed to to the young children wouldnt be a ,17
1251," for the probmlem

for me its hard to judge about this because i never thought ",19
1252, intensiv about this topic maybe because i am not a parent ,9
1253, for and against the statement manchend at the begiining,21
1254," discuss the controverse theme if television advertising  should be allowed or not
on one ",15
1255, itâ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children because the children in the age of  canâ´t say anything about there own opinion because they are to young to say it ,16
1256," children maybe donâ´t want advertising that is  them the children aged  are far too young to think about there own opinion and to think about advertising being  them
on the other ",16
1257, you could say that itâ´s good to direct the advertising toward young children ,16
1258, they canâ´t say if they want to do that because itâ´s the only way to direct an advertising toward young children itâ´s ,16
1259," important for the television advertising to do that
all in all ",10
1260, it might be important for the television to direct advertising toward those young children,14
1261, television advertising toward young children should not be allowed children aged  years are just in the ,13
1262, of their development as humans and do not understand the ,7
1263, teenagers and even adults have often problems with getting influenced by advertises ,11
1264," how could we think they would not even more harm to these small children

in these days ",12
1265, there is advertising everywhere it is almost inevitable that the children see it too but the advertizes directed straight to them are the probably the most harmful as an example a commercial from fast food restaurant in which they offer a free toy with the meal can be really damaging to these young children they do not understand ,16
1266," of eating unhealthy food 

there ",4
1267, and it would be hard to regulate which advertises are allowed and which not i ,11
1268, think we should try to do our best to not get the kids influenced by advertising because of the numerous bad ,16
1269,in my opinion it isnt as harmful as some of the publicity which little children are confronted with children nowedays grow up with electronic devices and it is quite normal and safe to say that children see things which they shouldnt see or what they should not see ,4
1270, advertising isnt harmful it is the content in it which isnt okay the content should be checked ,11
1271, some companys publish it but children could learn from advertisement they could improve their language and their vocabulary just by listening to the conversation or what is being told in it im sure the children dont know all of the words which they hear ,0
1272, it is an improvement at this age children are keen on developing their abilities ,8
1273, they might dont know it ,3
1274, it is important that they have a basis to build on it isnt useful for anybody to keep the children isolated from the environment and slow down the improvement of the abilities thich they will need in the upcoming future on the other ,12
1275, the advertising is directly directed to children ,16
1276, the companies which produce the adverts wont use difficult words they have to make sure that even the youngest children are able to understand what they are saying so the ,16
1277, is that children wont learn that much of new words because of the difficulty which isnt really given children  are there in an age where they start building longer sentences with words they start using from hearing and picking up whereever they are so to be honest i dont mind giving the companys that much of freedom to let them produce adverts for young children it is a winwin situation in which the children learn something and the companys make profit im not sure whether it should be allowed or not that isnt down to me to decide but it i have made my ,16
1278, and i see more positve contribution than negative ,21
1279,"young children should play outside more often that is sentence every child has heard a lot of times in her or his young years but why should they play outside

now a days a television and the outraging development of the technology is very normal to the young generation and there parent generation the only generation is the elders generation whom are not used to technology at all there are a few ones that do not have a probleme with the change but the most do so the snetence above is mostly to hear form the older generation  
the children should be allowed to watch television and use all the technology the presnt has to offer because we are living in a constant development of technology and in the future there will be more of that some say that it is all going to be compromized and going to be technical 
the only thing parents could do is to set a limit of tv watching for there children ",17
1280, they can be social and hang out with there friends actually that is a thing that every child is going to do in that young age they are going to the kindergarden or to a kita and will only be watching tv in the mo0ments ,1
1281, they are at home as you can see there are a lot of times where they do not have time watch tv ,1
1282," they shopuld have a time where they are allowed to watch there series or there favorite movie that is what makes the children happy now a days 
furthermore more many child series and movies on tv teach many life lessons ",17
1283," that the children will be prepared for life and their social life for example dora or other series there are some episodes where they solve math problemes teach you how to deal with strangers or hoe to treat your friends 
fact is that the series that they watch on tv prepare for school
the only thing that could be held against that statement is that there are ",8
1284, horror movies and other bad stuff that children at that age should not watch for that parents can just install a code for those channels ,6
1285, the children will not have a chance to watch these also to hold against the ,12
1286, that children that watch tv are not interfering with there family anymore the parents could watch the sereies with them and make a game out of it ,1
1287," they will make tv watching a family activity

in the end i can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 25 must be allowed to interfier with that in the future there will be more and more technology and we can not forbidm the children to not live that life",17
1288,"in the following essay i will show negativ reasons and examples for the statement  television advertising  should not be allowed
in my opinion i ",15
1289, with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples the ,21
1290, reason is that young children at the age  can not understand the main statement from the television because there brain can not translate or understand the film which is shown as a ,6
1291, it should not be allowed my ,12
1292, reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours ,17
1293, they would  not focus on there future work lives the ,19
1294, is that the television is a media which is lying fluently to have better quotes of the public to become famous and rich the children would grow up with wrong information ,17
1295, they could understand the truth of the television and its ,17
1296, on their there future lives could be mainly destroyed or would stay on the lies of the television my last reason is that children at the age of  are defintiv to young to look tv because of the risks and the ,17
1297," of this media to themselves

yours jason",19
1298," my children will never watch tv until theyre over 6 years old my parents threated me like this and i have the same opinion
for those parents who will let their children watch tv ",17
1299," this age or they watch with them in a very young age the eyes of the kids will develop in a bad
way i used to watch tv ",17
1300," but now i dont watch anymore because there arent good programms anymore 
maybe there are some good series for kids which can help them to learn speaking or reading that would be great but i dont know if its better ",6
1301, they learn this in school  i ,18
1302, think that children in the age between 2 and 5 should ,12
1303, play with real toys like a car or puppets and  ,20
1304," important to be outside in this age 
for example i played a lot of soccer with my dad and my sister was dancing everytime ",8
1305," things like that are better to do in a childhood

1306, to learn some threatments with other young children like me and my sister ,8
1307, we were five years old we were staying outside at our neighborhood playing with a lot of other young kids with the similar interests,24
1308,television has been a big thing over the last fifty years and with the tv there came the advirtising it is very important for companys to promote their products ,10
1309," that the people actually want to buy them the question is if this manipulating advertisment is harming for little children

on one ",2
1310, children aged 2 to five are ,24
1311, very easily manipulated which can lead to annoying children beggin for money to buy those things its important that children not get affected by those ads ,16
1312," that they not get the will to have everything they see in this world which is already filled with greedyness

on the other ",3
1313, children need to learn as early as possible that in this world you have to learn how to resist and to know what is good for you and not fall into every marketing trap they show you its ,2
1314," helps the children to get to know all those products

all in all it probably hasnt the best impact for little children and ",2
1315, you should keep them away from this marketing stategies ,11
1316, grew up with television advertisment and it hasnt caused to much harm in my case i believe the parents have the responsibility to explain their children that what they see isnt always how it isin real life ,14
1317," you actually buy those things
",18
1318, thing we tink about is is it good or is it bad for the children  but ,4
1319, we think about the children ,8
1320," if it woulnt be allowed to do televisom advertising the televisionbusiness would have a big problem they would not be able to keep on streaming they get a big part of their money by getting those tv advertising on 

an other ",15
1321," of view is if we dont allow television adversiting  theyll never get used to it i mean we all know those stupied or boring adversiting but we are used to it and we dont bother if we see its somthing we see all day and little children should be able to see it too
we live in a time where everything is bad and getting worse but the truth is that the older generation had to go through the same things and they are ",17
1322," please dont make a drama out of everything

on the other ",19
1323," we all know that television for little children is not that good some people even say that its very unhealthy they have a problem with understanding everything and we all know that a lot television advertising is real shit some are filled with black humor others with sexuell jokes i dont know how children are supposed to understand anything 

it ",17
1324," makes some people and even children addicted to it they start buying things out of those television advertising and cant stop doing that 
addiction to television is something really bad and if children suffer from it they need halp

my opinion is that children should be allowed to watch television even with tv advertising in it i mean they should get used to it if we make everything kidsfriendly they never get used to the real world",14
1325," im in school series for children are shown in the televisoin including advertisements should it be allowed to show children aged  advertisments
on one ",14
1326, children see new things know whats existing through othre sources than only their parents and maybe the kindergarden a marketing group that wants to sell their products is quiet interested in television advertisment for young children they are influencable very well and they are fastly convinced from such advertisements the advertisement can ,0
1327, be fitting to the serie that the children are watching for example that an advertisement for horsetoys is shown during a series about horsestories this is ,6
1328, for the ones that want to sell their products children aged  have a lot more impressions of their environment their parents siblings kindergardenguides and other children but ,2
1329, very important are the stories that they hear the movies and the series which they watch and they are ,6
1330, influenced by the movie or the series but by the advertisement too because ,11
1331, children cant difference from the movie or series and the advertisement in case of a leadership of a dictator or a very radical party ,7
1332," children can be victims of propaganda and that propaganda can be made very well in television and in the advertisement that is shown there 
as a conclusion if they stop allowing advertisements during children series i would stop allow some series at all and ot only the advertisement because there are many childrens series that make the children dumb and that is ",14
1333, a kind of propaganda and its more influencing than the advertisement between through that the marketing effect for the sellers is ,11
1334, here what is an positive effect too ,21
1335,"this essay will be about the ban of advertising spots on television directing to children between the age of two and five

on the one ",13
1336, children are not able to think critically about the advertisement they cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant for example children do not need their own playstation ,2
1337, they are really young they do not know that it is unhealthy if they use it too much ,4
1338," that they get problems with their eyes et cetera  
on the other ",19
1339," if the parents take care of them and pay attention the children will not get any problems but they will have fun with their new toy or other things 
but children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them they will be really unhappy for example if a child sees a plastic horse on tv running around and jumping it would think that this horse is really able to do that but it is not furthermore there would be some children who want to get everything they see on tv and for poor parents it would be really difficult to explain why their friends already own these things which seem to be important
but for the industry it is easier to persuade children than adults who reflect their actingthey would not profit of this ban ",14
1340, watching tv for young children is dangerous and unhealthy ,17
1341," these advertisements should not be allowed because for the children there is no benefit their health and happyness would suffer and the profit of the industry is not worth it 
 



",16
1342,in the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices in the following text ,8
1343," which speak for or against the advertisment which is directed 

the biggest ",11
1344, against the advertisment is that children are very easy to influece because they do not have enough experience to know what is wrong and what is write furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see ,2
1345," the advertisment could have negative effets on the children
on the other ",16
1346, children are learning very much in this part of life ,8
1347, the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products but this ,11
1348, is just valuable if the advertisment is supposed for children and does not have strongly influecing parts maby the companies could make an advertisment which gives the child useful information the information could be about important topics in our contemporary society ,0
1349," about the responsable thing eith the nature

in conlusion ",21
1350, that  a special advertisment for children should only be allowed if the advertisment is controlled by the parents or a kind of institute in the ,13
1351,television  young people should  be allowed but the children should watch tv not ,17
1352," often like adults because they have not enough concentration to watch an hour a day moreover it is bad for the childrens eyes young children must play with other friends and should not sit at home to watch television but often young children can learn something by watching television an example is that they learn to treat the other children in the kindergarten better or learn to say different words also little children learn what is forbidden and what is right but they should watch series which are made for young children with an age of if they look criminal series it is not good for their evolution and they can missundertand what the people are doing 
televison advertising is not good for the childish brain because they do not know what is important and what is not but i do not think that it is bad if they watch it
i ",17
1353, with this statement because it is not bad if little child seeing television advertising in this age but they should not watch it ,14
1354,"this essay is about the topic if television advertising  should be allowed or not

companies which sell ",15
1355, toys or games are doing much television advertising  children are easy to manipulate and if they want something really bad they often get it because their parents can not stand their cute child so the companies make much money with these advertising ,2
1356," at chrismas time so it is kind of good for the industry and the tv channels

but kids should not think they can have everything and those whose parents have not much money should not be shown what they miss besides should the media not be directed to ",12
1357," young kids children in this age should go outside and enjoy their childhood and do not sit inside infront of the television or other media 

i would prefer it if the advertising of toys and other childish things would be directed to the parents and not to the child ",13
1358, that the parents can choose what they want to buy and the kid is happy about that one thing and does not want every toy in the advertising  ,20
1359," the answer for this is very difficult
first off all it seems to manipulate the young children because the things named in the advertisings are used to atract these young childrenthis works because they donâ´t even think about the price and if they really need these things
nevertheless these children arenâ´t allowed  canâ´t even buy these things by themselfe
so ",2
1360, the parents are the people who have to buy these things and have to spend their money on this but ,9
1361, they donâ´t do this their children start crying and behave absolutly stupid so ,9
1362," children and parents are mad
on the other ",9
1363," advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television
that is the normal reason to produce advertisings it is the same ",11
1364," you see some advertisings for adults like an advertising for some good beer or a new video game also trailers of movies works like this  they have to make people interested in the topic of the movie
nevertheless chilrden are much more open minded for advertisings ",16
1365, it works much better with them ,19
1366, with this statement first of all ,21
1367, it is useless because none of the children is interested in advertising it is just annoying for them another reason why this is useless is that the person who buys the product are their parents or other familiy members the only way the advertising is affecting the children is ,0
1368, the children like the colours or animals in the advertising spot and ,0
1369, they long for it this could lead to a quite embarassing moment for the parents ,9
1370, they are at the supermarket and their child starts complaining or even  screaming until they get what they want in the other way the advertising could affect the children in a positiv way for example ,2
1371, the advertising shows a monkey eating a banana the children tend to eat more fruits or ,0
1372, they see how other children are having fun playing outside the childer might tend to go outside more often which ,24
1373, is really important nowadays but ,21
1374, that the producer of television advertising is interessted in how they can affect a childrens health life so generally its maybe a bit hard to not allow those television advertising i just think they are useless,13
1375, is that television advertising is an etertainment for children sometimes you can learn ,14
1376," it is a documentary about something 

on the other ",18
1377, young children between two and five years shouldnt watching television at ,17
1378, it isnt good for the eyes and ,4
1379, the figures in television not speak correctly children learn the language false children shouldnt watch often television because ,17
1380, they seat all the time they need activity they must go out and move in this age children learn a lot for life and television dont help they ,17
1381," 

my opinion for this is that young children dont need to watching television in this ages the children must play with each other and have contact with other childrens ",17
1382," in the age between two and five children need many activity and must learn things they need later for life 

finally we can say that television advertising isnt good for young children but it should be allowed then the parents could forbid to watching television for the childrens or not its their own opinion",14
1383,television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society there are some good ,10
1384, many bad ones for the children in this young age children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life television advertising can be good for a children whose parents are very busy and do not have many time for their child many television channels have learn programms for children where children can learn ,14
1385, languages or easy vocabulary but it is not good for the children to just sit in front of a tv and watch channels they need influences of their parents and of other kids they need to go out to the playground play with their friends and get social ,8
1386, that children who sit the whole day in front of a television will not educate as good as the ones who go out and learn from their parents and from their activities the other children will not learn how to get friends and to communicate with different people they will ,8
1387, not have a good relation to their parents because they did not spend much time with them ,9
1388, that it is really important for a children to have a good relation to their mother and father the position of parents is ,8
1389, important for children because they learn from them and act like them when they do not spend much time with their parents ,8
1390, they are young it will have aftermath ,19
1391," they are adults when they go to school they will possibly be a misfit beacause they did not learn how to make friends and be social 
to conclusion ",24
1392, with that statement because the television advertising is not good for a well education of the children and the relation to family,14
1393,television advertising  young childern aged  should not be allowed this statement should be discussted very well because children havent built an own opinion ,13
1394, they belive everything that they see so what are the ,3
1395, against and what are the ,21
1396," for this statement
first of all as mentioned ",21
1397, children can be influenced very easily ,7
1398," they are younger and there are ads everywhere so if children see how the children in the ads play with many different toys they want to have that too and they grow up with the idea of having everything in their lives with our ads we create a society of people who belive that owning a lot of things is important and do we really want that
on the other ",2
1399, you could say that small children cant really do things on their own expecially if they are 2 years old so its in the hands of the parents to look ,7
1400," their children and decide wether an ad is important or not
in the end you could say that it is in the interest of the parents how they want to raise their child and how much they let their children be influenced by the media",13
1401,"the question weather television advertising  should be allowed or not inst that easy to answer 
on the one ",15
1402, small that they arent able to reconize the ,19
1403, that they get manipulated plus the ,3
1404, that is pretty easy to do it because they dont have th ability to reflect things on the other ,19
1405," ads can be an insparation for the kids independet from their parents they maybe get introduces to some different things which show them the diversity of the world 
an other negative ",0
1406, is that the childrens arent abled to judge things regarding their quality or the need of it they are simply very easy to impress which makes them making desicions about spending money they dont have and can cause a lot of frustration if they dont get it but here we are at the ,2
1407, where the parents take place they are ,9
1408, the one who decide weather to buy the advirtised product or not they have ,23
1409, the exercise to teach their kids the handling of money the use treatment and importance of things and the moral behind it ,9
1410," that they have the powerneed to change their kids minds 
all in one it is a big industry which is interestes in the childs opinion because they are good selling customers it can be seen as regarding to the moral false or as regarding to the industry good 
in my opinion there is nothing bad about directing television advertising to the children because they get into the diversity which exists and learn about the parents how to handle it the only problem which occures is that if the parents dont theach their children they might get too much manipulated and materialistic ",14
1411,should television advertising be  this is a well discused question and ,15
1412," i try to answer it 
on the one ",18
1413, of showing these advertisings in tv is that the products have mostly a pedagogic ,11
1414, the child learns new things there are ,8
1415, dolls that talk with the child and it learns to speek another good thing about the advertising is that ,20
1416, the parents see them and might find new toys for their kids something they might not found without watching the advertise on the other ,20
1417, children of this age have a high level of influence the companies could sell them whatever they want if they make the advertise colored and happy enough at his age children can not decide what is good and what is bad ,2
1418, war is good they maybe think this is true also children in young years should not watch television too much making advertising for them shows that there is a high number of children watching tv and if the companies would stop it maybe not as much children would watch television watching too much tv is at this age not really good for the evolution last but not least the kids can become mad ,17
1419, they see what the advertising offers and what they have in their room ,3
1420,"toys they wont be as happy as they were because the children want more and more things but can not always get them from their parents
in my opinion television advertising directed  should not be allowed ",2
1421, kids at this age should go outside and play and not watch tv the wohle day and if they do they should not be influenced by consumorientated companies which just want to earn money and do whatever they can do to get it,24
1422,in our century it is totally normal to see some children playing with the smartphones of their parents ,24
1423, theyre talking with other people or just dont have enough time to look ,3
1424," their childs so why should television advertising not be allowed

 the children are to young to really understand what they are seeing in the tv they cant understand the real background of advertising ",14
1425, they wouldnt be affected by it but maybe if they at the age of five years they can learn something for life by watching the advertising as an example watching this things about healthy food or just anything about a healthy lifestyle of course they dont understand this things at this time but maybe ,0
1426, the grown up they remind something about the advertising and ,0
1427," they understand so in one way advertising supports the education of the children 

on the other ",0
1428, you can say that watching tv at the age of two years isnt really good for their eyes because if i watch tv for too long my eyes begin to hurt and i cant let them stay open ,17
1429, i have to close them to stop the burning inside and ,18
1430, that if youre just two years old that would be many times worse so too much tv  is really unhealthy ,17
1431, just for the childs they could ,12
1432, be perplexed by the crazy and sometimes really stupid advertising which were playing between our films and series ,11
1433, that if you have a child between two and five years you could do ,9
1434, many beautiful things with it than just watching some stupid tv shows in my opinion the child could learn ,6
1435, much more about life outside in the forest than inside on the couch especially the advertising never shows the real world every advertising in the tv is reworked by photoshop or some other programm that makes the pictures or the little shortfilms more pretty and nearly perfect as a result the child doesnt get to know the real society out there and ,6
1436, they dont learn really anything right about life sometimes this advertising affects a child ,2
1437," much that it want to be like their idol in the tv that it falls into a down and is really unhappy with himself

in my opinion the advertising has not to be forbidden for the children but ",14
1438, the parents have to say them if something isnt right and is just invited stuff so in that way ,9
1439, that advertising is good for them because ,11
1440, they could learn something about the life that they have to live ,8
1441," they have been grown up
but the medias should ",19
1442, dont do longer this stupid not really helpful advertising which is just stupid ,11
1443,i cant say if im ,18
1444, with this statement because there are reasons why it is good for little children to watch television but there are ,17
1445," reasons why it isnt good

first ",21
1446, that it istnt bad to watch tv but only if you dont watch to much ,17
1447, that litte children could learn something important or perhaps they could learn new words and ,8
1448, if you are have boring you could watch television ,1
1449," that you havent boring any more

but as i told ",18
1450, reasons why it is better that children plays with his toys ,20
1451," reason is that little children should communicate a lot with children with the same age and if the watch tv it isnt possible to talk to other children
a ",17
1452, that the screan is not good for the eyes ,4
1453," it could be possiple that they have to waer glasses later
for little children its ",24
1454," important to go a lot outside and play in the frish ear and not to stay inside and dont move
because sport is ",18
1455," very important and if they always sit in front of the television and dont move its not healthy

so ",17
1456, that if the children aged  dont look to much television it should be allowed,17
1457," discuss the question if television advertising s young children should be allowed or not 
the ",13
1458, against ads for young children is that they will probably not understand what the purpose of an ad is ,16
1459," they will want to have the advertised item this will be expensive for the parents or the child and the parents are going to fight over it
an ",9
1460," for advertising s young children is that they will see new things to play with and maybe they will get a bigger imagination or just new ideas 
but watching too much tv ",0
1461, is not advisable for young children because they should play outside and think for their own ,4
1462," just getting their stories delivered through the tv
but ",1
1463," for these ads is that children can choose a new food they want to try or a new game they want to play because they have seen it in an advertisment they will quicker learn new things
the ",0
1464," against advertising is that the companies who make these ads should not use the notknowing of the children to make more money
but the opposite of that ",13
1465, fot these ads if you see it from the perspective of the companies who ,11
1466, gain money gaining more money because of these ads is good for the companies and following from that ,11
1467," good for the economy of the country in which these ads are allowed in
another ",11
1468," for these ads is that if the children watch tv they are occupied because with different ads the tv program is different from day to day so the parents can do housework like cooking or doing laundry without really caring for the child for a few minutes
the last ",0
1469," against ads  is  
in my opinion the advertising  should not be allowed because the companies should not use young children in that way to get more money ",13
1470,"although to mutch consume of digital media like smartphones computer and television isâ´t good at all for young children because it takes big influence on the way their brains develob in a negative way so responsibl parents shold act in a way not let their children whatch all of this junk tv 
but if children of the age of two to fife years whatch tv in germany they are often whatching superrtl and in this childfriendly program they publish many scenes showing violence and there is a lot of advertising to and in the advertisin they show the newest and coolest toys and ",17
1471, these young children look at them they emidiatly whant to have them ,20
1472, in some famylies they get the new toys as quick as they publish them but some parends would say no and ,20
1473, normality of violence showen in tv the children start to behave the same and not just at home ,6
1474," in the kindergarden and at their friends homes 
in my opinion advertising should be banned out of childfriendly tv and they should ",14
1475, renew and think about what they show in this kind of tv and if this might be realy childfrtiendly ,6
1476, televesion towards young children in the age  should not be allowed because children in that age can be manipulated very easily they can only watch it and cannot understand what is shown in the advertisement when there is a happy child in their age which is playing with a specific toy from a specific brand for the advertisement of this brand the child wants to play with this toy too and it will try to make his parents give him that specific toy because it canâ´t really understand that the advertisement it trying to make this effect when an older child is watching television and sees an advertisement it can understand the things that take place in the advertisement and can see that the advertisement is only an child who is only playing with this toy for the advertisement and they can make a differce between toys they really want and toys they only want because the child in the advertisement seemed to be happy ,13
1477, playing with this toy but ,20
1478, televison advertisement towards young children cannot be forbidden because we live in a democratic state where everybody can publish what they wrote or filmed ,13
1479, you can only stop advertisement towards young cildren ,16
1480, it is affecting them in a negative way and ,4
1481, you can only stop a specific spot but the most advertisements are not affecting the children in a negative way they only make the children want a toy and ,16
1482, that is a very important way for companys to sell their products because this is the most affective and ,23
1483, the easiest way to reach the children and earn money by selling them specifc toys so ,20
1484, advertisement for children sould not be allowed ,16
1485, it is affecting them in a negative way and sets them under a bad influence but ,4
1486, televison advertisement towards young children is not allowed it doesnâ´t stop that young children can be manipulated very easily and want most of the things they see so ,14
1487, advertisement towards young children should be allowed ,16
1488,i think children from 1 to 5 shouldnt watch television at all they should go outside and play and not sit inside and watch television in our society today all kids just sit inside and play with their tablats or phones that is very bad they dont receive the experience from playing outside the advanteruse in the forests or the scary dog from your neighbor they just knew the internet my generation ist i think the last who doesnt have phones or something in teir childhood we play outside with our friends and doesnt text over facebook or snapchat its scary because ,17
1489, you say to your child stop watching television and go outside  they have no idea what to do advertising in the television is not just bad for kids from 1 to 5 its ,14
1490," bad for adults the advertiser are very tricky and they know exactly ho to catch the people to buy things from them advertising should be stoped but  thats impossible because the concerns are too big and cannot be stoped advertising should not be allowed for kids up to 18 because its very dangerous and many kids buying things that they dont knew they really buy
finally i think it should be stoped but its impossible  advertsing is too big in the society today the only thing we can do is to take our kids away from the tv and take our time with them ",14
1491, they dont want watch tv anymore,1
1492,the following essay deals with the topic of allowing television advertising for young children from age  there are different reasons ,13
1493," supporting this advertising or not 
a good ",11
1494, of television advertisement is the ,10
1495, that some products for children can be presented on tv and the children will talk to their parents about it if the ads would only run on channels for adults they probably would not listen or react to it as much as the young kids do many adults simply do not watch television advertisement having the children informed through television would be specifically great for selling the products ,0
1496," as knowing all the products as a parent 
there are more bad things about this topic ",2
1497, the children could be annoyed in their young years by this form of advertisement it would always interrupt their shows and they really just would not like it at all in germany there is a tvchannel called kika which does not show any ads it makes watching the channel way better and the kids are not confronted with the breaks for advertisement in addition children would only see the product and what they are worth they would be teached to think about prices and owning products more than thinking about feelings and ethics they would want to have everything and that is a bad thing for our society ,14
1498," because it should be all about what you think and how happy you are and not about owning every toy or all the money you can get 
all together i would ",9
1499, that television advertising should not be allowed on channels for children and for children ,13
1500, it teaches wrong ideas of living in abundance and owning everything it is the parents work and job to teach their growing youngs that things are just that much worth as you think they are and the advertisement shows a different idea just thinking about capitalism and making profit ,0
1501,"it would be hard to classify the advetisement is it for children aged  or for older kids the companys sponsering the ads could just claim that theyâ´re not aiming for the younger children but it would be very good if those television advertising would not be allowed anymore because those little children are very easy to manipulate
for companys who produce products for kids aged thwo to five it would be a huge ",16
1502," if they canâ´t advertise their product anymore and would damage the financial situation of them 
on the other ",23
1503," are the parents the ones who have to pay for the toys sweets etc of their children and the company use the kids because they are easier to manipulate to get the money from their parents using kids as things to get their parents money is ethicly bad
",2
1504, it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward young children because they are innocent they cant think of the ,13
1505, of their own acting and if they see something they like they want it this effect can be used to advert something with a lot of coulor and shining but the  year olds dont know that the ad just wants them to buy things advertisement for adult people is oaky they know the sence of an ad   ,0
1506," write about hypothetical situationin which television advertsising which is  young childern isnt allowed with young children i mean children which are aged  most of the childern in this age are allowed to watch television all the parents are in a worry about the series but what about the advertising
on the one ",14
1507," a  big problem which exists if you ban the advertsing is that the televison programm doesnt have any insources of money because with the help of streaming advertising they earn money to cast the series
on the other ",15
1508, you have to keep in mind that the children and ,9
1509, their future if they watch lots of advertising they always want to have everything which is streamed outor they want to live like the children in the advertisment and ,0
1510," they are younger parents often buy most of the things which their children want so they dont learn how to deal with money or stuff
but you shouldnt forget that there is advetising for everything in the tv and if the parents watch televsion they get ideas what the ",9
1511," present for their children could be if they havent got any clue our society wouldnt be like that if we wouldnt have that amount of advertising because advertisment has got a big influence to us
children are a good subject for the project of environements to try out some new theorys how to influence people that they buy the product so children are threaten like an object
in my opinion the advertising which is  shouldnt be allowed because ",16
1512, its a negative influence to the children which should have stopped and if we are able to stop one source of influence than we should to that,12
1513,television advertising on specific products for children like candys or toys is designed exactly for their younger minds you can find this image ,14
1514, inside a supermarket the sweets are placed right ,18
1515, to the counter with the reason that the children ask their parents ,9
1516, paying their products if they can have some haribo ,23
1517," the leaders of the market know exactly that they can play mindgames with younger people and earn more money in this way 
one reason for this is that young children dont have the experience to see if a product of their favour is useful or useless for them they ",2
1518," cant tell if its worth the prize of it  it is a skill that a human being achieves together with the process of growing up so adults are choosing more wisely which product they can effort and which not
the only question is if the advert is for children and has no other thoughts behind or is designed to earn more money with a product that ",0
1519," the job of the parents to inform their kids to not believe everything what television adverts want to tell them
so i would say that television advertising designed for young children is probably a bad thing for their parents money bag but should be allowed ",14
1520, for the reason that adverts for children most of the time dont want to steal your money and just want to show the product like every advert for an other product ,16
1521, for and against this statement television advertising can have a big influence to people and people from one to 90 years old watch television television advertising is an important ,15
1522," because the technology becomes better and better 

the reasons to ",23
1523, with this statement are that the advertising on television has a big influence to children and ,14
1524," much advertising is on television the children are more happier the thing is that the advertising for children is cool it has cool music many colours and happy children the children want to watch more and more television but the advertising isnt the reality when the children only see television advertising they want to have the same games as it shows in the television but for the children it is important to see the real world to play with other children and be thankful for what they have 

on the other ",14
1525, children are in contact with the technology they ,24
1526, have to learn things so they learn what an advertising is and what influence it has on people maybe they ,11
1527, learn that not all the advertising is good and that the most things are false and that they dont have to buy this things because not all is necessary and they see how the world is focused on money people want to make money with their products ,2
1528," for advertising you need money 

",11
1529, with this statement for me the advertising is too much for children the influence is too big the children can have a good life without this without the advertising the children see the good things in the world and are thankful with advertising they want more and more games or other things ,13
1530,"in this essay i am going to talk about my personal opinion on this statement 

one of the reasons why young children shouldnt be allowed to watch tv is ",17
1531," because they get distracted very easily so if you let them watch tv whenever they want they will get to comfortable with it young children can get faszinated for anything and if they like something they want to watch it again and again
but ",17
1532," bad stuff on tv children from age  are learing very fast and i think if they are able to learn with pictures and videos their learning will improve

on one ",6
1533," i think watching tv is a lot of fun and there is no reason to not allow young children watching tv
on the other ",17
1534," for young children it is important that theyre learning by doing they should play with other children and explore their surrounding
one of ",8
1535, factor in realtion with tv is that watching tv should be kind of a treat if the children ,17
1536, played outside the whole day we are living in a time where young chlildren grow up with the internet and all the electronic toys so to not allow watching tv at all wouldnt make any sense because theyre going to watch tv anyway for me personal it is very important to have a healthy balance between having fun ,1
1537," youre watching tv and watching tv because youre just bored 
as i already mentioned children from age  are learing very easily and as a parent you lay their foundation for their future you should make sure that theyre watching the right things on the internet and on tv

in conclusion ",17
1538, a bad thing but if you as a parent arent under control it can turn into a very bad thing and can influence the future of your child ,4
1539,"television advertising for young children should not be allowed because young children are easier to influence than older people so if they see advertisment for a thing they normally wouldnt want to have they may will be convinced   
that now they want to have it so than the parents are gonna have this problem with their children that they are going to cry ",13
1540, they dont get it on the other ,19
1541, those really young children possibly dont even make up their mind if they want to have something or not and just get what they need from their parents if you look at it from this perspective you could even claim that young children are gonna learn speaking and reading better through these spots also normally young children often times dont watch the television stations where many advertising spots are showed or dont watch much television ,0
1542, could have a negative impact on those children because for food advertisement is mainly made for unhealthy food so if a child sees this advertisement for soda ,16
1543, it want to drink it and maybe becomes used to it ,19
1544," this child gets heavy and gets in way too much sugar accasionally it could lead to diabetes 
in my opinion this advertisements dont really effect what young children buy because they aint buying that much for thereselfs anyway but it could effect the health ",2
1545, as the way these children see the world for example many little children who lived in the city thought that a cow is purpil because of a specific chocolate brand named milka and they never saw a real cow,7
1546,"the critical age between  years is a period of time in which a childs brain is the most flexible which induces the ability to learn as much as possible wasting their mental resources on targeted advertising which would distract theirmindsfrom learningessentialbehaviour would definitely put harmonto their congnitive capability
moreso brains fromchildren agedtwotofive are not developed enoughto seperate economicallytargetedinputfromother stimuli andthey might bring their parents tostressby expressing their needs

in contrary to the arguements inapproval ofthe suggestedlawparents who expose theirchildren to targetedadvertising would ",16
1547, bring normal advertising into theirlife witherto the ,11
1548, that advertisingistargetedor notwouldnot change the ,11
1549," thatthey arebeing shown advertisements at all

what parents expose their children to should be in their responsibility 








notethe spacebar on this computer is faulty",16
1550,there are different ways to think about this theme on one site people say it is very good for childrens to look tv because there are important ,6
1551, and ideas about the life which childrens can learn from shows or films on the tv most parents have to go to work ,6
1552, they are not at home all the time why shouldnâ´t it be a good way to have some education ,12
1553," the parents arenâ´t at home 
another opinion is that it is really unhelpfull for young children to look tv there are a few ",17
1554, which pointed that out at ,18
1555, parenst have the fear that their children forgot the world ,7
1556, to the tv they think it is possible that their childs stop meeting friends outside or having fun with conservative toys like action figures or something similar parents ,17
1557, say that there isnâ´t only good stuff shown in the television the problem is that there are many shows which are not good for young children most films are not made for children ,17
1558, the plot is a way too hard to understand or it is very cruel the result out of that would be that the childrens get fear or even panic of daily things because they recognice films where dangerous things happend in the situation in which they are now too another problem of the tv is that the people watching do not move in this time ,6
1559," the childrens start early with just sitting around and do not use their body they will never understand why it is important to move and do sports the result of no sports at the start of the life is that the childs get heavyweight pretty early that means that they do not know another stadium of their body and will never reach to a healthy way of life
both of the arumentations make sense to me on one ",8
1560, there are many important things to learn ,18
1561, for childrens on the other ,12
1562," itâ´s reasonable why childs shouldnâ´t watch television anyway 
so my result or idea is to have something in between these two opinions maybe itâ´s good to block channels which show plot for adults for childs so the childrens can look tv and the parents do not have to have fear of showing them bad stuff the problem with social contact with other childrens and the body movement could be solved with a build in timer in the tv the childrens have a time per day to watch tv maybe 1 hour so they have to do other things than watching tv and just sitting around
for me that would be a grat opportunity to use the good offer for children on the television ",17
1563," do not overuse it 

o",18
1564,it is discussed a lot about the new technology and whats good about it and what are the negative things about it ,23
1565, its very important to think about those questions because may be they can change our future and the future of the ,21
1566, generations a lot the new technology is very useful and we dont know what we would do without it but ,23
1567, we shouldnt use the electronic devices too much in our daily life especially for young children in the age of  it could be dangerous for their health we dont know it ,4
1568, because this new generation has to get older ,24
1569, the best for those young children is to go and play outside and enjoy their childhood if they are the whole day in front of the television they have never lived their childhood by playing with other kids in their age a reason for this change could be that people work more in a lot of households the mother works too and doesnt have time for her children or she is just stressed about the work and doesnt want to play with the children thats why more and more children just sit in front of the television the whole day ,17
1570," this is not a good developement but we cant change it and we have to accept that the world is changing every day may be television advertising  should not be allowed but we cant make a law out of it nobody could control them if they do it correct or not its everyones one desicion how to raise their children the only thing we can do is to memorize the parents what would be the best way to raise their children but we can never say that there is only one correct way to raise their children and we have to accept that
in the end we cant make a law out of this statement because its everyones own desicion how to raise the children we have to accept ",14
1571, opinons because we dont know what is going to happen the ,19
1572, years may be a child who always watched tv in the childhood doesnt have a good social life but it could ,17
1573, be that a child who never watched tv in hisher childhood is going to have problems in school or his job because they dont know how it works ,17
1574,we all watch televison to relax ,10
1575, a long day of work to inform oneself or just to let the kids enjoy nice colorful animated series and enjoy the peace and quet for a moment but what about the advertisements in between the series adults are animated to buy products by them but ,0
1576," are kids but as kids can only use the money of their parents is it okay to advertise things to children

firstly children who dont visit a daycare or are in contact with other children only have the toys they get form their parents and they only know about them advertisements are useful for a child do get an idea what they could wish for for their birthday or for christmas they ",16
1577, learn to distinguish between what they like and what they dont like maybe they even invent an own new way to play with their toys they already have which is important for children it may even be helpful for the parents ,24
1578," they get an idea what children could like and what may be useful for their development

in addition all the child can to is ask for it they cant go and buy it themselves ",8
1579, why is it a problem parents can always say that they wont buy it or tell them that they would get it for their birthday or another occasion children ,20
1580, forget about things they dont see anymore and once the advertisement for the product is no longer shown the demand for it will ,11
1581," end

lastly children at the ages  experience an inmesurable amount of things throughout their day the advertisement is just one little thing and if children dont watch tv six hours a day they wont be influenced as much as they are influenced by their mother or father the nature or other children children will like the toy but ",0
1582, they never get it if they are raised right there is no need to be worried about them they ,7
1583," learn to deal with it at an early age they will be in contact with advertisements their whole life and if they know what to do with the information they get from the tv as early as possible they will not be influenced as much later

in contrary people are way too materialistic people own too much and ",14
1584, you have children you get to know that even more everybody gives you loads of things for your newborn and youre practically being suffocated by all the things you own making advertisements for children will only support this even more if children go to daycare they meet other children with other toys and ,0
1585," they always want to have the best toy and as this is always the one in the latest advertisement you should stop advertising directly towards children aged  as they can not know what it means to buy more and more stuff

in conclusion advertisements towards children isnt a bad thing ",16
1586, it all comes down to how the parents handle the situation if their kid always asks for more and better toys toys play a major role in a childs life and are important to develop creativity and an understanding of possession advertisements can help develop an understanding of what is necessary and what isnt if you wanted to prohibit advertising towards children you should ,20
1587, prohibit advertising towards adults as there are ,16
1588, people who dont know how to spend money neither do small children if the guidance is right advertisements can be a supporting factor of the development of a child,0
1589,"advertisement towards young childern should it be prohibited

television has become a highly popluar media in the last few centeries and ",13
1590, the younger childern always enjoy watching their favourite tv shows whenever they can however apart from the entertainment factor which is being brought by the vast viartities of series television has ,17
1591," given the abilitiy to gain money through advertisement but is it fair to gain money with adverts on younger children why should it not be prohibited 

firstly advertisement is made to gain new costumers who should buy there products and ",13
1592, young children are easily to be convinced ,7
1593, they are seeing their favourite toy in an advert on tv the one toy they were always dreaming of next to the informations about the product there is always a person demonstrated which is similar to the costumers themself in this case the person is a child who is playing with the toy and seems to be happy not only is the interes of the child itself gained ,0
1594, does the child actually want to have that one toy which will make them even more satisfied just like the child in the advertissement the main reason of the advertissement has been succeful and the adults have to buy the toy for their child because they want them to be happy and why ist it like that scenario the answer is simple children can be convinced much easier ,20
1595," elderly people because they believe nearly everything which is said in the advertisement 

in conclusion advert towards young children acutally should be prohibited because the affluent and huge company gain their money from young people who can be convinced easily these company should make money with creative adverts on older people and not on young children which will believe everything their hear ",16
1596,"tlevision advertising  should not be allowed thats the topic today first of all i have explain what i understand with the expression young children young children are kids aged 
is it okey to let the children watch televiion adversitising somepeople are strictly against it but why
a child is easy influencable it can see a toy adversitising on the television and it really wants it finally the mother has the decision between a child which cries the hole week long or to buy the toy an other ",14
1597, is that the child can get a wrong idea about a product ,2
1598,"something to eat which seems to be healthy but in real it isnt
eventhough how can we know on which server all those children are how should we be able to bann the advertising exactelly at the time and the program where all the kids are that sounds impossible ",2
1599, wouldnt it be unfair for those who wants to sell the products for children whereals should they make advertising and dont forget the child sees the product at the television and he fall in love with it but his parents are the one who buy it  personally ,2
1600, advertising is good the child can see toys which he might whish for the ,0
1601, birthday that means it makes children to decide by there one what they want and ,8
1602,we have to think about that these children that we are talkking about are in a very early period of their lifes children in this age can easily be influenced by their surroundings bad advertising can have bad influence on their ,16
1603," development in extreme examples governments could even use ads to spread their thoughts to the youngest as we see the potential is huge 
in our days electronic devices are more and more used by younger people tv chanels use this ",0
1604, to specificaly target these young people and sell their advertisment time to ,11
1605, toy manufacturers for them this time is litteraly a gold mine as long as they makke their ads cool in a sence of showing how awsome their new toy is the kids will beleive them the children ,0
1606, dont care if they allready own a simullar toy they just see the newer and awsome one because of that kids do not learn to be happy with what they allready own they usually dont ask themselfs about the nagatives of what is advetised ,20
1607,"
this influencial power can and should be used in a positive way telling them about environment solidarity and moral would be possile it had to be packed into a good ad ",0
1608," in that way the earlier mentioned potential would be used to teach important stuff to children 
in my opinion advertising targeted towards young children is dangerous and should regularly be controlled by adults however the possibilities are to big to just not use it and i really think this potencial has to be used",16
1609,"children and television

television advertising toward young children have to be allowed because it helps children to lern saying what they wantif they want seeing a particular show in de tv because they like it or if they dont want because they dislike this kind of television show 

television advertising helps parents with her children because if children are able to say what they like or dislike its mutch easier for the parents to go along with their children there are less fights between them because the parents knows what their children really want

televison advertising toward young children have to be stopt because its absolutely not necessairy that young children have to be confronted with such things if anybody makes advertisment toward children in tv its dangerous for the developpement of the childrenhood children have to play and move and not just looking tv

children aged  are in that particular age where they are very influencable by something so television advertising toward them should not be allowed every serie in tv have some elements which influence you and make that you want to see every episode of them ",14
1610, its a kind of a druge for people ,18
1611, it should not be allowed because the television companies knows how they get new people or how they influence them ,15
1612, its not necessairy that kids in this age look tv every evening because they dont want to miss a serie let the kids be kids let them play outside because later they have ,17
1613, much things to do with electric things ,18
1614, i think in this age you should play and dont worry about somethings and television advertising is able to give them a wrong perspectiv of the world and which things are importent and which are absolutely unimportant like having a special product for beeing cooladvertisment can make a cap between children because it says them what is cool and what not ,14

1619," that they dont grow up in the way that their parents teach them but instead they see whats new on the market and just like children are they obviously want it where as without television advertising the parents can take their children to the stores the want and trust 
second of all ",2
1620, children arent supposed to watch tv at all exept for some films a month or rarely some pokã©mon or similar series if the young generation spends enough time in front of the television to see commercials often enough that it pays off forthe conmpany ,14

advertisement just supports children to buy way too much things and all of the conversations on the schoolyard are just about what theyve seen on the television

",0
1625,"it is friday night you want to watch your favourite movie on tv while your watching there are the normal pause with advertisement you will not pay attention to it but a child aged  will pay attention and maybe want it should because of that television advertising directed to toward young children not be allowed

firstly you can influence children very simply if they watch an advertisement and they like it they want to have it and afterwards they will beg their parents to buy it maybe they will go on their own an will buy it young children are creative and they will find a way to get it even if they have to buy it on the blackmarket secondly you can brainwash the children for your own reason ",14

not at all contret mr kouwn the television and the addet advertising havent a connect with the fatness or anything alse the worse thing you can say to it is that it is a freetime taker thats all with the advertising tthey just want to show there now products no less no more and they arent just fore the kids ",16

on my opinion the people now days watch to much television they shoud go aut and do sport there ",19
1647, to much advertising they shoudent be ,11
1648,"should television advertising  not be allowed

in the following essay we will focus us on the question if televison advertising  young childrn aged  should not be allowed imaging a toddler is watching tv and sees an ad occuring on the screen specially modified for its age group is this ad going to have an influence on the later life of this little child or not 

i guess ",14
1649,we live in a free country where freedom of speach and the press is a common good therfore if you say that ads towarded young people have to be banned from tv it could be seen as unfair towards the guys who want to advertise for their products ,13
1650," they are just not allowed to make pr for it
on the other ",19
1651, advertising always has a critical ,11
1652, because its main job is to manipulate people ,23
1653," make them buying the products from the advertising company

now one could say that toddlers wont even regocnize the content of specially modified ads and that the material of these ads ",16
1654, wont have any influence on the child but you could ,4
1655, say and this i guess is an even stronger ,18
1656, toddlers sense a lot more from their environment than we might think and that ,8
1657," such ads definitely have an influence on the child wheter its conciouss or subconciouss

so ",0
1658, television advertising  should be definitely banned from the screens because we dont want to manipulate the ,15
1659," generation in a way some company leaders would like to

",23
1660, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed because young children can be manipulaited very well because they to not notice that not all the television advertising is the true therefore ,13
1661," a person in the television something said a young children can not know is it true or false but a older person can say that is true or false

young children ",6
1662, become more wishes wich the parents have to buy for the childrens and ,9
1663," the child does not become his wish it will be sad 

childrens do not know how much something is and something cost with five years you start to learn to count at ten ",9
1664, they can not know how much ,19
1665, fourty is therefore they have no feeling for numbers ,19
1666," the person in television said that the price is very good a young children would trust him 

children have ",2
1667, not a lot of money ,18
1668, the can not buy a lot when a five year old child buy something ,20
1669," for ten francs it would have no money left

so ",18
1670, that the advertising in television about children products should be s the parents and not at the young children because the partents better know what is could for their child and they ,13
1671, have enough money to buy something therefore my opinion is that television advertising  should not be allowed,15
1672,nowadays every family has got a television in their house that means that all children have the possibility to turn it on and watch any programm they want between the programms there are advertisments played the whole day through but should it be allowed to advertise towards children between two and five years in this essay ,14
1673," discuss this question and write my own opinion about this case
it is a psychological ",21
1674, that children are very easy to manipulate the companies make use of this found they try to convince children that they should ,2
1675," have a certain toy in their home when a small child watches an advertisment in the television where another children smile and are happy to play with a toy that a company advertises they suddenly long for this toy and ask their parents to buy it
unfortunately not all parents have the financial capacity to buy everything their child would like to own these parents may try to deny the request of their children but they dont always succeed this leads not disappointment of the toddlers and they might beginn to not like their parents anymore because they dont get everything they ask for
on the other ",9
1676, the adverstisment is the best way to raise the profit of a company without advertisment and the people who buy the product the green numbers that a company writes wouldnt be ,11
1677," high that means it depends on the amount of people who watch an advertisment if the company profits or not
to resume there are to possible ways to look at the advertisment  from the sight of the customers in this case parents who are not always able to buy everything that their child sees in an adverstisment and from the sight of the company for which is the advertisment one of the main resource of marketing and profit
in my opinion the advertisments for children between two and five years should be banned from the television if i were a parent and my child would ask for every toy it has seen in the commercials i wouldnt be very happy about it for ",14
1678, much money to buy every single toy and for ,20
1679, my child has to learn that it doesnt need everything what it sees in the television,17
1680,"should television advertising  be allowed

television ads towards young chilred meaning children aged  are mostly made by companies who produce and sell food toys or clothing they are often very colorful and lively to attract kids and make them want to own the advertised products but should these commercials even be allowed

a big part of the income of a company relies on their advertising since this is what is supposed to attract new costumers and give them the feeling of having to buy a specific article so for a company that specialises on childrens products it would be fatal if these kinds of ads were no longer allowed 

also many young children enjoy whatching ads ",14
1681," they cant tell the difference between ads and tv programmes so television ads dont really bother them in any particular way 

but ",14
1682, children shouldnt watch too much television anyways ,17
1683," it is damaging to their brains and it causes them to lose the ability to entertain themselves instead they just sit in front of a tv all day long and stare just consuming whatever they see so if there are more and more ads  them they will watch even more tv

another ",14
1684," is that young children will immediately want the things that are advertised on television and they will bother their parents with it all day long so many parents have to deal with their unsatisfied kids and this can cause stress and in some cases even anxiety

also children dont even need that many new things they should learn to be satisfied with what they have children in other countries are lucky if theyve got one single toy and they never wish for anything else and a hundred years from now the kids didnt have a tv or that many toys they were just entertaining themselves and had ",17
1685, much fun doing it so our generations kids shouldnt be presented with that many new things to buy every single day because ,20
1686," theyll just want to get the newest and best things available at the moment and they will never learn to truly appreciate what they have

so i believe that television advertising  shouldnt be fully forbidden but it should be limited to a certain amount of time per day ",15
1687," that kids these days dont get flooded with all the new information and that they can learn to appreciate what they have in life

",8
1688,"nowadays many children are allowed to watch television once twice or more often a day television advertisings are advers mostly visual and auditive do children understand advertisements in the television and do they have an effect on them this essay evaluates if television advertising directet  aged  should be allowed or not

firstly children in the age of  have not a huge television consume during the day ",14
1689, as in the evening or at night in addition on chanels which are created ,18
1690, for children there are only adverts for children presented and none for adults in ,16
1691, that most children are allowed to watch one or two episodes of their favorite children serie ,6
1692, they do not see any advertisements ,11
1693," adverts  are not really effective and a loss for the company who set up the adverts

on the other ",11
1694," it is proved that children love to spend their spare time  and children have a lot of it  in front of the television but for the kids it is often prohibited from their parents to watch too much or too long television outstanding children realize much more than adults think in the modern time the kids are earlier in understanding things than the todays adults were

overall television advertising  can be allowed but if they let the companys make a profit is unclear question in the ",14
1695, of view form the parents ,8
1696, they should be prohibited because their kids can be affected from the adverts and it could be difficulte to make the kids understand that they can not get the things from the television everytime,13
1697,television advertising is often designed directly for children the directors of the advertising know exactly what children like and how they have to present their product ,0
1698, children want to have them young children are very naive and they cant tell very well if somethings right or false because of that ,4
1699, its very easy to manipulate young children and force them to want that product when they ,2
1700, get this toy or whatever from the advertising and recognize that it isnt as pleasureable as shown in the advertising theyre not very happy with it for example a little boy sees a lego police car in an advertising it drives around in a city with other cars and houses and the light on the roof flashes in red and blue of course the little boy is very excited and wants to have that toy when he ,20
1701," gets it he builds it together and recognizes that a police car without flashing lights lost and alone on the carpet in his oom without any houses or other cars isnt that exciting
allthough ",18
1702, that this kind of television advertising shouldnt be forbidden its the parents quest to ,13
1703,"it goes without saying that children are a lot easier to influence with television advertising than adults but this does not necesseraly mean anything bad

one ",14
1704, that a supporter of this statement might bring up is that children will be influenced to wanting something which is not particulary good for them while on the surface this looks true if we think about it the ,7
1705, is actually not such a solid one why is that because there will always be a parent who watches over the kid this adult can and should be able to explain to the little ones why they may not have this certain thing moreover it is ,12
1706, not nice to forbid young children from watching television adverts because a numerous amount of children enjoy watching adverts from their favourite toys it might seem odd for us grownups now but i ,13
1707, enjoyed watching the advertisment of the newest buildset from lego or whatever product it might be and ,20
1708, im not the only one with that opinion one question that im asking myself ,19
1709," i read this statement is how the advertisment specifically s children would be bad the companies who pay for the advertisments on television most certainly wouldnt want their advertisment about the newest beer brand to be played on the disney channel at four oclock

to conclude would i say that this is a really conservative and overprotective thing to do whilst these are just some of the reasons why ",13
1710, this regulation should not be a thing there are certainly many more ,12
1711, television advertising is not a bad thing but its a problem for little children because they are easily convinced if they see an advertisement they would love to have that thing and its difficult for the parents if they are in a store with them and doent want to buy toys but ,14
1712, thats a problem for any parent because of the big and coulourfull packages with advertisement on them this even happens to parents with children who doent watch tv so television is not the main reason ,17
1713," sort of behavior if the society thinks thats a problem al sort of advertising directly toward young children should be forbidden
its the parents resonsibility that there children doent watch to much television a child between two and fife should not watch more than half an houre a day in my opinien in that short amount of time they normaly doent watch to much advertisement from that ",14
1714," personaly that the television advertisement is  
",11
1715," advertisent on tv towards children is not good but its the wrong way not to allow it 


",13
1716,in the following iâ´m going to explain the ,21
1717," supporting and against the aforesaid these

one ",21
1718, to support the television adverstising toward young children is that they learn to how to threat the modern technic it is an ,17
1719, because in the world nowadays hightech plays an important rule in every branche for example they see a teddy in an advertisement and connect the tv as something positive ,23
1720," maybe they want to learn later on how an tv works and this can be an whelthy experience in the learn progress during the life

in contrast to this it is not necessary for young children to live an life with much technic this comes automaticly ",17
1721, they grow up and get informatic lessons at school or somewhere else in this ,24
1722, years of a life children donâ´t need to come in contact with the modern technic it is better ,8
1723, they learn to improve their motorical skills and speaking skills this can be achive with the modern technic there are ,8
1724, many apps and widgets for tablets and smartphones with the goal to get the childrens attention but another important part of the growingup  is to know how the reality works and donâ´t waste ,8
1725," much time in front of an tv

to sum up my opinion itâ´s good ",6
1726, children have interest on the modern technic which is an effect of the advertising but it is not necessary to advertise for children in this age because they maybe do not understand the advertisement  ,0
1727,the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is very controvers every person who live in today can imagine a situation like a little child sits infront of a big television and looks at small animated pets more and more children look often television as consequenz they are confronted with more and more advertising in television this is childish advertising ,13
1728," a way to influence the children and theire parents if some child sees a nice toy it will go to the parents and wants to have this new toy
to speak for the advertising advertising is just a form of market ",0
1729," that it is normal and if parents dont want that theire children look at advertising they have to forbit television for theire children also the children are confronted with advertising in all of theire rooms where they are in contact with newspaper oder radio
a ",14
1730, against the advertising in children television it con be said that yooug children con not difference between real and not real news or in this case advertising furthermore children do not can buy something ,14
1731," that the advertising is more added to the parents of the children who look television 
but ",14
1732, children in age of  do not have to look much television and with this the advertising children have to go outside and play with other children in the same age in addision to this ,14
1733," children do not learn to challenge with differences with other children because they are not together
to sum up young children are today confronted in much areas of theire live with advertising ",7
1734, they have to challenge with advertising but ,11
1735, children who are aged two to six are not able to challenge this so ,12
1736, that the advertising be controlled for children they have to learn that they have to challenge with it but they ,13
1737, be satisfied by theire parents because children have to be putside and play with other children in this case the parents challenged two problems in one ,8
1738, the children dont look taht much advertising and the children are more outside,24
1739,the 21 century a time where technology controlls the world and the people living in it a time ,23
1740, a five years old girl or boy gets an ipad as a gift for birthday and children get mobile phones a tthe age of eight so should we support this developpment and take it even ,12
1741," to even younger children if not television advertising must be illegal directed to children at the age 

television advertising should not be allowed to children  because they cant decide by themselves what they are watching and by what sources they are influenced 

in this time where technologies are everywhere and everyone uses them why should it be illegal to advertise it to very young childdren we should throw away the thought of a childhood ",14
1742, playing outside in the forest or on the street were the things to do during the freetime things change people change ,1
1743," the childhood does our thinking of a good childhood is the wrong thought we should accept it and get along with it that leads to why it should be legal advertising 

mobile phones and ipads rule the childhood of the kids today it starts at the age of 9 maybe some yearse arlier or later the question is do we want to support this developpment and in some years everyone from the age of five has a phone noa future like this would be awful the talking skills decrease and people get even more isolated 

to conclude im totally against advertising  the developpment of the childhood drom mine to the ones now is bad seing all the kids with phone at an age ",13
1744, i didnt even thought of mobile phones is bad and we should do something against it  ,23
1745,"television advertising  aged  should be not allowed 
this statement is very interesting ",15
1746, relevant for the future of tv advertising ,10
1747," lets discuss the pros and cons about it 
firstly young children could grow up in the wrong environment whenn they gets in connection with tv and advertising in that young age 
when they always watch tv and see the advertising that looks good for them they want to have whatever they want to sell them so they learn early that they have to get the latest products on the market and always have to cosum more and more this way of thinking could stay ",14
1748," thats just for the companys to let the people buying more products because the people will never stop they learned it like that
but in the other ",23
1749, children in the age of  might not remember much ,24
1750," they might forget about what tv wanted to show them 
in this age you normally just started remembering things because your brain starts working but not more than the relevant events that means such memories like the tv advertising could be easily forgotten again and children will not remember it later
however it is ",14
1751," because their brain just started working that the easily learn to trust advertising 
a lot of advertising is wrong like ",11
1752," they told you its the best phone in the world or with this washing product you clothes get soft as a fluffy dog 
so ",23
1753," they learn by a young age to trust the advertising they will never anymore change their opinion and this is what the advertising is for to make people think their product is the best in the world and they need to have it 
even ",2
1754, advertising for young children most of the advertising the young children will not understand because its for older people or they dont know what it is ,16
1755, they have no idea of it and are just not interested ,3
1756, wrong to have a lot of advertising in tv ,15
1757, the young children will not understand it ,12
1758,"
furhtermore their parents will â´watch normally with them togheter television ",1
1759, they will look what their childrens are allowed to see and what not normally if theres advertising you ,16
1760, dont watch it but change the channel ,18
1761," that theres no way that children can see it
in my opinion there should be not much advertising that is s young children but i ",16
1762, would not let my own children ,9
1763," have some watch a lot tv 
",1
1764,we all remember  those toyadverts from our childhood in which theres a child running around in a toystore and picking up all the toys he or she desired and secretleywe all wished that that could be us and ,20
1765," got the chance to make a wishlist for an upcoming birthday or christmas we wrote down all the cool stuff we had seen on television
but is it good for a child to want all those things

what an advert of a toy shows you is just latest version of their product then they advertise it in such a way that kids believe its bigger and better take barbie for an example actually it is alway the same doll ust fressed differently and put in different clothing immediately all the little girls sitting at home watching some kids show want to own her and theadverts are smart they make sure that it seems to be a totally new thing and is nothing like the previous version and it is not just barbie all the bigger toy brands do this 

when a birthday or christmas come up and you ask a child what do want me to get you they can immediately give you a whole list of toys they want to have this way you will never end up buying something the child might not like and ",20
1766," you walk into the store they make sure that the toys that have been advertised a lot are placed in a spot where no one could possible miss it this makes shopping for toys much easier for everyone involved

maybe advertising ",20
1767, many toys and products for young children makes them become gready they will alway be able to see that a new toy or model had been released but speaking as one of those children who grew up watching all those adverts i know that they dont do that much harm they might make me want to have new toys but ,2
1768, itis the parents choice to buy it or not i ,9
1769," believe that it helps you to learn that you cant everything you want from a very young age on 

in my opinion television advertising directed  should not be forbidden young kids will grow up too and learn not to believe everything they see or hear and they will learn that you dont need the latest toy to have fun and be happy 
           
 ",0
1770," you have a tv a part of your life and almost evreywhere
but should even young children be targeted by television already at the age of 
well at ",17
1771, it must be said that the channel itself has the right to show anything they want ,15
1772," people who dont want their children to see advertisments can decide themselves whether they want to switch the channel
",14
1773," it can help young childen develloping interest if they see things they like and they can start up their own opinion
but theres ",8
1774," many reasons it shouldnt be legal
children at a young age arent independent and get influenced very fast ",12
1775," they think about the things they will see in the advertisment but only want to have them
",11
1776," this the parents have to tell them that they cant have the things because they dont really need them which the children wont understand putting the parents under a big pressure
",9
1777, that it shouldnt be allowed to direct ads to small children because they get influenced way too fast and ,13
1778," set their parents under pressure to buy them things they dont need


",9
1779,"should television advertising  be allowed 
this is a really discussable topic with many different opinions

",15
1780, in generel advertisment is just a marketing strategy to influence or force people to buy something you can influence young children very well and ,0
1781, this is a problem children live ,12
1782," they are youngunder extrem high society pressure and the advertisments often lie or show these young children things they cant have besides the parents cant afford the things their children would like to have and think they are bad parents  
moreover advertisments can show the young children new things and in their following life they see advertisments everywhere and every time 

all in all you can say that advertising toward young children can leed to society pressure but you cant hide the children from advertisments because advertisment is a part of our material society",16
1783," add that it is really difficult to say to what age advertisments should not be allowed
    ",16
1784,as a child i enjoyed to watch television the moving pictures realy atteched me ,6
1785," it was just a annoying advertisment but should those advertisments be allowed for children

first of all you have to say that it wont matter if the advertisment is directed to a child or to an adult if a child want something it saw in the television it has to ask his parents who will say yes or no anyway some people will say that this advertisments are used like propaganda but shouldnt they ask themself if the advertisments for adults are the same in addition those advertisments for children are most of the time very colourful and creative so if a child watch this advertisment and tell his friends what he saw they will make a fun game out of this ",16
1786," you can say that this advertisments will teach the cild creativity neithertheless you have to say that the desire for the thing the child wants could cause trouble in the family the child could get angry and uncontrolled and destroy things in the room this is a common problem for parents who cant control their children anyway 

as a result i would say that it shouldnt be not allowed for advertisments to use the young generation as the person they want to get to buy the things they produced after all the parents will choose and not he child ",0
1787, advertisment industrie should ask themself if they talk to the right people ,11
1788, withe this statement it isnt good for the young children to do such things because the have to discover the world and play with other children it is important that thys young people can see many things on the world so the can have there one live it cant bee good to seat infront of the television the howl day ,17
1789, it is the answer whey ,18
1790," many peoble habe a glasses the scream of the electrony things isnt good for the eyes ant the body on the television you see many fiction things that cant bee real in the world we live 

children should play with other children therer can be a conflict and they must find a answer for the problem in real situation the children must find one answer to problems ",17
1791, they cray or say something ,3
1792," they are hungry on the tv are satch situation dont showed to thechildren the people on the tv live in a ficten world there are offenshoerd problems witch arent important in ouer live but the real problems arent showen 

it is alsow important that children learn things from older people the television schowed many things but we dont realy now if this things are right the young children should learn things from the parents and they have to go to school ",17
1793," the chan learn thing that are importent for example write read and other things the can learn in the school 

for me there are many reacens whey children sholudnt do that it is important that the parents say that to the children ",8
1794," they have tolearn the right things in the age of 25 the children dont now what in right and what is wrong so the parents and other people of the familie like the older sister or brother can help the young children to finde the right way and the right answer this is my opinian 




",7
1795,"children should not be allowed to watch televiosion 



sorry for not writing anything i dont know what happend but i started panicking ",17
1796,in our society technology brings big dvantaged on daily bases but unfortunately there are ,23
1797," many problems one of the most discussed one is the influence on our children
on one ",7
1798, every television serie has the right of free speach there are certain themes they cant speak about or show us but thats very rare but they never would have this kind of stuff in series for young children also its the parents decision to let their kids watch a tv serie or tv ,6
1799," to cosider that these special series for young kids could help them developing certain skills if the producer direct the series at them they might be really happy and inspired by the stories and pictures they see
on the other ",6
1800," is it possible that our little boys and girls get manipulated by economic interests with comercials and series
in my opinion its a chance and a risk but if i would be a father id have to take the decision myselve if my children watch a serie or not and i like to make this decision my selve ",17
1801, to  let this statement be regulated by law,21
1802,"should television advertising not be allowed for children in the age of 
a main ",13
1803, against this restriction is that young children could learn to ignore and get immun to those ads because theyre watching them ,13
1804, their early years and know how to dont get influenced by it on the other ,7
1805, strong that those children dont think for their own anymore because they dont have to think they get leaded by those advertisements which shampoo you should buy to fix your hair or that you really need to buy this pretty barbie doll those advertisements ,7
1806," try to use tricks to let the products look cheap but actually theyre not and if you watch those ads as a young kid they could lose the awareness to see those tricks 
if young children watch tv ads it could change their view at the world at some time replaceable things could be more important than the actual important things

",0
1807, tv ads should be forbidden for children in the age of  because you just dont know what effect its going to have later adults who cant think by themselves will probably bring major problems to the world ,13
1808,televison advertising is a often discussed topic especially young children become influenced by the advertising which can become a problem ,14
1809, they get older but is that an ,19
1810," to forbit advertising  children on television

first of all it has to be mention that the advertising for children often is very unrealistic because of this the children get a wrong bild of the world and learn things which arent right
but in case of this it must be said that it isnt important which advertising the children see in television they get influenced by each one even if they watch tv and see advertising which is for adults in most cases this is more bad for them than see things which are ",14
1811," made for them
an importatant ",23
1812, for advertising to children is that the partents have to control the consum of their kids ,16
1813," they have to pay attention to the programm watched by their kids and forbit it if it is not godd for them in their opinion

in my opinion all these ",17
1814, are why it would make no sense to not allow television advertising  its in the ,15
1815, of the parents which programm their children watch and ,6
1816, they have to take controll of how much their kids consum and get influenced of advertising ,2
1817,"day for day humans are constantly influenced by advertisment for a grown up person this seems just normal but how should we handle advertisment s the youngest ones of our society

to start off doesnt it seem unethical trying to use little children to make money this may be true but are little children ",16
1818," theyve seen an advertisment really going to take their money and buy a cool new race car no they are not at the end of the day at the end of the day the parents are the ones to decide and little children at this age usually have no money so television advertisment directly towards little children  could be more seen as an advertisment for their parents and what they could maybe buy for their children 

on the other handy ",2
1819, a small kid sees something it really likes it isnt going to let go from it until his parents buy it for him now we would be at the ,20
1820, saying the advertisment influences the kid who as his ,0
1821, step tries to blackmail his parents to buy him stuff to play with looking at this ,20
1822," wouldnt that just be bad parenting by the father or mother if he or she agrees to every of his little kids wishes yes kids at that age constantly see something new exciting the really want and there may be crying if it doesnt get everything but that is all part of growing up

in my opinion little kids  may be influenced a lot by television advertisment but at the end it is ",2
1823, its parents who are going to take the decision wether to buy  something or not so ,9
1824," television advertisments fit to the age of the child and include no sexual content etc advertisment is totally okay 

  

",14
1825,"today there are lots of televison advertising  different targetgroups should be television advertising  allowed in this essay we will give an answer
   concerns need advertising to sell their products if they couldnâ´t sell their products they wonâ´t make other product for children and havenâ´t money for those people work in this concern so at least the concern will close and lots of people lose their jobs
in advertising itâ´s never said that children have to buy the product of a concern but with special effects and wrong ",14
1826," they want that children think they need to buy those products 
   fistly the concerns often lieng about their products and these products were shown better and cooler than they are in an advertising in a televison the kids donâ´t see these false ",2
1827, and just see what is cool on the product secondly children havenâ´t money on their own they need money by the parents young children even donâ´t know the meaning behind money they havenâ´t the answer for the question how expensive are 100 or how much cents are 1 another ,2
1828," is they can not understand or find out what is good for their own or what is bad for their healthy they need everytime the opinion by the parents
   at least you can say that it is better to target parents for products for childrens because they can find and think about the negative and positive ",2
1829, of a product who can understand his children better than the parents there are just parents who know what is healthy and good for theri children,2
1830," there should be any legislative attempt towards restricting television advertising towards young children 
the purpose of government is to protect the natural rights of its citizens not to interfere in their lifes those natural rights include the right to life to liberty and property all aiming to give the people a maximum amount of freedom
now obviously a child does not posess the same ability to make choices as adults ",13
1831," placing them under authority is essential to safe adolescence 
this authority ",7
1832," must be a parental one and not one of the state 
it is completly unnecessary to restrict advertising because ",16
1833," growing up parents can do a far better job at restricting influences on kids than the government because they have direct knowledge of their mental state 
normalizing the grabbing of traditional tasks of parents could lead to an increasingly dangerous amount of power concentrated within legislation 

 
",12
1834,"in the following text i will discuss the following statment television advertising  aged  should not be allowed this statement confronts us with an actually theme 

much children in this age watch much tv and plays ",13
1835, games on a computer or tablet but is this good  nowadays it gives much fims and series extra for children in this age some who they learn something and other to have fun the most series want  to tell something to the kids an want that they learn much ,6
1836, they looking the films so they have a good aim the most things children must learn they learn ,6
1837," they have some people arround them and explore something on their own they must amke their own mistakes and experience and not a computerperson who tells them something 
        another ",3
1838," is that children needs much activities and must learn how they can move their bodys correct when they sits in front of the tv and watch series and films the whole day they donâ´t know how they make a thing by theyself
        also they donâ´t build a own creativty or a own meaning based on their experience because they donâ´t have own experience when children have the chance to play in the garden and learn their something about the nature around them itâ´s really much better and niecer for the kids as a television advertising
       on the one ",14
1839, the films want the children to learn something what they need in their future and for the school but ,6
1840, they confront them with unrealistic computercharacters which looks really unreal this is ,19
1841, it gave some nice series for children and not ,6
1842," much like today the maincharacters their were normal animals or real humans which talk to the kids

at the end you can say that it should be not completly not allowed but the children must have the chance to make their own experience and they should not be directed with television advertising every day a little consum is not ",6
1843," the parents vote a good serie 
at the end you can they ",6
1844,"advertising at the tv is a very useful way to speak to the people but can young people children stand against the advertising

at ",14
1845," you have to say that young children should not watch tv to much if a child doesnt watch tv the question of advertising you dont have to ask 
in addition children can find a present for his ",14
1846, christmas it would be eassier for the parents to chose the right present because they know what the child wants ,9
1847," a new car or a new barbie
futhermore the children learn to say no to the things the advertising wants to sold you this knowledge is something they have to learn for their live ",2
1848," why can they learn it aged 
on the other ",8
1849," which are against the advertising at the telivision toward young children 
the children have got many toys with they could play but if they see the advertising they are not proud of their toys anymore the toys on the tv are much better ",14
1850, followed to the main statement you have to say at this topic children want everything it doesnt matter if they have a car or a barbie the toys on the tv shows better ,20
1851," they need a new children dont understand it if they dont get it because they have something at home but the parents cant buy everything which is shown fantastic on the tv and this doesnt understand a child

so ",17
1852, advertising for children between two and five should not be allowed because the prior ,16
1853, if the children a little bit older they can decide which they really need and which not,9
1854,"television advertisement is something completely normal for us however should it be directed  or not
it can influenz the children and change their personality ",14
1855," that they only look at their own needs and dont take other people into consideration they develope a need for everything they see and get selfcentered children shouldnt even watch tv long enough to see these advertisements instead they should play with other kids outside and learn to share and communicate with them 
but some tv programms can be useful if they educate the children and increase their kreativity nonetheless there are advertisements on these channels which might be good for them and the companies who placed these advertisements but it doesnt help the children learn to share and play with other children
in my opinion there shouldnt be television advertising directed  because it only benefits the companies who make money with it these advertisements are only aimed at the money of the parents of the children furthermore the children get the feeling they can have everything they want and dont learn to value money ",14
1856, with this thesis because young children ,8
1857," at an age  are more likely to be caught by an advertisment while theyre watching his or her daily programm which has an educative meaning for the children because it is the age in which they can learn the most and they schould do learn the most the advertisements will lead to a feeling of need which would be connected with a greed the parents where forced by crying or similar to buy a product which the child doesnt want but which it has to have advertisements would manipulate children at all an in peticular at this age 
for example the christmas business the time where all companies can make and want to make the largest profit possible therefore they will make more advertisements and the cycle starts again 
another ",14
1858, is that the time wasted by advertising spots could be filled by educative content like movies series etc ,11
1859," interrupting the childrens programm with manipulative advertisements they could be prepared for life in the long run 
in order ",7
1860, that advertisements in the television programm of children is just a manipulative and somehow criminal way by the companies to gain as much profit as they can out of children the weakest part of our population therefore the government should strictly prohibit something like that  ,13
1861,"televison advertisings towards young children is a discussed theme because it can influence them positive or negative is it necessary to disallow these advertisings to children
the children spent a lot of time in watching television more than ",14
1862, ten years the companys know about this ,23
1863, and try to reach the children in advertisings where they talk directly to the children it can be annoying for the parents ,16
1864, their child wants everything what seems to be attractive in the advertising and ,2
1865," the children want to spend more time in front of the tv 
",17
1866, it is not necessary to disallow advertising towards young children because ,16
1867, they often dont understand what is said there and only see the product ,3
1868, if they make an advert for a car and ,11
1869, the parents should rule the tv consume of their child ,17
1870, it doesnt sees adverts like that all day ,11
1871,"is your child attracted by advertising in the television this is a problem many familys have nowadays and this question is disgusted a lot lately people are arguing if it should be allowed to make avertising for children aged  

from a economic ",14
1872," of view this sector of advertisement will open new doors it is a good sector to invest in because its new and not complitly  used up new companys can be founed and new innovative ideas can be made
furthermore it is ",11
1873," not a bad this for the children because the can develope pretty early a sense of what they really want and what they dont want like this strong personalities will be built 

on the other ",8
1874," the parents are definitly in a bad postition they never can fullfill the amound of wishes their children will have because of the appearece of this advertising sector children want more and more and wont be satisfied if they get it this could be caused by the overfloting of the advertising marked by new products the have to have as two year old according to the advertisement
additionaly the children are practiclly born into a world of consumption and this will take their innocence and childhood away they are overstrained by the amound of this they dont actually need

as a conclusion i suppose that advertising for such young children will make a huge change in society ifen if it is good for the economie of many companys im convinced it has just bad impacts on the children itself their childhood wont be the same if they have to deal with this world of consumption ",2
1875, early in their lives if this stays allowed there are just disatvantages for the children and for their parents too they should be allowed to stay children for a little longer than just for two years ,12
1876,in the past few weeks many people ,19
1877," parents care about one big problem they criticize the use of television advertising  but does this topic really brings this much problems or is it not even bad
on the one ",14
1878, adverts towards young children is a great oppotunity for the concerns the kids have a strong will and the parents want to do them a favor and buy the products but ,16
1879," children can hardly understand what it means to buy something they do not understand what money means if the parents donâ´t have the money or even just do not want to spend it it comes to argues between the parents and their children
another ",9
1880," for the use of advertising toward young children is that they can decide what they want and that they learn fast that there are many toys but they can not have all of them they learn to understand what it means to get something they want to have 
the concerns set themselves on an higher level than the parents if a mother does not want their children to know this toy she has to forbid them to watch tv
furthermore the shops just use the kids surely they know all this ",0
1881," but they just ignore them because they want to sell as many things as possible
to sum up this topic really is a problem on the one ",3
1882, you cand understand the shops that want to make money but ,23
1883, you have the parents that just want to protect their small children and i can totally ,12
1884, with the parents and the statement on the top it can not be respected that the children can see anything ,12
1885, their parents donâ´t want to,9
1886,in the newspaper there was a discussion about television advertising  should not be allowed in my essay ,15
1887," discuss this question
young children aged  should not be allowed to direct television advertising because they dont know anything about television advertising
they are too young and perhaps in advertising there will be shown how little children have to behave on the one ",13
1888, they could learn something but ,19
1889," their parents show their children to behave differently this is the reason why children get confused in some ways if the children look every time this advertising they will behave like it was shown in the advertising
for children aged  it is necessary to interact with their parents because parents have the most influence of their life otherwise they dont learn anything about communication and often the advertising doesnt reach the young children
advertising was created to earn a lot of money that people watching the tv will buy what was shown in the advertising in some way advertising can have a big impact on somebodys life and this isnt positive

in my oppionion ",0
1890, television advertisng  should not be allowed because as i said above they are too young in their ,13
1891," years they have to learn how to behave by their parents televison advertising can have a lot of negative things because most people dont think about it and they do what was said in the advertising
",14
1892, for the television advertising  children aged  is they can learn something about the products they are  in some cases interested to buy or let buy consequently they could choose a game of many others that seems to be the coolest or funiest if they compare the different advertisments thats why kids would be more often settisfying because the parents could buy things the children are want to if they ,0
1893," with their selection 

there are more and stronger ",19
1894, against advertisments for young children one of this is that boys and girls in this age should not be confronted with ,16
1895, much media which would be more if they ,10
1896," must look for a lot of advertisments if they want to have a new doll or something else
the most important ",20
1897, is that kids are not able to handle with advertisments because they don not understand something about trading the reason for this is that kids aged  have not the ability to quote about the advertisment and exspecially about the products because the seller has a big influence to the feelings with this always positive advertisments about the products thats why children want things which are ,2
1898," not even worth to buy 

to summ up this theme ",18
1899, televesion advertising direct toward young children because there are much stronger ,16
1900, against it parents should decide what is worth to buy for their kids ,12
1901,"television advertising toward young children

the statement above doesnt make any sense to me because i have never seen any advertisement produced for children aged  additionaly ",16
1902, that children at that age dont watch advertisement produced for them and understand it by 100 furthermore children aged  shouldnt be watching channels which feature a lot of adverts and most channels for children dont show any adverts ,13
1903, i am concerned even if they understood the advertisements it would be a better idea to show them those advertisements ,16
1904," advertisements  adults which might include adverts for alcohol and cigarettes
so ",11
1905, my essay i cant really ,21
1906, with the statement because i am not informed about tv advertisement ,11
1907, neither about tv advertisement  i ,15
1908," dont know the behaviour of children aged  and how much they already understand if they watch an ad on tv


",0
1909, young children has good and bad sites its important which progam they are watching and what kind of influense this program has it is good ,6
1910, the children watch a television program that prepares them for the school but television that has an bad influense and dont prepare them is not good for them ,17
1911, they watch it too often the parents have to controle the children and what they are watching ,17
1912," that they can protect them towards those programms with such a bad influense
but it doesnt make sense ",23
1913," the parents of these young children dont care about what their children are watching and the producers of these television programs often dont care too cause they only want money
its not important wether the children sometimes watch those series or movies which dont teach them ",17
1914," much like series who prepare them for the elementary school or the complete school in one thing but they shouldnt watch the too often
",6
1915, with this statement because i think that children should have fun and a good childhood television is included in our modern social life and we should allow them to grow up with these things some children are very good in elementary school because they watched such teaching childrenseries like dora or toggolino and some are not ,17
1916, good and too hyperactive because they always watched series like spongebob schwammkopf and only that ,6
1917, that only this fictional cartoon character was they ,18
1918, watch televsion for one hour a day they dont really get much information about that but if they watch very often television they can do bad things with the wrong knowledge also it is important which series or canal they watch because every programm had other content to get the people to watch it would the programms show the children important stuff for the whole life like school knowledge ,17
1919, they would do very good work but with series which only show stupid people who do some activitie like hiting a other person and ,6
1920, laugh about it or something like this ,18
1921," can the children do this at home and dont know its wrong to do that 
i dont really ",12
1922, with this statement because too many factors are to punish this statemant and to much situations which say its good or bad ,21
1923, that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed because kids at the age  are easy to manipulate and the guys who make the advertisement know that so they use or ,13
1924, abuse these young naive kids for their egoistic moneymaking they show tons of advertisement for toys barbies and other stuff during the beloved series of young kids the children ,6
1925, run to mum and dad and cry out for these ,18
1926, important toys its if just at that moment it came into their mind that they really really need the new barbie or the newest lego castle the trick with dumb children is they dont stop crying for these advertised items unless the parent goes imediately to his or her car drives to the ,20
1927," store and buys these bloody useless pieces of garbage
the parents should ",9
1928, throw the television into the rubbish and make their kids stop watching stupid shows they better let the kids play outside breathe fresh healthy air and learn to survive in the cold hard nature they learn much more their life from being in nature ,1
1929," in front of the tv

1930,"television advertisment  should be allowed 
i do nott think that advertisment in tv got that much influence sure they are in an age where they gonna grow up und learn all the things they see but advertisment in tv got strict rules ",15
1931, they can not influence young children in theire political meaning or something like this they are free to grow up with any obstacles advertisment in tv for young children can be something about the latest playmobilething or lego so how should toys influence the grow up of children toys could have a political meaning but strict controling of it prevends that toys with political meaning get on the free market children search some heros where they can copy their behavior advertisment can influence this cognital process but not that much because children do not sit 247 in front of the tvscreen they spend more time with their parentsfriends or someone ,2
1932, they got enough other people who can be their heros advertisment cutted on young children aged  have to be interested for them like any other advertisement for other groups of intrest they can not discuss a toppic which might be controverse in society children in this age  got no idea what is happening in world they focused on theirself they explore their enviroment and try to understand how is physiks working they meet friends learn how feelings felt or how social interaction is working they don not think who is donald trump or something like this it is more interesting how they learned speaking and interacting with other people and advertisement cant influence this behavior if advertisment can influence this behavior ,0
1933, we should think about our standards on tv it cant be possible that advertisment in tv can show how to treat someone badly without any ,15

1941, its not very good but it can help your intelligence ,4

1943, with this statement because with the age of two or three years its not important to look television to train your intelligence you can train your intelligence ,17
1944," with playing some games with cards or something like this it is difficult to abolish the television advertising because you cant test if one makes it or not this is a question for the parents of this children they should decide if its good or not if i would have children in this age i wouldnt allow them to watch television they should play outside or if the weather is bad they should play inside with cards or some plays but not games on the computer or handy because this would have the same effect as if they could watch television
finally i would ",14
1945, with the statement because its not good for your health and the most time in the television you can watch more or less just nonsense and this is not good for your intelligence this helps you nothing the children aged two years wouldnt understand something of what happens they would only watch the pictures and that they can do ,17
1946, with some picturebooks or they draw their own little pictures in our society many children have a handy at the age of ten or younger and they could watch television whenever they want but this is a question of the upbringing of their parents if they wont play something with them or the children havent learnt to play alone the parents would let them watch television but we cant abolish something like this its the bad outcome of our new society but we can abolish it in the nurseries and this we should do the nursery teachers arent there to watch television with the children they are there to look ,17
1947, the children and play with them if we could we should make an initiative to abolish televisions in all nurseries in switzerland or ,17
1948, in other countries but in our age it isnt possible to make something like this we havent the right to do this,12
1949,young people shouldnt watching television because it isnt ,17
1950," good for young people to watch the hole time television the children should go to the outside and to enjoy their life and to play with their friends 
if the young people wathing a documentarie in the television it doesnt matter because they learn something about the world or something about the nature
 but some families dont watching a documenteration because they like to watch cartoon or to watch some movies for a example a roman or a thriller it doesnt help their child to learn about the life or something like else children should read more because thats better for their life and it helps to be better in school as i was a childreen i was playing the hole time outside with my friends and i hadnt time to watch television or playing with a gameboy
to watch television the hole time isnt ",17
1951, good for their future because the most children arent ,12
1952, good in the school if they looked as a children the hole time television to read a book is even better for their future and it helps to understand the world and the nature in some countries in the school the used televisions or computer for their lesson because they tink it is better for the students but to sit the hole time in front of a telivision isnt ,17
1953," good for the eyes of the children 
and the most children are at home and wathing television and now why the schools do this so its okay to watch television but not the hole time and to watch series about the world or something like else

",17
1954, with the following statement because ,21
1955, that children at the age of  are able to understand what the advertisemnet wants to say but they arenâ´t able to really think about it and if itâ´s good or bad they canâ´t have an opinion about that ,13
1956, itâ´s unfair to let products look good to them but they canâ´t know an disagreeing ,3
1957, children at that age believe everything they get to know or see because they arenâ´t able to know it better and as we all know that every advertisemnt is only made to convice the people to buy the product children might only talk about that product ,2
1958, watching it in television  another contra is that if there were people in the advertisement who do kind of strange or dangerous things the children might want to do them ,0
1959, it depends on what kind of advertising the children see if it were an advertisement that teaches the children something it would be okay to do that if the parents have the opinion that thier chuild shouldnâ´t see that advertisement they ,16
1960," can switch off the television 

even ",1
1961, it could be that the advertisement is teaching something goodi ,11
1962, think that it shouldnâ´t be allowed to show advertisements for children that are at the age of  in television because itâ´s not necassary  the children canâ´t buy the product themselves anyway  and there might be some risks,13
1963,"in the following essay i have to answer the question if television advertising shouldnt be allowed  
",15
1964, to the statement because young children are way to manipulative to get advertising directly towards them in my opinion the advertising which are ment to be for the children are too aggressive towards them because they often say that they have to get that thing children dont have the control to say no ,16
1965," things around them like ads repeat they have to need that one thing now or they will be less cooler than others 
a other reason why ",3
1966," they shouldnt be allowed is that many children go to their parents and say that they need it until the parents get sick of them for only want this one thing 
mostly the advertisings are about games and dolls or things like this but often the things are useless and only for consuming i ",2
1967, think that children are too poor to get robbed without knowing it by big companys who only want to make money ,2
1968, their parents buy that things for them ,3
1969, that children shouldnt get advertising but more shows where they can learn something from without any ads between them because it has more perspectives for the young children there are things on the market which are good for children and where they can learn from but mostly they dont get enough advertisings because of all the other hyped things which get more ads in the television ,13
1970,today technology has a big impact on our lives it can influence us in a very powerful way and we are always connected to stay updated and not miss any news families often watch the news on television but ,23
1971, does the television provide us with news but it ,10
1972, offers many other options for ones entertainment,23
1973," tvshows or documentaries due to the everyday use of televisions in homes advertisement is unverzichtbar children watch televison quite frequently nowadays to get attention and be entertained most parents arent concerned about what an influence this device can have on their children but should they

children at a young age are easily influenced by all sort of thingsthey do not know what is right or wrong and are open to new ideas in ",17
1974, it much easier to attract a child with advertisement than an adult children can not protect themselves from the real world parents must take care of their children and shield them from bad things though that is exactly the ,16
1975," it is impossible to protect ones child from everything there is way too much to look out for

with prohibiting television advertising toward young children is a safe way to make sure that the child can buils their own outlook on life without being interrupted by advertisement



",14
1976,almost every childhood was influenced by the sesam street or the teletubies girls usually watched movies like cinderella or barby and boys watched the powerrangers or blues clues during a movie or episode there are advertisments like every television channel does every boy or girl saw the new toys and immeadiatly everyone wanted it clearly this advertisment isnt meant to be for adulat but is it even fair to influence those inncocent children through advertisment in the following text ,14
1977," discuss if televison advertisment  should be allowed

on the one ",15
1978, it should be allowed because children who watch television get influenced anyways by the movies or tv shows ,17
1979," why shouldnt it be allowed to advertise new toys instead of adverstising those new toys hidden in the shows they represent it clearly as an advertisment so the companys are actually giving the child a fair chance of deciding and judging because they can see that this is an advertisment

in addition we have to look at the economic opportunity children have the companys can earn a lot of money by advertising directly  often relatives like the grandparents love make them smile and this can be made through a new toy which children see in advertisments so the children will be happy with their new toy the grandparents because the child is happy and the companys because they earn money everyone wins

also children who watch advertisment in their young ages are later more able to handle advertisments when you are influenced by those early you ",14
1980," leatrn early that some advertisments might be lies or just not always the same as you expect with that knowledge you are prepared for the futurte live so the companies are actually doing good by advertising directly to them

on the other ",11
1981, we have to look at the downside of adversting children ,7
1982," they are young there is a study that states that children who watch television get strongly influenced and get pushed into a gender stereotype the big businesses decided that boys like blue and cars and girls like pink and barbies not hte children on theirselfs especially advertisments targets those stereotypes and influences children 

an other ",14
1983," is that through those advertisments children always have to have the newest toy which sets pressure on the parents or close relatives and on ther children too the only winner will be the toy company becuse they earn and the family looses money

my last ",20
1984," is that children in that age arent able to judge and decide weather this is a trick to influence them or just to show them the newest toys children are innocent and have no chance to defend themself from that advertisments it is simply not fair to influence them in that kidn of direction

all in all there are many ",2
1985, to look at in that discussion but ,21
1986, that we shouldnt allow this or only with regulations ,21
1987," the children have a chance ti decide
 ",9
1988,"today more and more kids watch tv play video games oder do other things on technical devices in their freetime also the young children in the age of  oftne watch tv but is this really good for the children or should they better watch tv if they are older 
in my opinion young children shoukd not watch ",17
1989, much or best no tv because they should use their freetime ,1
1990, they should go outside meet friends talk and play with them today there are a few programms which only shows series for young children  often the series in tv are not important to learn something they tell stories which arenâ´t important for the kids and their future maybe they are bad for them most of the kids usually donâ´t understand this storie because they are too young for understanding themthere are already a lot of television series for young children in which they can learn the number oder the abc but ,6
1991," it would be better if they will learn it in an other way maybe in kindergarten or from their parents or later in school if the children often watch tv they want to watch more and more tv and one time they just wanted to watch tv the whole day they donâ´t have any friends they just sitting in their rooms the wohole day doâ´t get any fresh air an activity today technics are more and more important and the most kids are sitten inside in front of them but this is not good for their body and for their sociality 
so ",17
1992, the young children in the age of  should not watch tv they should do other importanter things in their life which they only can do in the young life to play outside with friends and something like this also in older age people actually should not watch ,17
1993, much tv they sould go work do sports meet friends ore travel and donâ´t show it wrong to the kids,1
1994,the television advertising  aged  years is not good because their are many bad television programms for kids and they can destroy their hole life in the children television today are often series which are not good for kinds on kika are many series that are aged for twelve years some kids make things that they see in the television and thats not good for example some kids will cut their stomach because of the teletabbis another bad thing is that the eyes from young children grow in these years when they often watch television they must wear glasses in young years also it is not good to sit often on the couch and watch television they must go outsite and play football or play playmobil to learn something and to move when they play football or ride a bike they can met friends and have fun together in the age  they cannot understand words ,14
1995," good an they go not to school 
the television advertising  aged  years has not ",24
1996, is that they can learn something in the television maybe they can learn to speak an to understand or the watch some learning series for young children also the children relax ,17
1997," they watch television and they can sleep better 
in my opinion the television advertising s should not be allowed ",10
1998, with this statement the youg children must play something an go outside and not sit every day on the couch an watch television parents should say whats good for their childrens but ,8
1999, its not good for the childrens they often must wear glasses in the age of ten because they have bad eyes ,4
2000, they watch every day television ,6
2001,while you look televison you often see advertising between your program the advertising is about differint things und should influencesequences of that first of all ,10
2002," a young children who is only two years old should not watch tv that often and they  the people to buy the products and to convince them of their new product 
but is it okay if an advertising is  who are between two and five and what could be the problems and coneven shouldnt watch programs with advertisments because there are even programs for children which are without any advertising but ",14
2003," that children are much more easier to influnce than older people who should know what is real or who should know which advertisment they can trust young people always want the products or the toys they see in televison and they believe in everything they see in tv because they canâ´t know that the people who designed this advertisment only want to sell their products as good as they can this methode is only good for the people who desined it or for the people who get their money with this advertising because they maybe get more money because the parents buy the stuff for their children because they donâ´t want that their children are sad 
to conclude ",2
2004, that children should not watch tv that often and ,17
2005, they donâ´t see the advertising but ,11
2006, if you donâ´t allow this advertising because many people get their money with this job and ,11
2007, it is always the decision of the parents if they buy the things to their children everybody can decide on their own because everybody has his own opinon which shuld be accepted,9
2008,the question if television advertising  aged   should be allowed or not is often disscused many parents dont want the television advertising  their children because they have fear that the advertising chance their children and that they want everything which appears in the advertising it might be that they will called names in preschool because they dont have the newest things which are on tv  they ,14
2009, have fear that the advertising leads their children to watch television very often and that they wont meet with friends anymore or do their hobbys other people think that the advertising wont harm the kids and wont chance them because the parents have ,14
2010," the control about the kids 
",7
2011, television advertising s young children aged  isnt neccesary because they are very young and maybe the advertising will form them ,14
2012, unessesary that children watch television and that people in such a young age want everything what they see in the advertising but i ,17
2013, think that it depends on the form of the advertising a memory advertising which they created with a friendly atmosphere ,11
2014, is better than an advertising for a coputer game where you have to kill people ,11

 bad idol
 did a lot of bad things in his life
 many kids take him as an idol


contra

 was a young nice kid
 did nothing bad
 no connection between his kidlife and adultlife
 to take care because he was only a kid and ",18
2016," that he did bad things

to public an advertisment is not easy it could be risc for a lot of people but it could be ",11
2017," a good thing for other peoples noone can make the perfect advertisment for something it will have everytime a guy who doesnt like it at the end of a day all advertisment are good and has sense in my opinion everyone can show them whatevere they want only if its rasicm or hurts other people shoudnt be allowed to public them

a lot of people thing that the tv advvertising  shouldnt be allowed because he did bad things and he will be a bad idol for many other kids who watch the advertising they think it could be dangerous to show them this advertisment maybe the kids want to get like him 

another part of people think it isnt really bad to show them this advertisment because chevalier was young nice kid like every kid in the world actually he didnt do anything bad in his age ",13
2018, why we shouldntt see him on the tv like a 5 years old kid it has no connection between his kidlife and his adultlife people should difference between his life as a teenager and his life as a rich man in switzerland or as a prisoner in venice to show them toward as a child could be maybe a good thing because ,6
2019, the other kids can take care not to get like him evereyone is a good kid but not everybody would be for ever a good person ,7
2020," its not a problem to show them people this advertiment everybody knows that the chevalier get bad but as a child he wasnt really dangerous and why they shouldnt show us him at the end of the day it isnt necessary what he did in his late life

",6
2021,at the newespaper you often read that young children often watch television as often as theire parents do you ,17
2022, with this statement in many familys the kids often watch television ,17
2023," the parents can relaxe or do something that they want and didnt play with the kids

",1
2024, they watch only an half an hour or something like that but ,1
2025, they often watch television they didnt play enough time outside or with friends sometime the television is something you can learn from the parents should give them a timeline ,24
2026, they go to bed the parents didnt watch telesivion ,1
2027, long toobecause the kids think its right what the parents do ,24
2028, its not be allowed the kids demonstrate with this and its often hard to life ,12
2029, the kids are sad or something like that the kids can often be angry ,8
2030, they watch to much television and watch the false series too an other thing is that the kids very sad about it ,6
2031, the parents didnt play with them and only watch television is bad for the parents too its okay ,17
2032, the whole family watch a movie at weekend night ,1
2033, they do something together and its something that the whole family like its ,1
2034, okay to show the kids the news on television because to show whats happend in the world and that the kids learn something about the world ,17
2035, its important to have time with kids and not with the television  at the end the parents say that is okay or notbut ,1
2036," kids watch television but they need a timeline 


",6
2037,the question whether or not televison advertising directetd towards young should be forbidden is a quite controversial one as young children often enough cant voice their own oppinion and there are good ,13
2038, against this would be that the mind of a young child can be influenced way easier than an adult mind what could potentielly lead to big companies showing ads directly targeted at young children ,16
2039, that those stick to that very same company for their rest of ther lives as the memory about this company and how good it presented itself is deeply ingrained into the childs mind leading it to subconsciously preferring the products of a certain company in their adult lives this can be seen ,2
2040," good in the buying behaviour of old people as they often tend stick to a certain brand for the rest of their lifes that they know from their childhood on

another ",23
2041, against this is that children can not actively protect themselves from those advertisements as they often even don not know what they are being shown furthermore most parents can not protect their children from those advertisements aas well as they can not check on theri kids every five minutes ,13
2042, there are even parents who do not controll what their children watch at all showing a ,17
2043," careless attitude

then again there actually are ",3
2044, for advertisemenst being targeted at children because it just can not be avoided that at some ,16
2045, iof its life a child watches an advertisement so the actual question is do we want it to see a child friendly advertisement that will trick them into buying the products of a certain company or do we want advertisements that could be potentielly harmful to a childs mental health causing them to get anxiety certain phobias and ,16
2046," on an example for this would be the advertisement for a particular violent game or something comparable

personally i think that there should not be advertisements directly targeted at children and if ",16
2047, they should not be too influential because ,19
2048, outcome can be bad for a child  ,4
2049,in a shop full of toys a mother and child are looking around the child suddenly rushes over to a shelf were hundreds of the same dolls are lined up neatly it runs to its mother and says mommy mommy look its just like the one i saw on tv yesterday can i have it please please pleeeeease the mother looks up and says ok sweetheart but dont be sorry if it doesnt do the same stuff as it does on tv you know they always oversell these products without listening to her mothers full awnser the girl runs to the counter and gets her new doll when they get home and she openes the box shes clearly dissapointed it doesnt even talklike it did on tv  she exclaimes and ,20
2050," two hours of playing with it its lying broken on the ground so much for good quality merchendise the mother murmurs as she puts it away

this scenaryo happenes more often than you think with kid advertising on tv always more children start only buying things they see in commercials if they get something handmade there disapointed because its not the same as the one they saw on the tellie
 
then again it might ",20
2051," be the case that they start learning at a very youngage not to trust everything that is said on the tv
but ",17
2052," there are always breaks between their tv programms with only advertisements where they cant watch their show so naturally they go wake mommy from her nap to play because theres nothing on tv

on the other ",1
2053," they might learn a lot about new things and words and how to use them
so should it be aloud to make television advertising s young children

i ",14
2054, think it should be forbidden because young kids shouldnt have to deal with advertising besides at a young age children are ,16
2055, they fall for every advertising trick in the book in my mind kids should be able to be kids and enjoy their childhood and not have to think about stuff like advertising and if their toys are good quality or not i say we put a stop to kid advertising,2
2056,the statement  television advertising  should not be allowed is not easily to answer then it is right that young children at that age have to learn much from the natur and from all outside and that the television is not telling the truth but young have ,14
2057, a lots of energy and some adult could not be able to play with their children all the time and some adults have not the time for such a young kidso they are putting their kid in front of a television for some free time themselfsbut now we know that the latest television is too high for a three year old child ,17
2058, there are too much pictures wich appears at one sekund and the young brain could not work with ,24
2059, much so taht the kids could not sleep at night because the brain is ,4
2060, working to overlook all this information that is one ,21
2061, that defeat one of the excuses for sitting their children in front of that thing then ,1
2062, the children could not sleep the adult have much more work to do with them ,1
2063, there are tired too so the parents should teach the childrens early as they could to play on their own like drawing or playing lego or something like that maybe they could invite other kids too but the televions could ,1
2064, show the kid a new fantastic world with fantasy or a childhood hero but ,8
2065, the televison time have a limit like for an four years old child a half hour a day there is ,17
2066, the kid see things like a murderer or something like that ,6
2067," the child getting nightmares 
so my ",18
2068, opinion is that children under five years should not watching television because they have much more opportunitys for their freetime wich all are better than watching tv and getting maybe problems ,17
2069, they want to sleep and if the parents have no time for their child or no friend has time to play with them ,24
2070, the telivision is no option then childrens could do something on there own because at that age are all humans creative ,6
2071,"my statement is about televisoin toward young children is ist bad or not
my oppinion is that it must be allowed because children would watch tv ",17
2072, maybe they go secretly in the livingroom to watch tv and if this is the cause the children would watch television for adults and no program for them the television advertising is  the children with learning programms ,17
2073," the can learn something for a better understanding and knowledge

an ",8
2074, against it could be that the children watch tv oftener as usally and didnt go out to play ,12
2075," with a ball and friends the parents could use it to get the childrens quiet if they will be noisy and loud its a pitty that the television is mostly about witches and stuff that didnt exists

many people say that television make people stupid but if the television is direccted toward children and have an lerning effect i would ",17
2076, to the statement that youg children should not be allowed to watch tv it must ju be ,17
2077,television advertising which is directed  directed to children aged  should not be allowed because the children are not able to understand this adverts because they are just too young to understand maybe if there is an advert for a new game for young children aged up to three or five the children thought that they just have to own this new game because it is new and brillant but if the parents buy this game it is used maybe once or twice because ,13
2078, playing it it can be boring because you know what happens and how it should be used so just the parents of the young children have to decide if they will buy the things or if they will not the children are not able to  decide wether they would have this things which are directed to them in adverts maybe in tv or in magazines because the parents have to decide if the new things are good for their own children or if they could change the children in a bad way if there is any new food in an advert which is pronounced as healthy and good for children only the parents could decide if their children gets it because it could be bad for their children because of an allergic reaction or something else so my opinion for the question if television advertising which is directed  aged  should be allowed or should even not be allowed is that it could give some adverts ,14
2079, aged children but i think that this should be not much because the parents should decide if they would buy it for their children or ,9
2080, they would not buy it for them because it is not good or healthy for children maybe once or twice a day television advertising could be directed  between two and five years because children should not watch television all day because the childhood is just too short to watch television all day children should play outside and went playing with their friends because friends are a very important ,14
2081, you have to use all time you have in life and make it brilliant,18
2082,"the statement if television advertising  should not be allowed is a difficult question because there are some different opinions 
so it is bad that the young children learn to watch tv for a long time on a day and maybe they can not be ",15
2083, concentrate in the future also they should have friends to play with outside and do not sit in the house and watch tv for the whole day in the age between two and five they learn a lot and they should not learn it from the televison because they have to learn it from their parents or there friends or somebody else and not from the tv also it is really realistic that the young children be addicted to watch tv and ,17
2084, they learn it in this age maybe they do nothing else ,24
2085, they are in the age to go to school ,24
2086," they do not learn for the school or do their homework because they come home and start whatching tv and that is not good for their future 

but today there are a lot tv shows that shows something where the children can learn for their future but some tv shows are not good for the children and should only entertain and not tell something for their future 

so i thing it is not the right way that children should watch tv in the age between two and five the whole day but ",17
2087, they do not do that i thing that is okay but it is important that children learn to communicate with other people and not sitting home for the whole day and what the children learn in this time they do their whole life ,24
2088, they do not learn it in another way ,7
2089,children aged  shouldnt watch tv ,17
2090, often because they are in ,19
2091, age of their life at this age they are learning to speak to walk maybe to read and ,24
2092, on television advertising could cancel these exercises the television advertising could support the children to watch tv all day long and they want something from the television advertising toys or somthing else like smartphones but television advertising is ,14
2093, helpful the children can find some thimgs which are useful for speaking walking etc if the parents are poor it could ,8
2094, be that the children can get everything they want this could be helpful for the education of the children because they can concentrate more on things they have to learn it is like in school if children have things they like more ,8
2095, studying or doing homework they will do them mostly ,1
2096, homework etc in my opinion children should be allowed to watch tv and see the television advertising but not ,13
2097, often they should go outside and learn something from the nature and have fun it doesnt need electronical devices every time to be happy but to be honest the most children nowadays dont even now the nature because there sitting all day long in their rooms and play video games,24
2098,mommy daddy pleeeease can i have this every parent knows the struggle as soon as the child spots a cool teddy bear or a new doll in a tv commercial it has to have it this often brings parents in difficult situations they dont want to spoil their kids with new products but often cant handle the following drama ,20
2099, the kid doesnt get what it wants so wouldnt parenting be ,9
2100," much easier if television advertising toward young children werent allowed

a big pro ",13
2101," is the already mentioned situation as soon as a kid sees a new toy in the tv it wants it parenting would be much easier without these commercials because the kid wouldnt even know that these toys exist people that are against this law claim that the kid always sees new toys in preschool in kindergarden there are always other kids with different toys their statement is that the tv commercial doesnt make that much of a difference and shouldnt be forbidden because ot that

an ",13
2102, against this new law is the ,21
2103, that children have to learn to deal with commercials as soon as possible nowadays advertisements are everywhere it is better if the child starts seing them with three and can learn early how to deal with the ,13
2104," that there is an endless amount of toysand that it cant have everything

in conclusion there are many different opinions about this subject and not a simple ",20
2105, the problem is real and a new ,18
2106,"in our day and age it is normal that nearly everyone has at least one television at home but is it essential that young children have to sit in front of the tv nearly every day 
a main ",17
2107, of televisions is that we get to information very easily we can lay on the couch and listen to the news ,10
2108, we dont have to concentrate which is really relaxing ,1
2109, a heavy working day another ,18
2110, is that you can learn something ,21
2111, firstly tvs are often used as a babysitter ,17
2112, a lot of parents sit their children in front of the television and dont look ,17
2113," them by themselves secondly all those gadgets have a bad influence on us espessially on the children because they can get addicted to them it is important that they can play with other children to make friends and that is not possible if the sit nearly the whole day in front of a enormous display 

on the one ",24
2114, in favour they can be a vital factor in deliver us a lot of information on the other ,21
2115, a huge number of negative ,21
2116, like the bad influence on the young children which are not able to controll themselves in my opinion television advertising  should be allowed but the parents should take care ,15
2117, them and look that they dont,3
2118,"these days the biggest topic of our community is money i mean everything runs on money the whole economy runs on money 
and ",23
2119, i have no doubt that they ,19
2120," want to make money with children i mean no wonder where they see a good possibility to make money they take it without any respect of the childrens life and the life of the family they dont even think about it many of them dont think around the corner and just see their goal

and ",3
2121, the makers of the ads between the childrens favourite sopes i mean everyone wants to sell its products ,2
2122, but i guess it its a bit of a mean but in the same time clever tactic to make use of the childrens immaturity with all those plastic toys kids see in the advertising these little poor things sometimes think they live in a lila plastic world and live way beyond the reality instead they get told from some mean moneymakers that they can live a happier and funnier live with their talking plastic dogs or with their new collection of power rangers and in the same time as i remember my childhood these sorts of things were totally funny and i ,20
2123, think that it was somehow sweet that i collected thins and that and my friends did ,18
2124, to and we had a happy time but i was a lucky kid that wasnt influenced ,8
2125, much by the ads as my mom didnt allow me to watch tv that often but nowadays children get spoiled spoiled by the electronical industry parents are somehow naive and let their kid play with their ipad twentyfourseven probably because its easy for them that time the kid sits ,17
2126, the tv or ipad they dont have to take time for their kid what is in my eyes completely irresponsible so its ,1
2127, about the parents who let their children play with their electronics ,20
2128, ipad tv mobile phone etc it ,18
2129," lays in their hands whether their children get in contact with the many ads the moneymakers just take their opporunity

parents should be confronted more with the good ",2
2130, of not letting their children watch tv that often i guess many children would become much more social creative and more ready for life ,17
2131," they can joy the beauties of life outside in nature where they learn to play with that what nature offers them and where they learn to 

so as you may see ",8
2132,"in my opinion there are different reasons to say that television advertising  should be allowed or not be allowed
on ",15
2133," is that the children in that age wonâ´t buy things without their parents knowledge the parents know better than the children what is right and what is wrong and wonâ´t buy the things from the advertising if they are not worth it 
another ",2
2134, that television advertising should be allowed is that children in that age donâ´t watch much advertising they feel bored very fast and will switch the programm ,13
2135," there is advertising so there is no reason why it should be forbidden because they donâ´t get to watch the advertising

on the other ",15
2136," many reasons why it should not be allowed
children in the age of  donâ´t have an own opinion they are influenced very fast by media people or television advertising children can not understand that an object of the advertising is not that good in real life how it is descriped in the advertising they donâ´t know that the advertising shows an idealised picture of the product and want to have it ",2
2137," it is not that good in the reality
as well children havenâ´t got ",4
2138, much money they only have their pocket money and the money that them was given but children donâ´t own their own money because they donâ´t work so it is not fair to let them buy the things of the advertising because the children should not spend all of their money children should rest money for the future the kids will be disappointed if they buy an object and it isnâ´t ,2
2139," how it is descriped and they will regret that they bought it 

all in one you can say that there are more reasons why television adverting should not be allowed the children are to small to understand the sence of television advertising",13
2140,"nowadays advertisments on technological devices are getting more and more habitual for instance television programmes are regularely interrupted to add a new product or the latest magazines this essay is intented to give pros and cons about children who participate in an advertsimnent what is undoubtfully a moving question

to begin with the privacy of a young person who cannot make decisions on his own is published by a performance on tv despite a refuse of the children the parents can arrange an advertisment

another factor to be considered is that an intensive and demanding work in a tv stuio may be too exhausting ",14
2141," as not to feel comfortable producing and creating an advertisment is a long process which is why the children cannot bring neither enough motivation nor any experinece 

on the other ",0
2142," advertisments can bring valuable money new connections and important experiences to start with a show career an early start is as useful as habitual training therefore there are just a few grandparents who can show their future children a tv advertisment of them

last but not least tv performances or other participations is fun for most of the young children and bring a new experience ",0
2143," widen their horizons

all in all advertisments wit young children bring more ",0
2144," a new experience and a day with professional producers puts an exhausting and too demanding work into the shadow 
i am of the opinion that these young advertisment stars should keep going and that there is no deciding factor to  prohibit to build up a new generation of tv stars",10
2145,"in my opinion there are no problems about the statement below
on the one ",21
2146," i can understand that some humens are not okay whit that but i think it is a normal procces in the new modern world
so one say that it would be bad for the kids and they have problems in their social life
the kids have no friends because of the television consum they have
but in our modern world whit ",17
2147," much war and political statements i think it is our oppotunity to informate the young humens
so i think that television is not oly bad ",17
2148, it used safely also it is a normal rising process to watch tv and play video games on playstations i dont know even one child who doesnt do this in their childhood and that they dont get freinds is a not truth ,17
2149, because every kid do this and every kid get ,24
2150," are friends
es ist ja nicht  ",18
2151, that the kids are every day in the house and watches all day long tv and play video games the school or kindergarten is there a very important ,8
2152," because the cildren can talk there to ech other and can social contacts knã¼pfen
in my opinion it should give more high quality information sources ",23
2153," in the internt were these children can learn and have fun
",8
2154, the children should have there fun and learn by themselves to the end i can say that it shouldnt be forbidden but it should be verantwortungsbewusst used   ,12
2155,"televison advertising  children in the age  is a general topip wich should be discuss
the question is if should not be allowed or if it is okay to confront young children witch this kind of advertisig

for the ",14
2156, it is important to say that ,21
2157," children should not spend time with televison they should go outside and get their cognitive skills 
on the one ",17
2158," it does not care if advertising  because they don not have the age to decide what to buy they need the go from their parents 
on the other ",16
2159," they could be influenced for the future the struggle is that nobody can control what kind of andvertising dirceted to these children 
another ",7
2160," against advertising for the little is that they could see something what they could not get for example because of the money condition of the family this could be not good for the selfconfidence of the children it is a big disatvantage to show children in young age how important material thinks are

",0
2161, televison advertising for young peole should be not allowed on reason ,13
2162," is that in my eyes it is unimportant for the industrie things for those kids could directed to the parents maybe 
another reason ist that young people do not need any kind of advertising they are not in the age to know what is important for them they would just begin to thikk about material things  
  
",0
2163,"should television advertising  be forbidden or hould it be allowed
in general young children are learning at every time of the day they get visiual informations about all what they are doing and what they see and hear specific television concepts could be useful to teach the children important things like counting reading colors or something like that also in the social sector it can be useful on this way parents could be helped by rasing the children without specific studies about the topic over a long time nobody is allowed to write a paragraph saying that it is forbidden to let children watch televisison children are just in a process where the way of getting visiual informations is important if the children watch television much time a day or week they get the feeling that they always have to be entertaint and maybe they will get problems to concentrate in situation they have to or get less focus on them so they do not learn to be creative themselfs also they do not get children experiences like beeing outside and learning by seeing something new it ",14
2164," could by critical for the childrens healthy people who spending most of their free time in watching television would not do hobbies sports or investigate in social contacts they might be fat and social isolateted 
all in all i think that it is not important to watch tv in this age and they have to learn by experiences and do not have to count or write things like that working without that in this time where all works with computers it is important that by seperate using this things for a better life and making this things to our life and this should happen by rasing children but i ",17
2165, think that it is unrealistic to forbid duch a maual thing noone could proove it and a liberal country like our is parents are selfconfident to raise their children with own methods ,12
2166, the children do not get physicl hurtness or something like that ,4
2167,nowadays if you watch television it offen happens that you come across an advertising s kids ,14
2168," these ads shouldnt be allowed

first they could be annoying for some grown up people and ",16
2169," the television belongs primarely to them kids should be playing outside have fun and eventually do homeworks they shouldnt watch tv all day long thats why it is unnacessary to run commercials directed to little children

second its no secret that ads make people  want buying more things that is their purpose grownup people can ignore this strategy little children ",14
2170," cant they want to buy nearly everything they see in the tv no wonder that kids are being spoilt nowadays because their parents want them to have a good childhood and buy their children everything they wish for they need to understand that working is an important thing in their life and that unfortunately money doesnt just grow on trees

third a big part of the commercials are food ads they advertise all kinds of foods containing sugar and other harmful chemicals kids need to learn in their young ages that a lot of fat and sugar are not good for their health if they watch plenty of ads in which other kids seem to have fun ",2
2171, eating unhealthy food theyll think it could ,4
2172," be a good thing for them

i can understand that it isnt possible to permit the kids watching television but we need to teach children in their young ages to be healthy and to handle their money well they ",17
2173, shouldnt buy everything they see their parents work hard for the money ,9
2174,the statement that television advertisments which are s young children shouldnt be allowed is a ,13
2175, stupid statement these advertisments arent in any way bad for them lets look at a playdough advertisment in this kind of advertisments there are just children playing with dough and having fun or ,16
2176," an advertisment for playmobil or lego these advertisments are meant for kids and they dont do anything bad for them there are just kids playing with things a barbie advertisment is a kid palying with barbies does that could really do anything bad for them could that actually be harm for young children for example an advertisment for toysrus is s children they do not put anything sexually or harmfull things in these advertisments
on the other ",16
2177, these advertisments show a specific gender playing with a specific toy do you ever see a boy playing with a barbie or a toykitchen no because the advertisments show that it is supposed to be for girls and not for boys and the toy hotwheels or lego is supposed to be for boys but why i once read a story about a little boy having his mother buy him a pink stroller he was very happy with it and ran around with the stroller through his neighborhood when one woman came up to his mother and asked why she would let him play with a girls toy and this is a problem through these advertisments we show boys that they cannot play with barbies or anything pink and we show girls that lego or colours like blue arent for them so ,20
2178," than saying they shouldnt be allowed you should change these advertisments in some way
in my opinion we should let boys and girls just play with what they want pushing genderroles onto them is like telling them what they cannot do or be or saying what they are supposed to do or be do we really want to tell children that playing with a stroller if you are a boy or playing with a racing car if you are a girl is bad ",16
2179, we should just let them wear and play with what they want and that these advertisments are just pushing girls and boys into a specific genderrole which they maybe dont even want to be in banning them isnt helping anyone but changing them showing that boys can play with a toykitchen and girls building a legohouse is way better it would show kids that know that they dont want to play with any toy for their gender that they can play with or wear whatever they want which is just the reality    ,16
2180,"the statementtelevision advertising  aged  should not be allowed is a dificult theme for the childrens and for the parents an advertising with the television is a good option which every body could see but should it be allowed for young childrens
first you have to say that television advertising  is a reason for the them to watch more television or play some games in the internet because they recognize that somebody directly talk to them they  will sit more inside in the house and maybe dont go outside and play with some friends in there age you ",14
2181, have to say that television advertising toward young children is a trick against the parents when young children see something new or something they would love to have they may go to the parents and ask directly pls buy this or these ,14
2182, but you have to say that televison advertising toward young children ,14
2183, have good reasons with the television you could talk to everyone all over the world for example ,10
2184, you see something in england in the television you can order it ,18
2185, you are back in your home country as a parent you dont have to run from shop to shop to see the new things for the young children you see it in the television and ,9
2186," you will order it via internet 
you could say that television advertising toward young children is good for the childrens but not for the parents  ",16
2187,"children seeing adverts for toytanks in the tv and want to have this many parents are shocked about this and the call to ban advertising for young children from the screen gets louder
in our time media is an really important thing of the lifes of many children in the world
so you have to think about how to bring media in a healthy way to them 
and there the controverses begin on the one ",14
2188, there are the parents who see toys adverts in the tv and think this is horrible ,2
2189," there is the industry which wants sell things
there you can see this group of consuments is very important for the economy and yes itâ´s the future because ",23
2190," they are grown up they buy things and with the advertising you as a company can manage which products they will buy in their later life
no one wants children to play with tanks and going to think war is a good a normal thing but there you can say there is much more other advertising on the sreen than for tanks ",0
2191, why is this not good the children get to know the latest toys outside there and can wish them from there parents ,20
2192," for birthday and the parents know what their cildren want and can buy the best the latest toys
but there ist a problem with this children canâ´t reflect and know the intention of the adverts this is whatâ´s dangerous the child only sees this wonderful thing on the tv but does not know the industry wants to sell things children are manipulated and they are going to think itâ´s good what others tell and show you this would have ",20
2193," for their later life they do not reflect and canâ´t see the real intentions behind
so looking on the different sites my ",3
2194, of view on this topic is real clear ithink advertsing for children and ,16
2195, for the youngest should be banned from the screen itâ´s not good for them,12
2196,our society uses television a lot you rarely find a household where there isnt a tv and we are ,17
2197, surrounded by advertising daily one way to bring people things near is to place the product in breaks of tv shows almost every show is seperated in different parts and you can have 10 minutes of advertising till you can carry on watching some of these advertising may not be for children they could not deal with some of the pictuers of the advertisement but we have different channels for different ages we have disneychannel for kids or some channels where you can only watch crimes thrillers or documentaries ,0
2198, we have to keep an eye on what kind of advertisement is shown on which cannels but my opinion is that we cant keep television advertising away from young children completly if its no bad content it wont be bad for the children my view is that all the television advertising for young children are ,14
2199, for the parents to get them to buy the products for their children the statement television advertising  should not be allowed  is a little over the top children get to see advertisements for their age anyway because there are more mediums than tv they could ,13
2200, see that in magazines on posters in front of the shoppingcentre or on the phone of their parents so its useless to forbit television advertising for kids but we chould check their content and design,0
2201,"this essay is about the statement television adversiting directed towad young children should not be allowed 
in my opinions it is a statement which has a lot of positiv and negativ ",13
2202, the people who put the advertisings into the televison are doing this to sell their products were living in a capitalistic system ,10
2203, everyone tries to get money it does not really matter if they try to sell it to little childs or old people but its not fair that theyre using manipulation in the television its easier to manipulate the young children and theyre abusing this they know that the children will try everything to get the products in the television and they know that a lot of partens will not say no to the whishes of their children so they ,14
2204, manipulate the parents of them theyre right and wrong ,7
2205, right because they just want to make money and sell their products ,23
2206, wrong because they use young children ,12
2207, my older sister has three children and i know how it is if they want something they have seen in the television theyre crying to get it and its not easy to say no like with older children they ,9
2208, put children in their advertising which are laughing and having fun so the children who watched the advertising think that theyll have a lot of fun too but ,0
2209, four days theyre not playing with the toys anymore if someone would forbid this advertsings it would not easy anymore for them ,20
2210, sell their products but its better for the children and for the partens who cant buy new products all the time they should forbid the advertisings in the channels which are specially for children like disney channel and cartoon network but ,16
2211, nobody would see the products and buy it and ,23
2212, the channels would not make money anymore because its the main source of money for them and if they dont have money anymore they need to shut down the channel and ,10
2213, that the children would more cry if they can not watch cartoons  ,6
2214, with the statement the channels need the advertising and the children need the channels and the channels are the reason why young children are muted so the parents need the channels too ,13
2215, directed  is a very complicated topic first of all ,21
2216, it depends on the intention of the advertising the intention of advertising can be very different in many ways some commercials are worked out to show the people in this case children  the real quality of the product and just want to give you some ideas to buying stuff you could need beside that there are many commercials which are trying to manipulate you and have the intention to sell a cheap product for a high price this can be dangerous if children are involved children in the aged of  cant think about that like grown up can they watch the commercial and want to buy it they cant decide whether the money for the product is woth or not after that the parents of the kids have to tell them that this is maybe just a typical plastic product which is not worth to buy and ,0
2217, for the advertising directed  is that they learn how to figure out what they find interesting and which things are shown in the wrong light and are not worth buying them for them who will not think about that at this age it can be ,0
2218, dangerous because they will not detec whether someone tries to steal your money by selling you a shitty product which is not like they thought it would be over all i can say that commercials directed  can sometimes be really nasty and it should be controlled that the commercials are free to watch for kids and dont try to manipulate their brains if the concers advertising their product correctly and just show the young viewers neutral the product to give an idea of buying it i ,14
2219, would say that its okay it just depends on how the commercial is made  ,11
2220,nowadays its normal that even very young children watch television quite often of course if they want to see cartoons or something like that but they ,17
2221," see quite a lot of advertising between the different movies should it be forbidden to screen those advertising toward young children between the age of two and five years

a positiv ",13
2222," of adverting is that you get more openminded if you see whats going on all over the world the television companies screen adverting from a huge number of different countries which gives even young childrean an idea of life in other countries they get to know the diffrence between countries

on the other ",10
2223, the advertising form a channel for children involves mainly toys and food which is ,0
2224, they see all that new kind of toy which seem to better than the toy they already have they ask their partents to buy them a new one as we can imagine the parents arent happy to get something new again ,20
2225, they say no consequently the children begin to scream and beg until the parents ,9
2226," to go to the toysshop and that is exactely that what the main aim of the advertising is 

as i said most of the advertising includes stuff for children but its not unusal ",0
2227, to screen aderverting which isnt  but ,11
2228, they see it nowadays there are quite a few unpleasant situations all over the world and children shouldnt be confronted with problems from all over the world as well as problems they shouldnt see adverting of cigarettes ,2
2229,"

in my opinion it should be forbidden to direct telvision adverting  towards young children if its a channel ",13
2230, they will see enough advertising ,11
2231, they reach their teens of course i understand that without advertising a television channel cant survive but it isnt correct the direct it extra  who obviously cant estimate whats the aim of the advertising ,14
2232, it can be helpful for the young children to learn some manners or to learn a language better when the children listen to an english and german cartoon they can learn two language ,6
2233, its more easy to learn a language ,21
2234, you grow up it could be that some catoons are not good for children because of the bad influences ,7
2235, people who are rude to the others or it could be that children start to act bad and dont understand the moral of a story ,7
2236, the parents have to look what their children watch on the television ,17
2237, the young children watch cartoons that show the young the world and how to behave good or ,6
2238, they learn new words and new things it would be a good thing but ,8
2239, they watch tv series for the old or cartoons with bad things ,6
2240, its not good and something that are very important is that the parents shouldnt leave the children for a long time watching tv series a little bit is okay but ,17
2241, the children only watch tv and dont go out or dont do something else it is not good children should learn to play with other children or learning new things like baking with the mother or do something else ,17
2242,"most television advertisments have to do with dolls or other things that direct  mostly to children that are aged  some say that these advertisment shouldnâ´t be allowed because it has an big negative influence on the children but is it really that big of a deal or just some random thing that will be forgotten in a few months

these days children are watching more television than a few years ago and it isnâ´t a surprise that the parents try to find a programm that help their children learn and not to show them some advertisment because the advertising toward children is a danger for them most parents think that the children get corrupted by these advertisments into thinking they need this stuff to be cool or trendy or beautiful ",14
2243," they want the heavy advertising  children to stop most children mostly the children aged two donâ´t even know what is said in these advertisments and think because of that that itâ´s right what they say about the product it gave many incedents were children just wanted some product that had a good looking advertisment but a bad influence on the child itself and many others were children just bought things like makeup and nale polish to look like the children that are shown in advertisments that is a huge risk for the children because the donâ´t know how to use these things and might do something really risky for their health

but ",16
2244, are parents the ones who buy their children these stuff and itâ´s their child ,9
2245, them if they donâ´t want the young children to do or buy those things they shouldnâ´t do it ,12
2246, because some parents just buy the stuff their children want they donâ´t figure out what of an influence it could have on the children itâ´s a parents duty to watch out for danger for their children and if they think that advertisment is a danger they just have to stop their children watching television or stop them from buying products that are shown in advertisments itâ´s something the parents have to watch over and they ,14
2247, have the duty to educate their children ,9
2248," that their children wonâ´t even ask for things in the advertisments in the end not all television advertisments are wrong and bad for children and if there is one the parents and the child itself has to notice it and turn the television of

all in all ",14
2249, that the advertisments are a bit too directed to children and that it should turn down a bit but i ,16
2250, think that the parents have to look ,12
2251, their children and they donâ´t have to buy stuff that has in their eyes a bad influence on their children i say that ,9
2252, have to watch it and that they ,18
2253, have to think about the children and not about selling risky things and and buying these risky things,9
2254, that television is not that bad for children ,17
2255, they are just two years old its good to get used to technologie as early as possiblebecause you will need it anyway in  the future some ,24
2256, might be bad for children ,4
2257, rtl with its stupid shows in my childhood television was a big part when i came home ,6
2258, kindergarten or some years later from primary school i always watched pokemon one piece naruto or yugioh today i am 18 and i am ,6
2259, watching some of these series it is ,6
2260, nice to talk with your friends about series they watched and what they liked most these series and the advertising coming with did not hurt me ,10
2261, year i never had bigger problems in school and i did not had a bad childhood even ,18
2262, i was watching a lot of television i was spending most of my time outside with friends we often played what we were watching in tv ,1
2263, pokemon trainer or with yugioh cards duelist these experiences made my childhood better than it would have been without television i ,1
2264," think that it is difficult to keep children away from television if it wouldnâ´t be allowed for them 
all in all i would say that television wont hurt our children if we as parents brothers or sisters are taking care what and how much they are watching ",17
2265, we all know the sentence  go outside ans play the sun is shining ,18
2266,"television advertising

today we are discussing aboutif television advertising should not be allowed is it goodwhen young children watch advertisings in the young age or does that no matter

",14
2267, to discuss because the advertisings can influence their mentions that can be bad in the future because think thatthis things are real and they going to be naiv that will have bad ,11
2268," because of that the society will change in a bad direction

on the other ",21
2269, it helps to be more creative because they see in the young age a lot of creative things in the advertise but they can ,0
2270, painting pictures om the street or build things in the sand ,18
2271," tehy are creative outside and not by watching televisoin

",6
2272, that in that age they are they should not have to much time in front of the tv it is better ,17
2273, they play outside with their parents or other young children in their age if they pass too much time in front of the tv they lose to much time in their young age ,1
2274,"advertising is very important for selling products cars hair shampoo food und drink shoes or holiday flights  all can be advertised a good marketing is the a and o but some television channels show advertises for very young people is that correct
sometimes people think theres too much advertising on tv childs can see ",14
2275, much things they want to have but look at the age of them a three yearsold child cant understand the world sure its possible that a young girl sees  ,24
2276,  advertising for a new barbie product and want to have it but ,20
2277," young childs wouldnt go alone without the mother or father in a toy shop and they need money to buy it too so the parents decide what they buy their child and what not 
and advertising for such products is in special magazines or on the street too when the child isnt watching television she looks over the shoulder of her father in a magazine you cant save your children from all types of advertising that is impossible 
an ",2
2278," is that its difficult to forbid such advertising it can be that a ten yearsold girl likes the same things that a five yearsold likes so it isnt realistic that television advertising for young children will be forbidden in the future there are tv channels like kika who dont send advertising and this channel is for young children 
so ",14
2279, that television advertising for young children should be allowed and i dont see a chance for people who think it shouldnt be allowed that they will have success one time        ,13
2280,television advertising direceted toward young children has been a thing ever ,14
2281, television started to be a platform for advertising to see advertisement every day as soon as we turn on our tv or computer is a very normal thing for us today is it good ,10
2282," to be manipulated from the very start of life

advertisements are everywhere as soon as we get out of our house or apartement turn on the tv or the phone or reading the newspapers its normal for our daily life to be confronted with pictures logos and catchy phrases which are intended to make you want to buy a product one ",11
2283," against the banning of television advertising  is that they will need to get used to it and be able to cope with it eventually furthermore its good for their education if they can see the methods with which the companies use to make their advertisement good

on the other ",13
2284," such a yound child can never extinguish truth or exaggaration and it cannot see how its being manipulated i wouldnt want the kids of the future to get manipulated into wanting thing they dont necessarily need from the very start of their lives
if you arent aware of it and just see it without thinking about it the media is manipulating you into wanting the newest iphone body lotion or ice cream that could be very bad for your wallet also its very unhealthy to plant ideas in the heads of the kids that happiness can be bought and that thats the only thing that matters finally the parents feel a pressure coming from those advertisements the spots tell them how they can make their kidi happy with buying that one product which is not true obviously

",2
2285," to the statement that kids should be prevented of seeing the advertisement and think that the kids should not get manipulated into an object of our economy theyre sinply too young to know and understand whats happening and too naã¯ve

",16
2286,"generally in the 21st century in this technological century is a lot of advertisement on tv or on pc or other devices the advertisementâ´s task is to motivate the consumer to buy the pruduct 
but ",11
2287," mid aged people see these advertisements everybody can see them and can react different to them
so ",11
2288, an older woman could be motivated to buy the product ,23
2289, the advertisement reaches the goal of itâ´s task or she could ignore it but ,11
2290," an for axample a younger boy or girl watched the advertisements they wouldâ´nt see these advertisements theyâ´d see something different because of their age they wouldâ´nt understand the advertisements as we do for us an advertisement is just sometimes an annoying message from a store to buy some products in there but smaller kids just see humans or fruits  or any different products 
smaller kids get infected with new behaviours they see on a screen kids in generally areâ´nt resistent against behaviour changing trends or advertisements like social media you can see that the younger peaople are more respectless than the younger people from the generation of 2000 so they reflect these new behaviours they learn on screen so itâ´s ",0
2291," advertismentsâ´ fault that theyâ´re like that but advertisements have a small percentage of these 100 young people wont go out to play with friends like weâ´ve done they sit inside and watch tv or you tube  or any other social media device they get confronted with it very strong 
i completely ",16
2292, with the statement the times have changed new trends got injecteted in our community maybe life changing ones itâ´s ,21
2293, the advertisements fault but it takes part of it,11
2294,"in this essay we will research the statement televison advertising  should not be allowed it gives different reasons for and conter this statement 
one of the main question is not why shouldnt be allowed to show advertising it is why are such young childern aged  allowed to sit in front of the televison in this age they should play with other childern their age in the garden and to have fun in the reality not on the televison
but ",15
2295, we know that it gives young childern which sit often in front of the television ,4
2296," speak about the sense and influence from the television advertising what think the childern about advertising do they understand the advertising are they really notice the advertising the parents should ask all these question themeselve 
",14
2297, it gives childern which watch televison only that they have something to do not really for fun or maybe because the parents dont want to paly the whole time with their childern and ,17
2298, the childern dont notice or understand the advertising really they only want to look ,16
2299," picuters listen to animals who speak and to music which sounds
",18
2300, childern dont become influenced by televison advertising in my opinion im not whole ,14
2301, that childern in this young age shouldn be in front of the televison and i ,6
2302, think that such young childern dont notice the advertising ,16
2303, for older childern aged six to twelve the televison advertising should not be allowed because they always want to have the toys which come in the advertising but younger childern didnt notice this and because of that it dosent matter if the advertising is allowed or not,14
2304,the topic that television adversiting  between two and five should be allowed is a is hard to discuss on the on ,17
2305, its not necessary for them to entertain and they could do lots of other things another ,1
2306, is that there is no informatic ,21
2307, of television they can use because of their age on the other ,17
2308, there arent any reasons why they should watch television at their age but the reason that anybody or in their position their parents should decide if they are allowed or not because there are some series that even a little child would like and learn from it ,17
2309, its not as helpful to learn as other thing their parents could teach them the ,8
2310, is that that many young parents do ,9
2311, work in the morning or even in the afternoon ,18
2312," they arent able to take care of their child the hole day there they coukd use a babysitter but if they dont earn enough money to pay such a babysitter its way easier to keep the child happy
in my opinion it should be allowed just because of the earlier named reasons
",12
2313,the television advertising is focused on many different groups of persons ,10
2314, old people teenagers etc commercials aged for  year old children are very profitable for the advertisers because the young children wanna buy it ,0
2315, they ask their parents if they can buy it the parents ,9
2316, and buy it that wasnt the only commercial focused on young children ,16
2317, they will ask the parents again and again the advertiser receives a lot of money with that advertising strategy but for the parents it is very annoying and financially a hard task to manage for example a young boy wants to have a remotecontrolled car that he saw in the commercial but the parents already bought eight other toys the parents wont buy any toys for this boy anymore because they think that he has enough toys he can play with the boy has another opinion the eight toys he already has arent ,0
2318, good for him anymore because he wants something new he never had a remotecontrolled car he has never seen something like that ,18
2319, he wants to test it wether it is fun to play or not it is ,18
2320, looking very fun and interesting for him the problem is that the parents dont want to waste their money over and over again for their little son because they could invent it for somethimg different that is more needed than a toy a young child doesnâ´t understand something like that because heshe isnt confronted with financial problems when the young boy listens that he wont receive that remotecontrolled car he will be unhappy and sad the parents doesnt know what to do he is crying without a break they think the only way to stop the crying of the young son is to promise him that they will buy another toy that they are financially able ti buy the advertiser makes a lot money with that and the parents have to suffer from it is that really fair ,20
2321, because it is obvious that a child will receive toys ,20
2322, in his birthday new years eve etc the commercials are making it more difficult for the parents to manage that ,9
2323, i think of young children and if television advertising is allowed to them it is a very specific question ,14
2324," that it is different maybe they have to watch their own television so that they donâ´t have to watch some movies whitch are for children at the age of 12 
there must be some movies for kids in which they coulod learn something and not that they have to watch molvies in which words were said which they donâ´t have to hear 
but if you say that this isnâ´t allowed  from 2 to 5 they werenâ´t learn something from other kids 
maybe television is important  because they can learn something and get comfortable for the school which includes 10 to 13 years
maybe you can do movies in which the kids learn to read or to think of interesting thinks which they never heard ",17
2325," 
but if you say that kids between 2 to 5 shouldnâ´t watch tv and it isnâ´t allowed they must play at their own and never learn something ",17
2326," going to school and if they donâ´t learn something by using the tv you have to look what you can do
maybe you must learn with them or they must play with other kids 
but if you do movies in which kids learn something parents has freetime of them and can do what they want and the biggest ",1
2327," is that kids learn to think of something and if they were fit for school they didnâ´t have a big school probleme 
the education of young people is very important for the world because the politics were in 20 years not on the top ",8
2328," young people must get fit and go on top

without television in our time kids wouldnâ´t be interested in politics or sports television shows them how interesting the life could be and how interesting sports or politics can be kids could learn whith tv what they like and what they want to be in 20 years 

",17
2329, tv should be allowed for young children between 2 to 5 because they should learn in what they are interested and in what not if you watch tv you can learn many by asking your parents or something else,17
2330,itâ´s a comlplicated question you have to look at the different shows which are shown in the television on the one ,6
2331, they are shows who are very bad for young childrens like teletubbies or something like that this interrepted the education for the young childrens this shows have bad follows for the kids that shouldnt be allowed for them but ,6
2332, they are shows to learn about different languages or about different cultures in the world when the parents show the kids something like that the kids have a good start in the life for the school ,6
2333, when they are looking bzw hearing music or playing games on the television the concentration of the childrens could be better and ,24
2334," they are preperated for the future 
so you can give a easy answer to the question if television advertising   aged   should not be allowed when the parents show the kids learnvideos or music on the tv there arent any resaons to not allowed it but ",14
2335, the parents take the tv for shows who have bad follows for the kids it should not be allowed or the other way have to cancel the tv programs which make the bad shows,17
2336,television is a general tool of modern society but it might not be as beneficial to young viewers as it seems escecially cirtain advertisments aimed specificly towards children and infants are a constant controversial topic many parents and adults suggest that they should completely  be banned ,14
2337," protect the savety of the younger generation but is this really a necessary procedure or might advertisments not be as dangerous as they are portrait to be  
i  ",11
2338, support those who are against advertisments s young children because in my opinoin children have to learn how to develope an own opinion and those advertisments could be a threat manipulating children with colorful pictures and loud voices young kids are very likly to follow the lead of the people in their environment viewing them as an athority and if people in television tell them to buy things and act cirtan ways it might cause children to develope bad habbits ,13
2339, being to reliand on konsumism always wanting the newes toys and best games but showing them those images from advertisments aimed towards them could ,2
2340, cause them to have low selfesteem because they dont look like the people on televisoin or they dont want to play with the dolls the kids in those advertisments play children would grow up thinking that there is something wrong with them that they are differnt from others and by banning those advertisments kids would be able to grow up in peace and without constantly worrying about fitting in because ,13
2341, that being yourself and accepting who you are is very important ,21
2342, at a young age where you are already trying to find your place in society and by banning advertisments aimed towards children they would have the oportunity to do ,13
2343, without being manipulated by brands and markting tactics to conclude ,23
2344, children would only benefit from the banning and their savety would be insured,12
2345,there is a lot of television advertising that runs on our tv all day the fascinating thing about these adverts is the ,10
2346, that they manipulate us to buy a certain product and ,23
2347," manipulate the young children because they are easy to influence and if a child has a wish many parents want to make it true
but because it is ",7
2348," easy to manipulate young children one could say that it shouldnâ´t be allowed to do television advertising directed to these young children between an age of two and five 
in my opinion this kind of advertisings should be allowed 
yes children are very easy to manipulate they donâ´t know the tricks of the marketingcompanies and think everything they see on tv is true they could really get a wrong picture of the world and of life if they see these advertisings but this isnâ´t the fault of the advertisings it is their job to manipulate us ",16
2349," that we want this perfect life that is showm in this advert and we shall think that we can get this life if we buy these products 
",11
2350," itâ´s the responsibility of their parents not to let them think everything in the television advertisings is true 
if children see something fancy in the advertisings they want to have it and they are getting on their parents nerves until they buy it children can have a very strong will and parents see theirselves forced by the advertisings to buy things the children want to have but again the parents are responsible they are the ones that buy things they have the money they make the final decision and if they donâ´t get manipulated by the television advertisings and they donâ´t want to buy things thier children want to have they donâ´t have to buy them thatâ´s how easy it is 
and another thing that every parent should think aboutdoesnâ´t my child watch to much tv if it gets manipulated ",2
2351," bad by the advertising 
the only problem is that i know that there are parents that donâ´t mind if theire children watch tv all day and that they dontâ´t care or donâ´t know about the manipulation caused by the television advertisings this is sad and ",14
2352, change my opinion and say this kind of advertising shouldnt be allowed to protect the poor children which have parents that donâ´t know how to protect their children by their own,13
2353,the question wether television avertising  should not be allowed is a theme with a lot of different ,15
2354, that the children are old enough to make this experience and to find out in which world we live the ,8
2355," is that children grow up in a world with a lot of social medias they live in a time where the internet and television is one of the most popular thing all over the world 
secondly ",24
2356," that television advertising would be a great adventure for the children and they can find out their straights they learn a lot of things they will need in life 
but ",0
2357, that the children are too young for the television advertising itâ´s important for young children that they learn that the social media isnâ´t that important they might be play in the nature or they have to spend time with family so ,13
2358, they were confrontated in this young age with television advertising it might be not that good for young children moreover ,14
2359," that the children arnâ´t in the mood to say no or yes to television advertising so the parents usually decide wether their children have to take party in television advertising
i come to the conclusion that the children shouldnâ´t be allowed to television advertising they are to young to make their own decisions and they have to play in nature they have to live their childhood this means to play games and not beeing a part of television advertising ",13
2360, that young children in this age shouldnt watch ,6
2361, advertisements anyway in some programs there are many advertisements which arent good for kids in this age eg about alcohol and cigarettes kids cant understand them and maybe get directed in the wrong direction because they cant understand what is right and what is wrong in this age some parents think it is good ,2
2362, there childs see advertisements about toys ,0
2363, they can choose what they want to have as their ,19
2364, present for some event or what movie to watch ,1
2365," it is better to go to a toy shop with his kid or just let the child imagine a toy what you can maybe buy somethere otherwise they get addicted to the television and may forget about their friends on the playground in our century almost the whole population is addicted to smartphones and television but we cant stop this if we sat our young children in front of a telvision to have relax time from them annoying us in this way we support this huge problem 
another problem is that the kids fastly fall in love with all the toys and movies they might see in the advertisings but many  parents cant afford everything or even one thing of them so the childs get sad very quickly even worse is it ",1
2366, cool like it was described in the advertising because it is often ,18
2367," that things in television are described as the most perfect and best thing that you really need and they leave out all the bad informations about it
so to come to a conclusion ",10
2368, that children with young age shouldnt watch television advertisings because their dreams and thougts could get destroyed and they would get confused about all the other stuff which is advertised between the kids stuff,13
2369," analyze wether television advertising  should be forbidden or not in the past this topic has often been discussed by politicans 
firstly it is important to ask yourself wether or not it really is a problem because children in such a young age dont really question what they see they just want to be entertained by funny things which is often not the case ",14
2370," they see advertises for adults does it really bother them or is it just us the older generation that questions everything do they really care 
but is this the ",2
2371, that they dont really question what they see not the biggest problem i mean it is possible that they because they just accept the seen things get influenced in a negative way especially ,3
2372," they see idealized and very thin dolls it may cause them to think that something may be wrong with them because they just dont look like that 
on the other ",3
2373," is there a better way to advertise toys for kids with that i mean that i guess that it would just be kind of strange to look at grown people playing with plastic cars or dolls wouldnt it is it that bad to make fitting advertises for the product that the companies want to sell 
lets not forget about the things that children are tought by advertises we often see dolls in big castles who only think about dressing up who are maybe in a relationship with the different sex in example barbie and ken and boys whose interests are almost always just in cars or pirates or something at least in the advertises is this the ",16
2374, that these things are the ,21
2375, they turn on the tv the reason why sexism is ,19
2376," that important because children are thrown into groups because they are tought to like the things that are normal for their gender wouldnt it be nice to let children choose the toys that they want to play by themselves without being influenced by the television 
in my opinion ",20
2377, that it could maybe make a big change in a positive way if advertising for young children would be forbidden but maybe thats not what we really need we need a changethats ,13
2378, to not teach children wrong ideals but is this a reason to just forbid something ,12
2379, that it would be better to just think about better ,21
2380, changing the advertises in such a way that children are not badly influenced by it as they did ,16
2381, with barbie because they have introduced new body types this is why ,20
2382, that we need some kind of a revolution in the toy industries and their advertises but ,20
2383, that forbidding something is the best ,21
2384,"in these days more and more young kids spend their freetime in front of a computer or television by doing this they are often confronted with a lot of advertising for toys or other things for kinds in their ages but is in needed to broadcast ads for young children

2386, television why shouldnt it be allowed to make ads for kids ,13
2387, they are the customers it ist very simple children are easy to infuence because they can not decide if they need this product or if the promises the ads do are possible ore just empty promises but by watching these advertisings children ,2
2388," learn how to deal with the given informations they learn not to trust everything they hear this is one step for growing up further they learn slowly how to deal with money if there is a product which they are totally in they have to save their money for buying the product some day but sometimes this can go wrong kids who get too much money from their parents dont learn this quality they waste their money by buying the most unnecessary toys or other product just because  in the  adsvertising it seemed to be very cool
in my opinion it is very diffficult to decide whether advertising in television for kids shouldnt be allowed or not on one  ",24
2389," they learn in their early years how to deal with advertising promises and saving their money for things that are more needed on the other they are in a critical age where they easily get influenced by things in television and waste their money because they can not handle the given information and promises so if i  had to decide i wouldnt allowe ads for kids
",14
2390,advertisement  specially used in television  is sometimes really annoying when children are watching television and there are breaks for advertisement it could be really difficult for the parents to explain their children why they see these advertisement in the following essay ,0
2391," name explain my opinion to the theses television advertising  should not be allowed
the ",15
2392, for the theses is that children normally dont be watching any tv children in the age of 2 to 5 should be playing with other children you cant really let these children watch something because ,17
2393, you let them watch special children programm they can see things they dont are allowed to see and if they watch news which ,1
2394," can be shown on the children channel and see something about war it really can be traumatic 
the ",6
2395, against the statement is the ,21
2396, that the children can watch to something ,1
2397, they dont understand that is directed to them they will build up a connection to the tv and can understand the meaning of watching television it can really be helpful to watch to something between the original programm in what children ,17

2399," directed to the children 
the ",8
2400, which is for the theses is that children dont understand what they see in television television normally is directed to parents and aged people there are special channels for children in which advertisement is easier to understand but it doesnt allowed children to watch it because sometimes there are advertisement with sexual content which not is helpful for children an example is the german television channel superrtl which normally shows special programms for children soemtimes they ,14
2401," show advertisement which should not be shown to children 
to sum up all the ",16
2402, advertisement directed to children aged  shouldnt be allowed  ,16
2403, with the statement  because children shouldnt be watching tv in younger years it really can be shown something in which the content isnt that good as in other advertisement so let the children play and parents watch tv ,14
2404,nowadays advertisements can be hardly avoided you see them everywhere on the streets in magazines on websites and ,11
2405, television in the following text ,10
2406," argue why television advertising toward young children from the age of  is or is not reasonable and whether it should be allowed or not

it cant be argued that a lot of children watch tv where they face a lot of advertisement targeted ",13
2407, for them children from the age of  have less control over themselves and arent always reasonable as can be seen by the many tantrums ,7
2408, young children throw and the annoying shrieks they like to do ,8
2409, they dont get what they want now imagine they see an advertisement on tv and are persuaded into thinking they desperately need that item ,3
2410," lego cubes this will result in tensions between them and their parents 
however it should be made clear that not every child watches television  as i sincerely hope they have other and better things to do  and that i expect the parents who have control and supervision over them to control their television consume  this way they can ",17
2411," what advertisements they watch 
then again the parents cant always be there for their children and watch over them 247 ",2
2412," at risk of being manipulated 
but ",21
2413, they get manipulated these kids are not old enough to decide ,7
2414, and dont have that much influence some of them will perhaps insist on getting that barbie doll or whatever else they want but the parents ,9
2415," have the authority and the children are obliged to listen to what they say
",7
2416, important to stress just how badly the children get influenced by all the advertisement ,16
2417," those directed at them which makes them want bad and wrong things
however advertisement can ",11
2418, help the children to know what they really want out of the many things that are offered on the market also the same manipulation applies to basically every human being that has seen advertisement the goal is always to manipulate the folks into buying stuff or ,0
2419," spending money for example teenage girls are offered beauty tips in expensive magazines and makeup items that they really do not need 
lastly advertising is important as a sort of income for the people who advertise
i conclude that advertising for young children should be allowed and is fine as it is
",16
2420,"advertises everyone who watches tv sees them hundreds of times but should they not be allowed if they are  childs at the age from 2 to 5
",16
2421," advertising  should not be allowed kids at the age from 2 years to 5 years do not really have the understanding to realize what the advertising shows maybe children understand the advertising wrong or do not think about the advertised object for example kids who are watching tv without their parents see a toy which they see completely different from its usual meaning the kids fall for this and maybe this toy isnt even allwoed for kids this young
on the other ",16
2422, children at this age are very manipulatable ,24
2423," they get the advertising and fall for the advertised object they instantly want the object and do not even know what its meant for at this age its not really possible to realize what is happening around the children they just see everything but dont think about the things they see if you show a little kid a teddybear and say that they need this they think that they really need this this is advertising in a smaller way
the manipulation can be seen the other way too kids who are manipulated by advertises have no own opinion anymore they are like zombies they need this toy advertises in the tv are like a trap from the toy companies children tumble into the trap and they are caged no way out until the parents buy this toy mostly kids are sreaming and crying ",2
2424," they arent happy as a dad i couldnt stand this noise and would buy the toy 
advertises for young childs are indirectly s the parents no child would accept a no if they want a toy they annoy their parents until they are happy ",20
2425, there are other things in this age they are much more important for children in todays society there are much problems with the speaking learning and having frinds i thing one reasons why in the society came up this problems is to much television children have to play with other children they have to play in the forrest playground or somewhere else they find somothing to have fun but ,17
2426, the importenest is to play with frinds and have conversations connections and contact with other persons you suggest children what is important in life if a big part is television they add this meaning but television is something you do not need another persons there is no conversation no connection or contact in the age of  it is important to learn from other they add reactions how to deal with others and how to live television do not show the right way there are ,8
2427, much  uniteresting details but i thing you can not change the problems ,19
2428, you say television is not allowed first think about an five years old children on his sixt birthday what would you think  is the ,17
2429, thing the children want to do yes television something which is not allowed are much more interesting than others the following is that wanting the television grow and grow whit every day the child are not allowed and others are allowed another big problem are older sisters or brothers the conflicts between them will ,17
2430, you can not say without television there will be less problems you have to think about wich role television should play in your childrens life parents who do not care about this would find other things wich could make problems in the life of they childrens it is a different question but ,17
2431, it should be allowed but less than it is used now adays,4
2432,television advertising s young children could have some ,0
2433, at the age  children have to learn new things and start being prepared for their following life like school on the one ,24
2434, television can help to lern new words or something about life on the other ,6
2435, learn these things from the real world in this period of their lifes they experience a lot of things in the nature with their partents or children who are their age go to different places and see new things in the world can help to grow up in a better way if the weather ,8
2436, isnt good and the children havent got the chance to go outside and make experiences there they can ,12
2437, do something else than watch the television their parents can read out books for them the children can play with different types of things like little cars or dolls to play with the parents other family members or kids their age is important for the future children will learn to interact with other people share things with them and how good it feels to have people around you and not being alone in my opinion television advertising  yound children should be allowed because ,17
2438, it isnt completely bad for them but i think parents should create better days for their children and do things like i talked about ,12
2439, if they sometimes let their children watch the television thats totally okay but it should not be the whole day sometimes the parents have to focus on other things like clean the house or do something for work ,1
2440, its okay if the children watch tv of course its better if they will play with some real things but sometimes they dont even want than to conclude i would say that the television for young children isnt the best but it isnt the worst ,17
2441,should childern under 5 years watch television for ansering this question ,17
2442," name a few ponitâ´s for and against this these 
everybody know that nowadays nearly ervery child belongs to whatch television but is it better for them ",17
2443," exercising for learn reading 
itâ´s very imtortant for children to go out and play games outside ",8
2444," in summer it improofs the motoric of a child
lotâ´s of people say itâ´s not good for children in this age to watch television but this meaning must spilt up in two ",6
2445, there are much programms on tv that children shouldnâ´t look but there are ,17
2446," on who improof in this example the english skills from a such young child by learnings things with a playing background but even a child under 5 years shouldnâ´t watch the whole day stuff like that it would be too much time spend on the television 
but what is the anser now to the statemant if children at the age of 2 up to 5 years should be allowed to watch television or not  i not ",17
2447, with this statement but neither ,21
2448, with it in my opinion children shouldnâ´t spend their whole time at the tv but there are some series whtich are good for a child ,17
2449, there must be a difference between watching tv and watching tv with a usefull background watching tv could be forbidden but watching tv with a usefull background is good for the child and should be allowed,17
2450,"with the time more and more advertising has been showed in the television today almost every family has a television at home more and more parents let their kids watch television up to several hours a day 

it is easy for the parents to let their kids watch television ",17
2451, that they have some time off but the kids can get addicted to it in this time ,1
2452, much advertising the advertisers know that there are ,11
2453," they try to make advertises towards them
the kids belive what they saw in the television and they ",0
2454, want their parents to buy the product in the advertise the people who make the advertises know that the kids will show this behaviour ,2
2455," they use it to make money

the products in the advertises  are often toys which they will like because they claim that it would do something special but kids in that age are not able to see a difference between things they need and things they do not need the parents have to decide what is good for their children but the kids will not stop asking for this toy ",2
2456," the parents are not a bit strict in that they will waist a lot of money for unuseful things

but it is ",9
2457, up to the parents if they let their children watch much television or if there is a limit for them they could ,17
2458, let their kids watch just a series and ,1
2459," it is finished and advertises are shown they can turn it off however it is not possible that the kids will not see any advertises

",16
2460, it should not be allowed to make television advertising  because they belive everything they see ,15
2461, the producers of the advertises just use it to make more money but it is ,11
2462, up to the parents if they let their young children see televison,17
2463," television shows for kids there are special advertis towards young kids but should that be allowed
",14
2464," it should be allowed
there are many comapanys for products for children and they need to advertis their product ",16
2465, they can sell it better after televison shows for children where many children are sitting in front of the television its the best timing to do ,6
2466, so they must use their chance to earn money eventhough children cant really think clearly about the advertising and you could see this as obuse because they cant really complain but ,16
2467, want to see those adervertis because it is about products they like so they must talk with their parents to understand this systemchildren want their toys and you dont see many advertis for children anywhere else ,16
2468, special television shows the advertising system is everywhere and children must be confrontet early with this system ,14
2469, they could learn more about it if they didnt see any advertis ,11
2470, they become 5 they might buy just everthing they see in advertis because they dont learn more about the system parents might have problems with specific advertising because their child wants everything they see ,2
2471," their favourite televison show but they have the control over their child and they must teach himher how to live with those advertis maby you could see it as a problem that children want to buy everthing they see and they dont really think about it but if they werent confronted early ist will become a problem later on in their lives
",14
2472, adverftising towards young children is exepteble because they nned to be confronted with this system and they must understand how the world works and it ist teh exercise of their parents to teach them m ore about it the parents need to teach them how to live with zhe advertising sytem,16
2473, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed because ,15
2474, the brains of young children are not as developed as the brains of teenagers or older people young children are very sensible for new things and ,24
2475, they watch these advertisments they think they must own these things presented in advertisments ,3
2476," they want their parents to buy all that much unnesessary stuff like plastic toys
another reason why television advertising shouldnt be allowed for young children is that they are hanging arround in front of the tv the whole day the children could learn bad things from the advertisments ",14
2477," playing outside with their friends friends are better for thier social development than the tv
but ",17
2478, it is a good method for the companies which produses the toys to earn money because many parents buy new things ,20
2479, young children told them to buy it with the new money the companies could invent new toys for the children perhaps better toys it is ,20
2480," they could expand and unemployed people could find work
my opinion is that television advertising shouldnt be allowed becouse it is not good for th",15
2481, they shouldnt be allowed but ,19
2482, its difficult to built a meaning to this theme because most of the people dont have real memories to the age between two and five and ,8
2483," one cant decide quickly and easily how the reaction of young children towards this form of television advertising is
first of all such young children dont really judge about what is good and useful for them and what is bad and not useful for them but according to the normal television advertisings theyll think they have to get these stuff that seems great and good to them but sometimes theyre wrong 
of course it are the parents who decide to buy or dont buy the advertisements but the television advertisings are s the children and not the parents 
another remark is that these children can easily be influenced and some of the advertisements are a way too bad ",14
2484," they should influence the children
additionally the children who want one item that they have seen on television and are seeing it in reality in the supermarket etc they are influencing the parents by their target to buy stuff of course this isnt generally a bad thing but it can be a bad thing if the item isnt as good as it seems and if parents do not want to buy this item its probable that the younger children are starting to cry and this would be annoying for everyone
but there are ",2
2485, that are proallowing these forms of advertisements for example there are many children which dont often watch tv and ,14
2486," it wouldnt have much need to change the situation and prohibit the television advertising which are  
but just because some dont consume television advertisings it doesnt mean that this me gets irrelevant because there are many children who do this",13
2487,there is a tv in every normal family today because of this everybody knows the problem that young children want to watch something on it but their parents dont ,17
2488," but is it right that children arent allowed to watch something on tv is it a good idea to forbid this for children in the age of 

first we have to think of the great knowledge that these young children could get from watching interesting documetarys parents often think that everything what their children are watching on tv is bad but thats not right because there are many good series for little children which prepare them for their life of course the parents must have a look for the tv ",17
2489, their children watching something it is right that there is very much bullshit too and its important that little children dont watch some bad scenes because it could make them ill an another important ,6
2490, is that children shouldnt watch tv for too long time ,17
2491," they dont want to play outside anymore or something else but its okay if the ã½ watch daily for one lesson and than their parents have time to relax but today there are too many young children in front of a tv everyday for a too long time this is not even healthy anymore and they loose their connection to the real life thats a big problem for many familys in our century because their childs life very unhealthy

",17
2492, parents should allowe their childs to watch tv but it must be under control the new televisions ,17
2493, have a timer that parents can chose how long their children are allowed to whatch,1
2494,children are said to be sitting more and more in front of the television even at very young age this does not have to be bad as there are channels ,17
2495," as pedagogical programmes however should it be allowed to direct tv advertising toward our youngest generation
of course you may say beause they have to learn how to deal with it there is a huge amount of advertising in the adults life ",14
2496," wherever you go you will find some in addition to that researches have shown that children are immune to advertising if they grow up with it they automatically seem to learn to separate the relevant information from the irrelevant
on the other ",0
2497, there will be an impovement of advertising techniques which ,11
2498, will fit perfectly to the new generation the children are going to grow up and lose their immunity as new trends and new technologies are going to change their behaviour and the kind of advertising they like to add ,0
2499, children should grow up without being terrorised by advertising ,16
2500, if it comes from the tv at the age of  they are ,17
2501, learning a lot of central ,18
2502, what is important or not ,21
2503, that advertising belongs to the important ones and ,11
2504," it should be avoided
to sum up i do totally ",21
2505, with the statement that television advertising  children aged  should not be allowed not only it interrupts their development and confuses them ,13
2506, they soon will be victims of the advertising ,11
2507, as adults are right now,24
2508,"shouldâ´nt television advertising  be allowed
first of all we have to clearify which children is meant in the question children in the age  ",14
2509," really young children nearly babys
we all know what our parents said to us in the older days donâ´t watch too much tv itâ´ll damage your eyes we all know that at some ",17
2510, watching too much tv isnâ´t good for anybody it doesnt matter which age in the age of two little kids learn ,17
2511, much like speaking eating walking and its an really importend phase in their lives watching tv sure is good to learn some words or to be entertainend but the little kids need someone who is actually teaching them important things for their life like their mum or dad if their mum and dad work the whole time and just let you sit in front of the tv ,17
2512, you can get wrong information for example the teletubbies they all had a bit of an language mistake and soon some kids would talk like that because they didnt know how to speak right also some information which are shown in the tv are wrong because the producer think its for little kids and they dont really care about the content also little kids can get addicted to the tv or their favorite tv show and that isnt good it is sure better for a children to play outside with other kids their age at the playground or just at home or just even play with their siblings because ,17
2513, a kid watches tv the whole time it isnt outside because the tv probably is in the livingroom or some room inside the house and ,1
2514, they dont really go out the whole day of cours watching tv for a children at  five to eight for half an hour is absolutely fine it always depends how the parents act with their kids watching tv some people strictly dont allow their kids to watch tv and ,17
2515," others let them watch nearly the whole day but there are some parents that say only half an hour the problem with not allowing your kids to watch tv is the kids will do it anyway whether its behind their back at grandmas house or at a friends house
so ",17
2516, it depends on the age and the time how long its allowed to look as i said if the kids only two it needs his mother to be there for him and talk to him ,12
2517, steps but if the kid is like 5 or something ,8
2518, it begins to make its own decision and is more independend ,21
2519, a kid with the age 2 its ,8
2520, depends what the kid is watching if it watches some entertaining or learful tv show which is ,17
2521, for kids and wherer they can learn someting or have to think aswell ,8
2522, its absolutely fine but if it watches something their parents would watch like a sitcom or a movie or a horror movie ,17
2523, it can get horrofied and not get the pictures out of their head it all depends of the way how you specify this question and ,4
2524, which age the kid specifily has and which sort of tv you mean,17
2525,this is a good statement in my eyes on the one ,21
2526, it has many parents how just put their children in front of the television because they say a television advertising and found this good probably they find that at the age between two and five the children learn quick and should learn many things a television is good because the children ,17
2527, are quiet or they havent ,19

2533, that advertising should be allowed to be directed at children aged  is that advertising helps selling the products children are easy to influence and the parents listen to their children ,13
2534, that they buy the product the small boy or girl wishes for it is very easy for a company to sell their products to children ,2
2535," it is easier for them to keep the head above the water and stand out against the other companies
another ",23
2536, for advertising is that advertising can give new birthday present ideas for children for example hans is a two year old girl that doesenâ´t know what to wish for his birthday ,0
2537, he turns the tv on and boom there he has an idea and he runs to his parents but they say that this is too expensive hans is sad and cries the whole day ,18

it isnâ´t good because the children canâ´t decide what they are influenced by ",13

2544,"televison advertising is a very excited theme espacially the one directing toward to very young children in age of 
thats the reason why ",10
2545," answer if televisison advertising shouldnt be allowed for young children

in my view advertising is a way to manipulate somebody or to informate somebody about a product and i think its more a manipulation than an information 
it isnt my opinion but advertisings really could be dangerouse for the children and ",14
2546," it is a manipulation of a childs thinking there are more reasons for the television advertings
",0
2547," if somebody said it should stay allowed because some of the factories producing toys have to do this beacause they should survive in the buisiness and maybe it isnt nessasary to say it shouldnt be allowed because it isnt intresting for the children the adversitings are more for their parents their are more the adresse of this kind of advertising 
maybe the parents are going to have crying children they really wanted to have the toy the child in the telivision have
and if you want to answer the main question you should have a look at the problemes of the publizity and i think thats not a big problem because its the buisiness and all toyfactories have to have the chance to make television advertising like any other buisiness

all in all ill say that television advertising toward young children should stay allowed because i dont see any problemes for the children ",14
2548, they were manipulated by the advetising factory but the main adresse of this are the parents and they really should know what is something good or what is something bad for their children ,12
2549,"the statement â´television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is an interesting one 
im not realy sure if i understand it right ",15

you can find some ",21
2551," with it 
nowertimes children all ages use more televison and other electronic stuffs they use theire time not like the generation befor with playing outside and meet frinds or playing with their toys at home you can see that the modern generation and specially yound childern lose their creativ ideas the televison could be one factor for this losing of cours the televison has some good ",17

you can see that young children are happy ",8

2554," be a kind of something you must do because this is what you learned and something youâ´ve done your whole life
itâ´s importent for young children to learnd from the real life because most of the time they can not decide if that what they see in televison is real or something that only exist in a fantasy world 
so ",6
2555, should not be allowed for young children or only in some short times because it could make stupid and gives them a wrong picture from the world i ,4
2556, think that it gives some activitis which make more fun than sitting in room and look to an elecrtonical box when the children are in the age like six years they can chose by themself what they would do and what could be good for them ,8
2557, they can look something at the televison or something like that     ,6
2558,in my followig essay which is based on the question do ,21
2559, if television advertising  should not be allowed ,15
2560," present my answer
first of all young children in the age of  are living in a life time where they should play outside and get any positive influence which theyre able to its import to learn how to write to speak in conversations with other people or to handle situations if young children are watching too much television they are going to compare the irreal and the real world every story or character skill is going to be the one that the children want to have
growing up with too many telvision devices is not a helpful education to get in the ",17
2561, because of the fighting scences dangerous situations and the way how the actors talk to each other in tv shows most of the children aged  are staying in the kindergarden children are trying to live just like the characters in soaps in games or in movies they try to life talk and act like them ,17
2562," they jump out of a window
the young life chapter is really important to get life skills which are based on the following chepters parents and siblings should think about how their child or sibling should grow up at the end parents have the power to controll the childrenhood  ",8
2563, statement is the question is it dangerous for childern to watch tv very importent im not quite sure about the answer but i heard that it was never prouved that watching tv is dangerous for anyone so thats an ,17
2564, for children at that age it is importent to go outside and play some games and talk to other kids in this age kids learn ,24
2565, many things form the olther people eg speaking so the contact to the nature and other humans is very importent and ,21
2566, children are used to watch tv the hole day they lose that contact so thats an ,17
2567, for the statement when were talking about learn how to speak its ,21
2568," important to say that sometimes the parents cant speake the languge they speak in that country where they are living so the tv can be very helpful to learn things and sometimes the tv has like tvshowes for children to leran specific things
so thats a good thing about watching tv in that age 
so my opinion is that its ok to watch television i think it shouldnt be not allowed because ",17
2569, each parent should can think about that problem on their own and ,9
2570, kids wont be addicted to the tv is it totaly ok to watch their shows    ,17
2571," statement about  television advertising  should not be allowed i want to present my personal opinion about that

if young children watch tv they were always influeced by the advertising at every channel some advertising are directed for adults and some are directetd toward young children the ones that are just for kids can be manupulated ",13
2572, that the kids make a wish about the things they have seen especially ,8
2573, its time for christmas the advertising are full of presents for children so ,20
2574, they watch this they usually want to have these things but they cant get everything they want ,3
2575," they are not getting the things they want they can feel a bit uncomfortabel and be sad otherwise they have to learn that they cant get everything in life you want have and you have to work hard for things to get them
often the advertising show things parents do not want to that their kids see this but ",2
2576, they have such a big problem with that they have to forbit the children to watch tv because advertisning is at every channel und you have to accept this ,14
2577," you want to watch television
to put it in a nutshell i would say that its not possible to forbit advertising  advertising take a big place in our social life and we are always influenced by it when you want to watch tv you get advertising und you could not do anythings against that
if you as parents do not want that your child watch advertising you have to  buy them bluerays because that is the only possibility to get a distance between the kids and advertising",14
2578,first of all we live in a free country where freedom of speech and opinion is worshipped if we cut back on what ads are allowed to be shown on television we hurt that liberty a television channel should be entitled to show any content they want including their breaks filled with advertisements ,15
2579, they arent offensive or hurtful ,19
2580," racist or sexist

additionally nobody is being forced to buy the products advertised in these ads its just trying to sell something to you by convincing you why this product is ",11
2581," awesome or why you desperately have to have it however it doesnt actively steal your wallet slowly take out the cash and buys certain product it just tries to make you do named move through carefully formulated speeches

also why should specifically little kids not be allowed to see ads if you dont want your toddler to participate in the real moneyruled world you may not let him watch television kids usually do not have any money of their own to buy all the unnecessary stuff advertised on television ",0
2582, how can kit really be a danger to them they would ,19
2583," have to convince their parents to buy these things for them which requires quite some debating skills and im sure no two year old has

although its the parents that should be in control about their childs television consumption advertisement breaks help to limit the time spent infront of the screen because they make up some time in which the kid can ",14
2584, get ready for bed the parents could ,1
2585, use these breaks to control how long their toddler watches if theres a break every twenty minutes they know ,1
2586," ad comes on that its time for the kid to get off of media

theres ",14
2587," a lot of ad breaks on news channels and what grown up wants to see an ad for princess sugar plums pink tutu barbie doll every fifteen minutes if you absolutely have to fill gaps with advertises at least make them useful for the audience

however these are children  years of age they deserve to live in their fairytale world and shouldnt be spammed with our moneydriven societies advertisements for more and more and even more legos ",0
2588," theyre just trying to enjoy harmless toddler series like bob the builder and dore the explorer let them breathe give these kids a rest

summing my ",24
2589, up i understand why one wouldnt want their kids to see certain ads and things on tv nevertheless we should be allowed to show ads for barbie dolls and playmobils i mean thats how i used to get my inspiration for my chriatmas and birthda wishlist we ,13
2590, shouldnt give to many influence that the parents are supposed to have out of ,7
2591, they take up the responsibility for their child and if they cant take them seeing those ads they should consider not letting their kid watch ,16
2592,"if children aged  should watch television is a question witch is hard to answer cause every child is different
television could change your child but it ",17
2593, can not many parents say if their sons watch to much war films ore films where aggresivite plays a big roll there will become the same ,7

often the parents do not have ",7
2598, much time for their you children ,1
2599, they put them in front of the television that the television is doing the nani thatâ´s a completely wrong way to solv this problem bacause a television canâ´t teach a child how life is giong on because often tv donâ´t show how the real life is going on children who are aged  should discover what life can be and not how life can be manipulated a better way is to interact which the children instant putting them infroint of the tv television can ,1
2600, change their language and how theyâ´re speaking often small children watch cartoons and donâ´t understand if itâ´s real ,6
2601, their can thing like teletubbis that their got a tv in their stoomach and try to find it witch a knife small children really should not watch too often television but if itâ´s only a few times a week thatâ´ll be ok on this way they can learn wich is reallity and which isnâ´t ,17

young children arent interested in advertising they dont care about things like that they are happy with what they have and that they could play with it advertising would only change their interests into bad and made them unhappier mabey they are confused because they couldnt understand the advertise
when the advertise makes the children confused it isnt good for the company ",13

televion advertisment is a common thing and it is needed to keep the economy in a flow

some might say every advertisement ",11
2619, it is not offensive in any way should be allowed to be shown on tv companies which produce products made for young children should have the rights to advertise these products like any other company with any other product only because it is  a specific group of people it should not result in a worse standing ,16

furthermore if parents do not want their young children to watch certain advertisements they should not let them watch tv shows with a lot of advertising or turn the tv of in the breaks

however children in ",13
2621, that age group are starting to develop their character and their interests they should be able to do that without being influenced by advertisements what to like or not to like and what to do or not to do because of them developing a lot in that time they are easy to influence as they are looking for someone to tell them what to do even at that age they want to fit in and be liked ,24
2622," they try to imitate people who seem to be popular and happy advertisement could take them the chance of really developing who they are that state should not be used for advertising selling products and ultimatly just making money

all in all i believe that children aged  are in a crucial stage of their own development which should not be sabotaged by advertisements or used to make money televison advertising should not influence these children in any way and should not be allowed to higher the chances of a good upbringing and development
",14
2623, fast nearly ever child is able to use an smartphone computer or the television in 2017 these are types of getting the children out of their rooms from playing or learning but children dont unterstand everytime everything in the television or the computers the problem with this early relation between children and technology is that they get wrong or unrealistic ways of acting an example for this unrealistic way of acting is a tvshow which shows kids that the acting toys or animals can talk or do stuff just like humans are doing these types of tvshows make them think in a unrealistic and even stupid way also these animals which can talk or living like humans live doesnt have any realiton to the reality but why parents ,17
2624, allow their kids to watch this kind of unrealistic tvshows or catoons the answer is simple because it is one of the easiest ways of making a kid stop crying mostly the kids in 2017 are used to the technology and are bored by playing with some toys or reading a book if possible therefore let them sit in front of the television is a way of making them stop crying and ,1
2625, a good think for the parents because they have some time to relax therefore it is an ,8
2626, but do the parents recognize that the technology isnt good for their children this way of showing them the new world of playing around or learning by the tvshows or cvartoons led to high damage these kids aged between  years are in the era of learning ,17
2627, fast and getting everything with it is important that they are learning realisitc stuff and dont just focus on the animation in the tv which leds to a damage because they arent used to the screens ,6
2628, that they hurt their eyes by watching the screen too long or getting headache because of the fast moving and colorfull images not just in pyschologic way ,6
2629," in physiologic way they could get a damagein the ages  they have to learn much more informative stuff as tvshows or cartoons but some of the tvshows nowadays are about to teach the kids and let them learn new things 

to sum it up children aged  shouldnt waste their time in front of a big screen which isnt good for their eyes and their brain ",17
2630, a time but should go out and play around and learn things which are more realistic,18

but ",12
2632, that it is good to influence little children throw multimediaparents should look ,8
2633," their children and protect them they should not let their children watch television all the day 

 ",12
2634,firstly it isnt that good for children to see advertisment because if they see a toy or viedo games which doesnt belong to them they probably want this item and if the parent dont  buy it for them they might feel incomplete and got a empty space in their hearts in the psychologic ,16
2635," we would consider this as a negative relation between parenting character and the children because the child builds negative emotions against his parents for the reason they couldnt fullfill his wishes
secondly advertising is very chatchy so as young children get caught really fast it is hard to get them out of the vicious circle i mean to say if a advertisment stands for what it stands ",2
2636," it has the job to cover the audience 

and for the reason above children shouldnt be part of the audience 
but ",12
2637," children have the option to take own dicisions for example if there where a lot of barbie dolls the girl or in some weird cases the boy has to choose which shehe wants to have 

in my opinion its a matter of parenting because some parents just want the kids to love them and they forget what is best for child and vice versa so i would obiviously let my child watch advertising videos because choosing between options is something important in life maybe the child chooses the option to skip the add and it is ",2
2638, important which advertisment should be banned or not i mean advertisment to park or for some rollercoasters are completely fine but it comes to toy and things like that i might get a bit suspicious,16

2663," explain my opinion about this topic 

children programms are ",12
2664," good and important for kids in the age of  years but in my mind advertising are not a good idea 
everybody knows that problem you watch a movie and a part of this is very good and ",0
2665," a advertising cut this moment
but yes advertising is in a way good and present marks of communities in the supermarket it can be helpful and the person knows the product that heshe buys the person knows the price and the function and has an exactly picture in hisher head advertising is a good way to relax and to be happy about the last part of the movie

but the movies or series of children are not very long and advertising is not a good method advertising let things or food in a better light and children want to have nearly everything parents should be able to make an diccision for their kids is this foodthing good or not good for my children that is the important question 
in germany we say advertising make dump and i have got the same opinion in my mind advertising is a good way to present something but children at the age of  are too young children programms should be good for they the kids have to learn something and advertsing have to make a good break to the reality  ",0
2666,"today we are living in a digital century you can find a tv in almost every house so television advertising should be allowed 
i say principially yes
it is always a question of the programme in the tv not every documentation is agespecified a good example for this are series like the big bang theory or how i met your mother for young children there are other series with are much more better like the sandmã¤nnchen every evening on kika
when i was young i could only watch this one tvshow every day
but the main reason against television advertising is that children have to keep in touch with other children if your child is watching tv every day every hour if that happens your child will loose his or her social contacts the friends
in this time of their life children are learning very much ",14
2667, how to communicate with others they have their ,3
2668," friendships are meeting new friends in the primary school watching tv is not very helpful with that it gives them a wrong view of life
in the end ",17
2669, that television advertising should be principially allowed but only if the children are watching tvprogrammes which are agespecified if this would be allowed there would be a big missing part in this digital century but to let them watch tv always,13
2670,"in the following essay iâ´m going to give you my opinion about the question if television advertising  should not be allowed

2671, it should be allowed if an adult controls it because there are lots of serials extra for children where they can learn words or can train there logical thinking also it makes them a lot of fun and the serials are extra created for children ,12

2673," sexual content there is this serial named dora where dora and her equipment that can speak help her friends in this serial the children learn new words and to think logical so itâ´s quiet good for the children to watch this serial 
but which children says i donâ´t want to see reality tv ",6
2674, watch dora in my opoinion the children always want what they arenâ´t allowed to so ,20
2675," the parents turn on the tv or the child on hisher own they switch the channel to a channel where something like reality or music videos this kind of content isnâ´t good for children because there are lots of sexual and rude things also the carakters in reality tv donâ´t have such a good behavior and if the children watch these shows they can start to behave like that well i donâ´t think  that somebody wants to behave their child like that 

to pretend this the parents can control what their children watch in the television they can always have the thing to control the tv ",17
2676," the childrens canâ´t turn the tv on when the parents allow their children tp watch the tv the parents can turn the tv on switch to the right channel with a serial for children and take the thing to control the tv with them 

nevertheless the parents have to look at how long the child is watching the tv becuase ",17
2677," they watch it for too long they could get a headache also it 
good for the less 

",4
2678, television advertising towards children is okay  ,13
2679, itâ´s controlled by the parents ,7
2680, they only watch serials which are made extra for children ,6
2681,television plays a big role in the life of many people even younger ones many children around the age of  already watch tv the problem with that is the ,17
2682," that tvshows come with advertisements children are often times easily convincent by others and tend to believe many things they get told

when it comes to advertisements they could ",14
2683, be convinced to want certain things that are shown on tv this could prove a problem for the parents ,17
2684," their children want them to buy something new all the time that maybe isnt like the product they saw in the commercial because advertisers tend to glorify their product very much
many children could ",2
2685, they want a certain product they saw but their parents cant buy it so ,9
2686, it would be a bad experience for the parents ,12
2687," for the children
also the parents are the ones buying the product ",2
2688," the commerials should be s them and not the children

on the other ",16
2689, you can see advertisements almost everywhere nowadays and children can ,16
2690, see them these advertisements could be posters and malls or near toyshops children get influenced by advertisements in any way ,0
2691," by tv commercials also it would be good for the market and the state to have more people buying more products

in my opinion the ",23
2692, that children are influenced by many things ,7
2693, easy makes advertising for such a young group morally problematic because you may change their perception of the real products in a big manner this system could ,2
2694, they cant buy their children certain products over and over again because they dont have the money this would be bad for everyone involved in this system in the end the parents have to buy the products advertised for their children ,2
2695, it is their choice to buy it they dont have to buy things that they dont want their child to play with ,20
2696, they should be the ones that get convinced to buy the product the commercials should be s the parents and not the children,2
2697,"today really every children has the chance to watch tv its not important how old they are or some thing like this when there parents watch tv the children watch it too now is the question should television advertising not be allowed 
young children aged  are in a phase of learning they learn new thing all the time but its better if they learned things by a book or from their parents they could watch eight hours tv but i doesnt think that the parents will watch children tv for eight hours so the young children must watch the tv for older person and this isnt good for children most of the time in this series or movies are things which arent for their young age
for childrens is it better if they play outside or play with a friend its more important for children to play with a pet but to watch tv isnt the best thing in the age of them its important to be in action and to find friendships they must be social and not alone but tv has ",14
2698," good things for children in children series like benjamin blã¼mchen they could learn something over friendships pets and other things 

its absolutly ok if young children watch tv but they must have a limited time and specifical channels which is only for young children ",6
2699," they parents must bring the children to make sports or meet with friends 

",1
2700,"well newspapers brought up the question if the advertising material broadcast in television for children aged between two and five years are harmful to them this controversial question is such important to be discussed with regard to the mental growth of young children

first of all advertising wants to face all ages of society ",14
2701, sell as many products as possible as adam smith formerly said there is an economical ,23
2702, which says that we should not disturb the market ,23
2703," as to provide maximal wealth for the whole world if there is no evident need of interacting against the market we shoud not 

on the other ",23
2704, children are not conscious of what they remark ,7
2705, they watch tv they begin to develop a strong desire for a product shown on tv without knowing what it means exactly if the marketing group present a product with a lot of colour children will be attracted automately and ,0
2706, of this parents will be interrogated by them children are very patient ,9
2707," it comes to be ambitious for a goal like purchasing a product

ultimately we can say that many children nowadays are faced with advertising for prosperitive reasons of a business but ",0
2708," i recommend not to create new restricting elements to prohibit this things for businesses it is unbearable to see that liberal ideas of marketing are being destroyed  

in my opinion we should do everything that there are nearly no restrictions for companies trying to sell their products finally it is obvious that we are those who are in charge of reducted prizes if we prohibit trivial marketing tricks of big brands",23
2709,advertising is spread everywhere on the street in newspapers on apps billboards mobile devices television just everwhere you can reach the people it affects us more or less but ever thought how it affects our children ,0
2710," on tv are they even undestanding it

children spend more and more time infront of the television theyre not often outdoor theyre more interessted in watching tv and as its easier for the parents to let them watch series or films they spend hours infront of the screen lets say an hour a day makes up seven hours a week every twenty minutes an interval of advertising leads to one hour and fourtyfive minutes advertising per week a huge ammount of time
however are they even affected by advertising one may say ",14
2711, no cause how should be a child affected by watching coffe shampoo or car advertising it neither has a relation to these topics nor has it an interest in them but as a matter of ,14
2712," advertising is a huge market and really well done of course you dont see a head and shoulders promotion clip on a channel for children the interests of children are more in toys adventure parks and other children places 

everyone of us has been in the situation walking through shops with a child its not that much fun as a normal shopping tour every ",16
2713, thing has to be analyzed every ,21
2714," to be touched and every fourth has to be bought its easy to rise desires about new toys or clothes in a child
now imagine almost two hours a week advertising agencies have the possibilities to tell our children what their new desires are not a nice imagination isnt it you dont even need fiveteen minutes to persuade an adult of a new good if its well done ",0
2715," how long does it need to persuade a child

do we really want to let someone else telling our children their desires do we really want to have some advertising directed children do we really want to allow advertising for children",16
2716,"everybody knows that television advertising is a lot about overreacting and false statements people in our age know what is true and what is false but what about the little children that get confronted with those advertisings every single day does it has an influence on them or should it be banned from the television

first of all little children at the age  have no idea what money is when they see something they want they scream and cry until they get it they dont care if it costs a lot money because they have no idea what is they are easily impressed and thats what advertising do what isnt correct and should be banned from tv they show little kids something that even hasnt to be true just to get the money of their parents because they know that the kids dont care if a toy costs an amount of money and the worst thing is that the toys arent even that good as shown in the advertising and that leads us to problem number two

the industry doenst care what happens with their products ",14
2717, they are bought they would sell a dangerous toy to a little child or something that doenst belong in the hands of a five year old just to get money technologies like mobile phones tablets or video games that are only for adults are made attractiv for children in advertising those games have an influence on those children it shouldnt be allowed to show little children what a computer is how cool they are and that they need one ,2
2718," to have fun on a long car trip with the family

the last ",18
2719, is that those advertisings make looking television for young children attractiv by seeing cool toys on tv they get stuck to it and keep watching and with that they start to see things that isnt meant for young eyes ,14
2720," movies for adults advertising for adults or even gaming shows

in my opinion young children shouldnt even be in the near of a television nor of another technology if they see a toy in the store that they like and they want to buy it ",14
2721, they should have it because they want to explor it and not because some movie spots made false statements about it in the other ,12
2722, there isnt such a thing as getting out with the little kids and have with them outside in the yard or in the forest no advertising ever said they should get out and have fun with other children or their family,1
2723,i donâ´t know if i have correctly understand the task but if the statement is television advertising  at the age of  should not be allowed i ask myself which children at this age are interested in television advertising the feelings wahrnehmung of this young children isnâ´t good like at a erwachsenen human the children donâ´t know what they see there at the screen maybe they see there a tree or an animal and they say oh there is a horse they are happy to see this and ,13
2724," i donâ´t think that they want to know what the message of this television advertising is and which absicht the director of this has

so i ",11
2725," with the statement in hope of the right understanding by myself 
",21
2726," that young children should not be allowed to watch too much tv because of the television advertising 

the tv is probably the most common media around the world and every modern household has one or more itâ´s really fun to watch movies shows and ",17
2727, on with the whole family ,18
2728, alone itâ´s entertaining and a part of the todays society when ,6
2729," about my childhood i remember all these kids shows which i watched with my parents with all these characters and their names which i remember till today the tv is a popular media for every age and there should be an oppertunity for every kid to experience it
the real problem about tv are the ads or television advertising which are annoying for all of us when we watch a movie there are always breaks about five till ten minutes where they show us the most popular products and ",17
2730," influences us because music background colour and much more create a new picture of the product in our head we start to really want to have these products and kids shouldnâ´t be influenced like that at such a young age
i guess that tv shows and movies are always connected with ads and itâ´s not possible to have the whole tv experience without the annoying ads ",2
2731, should have the chance to watch the kids shows and talk with their friends about it but only for a specific amount of time ,12
2732, they donâ´t get to influenced by the advertising there should be a tv channel only for kids without ads ,14
2733," the parents can relax and donâ´t have to worry
still the kids shouldnâ´t watch too much tv because sometimes itâ´s much more fun to play outside with their friends 

because of these reasons ",17
2734, that yound children should not be allowed to watch too much tv because of the television advertising but they should have the oppertunity to experience this kind of media,13
2735,the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is a sentence i would discouss ,15
2736,"
firstly i want to say that i think television is okay but not to much not the whole day the childrends have to play in the nature whoever where exactly the forrest the street the garden its not important where exactly they play but they have to play outside i hate it ",17
2737, childrend are only inside and look tv ore relax the whole day kids have to play outside and didnt watch tv the whole day when its evening and they watch the sandman ,1
2738, its okay but i think young childrends arent alloud to watch much tv its important to find social contacts and learn things and you could only learn this ,17
2739, you are with friends in the television you can find much stupid things and worse series childrend coulndt notice if the series tells really things ore only stupid and unreall things its very important to protect childrend ,6
2740, they will think that the television only tells good and really things ,17
2741, i can comprimise with the statement because i think its important to show chioldrend in this age how to play outside and have fun without television but i ,17
2742, think that childrend are allow to watch tv but only a bit and only the series which are for kids,17
2743,"should it be allowed to make directed advertising for young children in the age of 

for the ",16
2744, the children could get lead to watch even more tv if they like the advertisings because they look colorful and funny for example the children are looking one hour per day tv ,14
2745, theyre wathcing advertisings too this could lead them to watch more tv because it looks ,10
2746," funny and nice
but advertisings can be useful too like helping the parents to find a present for their kids if their children saw a nice toy in the advertising what they want they can wish to get this toy so a boy who saw a nice train with trainstation in the advertising can tell his parents that he wants them for christmas the parents will buy it for christmas and they dont have the struggle of thinking the whole day what they could give their child to christmas
a big ",0
2747," against the advertising is that children get influenced by advertisings and even more if theyre young as you see if a advertising looks funny and colorful the children want it and try their parents to buy it for christmas or birthday
but ",0
2748, if the parents are too afraid that their children could get influenced could easily shut down the tv or use some streaming services like netflix maybe the children of 4 years are allowed to watch 1 hour per day tv but the parents are afraid that their children get influenced by the advertisings ,14
2749," the parents could swap to a streaming service where their children could watch many series without any advertising

in my own opinion ",17
2750, that its nescessary to deny every advertising for children because ,13
2751, children shouldnt watch much tv at all in the age of  and if the parents are to afraid that their children could get influenced they just have to shut down the tv dont have to buy the toys in the advertisings or use some streaming services without advertisings so today theyre much options for parents to protect their children of the influence of advertisings,14
2752, with the statement for the reasons i show you below ,21
2753," of the cause of advertising

for young children it is much more difficult to unterscheiden the reality from fiction they are more likely to misunderstand the advertise and get a false impression of the world children are influenced by everything they know espacially from what they see so it is easier to get them wanting a product ",0
2754," it is to get adults
for a child it is not good to see those advertisings on television and they get addictect to a world of consume

on the other ",2
2755, we have to look from the advertisers view as i said kids are much easier to influence like this advertisers get easy new customers the kids really want to have a cool product they saw on tv also parents will buy more often things for their child ,2
2756," the child will become a new customer the parents will too so companies can make very efficient advertising for less money
ads for kids are ",16
2757," important to many companies many tv stations need it too if there were no ads like these stations like kika or other stations for kids would have to close most of their advertising direct to children and without them they get no more money

in the end you can not forbide ads directed  it would cause too much damage to the industry of television and the toys companies i know this advertising is not really good for a child but if parents think like this too they can easily forbide their children to watch stupid tvshows all day long",14
2758,today many pople have a ttelevision at home and watch many hours  ,6
2759," to them  some of the advertisings are  aged  should that be allowed or not

sometimes adervertising is drected toward children because the person behinfd it things that it could be good for promotions because they tell their parents to ",16
2760, buy a candys because they looked ,18
2761," delicious on the tv or they want a bike because the advertising said you need a bike to be cool it influences children some people say in a good way because they learn to have an opinion on certain things or learn to tell what they want others say it is a bad influence because the advertising tells them what to do and mabye keeps them watching tv or get an wrong opinion of what they really need in life

youngh children should play outside and not watch advertisings and get influenced by it they should have they prioritys else where because it could have an effect on their character or they behavior and there its again some say in a helping way and some in a daming way it could help them to see how they people behave in the advertising and they could lern new words because if it is directed to them they are intrested it ",0
2762," could damige the way the children used to think or behave because they think that in the advertising the people get a kind of an idol for them and sometimes they are just not real because they play everything

also the company who make those advertising would go out of work an it would cost many workers who have no work anymore an no many and thats not good for the state

advertising with foods could ",0
2763, be dangerous because mabye they say its a healty candy but everybodey knows it is not and their parents try everything to convince them but they cant because the children ar already ,4
2764, infuenced by the advertisingit could ,11
2765, help them in some way  ,9
2766," a children smoothie advertising and they mabye want to live an healty lifestyle

but mostly imported is that the most children in these age cant really think like that and they just watch it and what ever happens happens

",2
2767, parents should decide wether they should watch it or not they decide wahts best for their kids they know them and they know if it would be goog or bad helpfull or dangerously it should be up to the parents  ,12
2768, there should be a law or something,19
2769,"how often have i seen a parent arguing with his or her child at the supermarket 
no lily we will not get these chocolate cereals put them back now 
but muuuum pleaaase ect 
i can imagine how annoying these shopping trips with kids like that have to be for parents and whos to blame the advertisings on tv just recently i found myself discussing with my friends about ads ",2
2770, ads concidering kids its brainwashing is what one of my friends said and ,16
2771, that is to some extend quite true children are watching tv at a very young age these days and no doubt that they find tons of ads there i get the feeling that its getting crazier and crazier too all the toys are getting bigger better more exciting and ,14
2772," grandma ask lily what shed like for her birthday he will answer with something she discovered whilst watching tv
on the other ",18
2773," that one could forbid all the ads if one wanted to be fair or non at all because companies just want to make profits dont they they want to sell their products so they have their ads streamed on tv its just how it works
so ",15
2774," its ok that television advertising directed to children is allowed
",13
2775,in the following i give some ,21
2776," and will discribe if young children are allowed to use television 

you often hear that young children aged  are using ",17
2777, much television because the parents watch ,17
2778," much tv or the parents havent got any time for their own children 
",1
2779," young boys and girls are watching tv or play some games on the tablet or the laptop from their parents if the parents havent got much time to play with their children little games like memory or hide and see or go outsite in the forest and take a walk
also the kids learn how to act with the media and that could be very important for they future 
but if the young children are watching to much tv they want more from day to day the media are ",17
2780, bad for the eyes if the children make the television to their hobby it could be that they were fatter and fatter because only watch tv is boring ,17
2781," that it should be allowed that the children use the television if its not more than one hour on a day 
 ",17
2782, of all i have to say that i am not shure about the vocabulary in the question ,21
2783," i am going to answer the question if childrem from age  should watch as much tv as people at a higher age 

no i really do not think children this age ",17
2784," older children should watch much tv they are young they are children they should go outside play soccer drive around with their bike or inlineskates the contact to other kids is much more important than to hang around on the sofa an watsch something very uninterlectual and things nobody needs as a child you should experience the world with friends or with your family you should experience it on your own an do not watch tv and see how painted figures do that the series for children often do not have anything to learn something from ore worse they learn something but not the good things the bad things only 

but if they watch tv because soetimes it is okay they should watch a series they can learn soething good from parents should give strict rules for the tv and give ",17
2785," the children are allowes to watch tv and what they are allowed to watch
 it would be horrible if a child this young age turns on the tv in the evening an something thar shows war or even just blood or dead would be showen there they should only watch tv together with their parents ",17
2786," they can control what and how long they do it

in my childhood i was only allowed to watch tv one hour a day and only if i was nice the day ",17
2787," the older i got the more i was allowed to watch tv today i know what is on the tv and i am glad and thankful my parents stopped me watching tv in the late evening or in the night 

parents in genereal should not let their young children watch tv all the time ore even alone if a five years old child or even younger or a bit older sees something brutal ore sexual on tv they would not know how to deal with that
but the parents should make them clear they just want to protect them and not want do vorbid evberything that seems to be nice children can not imagine what happens in the world and think everything is nice parents have to make them clear it is not and have to protect them
there wonâ´t be enough time for playing outside ",17
2788, they should use the time they have at this wonderful young age and should not waste it on bullshit like tv,1
2789,"today the television is a normal part of our day most people sitting in the evening in front of there tv and watching the news but the program changes over the last years first there are only some movies for adults but today half of the dayâ´s program are for children especially young children in the age of  can sit the whole day in front of the tv and watch any series but should this be allowed or not
",17
2790," most children who watch tv the whole day do this because they canâ´t do anything else when they go to the kindergarten they hear all other children talk about a new series in tv or about the last episode or movie because of that they have to watch this series or movie too to talk with other children about this this can be one reason why children wnt to watch tv 
an other reason ",17
2791," the parents of a child have to go to work and the child is the afternoon completly alone it watch tv because itâ´s boring without anyone who could play with the child so itâ´s just for being entertained 
but this arenâ´t reasons why it should be allowed just why children watch the whole afternoon tv 
when you have a look in this series for children ",17
2792, you can find some really interesting ,18
2793, but the rest is nonsense for adults it can be possible to split of the ,4
2794, and the other stuff but could do a child this splitting off i donâ´t think ,19
2795," 
and because of that the children gets stupid ideas and will have confusing dialogues with friends because each friend have an other stupid idea
in my opinion the parents of a child should really try to cotrole the time their children will sit in front of a tv you have to allowed your children to watch tv otherwise they havenâ´t the chance of find new social connections because they havenâ´t a topic to talk about but it will be better for a child to play with friend or there parents without any electric stuff because itâ´s better for education the of the child",17
2796,the statement television advertising  should not be allowed can be seen from two ,15
2797, one is the one of the parents or maybe just grownups ,9
2798, if their child sees something on tv an they want to own it its their parents fault ,9
2799, they wont buy them evry single thing they see furthermore a child might take the advertisment the wrong way in many advertisments for young children there are other young children playing with the product and it seems like theyre having fun ,2
2800, the child whos watching the adverisment thinks it can only be happy ,20
2801," itll be able to have what they have 

on the other ",19
2802, those advertisments are mostly shown on channels which are ,11
2803," for young people and what if they would just show advertisments for grownups on those channels would it be okay to show a fiveyearold an advertisment for sex toys or something similar to that because advertisments will be there to finance the channels
nowadays its normal for everyone to see advertisments everywhere and whether or not they are directed at us they often catch our attention so ",14
2804, certain advertisments which are s young children arent allowed they would ,16
2805," see advertising the question is whats worse for them 

in my opinion advertisments for young children are fine its not the best thing theyll get to see on tv but its ",14
2806, not the worst channels for children should have children friendly content and if that includes advertisments thats okay therefore ,16
2807, with the statement television advertising toward young children should not be allowed,13
2808,nowadays  everybody has a computer or a smartphone young children ,24
2809," as adults people learn more  by television and lesser from books or other people but is this way of modern studying good for children 
 
today there were a lot of different channels on tv ",17
2810," channels speciel for children on this channels a lot of shows try to teach young children on an easy way about different science from physics about biologie and chemie usual all day situation were explained by simple test mostly on a funny way 
this shows were created very funny speciel to children ",6
2811," they were interest and learn more effectifly
on the otherhand ",8
2812," were the most programms on tv not made for chilfren at all there werde sitcoms with dirty jokes or boring newsshows children watch bad shows and comedies they were very funny but are not created to teach anything to young cildren 

",6
2813, young children learn most effectifly in human contact with their mum and dad or their friends in this way they get their  education in early years by own adventures tv should ,17
2814, be allowed but only in regulated   times and with special shows for children with a high potencial of education ,12
2815," this is a good idea because if young children watch tv too often they will become stupid and lazy in this age you have as parents the task that you could build up a relationship with your children 
watching tv will not help you with that for young children it is much more important to do something namely sports ore somthing in which you learn to kow other childrens this is the case because the modern people have to learn social interaction as early as possible
regarding the the tv too often takes away your sense of the reality if your kids do that you should do something against it because they will never learn something about real life if thea are watching tv all the time finding themselves in a virtual world
tv is teaching your children bad things theres ",17
2816, the bad vocabulary no its ,18
2817, the actions if the children see in the tv how they make dangerous things and it didnt harm them ,17
2818," they may try to do the same things and this could be really dangerous
but dont worry about the danger of watching tv there is a good method to bring the children not to do that you have to tell them that they will become squared eyes they will believe that and they will not watchig tv anymore
till now it shoud be clear that watching tv is a bad idea for young children but how it is for older",17
2819,"should television advertising be allowed toward young children

the advertising has a big influence on everybody ",13
2820, the young children who have little knowlege about the world and its dangers companies could use this advertises to influence our society early on and make a whole generation dependent on their products but it might not be such a big problem because the young children dont have the money to even buy these products and if the parents reject to buy them the children will fastly forget about them it is ,0
2821, questionable if the children which are aged  would even understand what this advertising is all about if the companies manage to get their slogan inside the mind of the children in the way that they will recognize it ,16
2822, they see it in a shop they will beg their parents to buy this specific product ,3
2823, the quality and the price are ,18
2824, the other ones in this stage ,18
2825, it comes to parents wheter they give in or they take their time and explain the children why this product is worse this is an importent part of childhood and if this is missing it will be a problem for the child ,2
2826, it has to manage his own earnings so ,23
2827, that it has to be forbidden to show advertises  it is about the parents to teach them enough about life ,13
2828, that they can deal the right way with their funds and the advertising that is nowdays found evrywhere,23
2829,"the question that im gonna talk about is if television advertising should be allowed which is mostly focused towards young children in the age between two and five years
advertising has a big impact on how someone is thinking about certain things young children are more affected by those ads than older people

one thing that i dont like about these advertisings is that they use lights colours and camera movements that give the children the toughts that they need this toy not because they like it but because they need it and if they ask they parents the same question over and over again most parents give up and purchase their kid that toy

a positive feature that these ads give is that children dont feel out of place because only ads for their parents is shown the ads for a younger group is mostly shown on channels that are general made for younger kids if ads for a new car are shown there children cant do anything with that information they give with ads for their age they interests are spoken to not from their parents





my opinion about these ads is that kids shouldnt get that feeling that they need it but im not against advertisings ads must be made ",13
2830, a channel can pay their staff and other costs and companies do these ads targeted towards children because it works most parents want to give their child anything ,0
2831," he or she is happy im not against ads targeted towards young children if parents dont like that their kids watch ads they should do something with their kid between ad break

 another bad thing about ads targeted towards children for the children is that they dont do something else between ad breaks and waste alot of their life time but ",16
2832, they are kids later they ,24
2833, watch ads because they are used to it this is something that companies want they obviously want that their ads are being watched but this as i already pointed out a big time waster but ads need to be that way ,11
2834," parents should do something against that

 with advertisings towards younger children they learn how to have an opinion on something or with the help of their parents they learn how to use their money correctly or that they dont need everything they see this will open the gates for a healthier lifestyle because they already know that they dont need everything to be happy but this can only be achieved with help from their parents if the parents are strong minded they can help their kids not to worry about everthing they see",2
2835,"in the following i will write a essay about the statementtelevision advertising  aged  should not be allowed

it can be allowed because many advertising are good for there knowledge but there can be adverstising which are not good for young children young children are watching television in the morning ",13
2836, there are series for them but if they are watching in the evening thats not good because there can be advertisings for old people but very often the children watched television with there parents and if they are watching allone the most children passed the advertising away it will be good for the young children ,6
2837," the advertising allowed a lots of the advertising are funny and very interesting the young children are going to bed very early the advertising help them to learn the  language so advertising can help them 
advertising can be ugly fe ",0
2838," they show what will be hapen if you are smoke zigarettes they show it with some ugly pictures the pictures are not good for young children because it can be scary for them
its good for the young children ",6
2839, the advertising should be allowedbecause some advertising are for young children  they are funny and very interesting the advertising are good to improve the language beacuse the children who are younger ,16
2840, five years they can not  speak good they are definitly some advertising which are not good for young people but the most of them are in the evening ,16
2841,in the following text ill ,21
2842," to the statement that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
",15
2843, there are some problems with advertising direct toword young children mainly because they are far too easy to influence and ,16
2844, the young children wont be able to buy the products they see in the advertising anyway the whole ,16
2845, of this is to make these  young children absoulutly want the product ,2
2846, they will make their parents buy it for them so ,3
2847, the advertising isnt  the adults they are ones wholl have to pay ,16
2848, but what would be a conclusion  obviously it isnt an opportunity to just forbid advertising for products which are made for young children ,13
2849, the only way to solve this  problem is to make advertising toword the adults ,16
2850, to try to persuade the adult who is watching the advertising that hisher child needs that product that way you stop young children from being influenced by advertising but the companys will ,0
2851," be able to sell their products a problem with this system could be that it is hard to tell what directly  means and what the companys would have to change to change to make it  adults 

in the end i definetly ",23
2852, it is just a way to get money from adults by influencing their children which shouldnt be allowed,12
2853,in the time age we live in homes without television or other technical advices are very rare from a young age you get used to those advices and ,17
2854," the children in an age between  get very affected out of this the question should television advertising  not be allowed anymore arises

first of all the children are mainly too young to understand the advertisings they are seeing in the way those were supposed to they are just seeing many colours and some foreign people who are playing with a toy or eating some delicious food however this would not affect any child in a bad way maybe they would stress their parents and force them to buy them this product but that would not be a bad affection

on the other ",14
2855, the people who set those advertisings up don not care about how smart or dumb the clips for television are they just care about which way may bring the best possible win for their own company they do not want to educate the children with the advertise they do not care if the children who are watching the advertise take the things they are seeing for real ,0
2856," it is completely unreal and from a fantasy world 

another problem is that parents more and more tend to use the television as an entertaining program for their kids therefore those would see all those advertisings which are partly not even true or real and ",10
2857, they would want to have all those things the moral values get lost sooner or later and the kids just sit in front of their tv ,12
2858," going out and play games with their friends furthermore they do not want to play anymore with the other kids because they have that many toys that they are not interested in other kids anymore because the toys are more special for them

to sum it all up ",24
2859, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed for me the producer of advertisings care too less about the educational value they should have for children in the age between  this affects them extremely because they get used to dumb things and maybe ,13
2860, would do dumb things in their real life or think those dumb things are not dumb but smart,3
2861,"the question whether tvadvertisments which are  children aged between  should be allowed or not has caused a huge discussion lately 
first of all advertisments are often designed to be really manipulating for ",13
2862, adults and children however children are much easier to impress ,8
2863, they dont have much knowledge and are usually naive to take ,3
2864, of this naive mind by advertising a product which they should buy is certainly morally questionable furthermore the company knows exactly that children between the age  are not able to buy something on their own ,2
2865, the parents have to buy the often expensive toys for their children because the children are annoying them ,20
2866," they dont have what they wanted
however ",3
2867, its questionable if a child between  even understands the advertisments and that the products in it are real things they could probably think it is part of a show ,2
2868," and do not even know that the thing they see is available for them to purchase  
moreover you could say that its the fault of the parents it is up to them to set rules and to make it clear to the child that they cannot buy everything they want or they could simply set tvtimes to make sure their child is not watching too much shows and advertisments or they could watch tv together which their child and decide on their own which toys to buy in the end it is all a matter of parental education if the child is more manipulated by advertisments than by their own parents 
in my opinion tvadvertisments for young children should ",2
2869," be allowedbesides that i dont know whether a child even understands what they see in the tvi think its up to the parents to educate their child in a way that they know they cannot get everything and maybe they can even teach their child to be satisfied with what they have
",17
2870,advertising has an very important use for media and products it is useful to convince people to buy what you want to sell or to get exposure for your company there is no problem for companies to advertise their products but can it be directed to every group of people there need to be ways to get people buying your products and television advertising is definately one of them many people watch tv every day and that makes it one of the biggest entertainment sources ever  it it really important to advertise but the question now is should television advertising ,15
2871," be  very young children  
the reasons why it should be allowed is that television advertising is for everyone that means it is for every group in the society and the young children are one of them companies that sell products for young kids need their advertisements to gain money and exposure if companies didnt do that children would not have as much fun as they are having because they dont get the kind of toys they like the childhood is a very important stage of life it sets the ",14
2872," milestone in our lives and a beautiful and easy childhood will definately influence the future 
young children are seemlingly very influential that is a ",8
2873, what they see and adore at the ,3
2874, moment they witness it they run to their parents and tell them that they have seen something in the television and they want it for their birthday present the problem with television advertising is that it has a big influence on people ,10
2875, children and that could cause parents to buy stuff for their children that they should not ,9
2876," lego that could be swallowed by a young children there the parents have to really pay attention and have to make their own impressions on the products they but for their kids 
in my opinion its not okay to advertise products that are directly towards young children because it can really produce accidents and problems which ",2
2877," have to be solved by the parents and take even their time away advertising is just too influential for young kids
",2
2878,"my question is television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
you can discuss how good is advertising but today we only discuss is it good for kids in the age  you can see it from two different sites on the one site are the companies on the other the parents and kids saver but i start with the companies the thing is that kids in this age think everything is true they cant deside is it true or false so ",13
2879, they say we have the best product ever and shows some sweet figures they love this product a big example is ferrero with the kinderschokolade ãœberraschungsei or kinderschokobons they annimate the chocolate and shows the kids how good it is and the speaking ,0
2880,says to the kids that they buy seven ,20
2881," so they influence the thoughts of the kids and they do this to have thees custromers later so they make much money with the ads
on the other ",0
2882," you have the parents they dont want that their child are a zombie of any advertising companies they want that the kids knew that choclate is not good that there is many sugar in they want that they eat vegetables and that they do sports anyway kids who cant see the ads make their own thoughts and kids dont watch tv the hole day they go out and play with their friends

",2
2883, that you as parents must have the choice if you dont want that your child see ads they watch only the public channels ,13
2884, kika or ard in the morning but ,18
2885, the parents say it doesnt matter if my child see ads or not ,16
2886, it can watch the private channels too eg superrtl or diseychannel,6
2887,"advertisement is everywhere nowadays it is a part of our everyday life and it is  all of us young and old that brings forth the question should we allow advertising 

small children are very naive and dont know how to form their own opinion ",16
2888," therefore advertisement directed directly toward them will have a big influence on them if an advertisement tells a small child that the product is the best thing in the world a small child will not be able to see through the marketing desguise of the advertisement and will instead just believe it and demand for their parents to buy it therefore advertisement  is very dangerous as it influences their perception of reality by displaying a false image of products and it can lead to them being spoiled and having false priorities in life

on the contrary one might ",0
2889," say that the parents are responsible for their children and with that it is their job to decide wether something is suited for their child or not therefore banning television asvertising  children is not nessesary because the parents should be the ones preventing their children from being influenced by these advertisements and with that becoming a vilctim of the marketing industry at such a young age 

personally ",13
2890, that advertising  small children does not need to be banned in my opinion the parents are responsible for their children and with that they are ,13
2891, responsible for what their children see on television though i do find it morally questionable to try and use a childs innocently naive perception of the world to sell your products it is ,2
2892, the parents duty to teach their child what is right and important and what isnt ,9
2893," give reasons and examples for and against the following statement television advertising  aged  schould not be allowed 

nowdays the juse of mobile technic is getting a higher position some people say it is a positive change but some people say it is a really negative change a reason against this statement could be that these children can leran something out of these television programs but ",15
2894, it ist important which chanal they wacht if it is a grate show where you can learn something about the nature and life ,6
2895, it is a good thing like the show in germany wissen macht a it is a show where two people are teaching the children some spizific words they had asked for but in this age ,6
2896, it is to early to try to teach the children some things this way because a two years old children canâ´t really understand what they are talking about so i tink it is important to show it with pichtures and picture stories a positive reason for this statement is that children are sitting all the day inside and are watching tv and are not going out to play foot with other children and they are not doing tings on  their own wrong because they learned it fom the tv another reason ist that ,8
2897," every children is watching tv they can not have good connections and friendships and this is a really bad thing every child has to ceep in contact to other cildren without tv

in all ",17
2898, jung i loved it to play outisde with my friends and ,18
2899, it is ok if they sometimes watch tv but the relationship to other children is more important they have to learn something about life outside the parentshouse they have to do something wrong ,17
2900," they can learn out of it 
",7
2901,television computers mobile phones and many other thing are used nowadays by billions of people all around the world some parents allow their childen to watch television at an age of 234 or 5 in the following ,17
2902," give my opinion about the statement television advertising  young aged  should not be allowed

first of all ",13
2903, watching tv is kind of a nonsportive hobby which you should use not that much especially for childen with low ages the parents have to decide and controll their children ,17
2904, every mother or father have to look up for their childen to teach them what they can do and what they can not do the tv and the theme of the series you watch in the tv can influence the childen with low ages in the future ,17
2905, it depends on the series you let your child watch whether it influences your child in a good or bad way nethertheless ,6
2906, that you should not let a 2 year old watch tv because it just donâ´t make sense because the child doesnâ´t understand those themes at a higher age ,8
2907," you can confrontate your children with modern technologies but a tv should be one of the last things 

in my opinion at some age you canâ´t avoid your children watching tv because ",17
2908, other children are watching tv your child will come to you and will say my friends are watching tv ,1
2909, watch it too to avoid this situation you can let your child watch tv in lower ages but it should be controlled by parents at the end it depends on the child and their reaction about tv and the parents who can decide on their own whether they want their childen to watch tv or whether not ,17
2910,"television advertising   young children aged  should not be allowed

",13
2911," try to find my opinion to this difficult and hard statement in our modern world

 when i was younger at the age  i watched not ",21
2912, much televison or just a short time my parents said that the telvison is bad for my brain ,17
2913, i paint many pictures and played the whole time with my toys my best friend watched the whole day televison becouse his parents had no time for him ,1
2914, they allowed him that i was always jeallous but ,19
2915," that you want something what you cant get
today ",18
2916, it s more difficult to dont allowed the children that they cant watch televison becouse our world is really modern and in every house are many electronic for example my family have got 4 mobile phones 4 computer 2 tablets and 3 tvs this is a example for our modern world you cant say to a child who grow up with ,17
2917, much electronic that he cant watch television when i was younger and my parents went out they always took the tv stick fernbedienung with them ,1
2918," i cant watch tv and if i watched tv  my parents i always take care that i watch just the films for my age

so my opinion is to this statement that children who are in the age of  can watch tv but they can just watch for a short time and the parents have to take care of them that they cant watch any film above there age 

",17
2919, children could be maipulated very fast if an advertisment is shown in the television which says that thy have to buy this toy they would buy it quickly without thinking about it sometimes an advertiment isnt for the age of the little children like eisde those advertimsents should be shown in the evening ,2
2920," the children are sleeping and on channels for adults the advertisments should be made for kids in the age who are whatching the channel where the advertisment is on air if there is a movie on tv in the evening the channel should take care that there is an advertisment for kids
on the other ",14
2921, it should be allowed because the companies could make more money with their advertisment because some children see a toy and want to buy it and the channel could make more money too if they can show more advertisment and the children dont get what the advertiment is talking about ,13
2922," they dont care about it but if the children are whatching the channels for adults the parents have to take care that their child dont whatch the channel and only the program which is made for it 
in my opinion the advertisments should be made for the kids if they are  and if they switch on a channel which isnt made for kids it wouldnt be the mistake of the advertisment or of the channel but advertisments like eisde should be shown ",14
2923," the children are definitly in their bed and are sleeping if not their parents have to take care that they dont have a chance to see those advertisments 
",16
2924," discuss the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed 
children are more likely to be influenced by advertising than adults and they get to see a lot advertising it seems like 50 percent of the time there is advertising on telvision 
kids that grow up with ",13
2925, they are adults so early influenced children will probably grow up to be very hard conumers good for the economy but bad for them of course i wont have to be this way but it is an often used ,7
2926," on this theme
also there is a difference between a kid seeing the newest game on tv to an adult seeing the newest beauty product or something kids often want it imidietly because it is faster prettyer or if it only has a new featur even thou they have something just like this at home i guess ",20
2927," parents let their children watch tv they know how much advertising their kids will get to see so you could say it is their decission but to distract your children completly from watching tv is nowerdays not that easy 
so if children would get to see less of this advertising i hope they would not be influenced this much anymore i dont think advertising toward young children should be completely forbidden but ",13
2928, there should be a mark of how much advertising is allowed on television channels  children,14
2929,i am writing an essay about the question if it is good ,21
2930," the television advertising  you often see on televison that advertising is directed to young childten age two or five the reason is that they want that the children want to have something how they saw at the television they run to their partens and scream and want this wonderful teddy the saw on televison is this bad for the revolution of the children

it is right that the parents often are stresst and have no time then it is good ",14
2931, the children have something to do the television is the best thing ,1
2932, all children love to whatch something funny but at the advertising comes a lot of rubbish there are things for adults and not for childrenon this ,20
2933, is it good that the advertisindis  because it is better ,11
2934, they saw something about the easther bunny ,19
2935," what the kardashians are make with her money

on the other ",19
2936, many rubbish to see at advertising it is not good for the children ,16
2937, they saw all these things on television they become to children how want everything the do not live in a real world i would be better ,3
2938," they whatch one film in one piece without advertisig after that they could go outside and play football with friend and have social contact

in the end ",1
2939, that it have positiv and negativ ,21
2940, that the television advertising  aged two or five the most of them is not very bad for the children ,14
2941, it is no problem but ,18
2942, the young children whatch to often television ,17
2943,in this essay i will you say ,21
2944," for and against television advertising  youg children should not be allowed television advertising is today a very important themathic during you watch television its imposible to didnt look a television advertising 

the importest ",13
2945, for television advertising directet toward young children is that the chlidrens should learn what they should do and how to react with these television advertising its a important thing to learn in the young age to not be infulenced by something with television advertising the children can ,14
2946, see what for new stuff to play are coming out and ,18
2947, can decide wich play they want to wish maybe for a birthday children television ,20
2948," have to win money and thats impoossible without television advertising

argument against television advertising  is that its to dangerous its possible that the children want every month new plays and just beacouse they see it on the television and is it really okey during a children television show to see a television advertising another ",14
2949, is that television advertising influence children often in a negative way in the view of the parents its ,14
2950," of saftey and responsbility who must to be there or even not

for me its to dangerous and a to big responsibility for the parents its complicated ",9
2951, television advertising show things that children shouldnt see in this age ,14
2952, that its important to grow up without to be influenced with television advertising its not a good ,13
2953, to be influenced in the aged of  they would be enough influenced in a older age,7
2954,nowadays we live in a society in which the most of us have a tv when you watch a film tv show ect every single break between it you can see advertising about erverything on childrens programms ,14
2955," 

televisoin advertising on children programms show most of the time new play stuff like toy cars games or barbies when i was younger i always want to have new things because the companys that sell these things show do these advertising on purpose they want to get higher sold rates with good ideas they influence the children during they watch their favorite series they used special effects specific colors or characters to get more attention they set their products in a perfect light 
young children are more influenced by it than older children because older kids have the knowlegde that they canâ´t get everything and accept it easiler than younger ones they always want to have new play stuff and with advertising their consume will increase more than ",0
2956,"
some people want that those advertising should not be allowed but ",11
2957," want do you want to show childrens tv programms earn money from companys for showing their advertising and you donâ´t want to have advertising of new soap  or not for their age alcohol etc

i doesnâ´t ",13
2958, you should look for younger children ,9
2959, is you have to switch the programm or talk to them during those periods ,19
2960, you donâ´t want that your child is influenced by it another reason is that tv programms donâ´t cut advertising out that easy they were paid for it and it doesnâ´t disturb me at all because ,14
2961, i was younger i learned that i can not get everything on tv and ,6
2962, time i got bored of advertising until now  ,11
2963, with the statement because nowadays there are ,21
2964, many hidden influences in the television like how to act in our modern century mostly of a bad ,6
2965, of view or in case of business ,21
2966, you want people to need special things to be accepted ,21
2967," in television s young children
often tvshows create a wrong view of the reality like creating a different universe or a better world and children at such young age do not understand which one is the real and which is just virtual world
also the normal comunication of children get lost because they are sitting in front of television and learning the informal language ",17
2968, being outside with others and learn to comunicate in the right way ,8
2969,"  in tvshows made for kids
the health suffers too because they do not move as much as the other children who playing outside and having the good influences of nature and they get bad eyes by watching television too much
children at the age  learn mostly imporrtant things in this period like cycling comunicating or to write their names
the biggest part of television they can not understand because there are letters difficult words or formal language
after all i am ",17
2970, the opinion advertising television  in television schould not be allowed,15
2971,to start the given statement wants television advertising  should not be allowed there are different ,15
2972," supporting or weaken this statement
on the one ",21
2973, young children are not able to understand all the presented information or more important not able to question them so they may start believing everything that they were told and could develop a wrong image of realitymoreover they could easily be unhappy or angry ,7
2974, they realize that the product does not conform with their expectations ,3
2975," they are not able to reflect on a explanation
on the other ",19
2976, young children has to make their own experiences to learn from them in their future they will have to deal with wrong promises and unfullfilled expactations anyway ,7
2977, it could be better for them to start early with questioning advertisement therefore television advertising could provoke such a situation and with their gained experience and the explanations of their parents they could learn and be prepared ,2
2978," being totally suprises if such an event occurs in their future
furthermore it is the task of the parents to inform their children about possible dangers caused by television advertising hence they should watch the different adds together with their children and explain them the difference between television and reality concerning promises expactation and given information this could influence the future in a positive wayas the children has to deal with the problem in a conforming way and they start learning on how to questions such adds additionally ",14
2979, in a young age children regard their parents as role models as a ,7
2980," they are willed to learn from them what would be more effective as banning every add which concerns them
furthermore the children watch other adds ",12
2981, they are not addrest they may believe the promises as you can see they are confronted with advertisement anyways ,3
2982," not all of them could be forbidden as a result of this i believe that it is better to confront them with advertisement to give them the chance to learn
finally advertisement could be banned to protect young children howver this is no ",16
2983, children get confonted to advertising at some ,16
2984, learning at young age with the help of their parents would be more effective concerning experience and knowledge,8
2985,in todays world television and media are getting more and more important advertisising in the television is mostly directed to a specific group of people ,10
2986," young children are one of them but should this young group be advertised
children aged  are very easily influenced by everything they see and hear advertisements in the television show them what they really do not need but the adverts make them want that sweets are often displayed with children actors to gain the feeling of need in the watching child ",16
2987, that children should be advertised because of their young age and as a ,16
2988, to this their easy influenceabilty explained on the example of the kinder ãœberraschungsei in this advertisement adults give the chocolat ,0
2989,to children telling them not to open it until the adult gets back the adult leaves the room and the child stays sitting in an empty room with nothing but the ,9
2990,on a table in it every child gets very temptated by the ,8
2991, opens it to see the surprise the watching young children get the feeling to need that too to want that chocolat and the surprise too they want to feel the excitement of the children in the television too in ,18
2992, i would not want my child to be that influenced by people i as the mother do not know and even worse whose intentions i do not know i would want my child only to be influenced by me and my husband and the only other people i would allow that were other tight family members i do not know the people that produced these advertising but ,16
2993," if they would think about this more carefully think about how their child could be influenced they would probably be more careful with what they advertise

2994,we all somehow now a few tricks of the marketing industry whether its special music which aims for avoking a certain mood ,11
2995, listening or a very distinc color pallet to convey a certain message the ,18
2996, that the marketing industry and exspecially the advertising industry is using special methods to achive their aim is undeniable and we can see how tempting it is to buy a thing ,11
2997, we see it in a tv advert so the question is ,18
2998," its already hard for grown men and woman to resist these temptations should it be allowed that tv advertises can be shown which are s children in the age  
",13
2999," it silly to ban these kind of advertises most of the time these advertises are about toys or some special kind of food as we know all things have aprice and kids around that age dont have money or atleast just a small amount of it so the natural cause would be that the kids wont be able to go in the mall and buy the stuff they saw on the tv they would need to ask their parents for money and the parents could desitnguish between blind consumption or the necessety of things 
nevertheless it would be way harder for buisnesses and the industry to sell their products because they cant put the on display anywhere 
in my ",16
3000," of view kids around these age should not watch tv at all well they can watch some kids tv shows but only in a certain amount products for thise age level does not need a special display in the tv because most of the time they are just toys or products the parents would buy for their kids 
instead of allowing these adverts s kids the toy store or drugstores should step their game for example they can redecorate they interior ",14
3001, its more kids friendly i can remeber how exciting it was ,8
3002, as a kid to go to the toy store stores should focus on maintaining this special kind of feelind and anticipation ,20
3003,"nowadays many young children watch alot tv and many advertisings are  children in the following statement i give some explanations whether the advertisings toward children who are under the age two or five should be allowed or not
first of all i have to say that childrens get information about new products so they can talk about these at school or somewhere else furthermore the children are ",13
3004, intigrated in the economic market ,23
3005, the companys have a right to advertise their products ,11
3006, products are made for children but beside these ,2
3007, why the advertisings should not be allowed adding to that is that many  children change their mind about money spending because they have no idea how hard it is to work for money they just go to their parents ,13
3008," they are interested also the kids are not educated enough to understand the rhethoric methods from the companys 
all in all advertisings to children should not be allowed and i can not ",16
3009,when ever a form of media gets invented people will try to use it to their ,3
3010, and try to monetise them via advertising and television is no exeption television advertising used to be incredibly effective ,10
3011, watching the tv was the main source of entertainmentf for the whole family nowadays ,17
3012, most millenials dont really watch cabled television anymore instead they use programms like netfilx or hulu for shows and webistes like msm for news so the tvadvertisers has to find other demographics to appeal to one of those groupes are small children from 9am to 15 pm there is a surprisingly large amount of advertisments directet towards toddlers aged  this calls forth the question is this good for the childs development many people say that manipulating children at such a young age is not acceptable from a moralic perspective children are extreamly guilable and belives most of the things you tell them not only that children aged  are increadibly fast at learning new things if you teach them a new word they will use it and if you show them tons and tons of advertisements they will learn to nay be forced to love those products thats why advetisements directet directly at them have a much stronger effect than advertisements directet at older peoplehowever if you manipulate the children too much you will erase their individuality is creating a future where all people want the same things because they saw the same advertisements ,14
3013, they were children that attracive apperantly for the advertising companies it is ,0
3014, having most people think alike will increase their income me personaly ,23
3015, that having a diverse and colourful ,21
3016, generation is important and nessecairy for the continuation and evolution of the human as a species which is why im adamantly against television advertising s young children ,14
3017,"this topic is going to be about why it should not be allowed to show toward young children aged   television advertising 

well nowadays every child even the youngest are in front of the television just to occupy them and the parents get a small moment in the day the always wished silence from the day but people more and more are starting to question the method to allow the children watch television because there are sometimes just trash and not very childrenfriendly things running in the programme 

the ",13
3018, is that children with this age are very sensitive and influentiable one could ,24
3019," say sort of bit naive because they believe literally nearly every thing what they are told 

the advertising could make them become addicted to   to stuff what the advertising tells them for example ",11
3020, the advertising always is about sweets and how happy these things make you then the youngest and most vulnerable people of our society cannot be longer without sweets because ,2
3021," they wouldnt be happy 

on the other perspective i


 so its connected with many dangers show television advertising  young

",7
3022,if advertising is good or not is a theme ,11
3023, years the statement televison advertising  aged  should not be allowed is officially against it however there are some ,15
3024, which are for television advertising companies need to do that they do these product placements to earn money without it they would earn less ,10
3025, it is very important for them another reason why it should not be allowed is that children want these things more and more in this young age they should not think about that because ,12
3026, they dont get it they try to get it on another way these ways can be dangerous ,3
3027, they steal it or they steal money from the portmoinee of their parents ,3
3028, reasons for television advertising children can discover more find new things and maybe new hobbies they can learn what goes on in the world they dont need to do it on the way adults would do it and the world has changed ,14
3029, we find new ways to discover the world with technologie ,18
3030," 
to sum it all up televison advertising is good it is important for companies and stores to earn money but not ",10
3031, it is  these things buy their parents ,9
3032, there is no need to make advertising for ,11
3033, to forbidden television advertising directed to kids is too hard they should make a law to show customers theirs products on another way in the world of television is enough advertising ,13
3034, children dont need to have their own on the one ha d its important for companies to sell their stuff to new people and ,2
3035, to the youngest of us but these kids mostly dont have money as i said ,24
3036, their parents buy them the things they want or need its good to show parents what they can buy for their kids but most of them dont get what they want just because of advertising in a store you get held from people who work there in television you just see the product and dont know if its good or not to show products advertising is good but its not what the world really needs,0
3037,"this statement makes it worth to think about if should happen or not
firstable it has some positiv and negativ effects i beginn with the negativ ones when the young children are crying you want them to stop ",12
3038, you go to the  television and show them a programm or some something like that but ,1
3039, it does not has something for children to watch you can not show them anything to them also if the parents have no time for them to play maybe they going to give their phones and than it could be addicted to it because it spend ,24
3040, many hours with it in not ,18
3041," much time

and now some positiv ones so if the children grow up without looking ",9
3042, much televison they will not stay for a couple of hours ,1
3043," the television in their young age the children will go outside if it has not something to do at home they wouldnt have the problem to do otherthing as just watching television the children will not be addicted to it like the other children

so ",17
3044, with the statement because it has more positiv effects on the children as negativ onesthis should be clear sure it will be a bit more complicated ,7
3045, the children grow up it will have positiv effects with it but i could understand if some parents hav not time to play with their children ,12
3046, much they could do a compromise that they let their children watch the television with a timelimit ,17
3047, just one hour per day,18
3048,the question i am thinking about today is should advertising television  aged  not be allowed it is a good question in the modern technology time ,15
3049," you can do a lot of better things than sitting in front of the tv to pass your childhood

the main contra ",17
3050, is if young childrens be allowed to look television in their childhood they can learn a lot of different new things for examples in  documentations this could save the parents a lot of explainig and they would be able to do more other things ,17
3051," their kids are watching tv

an other ",17
3052," is that if the little children are looking tv all day long they wont disturb their parents so the parents havent that much stress and maybe would be a little bit calmer

on the other ",17
3053, why should these little kids sitting on the couch watching tv the whole day they could do ,1
3054," many better things for example going outside and play with their siblings or neighbours because a lot of the tv shows involve stupid or not necessairy things wich kids shouldnt know

an other ",1
3055, many different things about how beautiful life isfor this you dont need a tv without one they are at the fresh air or doing something where they are moving and dont sitting stare at the same ,6
3056," for hours  

in conclusion it would be the stupiest thing you could do as a parent if you let your child passing his childhood in front of a tv at some ",17
3057," it would get really boring and the kids dont learn how to interract whit other humans and maybe later if their are older they are not good with social relations
",12
3058,everyday were overloaded by the informations subconsciously reaching our brains all the advertisements interrupting our favorite tv shows have become an annoying thing we have to cope with but what we dont realize is which impact it has on us more and more scientist claim that it has a negative impact on consumerism selfimage and our general selfvalue one might ask himself what does it cause in young children who are not able to think properly for their own good ,10
3059," that television advertising is one of the strongest possibilities to create desires for something in the humans brain advertisements s young children should clearly be forbidden its obvious that those children are not able to determine what is real or not and what will benefit and what will harm them so putting them in front of a tv where they are constantly provided with advertisements will have negative impacts on them it can even be seen as a tool for manipulation of our young generation if advertisement towards young children wont be banned many companies could use it for themselves

but ",14
3060, the television programm is something which we can not really control there are some guidelines the companies have to follow and ,10
3061, its forbidden to show something inappropriate on screen ,18
3062," afternoon we might say that the advertisement wont have a negative impact on the child all these rules are guaranteeing us that our children wont have to cope with sexuality strong language and other for their age inappropriate behaviour

history ",16
3063, has shown that such advertisements are able to cause huge hypes in young children while  about 60 years ago children were not exposed to such things nowadays its normal for them to want something theyve seen on the tv it does ,0
3064, raise the costs spent on the child ,9
3065, makes them very materialistic already from the ,3
3066," of their life were lacking children who are able to play outside with nothing else than branches of a tree and some dirt were lacking children who are creative without any electronical devices and who enjoy the nature as we once did

in contrary to that there might ",8
3067, be advertisements who encourage children to be creative and develope their environment if we think about ,0
3068, an advertisement on the tv showing the newest acrylic paint maybe it might cause the desire in a children to start paiting and if we think even ,8
3069," maybe one day he or she will be an artist 

i strongly support the view that children should be outside and be challenged to be creative in a reality where they are victims of the industries we can not expect them to grow to independent adults its our job to create a safe space for them so we ",24
3070, have to provide them a world where they are not subconsciously manipulated maybe one day we will be at a ,7
3071," where not everything has to be controlled by the media 



",21
3072,in the world we live today advertising has a great impact on us the industry has realized and has already taken ,11
3073, of that what we like what we dislike what we ,21
3074," with is highly influenced by what we see daily it can influence our childre even easier do we want to let our children grow up 

it is difficult to say if advertising towards children should be banned but it is true that it has a great influence on them imagine a kid seeing an advertising on something offending content if parents do not intervene it might be likely that unconsciously the child becomes familiar with it

but is it just to take their right of beeing free of choosing their of choosing what they like and what they dislike in my opinion their likes and dislikes should be influenced by something else than what they ses on tv young children do not need to find the newest trends fashions etc responsible parenting forms their opinion much more than some advertising

however it is impossible to introduce this idea of banning advertisement advertising  mostly unconsceously  occurs in our daily lives ",14
3075, prevent this from happening nevertherless ,18
3076, that television advertising has such an influence on children as a matter of ,14
3077, i do not want that my children spend their childhood on television ,17
3078," my concern is not the advertising but the tv programs thei watch



",10
3079,"it is commonly known that television can have a big impact in children therefore we have to be patient and aware of what or chldren watch 
the question is if the television should be in position to speak and to advertise directly to our kids in my opinion they should be allowed television should be autorized to show this content the other question is what they would show if the publicity is about toys and normal kids stuff ",14
3080, its alright with me but if the program is leading to change kids minds and tell them to do bad desicions teach them bad manners or show them ,6
3081," i wouldnt definetly aprove to this statement

parents have the responsabilty to be aware of what their child is watching childrens minds should be widely open and show them beautiful and great things ",12
3082, television should be allowed to show advertising it gives children the possibility to see new things  ,15
3083,"television advertising

television has been one of the most widespread medias for a long time it can target different audiences of all ages ",10
3084, there is a huge amount of different channels with content specified for certain targetgroups one of them are children even under five years old while this sounds nice there is a dangerous scheme employed on those channels the ,6
3085,called adverts usually adverts serve the purpose of making money to finance the streaming of the tvprograms this is here no different but small children are easily influencable if they watch a commercial about a new fun game they will often want to have it and will persuade their parents to buy said products and young cute children are espescially talented in doing ,0
3086," compared to adults and teenagers they do not understand the value of money and  have trouble to figure out whether a toy is going to be worth it or just a scam 

on the other ",24
3087," prohibiting advertisements for a specified agegroup seems pretty radical and it is not like only children below the age of five would fall into the categorie of getting effortlessly manipulated by ads besides that television is no longer the biggest most important media it has been overtaken by the internet since even younglings nowadays get a lot of exposure to the internet because they already have smartphones this might very well be the bigger problem but banning advertisements on the internet is close to impossible and would probably destroy the whole industry so getting completely rid of ads does not sound like a good solut

my opinion is that the parents should put more work into monitoring what their children watch furthermore they ought to explain them that buying the things promoted on television is not always a good idea ",14
3088,a reason for such television adverstisings is that it may ,10
3089, be funny for the children and that they could learn a lot if a little child ,8
3090," loves television advertising it can have a lot of fun 
another ",11
3091, is that it can give the parents more free time if the parents have a lot of work to do or would just like to relax and not always look ,8
3092," their child the child can do something alone without the parents 
it can ",9
3093," be very helpful for young children if they see a lot of different things which is the case with television advertisings 

a reason against those television advertisings is that young children usually do not really understand what they are doing this is more often the case with younger children which are ",0
3094," two or three years old 
furthermore are many young children forced by their parents to do something they actually do not want to do a young child who is ",7
3095," two years old can not decide what it wants to do because it is too young and the parents would not listen to it anyway 

",24
3096, that television advertising  should not be allowed because young children should play outside and have an adventurous but calm childhood if they spend most of their time with television advertising they have less free time in which they can do whatever they want surely there are some children who would love to do this but most of the litte children just want to play with ,13
3097, lego or barbies then the parents should not force them to do anything they do not want to ,20
3098, that the children have enough time to do something with television advertises ,0
3099, they are young they should be able to play outside with some friends and just enjoy their free time,24
3100,"televison advertising is nowadays something which is normal everyone from young to old watches televison and with the televison the advertising
with time as the televison developed the form how the televison works and what form of shows series and advertising developed too
in todays age everyone gets influenced by advertising and televison our society does build up on that exp whats new whats cool etc
",10
3101, advertising directly to the childern in these ages is dangerous the reason why is because in these years of childhood as a child your are developing and learining new things and you go on adventures on to find out how life works how do you as a human being and person funtion advertising little children is dangerous from my ,16
3102, of view because your influencing the childern in a young age were thy cant build their own opinion about these things for me ,7
3103," parents who let their childern watch televison in such a young age is not responsible the childern should be playing and not sitting around and looking at little pixels who arent even good for their eyes
",17
3104, is importend is what sort of advertising is it are we talking about games things you can play outside or just a teddybear they can have for sleep would it be games ,20
3105, it is go the children are influenced ,7
3106, to play it and are getting even faster addicted on a young age ,24
3107, maybe kids do espacially these days were everthing is electronic if we are talking about a teddybear ,20
3108, it depends on how the advertising is done is it aggressiv or is calm if it is aggressiv like you have to buy this teddy ,11
3109," it is a good idea as i was saying the kid cant build them self a opinion
however what ",8
3110, is a big reason to say it should not be allowed is that the kids should not watch television becaue of their health it does effect the eyes and does not get better with time when they grow there are even more electronic things they have or want to handle for exp iphone ipad etc what i ,17
3111, think is that from time to time we get even more addicted by growing up and that should not start at such a young age referring back to what i ,4
3112, said is the opinion they cant make themself ,3
3113, a two year old baby understands whats going on and what the advertising is saying or even make a opinion about that,2
3114,"in the last few years television advertising has increased very fast the advertising is often directet toward young children but do the young children even understand the advertising or not can it cause harm or not

children like to watch television they have their favorite channel and they watch television whenever they can so the diffrent brands produce advertisments these advertisements have a lot of colour ",14
3115, the children enjoy watching it when they see something they like they tell their mother to buy it ,20
3116," have something more to play with the channel makes a lot of money and the brands too and the children are happy with their new toy
on the other ",20
3117, someone has to pay the toy and the young children have no relation to money in the advertisments everything is fine and looks good but in reality the things are often disappointing they coast a fortune but ,20
3118, a couple of months they break appart adults can differentiate between a good advertising and an advertising that wants you to buy cheap stuff but the children are to young and they think everything is nice and cool and nobody wants to be a looser because he has less toys ,2
3119, that advertising should not be prohibited because ,15
3120, the chldren want to buy something the parents have the last word in the end they have to decide whether to buy something or not in my opinion ,9
3121," adults buy everything their child wants it is their own fault the adults should be able to say no even thogh the children begin to cry if the parents are able to do that everyone will be fine 
 ",9
3122,my opinion to this statement is really clear ,21
3123, young childrend doesnt need to watch television which contained advertising i thing ,0
3124, childrens dont need to watch tvthere are ,17
3125, many other good possibilities to show the children the live without tv for example the children are watching an animal movie and in the break there is an advertisement for a hairshampoo or a special car or something else at the end the childrens are ,17
3126, fascinated from cars and all the other stuff that theyve forgot the animals and why they doesnt go with the hole family to the zoo and watch the animals in live ,3
3127, for the childrens there are no advertisements and theyve been outside ,16
3128, the parents can calm down from work and ,1
3129, enjoy the nature and the world of animals or the families could ,1
3130, go swimming with their childrens because ,1
3131," to be able to swim can save lifes and thats much better than television advertising where all stuff is fake and in a glamour world
i know that the tv is financed by advertisement but i really ask me why there is advertisment on the childrens channles on tv for what they advertising on a childrens platform for a car or a shampoo most of the childrens wont be able to take these informations from the really glamour word into the real world and ",0
3132," that they will have big problems and they wont go to the shop and buy the shampoo beacuse theyre too young
in my opinion the television advertising shouldnt be allowed on kids channels nowbody will buy the stuff
and ",2
3133," a bit unnormal that 2 years old childs are allowed to watch tv
i hope that our generation doesnt get their childrens too much into the whole thing with computers televison and ",17
3134, not mobile phones my wish is that there is not television advertising or advertising ,11
3135, which isnt good for our childrens beacause they destroy the mind of our childrens and childrenschildren,4
3136,it has been often a topic of arguement and it shouldnâ´t get forgoten what iâ´m talking about is the television advertising  should it be forbidden or does it be ,15
3137," allowedd to be shown of course there are many different opinions for this topic and iâ´m going to present some

in one ",21
3138, you can definitely say that children of the age of  arenâ´t able to just turn of the tv ,17
3139, any kind of advertising is on it clearly also they can not understand wheater theyâ´re getting manipulated by getting shown some toys or any other things kids would like to have the ,16
3140, of the manipulation is clearly one of the strongest ,21
3141," for the position against this kind of advertising because it isnâ´t fair to manipulate a kid as a adult person and it doesnâ´t fit to a morally correct behavior also children get more easily influented than adults and this without even noticing it 
in the other ",16
3142, for this kind of advertising for example ,11
3143," children watch this kind of advertising and with them the parents could get inspirated to buy their children something they really want to have concerning christmas or their birthday maybe also itâ´s more likely that adults watch that kind of advertising because many parents donâ´t allow their children to watch tv for long that often and without them being their to check what theyâ´re watching

to conclude it is important that some kind of advertising is shown in tv because ",0
3144, adults like to get inspirated by the tv also children should have the right to watch tv and get inspirated but ,17
3145, it should be thought a lot about the advertising s children ,16
3146, that they get inspirated but not manipulated like some advertisings do manipulate ,23
3147,as a child whos raised in a family with no television i can only imagine this experience and use stories that ive heard ,17
3148, we watch it so if a child at the age  watches this advertising if daily or just from time to time it maybe help to prosper its imagination and fascination of new things im not an expert but if i watch an television advertising ,0
3149, for a new product theres a chance that ,23
3150," get interested and start thinking about how it works what i could use it for etc i can imagine that a similar process of thinking could start in the head of a  young child
on the other ",18
3151, without doubt it can be easily addicting the child gets used to watch something on television and learns that you can spend time just watching television but to come to the specific part of the advertising i guess theres a high chance that the child sees something in an advertising and it instantly has a longing for it for exaple if a child sees a toy which is offered as if one couldnt have fun in his childhood without this very toy it simply wants it advertising can be ,14
3152," manipulating that a child doesnt realise what other toys it might already has but just gets greedy about this new toy
thats why ",20
3153, advertising focused on children aged  should not be allowed,16
3154,this statement is a very controversial one it asks if young children aged  should get specialised television advertisement on one ,13
3155, i dont believe there exists a lot of ads for young kids that age at least not on a channel like kika i remember that ,16
3156, i watched kika there was absolutely no advertising at all other than for their shows during primetime or ,10
3157, also i dont believe that kids that age watch that much tv ,17
3158, that most of the ads made dont even reach them but i ,11
3159, think that small children should get to know what kind of toys etc exist ,20
3160," that they get an idea of what they like and what they want eg for christmas 
however i do believe that advertising does make things look better than they actually are and the small children shouldnt need to deal with the real world ",0
3161, by saying this i mean the ,19
3162," that the stuff being advertised may break easily or isnt as cool as it seemed to be whilst watching the commercial also i believe that most of the toys are overpriced
as an example i have a little boy aged four watching his favorite tv show suddenly a commercial comes up speaking of the newest playmobil boat that can float and be on the water etc he thinks that it looks ",2
3163, he puts it on the wishlist for his birthday then his birthday comes up and he actually gets the ship and is excited and happy about the very expensive present his parents made him he starts putting the ship toghether and ,20
3164, puts the boat onto water in the bathtub at ,18
3165, he wants to jump in and play with it which he ,18
3166," does after 20 minutes of playing the boat starts to fill with water and gets heavier and heavier then it sinks and breaks and the boy is sad and crying still the company is happy because they have the money
to conclude ",18
3167, i believe that there shouldnt be commercial for those children because usually there are overpriced products with low quality being advertised also ,16
3168, that children dont necessairily need advertising to know what they want for their birthday or ,0
3169,"in the following text i will discuss if television advertising  aged  should be allowed

on the one ",15
3170, these advertising help parents to find new cool things for their children to play with but ,0
3171, the children get very influenced by the products shown on tv i remember ,6
3172, i was young i always wanted to have the thing which were shown on tv otherwise there are advertisings like durex or stuff like this which are ,18
3173, not good for the little ones furthermore it exist ads like the mcdonalds advertising which has a big influence i have seen a movie once it wqas about a man eating mc donalds everyday and in this movie they were asking kids if they new the hymne of the united states but they didnt know and ,4
3174," sing the song of ronald mcdonald they knew exactly how to sing it

so ",18
3175, there are different kinds od ad which can be shown to kids because there are ads which are made for little ones and their parents like the babyborn ad but ,16
3176, there are way too much ads which have a negative influence to kids me as a child my dad only allowed me to watch kika because there was no advertising only for there programm but what he didnt know i watched super rtl secretly at my friends house the only way to prevent kids from bad influence is to forbid advertising on kids channels ,14
3177, it should be allowed on normal channels but not on kids ones,12
3178,"everybody already watched tv its normal and natural that people want to be unterhaltend and amused but children in age of 2 to 5 sometimes watch to much the tv but why
maybe the perents need some free time or have to work on something and ",17
3179," they let them watch the tv

children in this age can watch the tv its not unhealthy or something like that but you have to regular it otherwise it will be an addiction and that could be unhealthy they wont make some new friends because they are just at home alone
in this age its betterwhen children play in the garden with friends children have a very big imagination and they will loose it with the age thats pretty normal but in this age where its possible and that simple to imagine some cool games with friends they have to do it and let theire imagination free 

but the tv is ",17
3180," can learn from the tv some series are quiet intereseting and helpful an example is galileo

my opinion is that every family has to decide for themself but ",6
3181, the children play in the gardenwith friends or play society games but ,24
3182, they are watching once or twice a week the tv its ok and it will not have any bad influence on the children sometimes watching tv could be a belohnung for the children,17
3183,"some critics believe that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed 
reasons ",15
3184, younger children see the advertising and commercials on their tv immediatley want to get the item that is advertised ,0
3185, they dont fully understand want that item often a toy even is the children could get unsatisfied with the toys they have at their own house ,20
3186, children always want new things they can play with but ,20
3187," not all parents have the money andor abilities to buy their child a new toy everytime they see one on tv it could be better if the children didnt see any commercials on televison 
but that could ",20
3188," be achieved in another way it is easy for the parents to make sure the children only watch tv channels that dont have any commercials that are directly towarded  
private channels only make money off of commercials and ads which is why there is no way around showing them in my opinion it is better for a child to see commercials they can understand and get entertained by than an ad about something they dont understand or shouldnt see because it contains graphic or sexual content
in conclusion ",14
3189," it is important for the parents of a young child to know what their child is watching on tv it should be their decision whether or not they let their child watch tv if it was my child i would make sure it is only watching channels that have child appropriate commercials and tv shows 
all in all ",17
3190,nowadays watching television is part of the everyday life of children as we know ,17
3191, tv  shows are part of the television programm ,6
3192, the adverts in between the tv  shows now ,10
3193," discuss if these television advertising  should not be allowed

on the one ",15
3194, television advertising could be something useful because thats how the children can come in contact with new products they learn more about the variety of products and can get interested to try new games etc moreover the adverts arent a big danger for the children because they just show new products ,0
3195," there isnt the possibility that they have a bad influence on the children

on the other ",7
3196, by watching televison adverts the children get influenced on what to buy or what to like because if they see a special product over and over in the television they will want to buy that product one day especially ,0
3197, the children are in such a young age they can be influenced very easily besides that ,7
3198," the television adverts they cant developp an own opinion of what they like or of what they dont like because the television adverts bascially forces them to like somethig or to not like something 

in my opinion television adverts  should not be allowed because ",15
3199, that it is really important that children ,8
3200, in that young age where they start to make an own opinion about things should be able to decide on their own without the influence of adverts what they like or what they dont like moreover it is more important to create an own opinion through other human beings like friends or family and not through a machine ,13
3201,if you like watching tv you may have recognized that there is a lot of advertising between your series or movies which always interrupts everything and is just annoying but ,10
3202," adutls should be caught nowadays advertising is even  who are aged  critics think it should be forbidden to catch the attention of these young children by showing them all the nice toys and sweets they could get for christmas or their birthday
in  my oppinion they are absolutly right 
having a childhood is ",16
3203," thing in life it helps forming your character and should not be influenced by television advertising or any shows if these kids always watch tv and dont go outside to neet new people to discouver their little world they will never get the chance to be confident and to do things by themselves
on the other ",6
3204, the companies which produce all the toys or sweets and clothes do really profite by catching the attention of kids at least kids are the ones who beg for getting new toys and who are able to make their parents buy all the stuff they want just by looking cute so actually it wouldnt be helpful to stop the directly advertising toward young children moreover by playing with their toys children can have fun and ,16
3205," enjoy life so why should we forbid this advertising 
i do exactly know why children learn by touching moving and feeling not by constantly sitting in front of the tv it makes them stupid watching a lot of tv besides ",14
3206," they got a lot of toys to play with we actually know they wont use all of it they will have their favourite one which they wont change for a long time young kids should better go outside and learn something about the nature
in conclusion the advertising  shouldnt be allowed it makes them even more watching tv istead of going to explore the world 
they see all the nice stuuf and want to have it which is not good at all
",14
3207," in favor of television advertising  and against it 

it is said that young children should not even watch tv in their young age they could become dumb and not educated the should go outside or play with someone nevertheless there are programms in which you can see documentaries and earn education of them but even between one documentary and another one most of the time there will be television advertising because there has to be a way to make money for the people who are doing work for these documentaries on the other ",14
3208, it is said that televison manipulates people children in the young age can be more manipulated especially if this would be advertising about toyâ´s or some stuff like that so if they watch tv and get education that is fine but each advertising is made to manipulate people when children see television advertising about toys most of the time they want to get this toy the ,14
3209, is that the kids want the toys and the parents have no other choice but to buy this toy or other stuff like that toyâ´s are expensive and ,20
3210, a short time they get broken or the children are bored of these and ,24
3211, they watch tv again and want a new toy which means the parents have to pay even more money if they start to watch tv in their young age it could be fatal if they would get all the toys they want because if they get everything they want in this young age this will not stop if they get older than five years it will ,24
3212," and they will not learn to respect what money is they will buy even more stuff with the money of their parents and if the parents do not buy the stuff their children want the children will get angry or loud until they get it

in the end to sum it all up it can be said that watching tv does not have to be bad no it can be educating only the television advertising can manipulate the children and educate them wrong
    ",2
3213," it is right that television advertising yound young children should not be allowed beacuase the influence of the television is bigger than we think the children do what they see on television they can not think what is real and what is just fantasy 
on the other ",13
3214, bad because the brain does not grow very much anymore so the influence of televisions can not be ,17
3215, that every parents should be decide by his own every person thinks different about television and children so everybody should do what they want but ,17
3216, it is not good something to allowed because it is just an little thing  there are bigger problems in our world ,12
3217, completly with the statement television advertising dirceted toward young children should not be allowed at ,13
3218, why im in certain parts ,18
3219, with the statement for little childrin flashing lights and loud sound can be very disturbing bescause their brain cant handle it ,4
3220, so it is not very healthy for them and doesnt have an learn effect ,4
3221, to make your child calm down or be distracted you shouldnt place it infront of a tv you as a parent should interact with your child and teach him or her ceratin things the television is not made for raising your child which some parents think because there are a lot of teaching shows for different things it ,17
3222, can ahve the sideeffect that the child has to much energy left ,4
3223, it sat infront of a tv for quiet some time well try to put a small child with to much energy to bed you will fail constantly now the ,18
3224, with this statement it depends on wich schow you watch with your child or if you watch the show together with your child and at which time when your child is very young loud shows with flashing lights should not be watched insted look for something calm ,6
3225, your child wont be hyped up again it is now problem to watch ,6
3226, your child had a long day maybe at kindergarden if the show dosent have certain effects it wont bother your child too much and will even make it sleepy it ,6
3227, is no problem if you have rules for tv watching 30 minutes a day are enough for a small child if you dont overdo it with the tv watching it ,17
3228, wont become something your child needs to calm down but ,4
3229, ways childrin should be outside a lot espacially in their young age because the have energy which needs to go somewhere in my opinion it is okay to watch tv with your child but only for a limit time like 30 minutes a day and than only one show without attention keeping effects like flashing lights it is no problem that there are a lot of shows for young childrin only you as a parent can decide what your child well see or wont see so it ,17
3230, depends on you how much television you bring into your childs life because you and only you decide whats the best for your own child still the television shouldnt replace your role as a parent to raise and teach your child ,17
3231,in the following text iâ´ll compare the ,21
3232," which support or are against the statement television advertising  should not be allowed
first of all there are plenty of reasons to support the statement one of ",15
3233, ones is that young children who simply want to watch their favorite shows on the television have no other choice than to watch those commercials little children donâ´t have an own opinon like we adults do ,13
3234, so they would believe erverything the commercials tell them which can be very dangerous ,10
3235, or makes them loose their instincts for the reality ,3
3236, so if they see a commercial that shows somebody sky diving or bungee jumping of a high cliff they wouldnâ´t know that the people who are doing this are secured and safe like we do they could try to do the same without knowing they arenâ´t just because it looks fun moreover there are commercials like mcâ´donalds that are trying to make their food look as healthy as possible on the tv we would know itâ´s fast food and to stay healthy we shouldnâ´t eat to much of it but a young kid without any kind of experience or an own opinion about things wouldnâ´t know better cool advertising for vodka or cigarettes makes them believe itâ´s something without any risks just because itâ´s on the tv and thereâ´s some nice music in the commercial and a lot of impressive pictures on the other ,11
3237, there are special channels for kids like the disney channel which wouldnâ´t show the same commercials like adult channels would do which doesnâ´t mean thereâ´s no advertising channels like this would show a lot of commercials for toys with a lot of animation and effects ,14
3238, the kids ask their parents to buy them an ,9
3239," against advertising  children would be that itâ´s impossible to stop advertising at all because thatâ´s what pays the salary to the people who work there and finances the channel itself

finally ",13
3240, that it is impossible to stop the advertising but not impossible to stop it for this age they need to show commercials anyway but they could direct the to older kids,13
3241,television advertising that is s young children has positive and negative ,14
3242," it should be allowed for everyone to advertise any of their products and not limit it to a specific age
this is ",16
3243," difficult to manage or judge about as it is never absolutely clear to whom the advertisement is addressed assuming a decision in court would become necessary judges must decide to which age the commercial appeals the most which the advertising company might refuse to accept
however children at this kind of age  years are very easy to manipulate they believe nearly anything that is being told to them in the advertisements and are not able to polarize between wrong and true ",16
3244, that are being presented to them in the advertisements additionally ,11
3245," watching tv children are mostly alone therefore they do not have a parent that tells them what is false about that commercial
although here it is necessary to respect that most advertisements are not as aggressive direct or manipulative as others these most definitely must be an exception for children at this age an commercial is called manipulative way earlier than for adults when children are being manipulated on this way it might result in a different judgement in their later life ",14
3246, that it is not a ,21
3247, to generalize about this topic a relatively free economy as we have it in germany needs to maintain that right and be able to advertise to everyone but as soon as it comes to manipulating young children companies must be restricted in that freedom overly manipulative commercials should be banned at ,13
3248, this age because it destroys the free judgement of the children watching,12
3249,every mum knows it the moment ,18
3250," their child watches tv and suddenly screams i want this or mum i want this for my birthday but should it actually be allowed to put advertising directed to children on tv

a big problem with children is that they want everything they see on tv when a new ad comes on about a new playmobil school or starwars game they want to have it this summarizes up to big numbers of toys which children want to have which can be a problem for mums who dont have that much money and cant give their children the toy they want other than that children see that there is ",14
3251, much more they could have and their old toys or ,20
3252, the new book their parents got them for their last birthday is already forgotten and they want the ,3
3253," thing 
wouldnt it be way better to forbid advertisement on tv for young children children are influenced by media already do we have to put in front of their eyes every new toy they have to have and is it even necessairy kids should not be influenced and convinced by the media already in such a young age they should ",13
3254," watch teletubbies without screaming i want this as soon as the ads are on 
the problem is that ",10
3255, ads were forbidden children would see these toys in a store or at their friends house anyway ,20
3256, in not allowing advertisement and what is a childhood without toys,20
3257, talk about the television advertising  in the ,10
3258, start with the bad biological influence of the television for the child it can lead to cancer because of the power that can destroy the cells of our bodys we know about those ,17
3259, we should be more aware of it we should look out for our children because we are the adults we cant just let them do whatever they would like to do they are children ,12
3260, they cant think of the bad influences ,7
3261, like we do but its not even just the health ,19
3262, the age which has a big influence on this disagreement if you look at it psychologically in this age of the children you have to talk to them and to be able to comunicate with them even if they cant reply you they are listening ,7
3263, you talk to tem their brain starts to get more active and they can improve their thinking activities you have to sociate babies and children ,8
3264, they can live a better live where they are able to communicate better with the people who are surounding them there was once a little girl her name was genie she has been beaten up everytime she started to scream or to cry ,7
3265, she did not say anythimg anymore after they had found her she was not able to talk to people ,18
3266, she was in the age of 7 years so with that exemple you can see that the process of a good socialisation and of a good brain function it all starts very early its an action and a reaction you have to react on the baby because they see and hear more things than we could say we often think they are not able to realise a lot things because they are that young but that is actually not true you have to give a child a lot of affection and attention it can just learn things ,8
3267, you are talking and communicating with it othervise it wont be able to learn for exemple a language it can listen to a radio all day long it does not have a big impact on the child it doesnt learn the language ,8
3268, than it does it with another human being so to summarise it a little bit there are not just negative ,21
3269, a lot of contras in the psychological ,21
3270," which you have to be considered of 
there are a lot better ways and alternatives how you could entertain your child a very good way is to start reading something for the child and start to show himher pictures and explain them everthing you can of course it takes much more time and energy than to just let it sit down in front of a television but the influences are much better for the developement 
of course we can even see it with the geographycal perspective there are a lot of resourcess which could be used by far better than to be invested in all kinds of technical television 
so as a facit ",17
3271, there are a lot of contras for this statement and ,21
3272, we should start to think better for our children and their developement we can have an impact on all those things and we should start to invest more time and energy in the entertaining and learning process for the children of the ,8
3273,in the following essay im going to talk about the question if television advertising  children aged  should be allowed or not the most of us probably dont like advertisment at all ,13
3274, watching a good film and being interupted by an advertisement but we all know that in this century it is the best way for companies to do their marketing and to ,10
3275," sell their products but do our little children really have to be confronted with advertisingisnt it enough if we are confronted with advertising every day

first ",0
3276," for economical reasons it does make sense to allow television advertising direct toward young children  because they would like to have everything if they could its easy to convince them of posessing this product is nessesary 

on the other ",14
3277," at their age they should have the right to watch television without any confusing advertisment furthermore it is important not to only care about money and that is exactly what we do if even the youngest of our society have to watch television advertising

in conclusion i could say that im absolutely against television advertising directed  because it isnt good for their developpment and they should not be treated like teenagers or even like adults",14
3278,it is questionable whether advertising s young children should or should not be allowed in my opinion it is not possible to ban this kind of advertisement because it is up to them what kind of advertisement they make but it is ,16
3279, up to the tv program what kind of advertisement they show and ,10
3280, they show the ads they get paid for the most so its not for the tv programs or the companies to choose but ,10
3281, for the parents to choose what their children should watch and what they shouldnt what should be banned is false advertisement which ,13
3282, happens in ads for children aged  suddenly the barbie or the racing car is alive and able to speak and does fun things and the children in the ad are amazed and happy and the stuff seems like the most fun you could ever have but in reality its just a piece of plastic and ,20
3283," the most times overly expensive
there should be a filter to what young children are able to watch and if its not possible to directly ban ads from television the parents should think whether their child should watch this show or ",14
3284," watch a different one where there is no advertisement
those ads are always for the newest toys or toys that appear in tv shows or movies ",11
3285, the children will want them but their ability of judgement has not ,9
3286," developed to see that this is not about them having fun but for the companies to make money because of their lack of understanding and them getting tricked to want what is advertised 
young children should not watch advertisement because ",2
3287, they grow up thinking that everything presented to them in ads is as good as it seems companies should not make that much profit by taking ,2
3288, of them not knowing better,3
3289,to answer the question wether television advertising s young children should be allowed or not its necessary to define the question ,13
3290, television advertising  is talking about children aged  and about advertising the products made ,0
3291, for them like toys those products shall no more be advertised and shown in television the reason for this prohibition is young children being more sensitive to advertising ,13
3292, they can be manipulated more easily and donâ´t know how advertising works ,11
3293, you could say thats just how economy works if your target is easy to persuade you should exploit it regardless of their age if people working in the marketting branche  considered the customers emotions and if they really needed what they sell them economy wouldnâ´t work growing about this children could ,2
3294," become one of those marketting managers exploiting young children forgetting about how they were young and manipulative
on the other ",7
3295, one could argue its our duty to protect childrem and be aware of what weâ´re buying or selling itâ´s ,12
3296, about the children everywhere everyone tries to make us buy their products ,2
3297," we should at least protect the children until they understand that what is promised isnâ´t the truth in the end itâ´s the parents anyway who have to pay for the toys

i am not against the idea of forbidding television advertisement  i just donâ´t think itâ´s the way how advertising should be handled in my opinion it would be more useful not letting the kids watch televison too often but ",14
3298, they are accompany them and talk about what they see in this age kids are more willing to learn and understand the world and their surroundings ,24
3299, i reckon it would be best trying to explain the children how the marketting branche works giving them the feeling of being important and grownup of course this strategy might not work for children aged two but in this case they can watch tvchannels without advertisement and at this age they shouldnâ´t be allowed to watch television anyway at age three or four ,14
3300, they start talking better itâ´s time to explain as much as they can understand itâ´s not possible to avoid advertisement and it will never be learning how to handle it and knowing whatâ´s behind it is the way to go in the end children should be allowed to be children without being tried to be manipulated ,16
3301, and they should always have other options like playing outside or cuddling with th,1
3302, from advertising on series for kids is that they can show topics the children dont have  and dont want to know about if the advertisement is brutal ,14
3303," or shows a kind of sexual situation the child may not be allowed to watch this its not hard to manipulate children the advertisements can do that if they only shopw a short clip with a happy child with a great toy that the watcher suddently wants to have

 but that can bea positive ",16
3304, tothe children can find knew stuff they want to have in advertisements if they need any wishes for christmas or their ,0
3305," birthday they can find them through advertisements
 another ",18
3306," ist that the parents if they watch television with theyre children can see what their child likes as toys they might know that but there are always surprisings 
there is ",20
3307," that the children have to grow up if you seperate them from the older ones you push them into another kind of world advertisements show you whats up to date in the world maybe a five year old child doesnt need that but its hard to seperate clearly what is a show for children and what is not 
and if you watch a series about a zoo or generally about pets ",14
3308, you have to sepperate many children watch series like that ,6
3309, there would be no advertising but many older people watch it too ,10
3310," you need advertisingh to make money

",11
3311, its wrong to take advertising away from children because ,13
3312, that its good to seperate them from the outside world they have to grow up and you cant controll what children are watching if you arent the parent i have the opinion that its not okay to show stuff that has some brutal or other topics that are not good for children maybe a ,17
3313, can be that on tv channels for kids they dont show such advertisements but most of them are okay for children anyway  ,16
3314, if the parents dont want their children to watch advertisements they should watch out for them that is not the work of the publischer or the persons who make the tv programm my parents never had a problem with that and ,14
3315, that is good because i dont like beeing sepperated to the older ones mybe a child doesnt care because he wouldnt know the another way round but i dont like the idea im not a fan of advertisements generally ,11
3316, i wouldnt really care if they really never show advertisements on childrens channels ever again but i dont watch them ,14
3317," and as a child i didnt care about advertisements i just dont like the thinking that we have to protect every child
",16
3318,television advertising  should not be allowed because children between  usually take ,13
3319, the exemple they see so as soon as they would watch tv they would quickly get attached to the item they saw as well it might be quite hard for parents to explain every time that it isnt possible for them to buy it at the moment ,20
3320, the children saw it on tv it is ,6
3321, unfair because children like colorful things wich move or ,20
3322, they get older they like to play video games in the case of girls maybe play with dolls and advertising such things is ,24
3323, easy for a company it is quite manipulativ because children dont get that they need to resist the urge of playing with the exact same game as they saw for adults it is easier to know what we really need but even for older people advertisement ,2
3324," works wich is estonishing 
so the idea of advertisement for young children is really intelligent because children wont understand that you need to spend money to buy the subject ",0
3325," youre even able to play with it for parents it is hard and exhausting to change the childrens thoughts on every advertisement they see plus they can be quite persuassive 
",2
3326, it should be prohibided because adversiment is already huge for our own generation and we react the same as small children but we are ,12
3327, able to control our feelings toward an item we like for children this might be much harder the effect advertisment has on us is with young children multiplied i expierenced that ,0
3328, i was younger the same way if something had my favourite color i wished for it and the idea of having that item lasts mostly quite a ,18
3329,watching television nowadays has become a common pleasure in the daily life of people at any age lately watching television got some harsh critics because of some shows that do not have a good reputation but ,17
3330, shows got harsh critics even advertising did so ,10
3331," abord the statement if television advertising should be allwoed towards young children 

first of all there is no harm if children at a young age are confronted with television advertising children have friends and they get to know such things really fast secondly even without television advertising there is no prevention that could abandon the knowledge of a child the child will get to know the tv sooner or later and ",14
3332," it is later than sooner they need to learn to cope with it if the parents want to protect their child the power is in their hands and they can not forbid companies for trying to make profit

however a child should play outside in its youth and not be stuck inside in front of a television television advertising s children is cruel and reckless the companies use the mind of a child because this mind has not a personal opinion and can be formed easily children at a young age like whatever looks fancy ",12
3333, it may harm them second ,4
3334," a child can develop itself better without television advertising it is not influenced and can truely become the best version of themselves

to conclude ",14
3335, out that it is the parents will what to do with their child and they should not try and  screw a profit for companies because the parents are mainly important for the developpment of a child and not television advertising i would consider that television advertising should be allowed towards young children because i can not see any harm  ,13
3336,it is known that tv advertisements often contain promises which they cant hold or ,11
3337, that arent true but unfortuanately young children tend to belive them ,7
3338, theysee these advertisements on tv therefore many people think that advertising  aged  should not be allowed an ,15
3339, in illegalizing these advertisements would be that parents wouldnt have to face the problem that their children are crying or screaming because they want to have something they saw in an advertisement another ,13
3340, could probably be that there would be less advrtising on tv and ,10
3341, the adults would probably profit ,9
3342, that there would be less annoying advertisement breaks ,11
3343, they want to watch a programm on tv an ,1
3344, against the illegalization of these advertisements is that the children should better learn at a young age that advertisements on tv often lie to them and that they shouldnt belive everything they get told ,13
3345, not if it is on tv another ,19
3346, si that the toy industry would be affected negatively certainly this ,20
3347, small specific group of people but it would bevery bad for these people who are working in the toy industry also the private tv channels need the money they get through these advertisements and ,14
3348, they would be affected negatively too because of the reasons i just named ,19
3349, the illegalization of tv advertisements directed  ,15
3350," with the statement that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed at this age children are easy to influence they donâ´t have the ability to decide wether something is right or wrong
by influencing the children the parents get influenced ",13
3351," because the children talk their parents into buying things by directing television advertising toward young children the kids get connected to the advertinsing and market world by this young age and are not able to develop their own mind and own opinion they have an opinion on whats right or wrong and whatâ´s good to buy planted in their minds

for economy ",2
3352, itâ´s usefull to direct television advertisement toward young children because they win a new generation of customers a child will keep a brand or a product name which itâ´s seen an advertisement for stuck in itâ´s head for a long time and might even remember it ,0
3353," itâ´s an adult
they are programmed to buy more things because they know from a young age that buying things is a good things
the system trains them from a young age that they have to buy stuff and that money is ",3
3354, value in this world and ,23
3355, by buying stuff they just support the system and they donâ´t even understand why,3
3356,"nowadays on nearly every tv programme there is advertisment and some of it is  however some think that this should not be allowed

one reason is that young children who are only two or five years old are not able to understand everything they see on the television but ",14
3357, they see something they particualery like they want to have it even some new technology that their parents wouldnt allow them to have because they think its unnecessary furthermore one could thinnk that these thinks are what other children of the same age have so ,24
3358," they see it on television advertising the dont want to be outsiders this advertising spreads the idea that it is normal for children to have the things that are shown on television
on the other ",24
3359," that advertising doesnt hurt anyone whats the problem if children see television advertising they might want to have those things but advertisment does not force them to buy the products they have shown it is a good way to show what new products there are and what there are for if parents dont want their children to see television advertising they can just make sure that the children watch only programmes without any advertisment

personally i dont have a problem with television advertising toward young children but its possible that i would see this differntly if i had young children on my own right now it has no influence on me and its nothing i have thought about ",14
3360," with the statment that television advertising  shounlnt be allowed television advertising manipulates the thoughts of the viewers and espacially young children are easy to manipulate 
if a young child watches an advertising that shows a spezific thing ",13
3361," a toy it will want that toy because it just saw how cool it is young children arent able to think about things as older people and they belive what olders tell them a television andvertisement shows only the positive things and fitures about a new thing bacause it should be presented as new and cool as possible younger children dont have the emotionaly strengh to fight against the positive image of the advertised object they just belive what they were told 
on the other ",20
3362, are already many kinds of advertisment avalible and there are other ways to advertise an new product to younger children an ,0
3363," for television advertising towards younger children is that parents decide what they buy their children younger childrens arent able to go to an store and buy the object which was advertised so if the childrens get manipulated by the advertising not all of them get the product they must confince their parents to buy them the product or they wont get it
to sum up there is a problem with televison advertisemant towards younger children because theyre to easy to manipulate that is good for the companys which run those advertisemants but the children arent able to buy the product they have to convince their parents 
",14
3364, television advertising towards younger children shouldnt be allowed its unfair to promote a product to people who are not able to resiste those advertisments i fell its like television advertising towards younger children is like offering drugs to an drug addicted person they arent able to say resist but the people who offer it might get profit,13
3365,"should it not be allowed to direct advertisement on television toward young children
first of all the question occures whether advertisement harms anybody and ",13
3366, it is not offending or anything compareable the answer to that question is no because ,19
3367," just a way of saying what is on your mind out loud so if it was not allowed that would offend our freedom of speech
of course it is hard for a child to see the advertisement for all the great new toys which their parents can not afford on television but would it change a lot if advertisement was not there
because ",13
3368," the children advertise toward eachother anyway 
if ",7
3369, one child has a great new toy which it loves it will show it to his or her friends and they would probably want to own it too that is ,20
3370," nothing else than advertising
but ",11
3371," advertising in between children works differently that on television it is more innocent and if there would be less advertising those children might be able to think free with less influence on their minds
summing up it might be good for children nowadays to have a less influenced mind but to forbid advertising toward children would take away our freedom of speech",14
3372,the question if television advertising toward young children should be allowed gives a few positive and negative ,13
3373, is that they could find new things and would try to taste them like if the kid doesnt like tomatos but in the advertising is someone who eats one and tells that it is really delicious ,2
3374," they would like to eat them and they get new experience

a negative ",3
3375, is that in the advertising could be games which looks ,11
3376, good that the child wants it and crys until he gets it and ,20
3377," the parents would by it more than if they dont watched the advertising so they get very influenced by the advertising

",14
3378, got for the children because they could get spoiled if they become everything that they want and get influenced of the advertising of what they like and of what they dont like but in some case it is not ,2
3379," bad for the children because they sometimes have no idea what the people in the television is talking and they dont even get whats happening
but for the company it is good because they can sell more the kids get more influenced than the parents or older kids
",14
3380, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed the reason why ,15
3381, that it should not be allowed is that advertising ,15
3382, manipulate people and the younger a person is the more can it get manipulated because the older a person is the more lifeexperians it gets for example if i would told a child that 113 it would belive me because the child was not able to collect some own experiance so if a child with an age from under five is whatching an advertising it will get strongly manipulated so if the television advertising is showing ,7
3383, a toy than the child will think that it have play with that which is from there on really stressful for the parents because they maybe think that the toy is too expensiv for them or just not good for the child ,20
3384, they would not buy it but ,3
3385, that the child will cry the whole time whitch is not great for the child and for the parents neather so ,4
3386, my oppinion it would be the best thing if such kinds of advertising would be not allowed ,11
3387," the parents have not to spent their money for some nonsence just because the television advertising is manipulating the children
but i can understand why it could get difficult to ban those advertisings because where is the border from an advertising which is for children with an age of six and one with an age of five but ",13
3388,"the statement that children at the age of  should not be allowed to watch television is not easy to answer there are many reasons why it should be allowed and many reasons why it should be forbidden
kids at the age of  are in a part of life in that humans learn a lot and create their own identity
televisionn could be a big help on the way to learn how speaking works today there are many tvshows like dora which are helping kids to handle different situations of life but it is ",17
3389, important to learn skills like eating alone go to toilet alone and ,8
3390, on it is way better to learn together with your parents ,8
3391, learning alone in front of the television everybody knows how hard kids can be and if the parents need some freetime to calm down or something like that the television would be a good ,1
3392," to give the kid something to do
",8
3393," it would be a good compromise to allow kids watching tv but just a special type of tvshows which are made for kids and maybe with a time limit of 1 hour per day
",17
3394," it would be the best if the parents are finding a good balance between learning together with the kid and let the kid learn alone
",8
3395,young children believe everything they see on this big bright screen people can fly animals can speak and you can buy everything television advertising makes them believe that and it has a big influence on them thinking they can have whatever they want is dangerous having a too high selfesteem as a child is often normal but not always good being selfish and arrogant towards other children is a ,14
3396," which makes them an outsider and sometimes bullied having a high selfesteem is good but being arrogant isnt 
but television advertising makes children see what they want and what they wish for it makes them wanting to achieve their goals or maybe just write a wish list crying until the parents will buy it cant be the main problem 
the topic television for children is a difficult one how much are they allowed to watch and how much is too much getting children involved with advertising and the whole marketing isnt always good theyre innocent children too young to know whats the truth and whats a lie the marketing business is tough people are doing everything to make their product seem great and perfect ",14
3397," it isnt children cant see the difference
advertising is influencing the opinions of children because believing what is said on television is easy if somebody one television says bananas are toxic they probably would believe it and not eat bananas anymore advertises with dangerous videos like bungee jumping or jumping off a house are influencing children they think its okay to jump off a house and be fine ",14
3398," it because somebody did it on tv the sentence dont try this at home wont help they wont read or overhear it and want to try it too
seeing ",3
3399, many different and exciting products makes children want everything ,20
3400," they dont even know what they really want it makes them confused and believing that they want all of it thats one of the influences and manipulations
children learn to get their own opinion they learn to see every ",7
3401, young they cant do that ,24
3402, they shouldnt be influenced like that ,7
3403, television advertising shouldnt be  because they often dont know how to handle this information especially advertises with dangerous content should be banned and not allowed making children believe its okay to jump off a house is dangerous and can hurt or even kill them it isnt fair to manipulate young people who have almost no wisdom forcing them to believe everything isnt fair and managers or other people who produce these advertises know that,15
3404,commercials are an important factor in our society where you are confronted with advertising nearly everywhere not only on the television ,10
3405," on the street through shields and logos attached to a wall or on a car

everybody  knows this feeling you are watching a movie at home and during the commercial you suddently become hungry even if you just had dinner you have the desire to take the car and drive immediately to the ",11
3406," shop to buy a chocolate bar but as soon as the commercial ends this overwhelming feeling disappears as fast as it appeared obviously this is an exagerated exemple but its pretty much the goal of the publicity industry they want to induce you to buy a product
a child has to learn how to deal with the manipulation coming from the media if you dont get used to it as a child and learn how to control your emotions it could be too late for you youd  be constantly buying things you dont really need and be loosing money in the meantime 
you have to know yourself better than anyone else especially your response to certain commercials there are researchers working only to find out how to stimulate certain regions of your brain and connect the product in question with pleseant feelings and memories

so no im completely against this statement",2
3407,television advertising is always s the group of people that should take use of the product young children are easy victims for manipulation and ,16
3408," through media like television so should television advertising  be allowed or not
advertising in any form is very important for the economic stucture it helps the companies reach more customers and ",15
3409," it comes to children they can easily sell their product with the use of bright colors and happy faces 
on the other ",0
3410, children are not well aware of what exactly is happening in front of their eyes a screen is often misjudged as reality and ,24
3411, they get diffrent ideas of what is real and what not when a childrens toy is advertised ,20
3412, surrounded by creatures like faries and cute animals it is ,18
3413, the assositaion with positive fealings that is created ,21
3414," a diffrent reality of a toy coming with faries and animals
through advertisments the child that is ",20
3415, in need of education by its parents is ,8
3416, told what it needs to be happy children are more curious than anyone else and they want to know what makes the people on the screen ,8
3417, happy but this can create the thought that materialisic worth is ,23
3418," to be happy that might lead to jealousy between chilren and not worshipping things like friendship or nature that should be experienced and explored as a child and people at any age
parents should be aware of what their child is watching and wether they are being influenced too much in what they want to have or play with but forbidding watching advertisments or having advertised toys is not the best way by seeing what their friends play with what they do not have children might get frustrated and feel left out and beg their parents ",2
3419,"
companies and television programms are responsible for showing those advertisements ",10
3420," they are the ones who should restrict the amount of advertisements 
in my opinion advertiements for video games or useless expensive things should not be allowed because they are not supporting the childs development or are woth their price
",13
3421,in the 21st century television advertising takes a huge part in companies marketing techniques ads nowadays follow certain terms and conventions based on target audiences the specific products are meant to attract more and more advertising companies dont just talk to adults or adolescants anymore they are ,10
3422," directly adressed to younger children around the age of  these specific kind of ad rises a lot of critical questions in todays society

young children are really easily affected by the things they see around them wether they copy things done by people in their envirement or recreate things seen on tv or the internet therefore ads directed to younger audiences are specifically meant to persuade children even if the ad just introduces new toys or games children will get attracted to it and will certainly want to buy them ",0
3423, the lack of rational decision skills children will ,7
3424," persue to influence other family members whithout even noticing they might mention the item to a sibling or ask one of their parents to buy it for them

on the other ",9
3425, ads for  this speci target audience are most often constructed in a nonoffensive way and ,11
3426, dont disturb audiences watching them it ,19
3427, is a huge marketing platform for companies even if the product is not entirely meant for childrens use if the ad is designed in a childlike humorous way it will ,16
3428, carry the message or the content of the ad to older audiences ,11
3429," their parents or relatives

in my opinion tv advertisement directly addressed to children is not problematic ",14
3430, term and conventions of childrens advertisement are not obeyed at the end of the day a tv advertisement will not have a huge impact on children aged between  and will most certainly not change consumption habits of adults in their envirement,14
3431," to the upper named statement because why should advertising to children should be forbidden
children up to five are ",13
3432," watching tv if the parents allow it if the mother or the father dont have a problem with dealing with the television advertising why should it not be allowed 
the parents should be able to know what there children are allowed to watch and what not ",13
3433," i dont think that it should be forbidden for all because it is not the
television that has to think about it
also a few spots are ",15
3434, interesting for those young children espacially things about animals or something that they can play with when i was younger my mum did allow me to watch tv and i would not say that the advertising was bad ,14
3435, or my future young children are often really happy ,8
3436," they get to see some cute animals or a barbie 
maybe specific spots should be replaced to spots which are teaching children something about life or make the children happy
there should not be a advertising that says that smartphones for this aged group are good or that a spot where they get to know what alcohol is
in my oponion there should be specific times for the programm for the young aged and in the afternoon there should be the programm for the upper aged
so that parents can easily let there children watch tv and in the afternoon ",16
3437," the children are sleeping the older ones get to see something they want to see
",1
3438," half of the upper namend statement because some advertising is bad for the children but some arent even a little bad
a advertising for children should have specific themes that children love like animals or spots for children based films an series
but it would better if the advertising would be much shorter ",16
3439," that children get to see what they want and that the programm doesnt take too long
at the end i summarize my ",8
3440," of view television advertising should be allowed but not every spot should be in the programm for these young aged
the spots should show things children love and nothing children should not see also the advertising should be shorter ",14
3441," that the children dont have to watch a long time tv because of the long spots which are shown in the breaks of the programm they want to see
this would ",6
3442," make it a lot easier for the parents to let the children watch what they want and they dont have to take care that something bad would be shown their children
  ",17
3443, that some advertisement at the television can be dangerous for young children children in this age can easily be manipulated and are open for any influences in addition to that the children of the current generations are spending more and more time watching television ,14
3444, the danger will increase in the future children at this age canâ´t really see wether itâ´s a true statement in the advertisment or if itâ´s a lie even in some advertisements where their parents would clearly understand that itâ´s not true the ,16
3445, of this bad influence could be that young children increasingly think that they need to buy things to be accepted and to be popular pretty or even intelligent on the other ,2
3446, the children will be sooner or later confronted by advertisements ,16
3447, they didnâ´t watched television advertisements ,10
3448, they were 3 or five so it would not change much to not allow it ,19
3449, against the statement is that advertisements with bad influece arenâ´t only at the television young children can be manipulated and influenced by advertisments everywhere wether itâ´s a mall or a supermarket so it would not help to keep the children away from the advertisements at the television ,13
3450, only the parents should be responsible aobut their childrens well being they should make sure that the children know that they dont need things to be a better person and that the advertisements ,2
3451, at the telvision arenâ´t always real if the parents are aware of the possible danger of the advertisments i donâ´t think itâ´s necessary to not allow television advertising ,14
3452,today it is normal that televison advertises directly toward young children in this statement ,13
3453," discuss the question whether it should be allowed or not

first it can be useful for parents to occupy their children ",12
3454, they are doing other things and cant give attention to them the kids ,1
3455, it is not hard to keep them watching however it cant be right for parents to sit their children right in front of the televion just to occupy them the young children can totally be affected by it and can getting used to it furthermore it is damaging and cant be healthy for a young brain which is not completely developed if they are always watching tv they will be used to it and dont know anything else in addition to that the children are obviously too young to understand everything which they see if they are getting older they ,17
3456, understand most of it but the main problem is that they believe everything they see ,3
3457, if there is a person in the television who comes very often he or she could become a role model for the kids they will take it very personal and the advertising will stay in their mind they ,0
3458," want everything if there is anything that seems nice to play with

to sum up i ",18
3459, think that advertising in the television toward young children should not be allowed because there are just ,13
3460," against it finally it is about the health of our children and we cant let it affected by the modern technology  

",12
3461,"advertising 

times have changed in terms of raising a child new technology has come and nowadays cant be ignored kids from young age on get used to a tv a mobile phone and the computer with the use of the new technology comes advertisement but advertisment isnt only just bad and not good for the kids it gives them ",16
3462, ideas for christmas or their birthday it gives them something to dream of or talk about with their friends and this can ,24
3463," happen to children aged  channels and companys need advertisement to promote of finance themselves there is no difference between going outside and seeing a huge board with advertisement or wathing tv and have a small spot between your show 
but theres ",14
3464, good advertisement many try to controll kids and promote things which are ,16
3465," heavily overprized but maybe even bad for the children because it contains small things that they can swallow and in the worst case even die 
in my perspective advertisement should be sorted the age  is one of ",2
3466, phases of a growing children and its a learning phase in which they more or less believe everything you will say as a child i watched tv aswell and the adbreaks werent the most fun ,6
3467, i did something else this shows you that ads have ,11
3468, a impact on the minds of little kids but they ,8
3469, have a own opinion and wont be controlled by the advertisment its all about how and what you promote and what is allowed to promote thats is why ,11
3470, that advertising isnt always bad but should definitly be sorted also its pretty rough to only ban ads for young children because ,13
3471, young children watch those channels and others who were wathing could be offended because they acutally wanted to see the ads ,13
3472, to say if it should be allowed or not depends on the commercial for example some commercialspots are really creative and should be allowed ,15
3473," some spots are to influencing towards the children should not
for example if the commercial make it seem that you have to have the subjekt and can not life without it this is dangerous ",16
3474," for young children because they believe things like that alot easyer than adults which is obvious but i think you can not disallow them because tv is for everyone 

to come back to my ",17
3475, pointing out the creative tv spots and with that i mean ,10
3476, something usefull or real fun for the children i remember ,8
3477, the spots for a summercap which in my oppininon is ,18
3478, cool of course maybe they ,19
3479," to make the camp seem cooler but that is ok in my oppininon
another example are the lego commercials because in their spots no one tells you that you need their products to have fun and they do not show anything wrong about their products to make them seem cooler

so in my oppininon you can not really disallow television advertising for young children because it is a bussines ",14
3480, the parents have to decide if their child should watch commercials and if ,14
3481, they are the ones who should explain their child how advertising works ,16
3482,"most children watch tv daily the amounts of advertising may it be toysclothesfood and what not that flashes by is unbelivable which leads to the question wether television advertising s young children should be allowed
the young children get introduced to greed as soon as they start watching television the constant flow of products that you must buy and cannot live without does have a serious impact on young children they will soon start beliving that ",14
3483, be happy they need a certain new toy its a phenomenon that even adults struggle with the need to fill up certain gaps in their life with materialisitc purchases this is not something that should be introduced at such an early age ,20
3484," it results in a certain selfdestructive behaviour 

they are more likely to make bad decisionsthe children are prone to spent their pocket money on these pointless purchases ",4
3485," a speaking turtle children would spend all their pocket money on rdiculous toys if they just see it on tv over and over again convinced that they need it

on the contrary ",20
3486," one could argue that the telvision ads may teach children how to deal with money  and teaching them the value of things making them realize that once 20bucks spent on a speaking turtle means that you may not be able to buy the princess necklace or that with the same money you could have bought a bunch of candy teaching them the most basic understandings of economics

of course the ads may lead kids to wanting something but by all means this does not mean they ll get it the parentsto do have a say in what their kid spend the money on this means that they will learn how to deal with disappointment and ho to get over it

in my opinion the telvision advertising does neither ruin the kids nor help them incredibly i dont think it has to be forbidden if parents want to protect their kids from the kapitalist part of our society the may just switch of the tv",14
3487,"television advertising s young children should not be allowed 


young children are easy to manipulate ",13
3488," they are not ablr to think as rational as an adult would

on one ",24
3489, it is important for making money and an effective way to sell more products industries need to advertise there products to be succesfull also it is in the ,11
3490, of the parents whether or not they allow their children to see television advertising also i think that it is better for the children to see adverstisement directed to their age than advertisement directed for adults ,13
3491," that could be worse for their well being

on the other ",19
3492, they might not understand that they can not have everything shown in the adverstisement and seeing a lot of great toys might make them think that what they have is not enough which leads them to be unthankfull towards their parents also they are not able to think rationally about whether they really need something or not it is easy to manipulate them to thank that they need something shown in the advertisement to be as cool as the children on tv which can lead to a low confidence and think that they are only worth something ,2
3493," they own the things shown in the adversisement

to sum up ",3
3494, that tv advertisement should be forbidden ,15
3495, it is imporant for the children to learn that what is shown on tv is not the reality they need to learn that they can not have everything and that they need to compromise it is impartant the the parents speak with them about television adversising to make sure that they understand everything correctly and that they do not need the best toys to be confident that is something that is important to learn at that age ,17
3496, that comunication is always better than to forbid something of course it is a big problem that children are very navie and believe what they see but it is important for the industries to sell their toys aswell parents should deciede whether or not they allow their children to wath programms that show adversisement iand if they do deals with the ,17
3497, and explain the children the conce,9
3498,it is a common picture in a normal houshold children watching television ,6
3499," school to most of the people it may seem harmless but there is a danger hidden inside advertising many complaints about advertisments in television were recently mentioned by a sheer number of families parents complained about how their children began to ask for more toys specificly those which could be seen on television moreover the wishes for candy and similar junk food increased more a small party consisting of concernd parents wants to disallow advertising s young chilrden but should television advertising  be allowed or not

first of all it is wellknown that advertisements are no good studies show that customers bought a certain product 20 times more ",14
3500, having seen it on television the influence on our choices on products is very heavy the better an advertisment is the longer we think about it the more it settles in our brains advertisment has a long history of sexism and racism ,11
3501," is has never been disallowed 

however advertisments are not muteable they are at your bus station in your magazine or even on your shirt there is no way to escape from advertising although the influence of advertisments on children between the age of  is certainly high the influence is going to increase even more during the age of six to ten so what could stop the children from being influenced and pushed into this never ending circle of course the ",16
3502, thing to do would be to make the children stop watching television at all this might work out for a certain period of time but their friends might ,17
3503," be watching television and be informing them about the latest toy or candy 

to refer again to the question mentioned in the introduction ",1
3504, that advertising towards children aged  should be allowed there is no way that the children might be able to flee the circle most of the population on earth is stuck in ,13
3505,children often donâ´t know what to do so parnets put them infront of a tv but is this really the right thing to do ,17
3506, your kid is between aged  if the parents have many things they have to do and the child is only annoying ,24
3507, it is a good thing to show the kid a serie it is not okay to think that your child is annoying but that is a different subject through tv shows kids can learn many things eg colours ,6
3508, cultural normes like sharing to other peoeple or that it isnâ´t okay to hurt somebody there are ,7
3509, some shows where kids can learn other languages but ,6
3510, scientists found out that kids could get ill from watching tv young children can only see many many pictures which changes very quickly they couldnâ´t realize what happens and canâ´t understand what a tv is also there is a lack of communication ,17
3511, children watch too early too much tv they canâ´t say what they feel or want because they have less words to use and ,17
3512, it is better to care about the children when parents decide to have a baby ,9
3513, they have to spent time with herhim ,19
3514, it is a difficult situation kids learn a lot ,7
3515, the parents read them something out they know how to listen and how to learn by heart ,8
3516, it is okay for young children to watch tv once a week but only for half an hour and only if the kid wants it the shows must be checked by parents if it is a reaaly good one and donâ´t get the children be stupid like the teletabbies but there are many other activities to do the kid has to learn how to do something alone ,17
3517, he has nothing to do tv arenâ´t allowed to be the answer he has to get a social life even it is a young person otherwise they donâ´t learn how to share in real life or all those cultural normes so i would more ,1
3518, with the statement that television advertising s young children should not be allowed ,13
3519,nowadays children spend way too much time in front of a television ,17
3520, playing with their favourite toys and having fun with their frieds outsidewhen i was 2 years old or even 5 years old television wasnt an issue at alli wasnt allowed to watch tv by myself ,17
3521," i would only sometimes watch the news with my parents if the subject wasnt too heavy for my age group but in the new generation of children it is very common to watch tv at a very young agethere are even are even advertisements designed to please the youngest viewersis that a good developement in our society or a bad one
its obvious that young children are easy targets to advertisements they see something and they want it immediately not tomorow or ",14
3522," weekno right now when we think of little children at a supermarket we get the picture of children comlaining maybe even throwing themselves on the ground and crying in frustration for not getting something that they want really badly that kid maybe saw an advertisement for the product on tv the other day and now it aasosiates the product with the fun the children in the advertisement had with it
you could say that children that young dont have a brain enough developed to assosiate anything well thats not true because a young childs brain works almost only by assosiatons they assosiate vegetables with disgust or snow with winter they assosiate their mothers voice to safetyit obviously only works if you repeat it to them enough so as there is almost as much advertisement as series and films on tv they are persuaded quite quickly
so ",2
3523, advertisement  children that young is a good thinkthat it actually harms them and their relationship with buying and possessing productsi would even go ,16
3524," saying that the advertisements make them gready and harm their developement

",11
3525,"many children are watching tv daily the time goes faster and the parents dont have to care about them television has a big influence to the children they can be scared of a movie impressed by a hero or even learn something about the life 

near to all tv shows movies and ",17
3526," on are interrupted by advertising they can be good or bad adventurous or stupid 
the advertises are good for the business the children see some sweets or a doll and the want to have it they ask there parents to buy this stuff until they get it without television advertising many factories would be closed

the advertises are sometimes very long ",0
3527, the children get bored they just want to watch something and all fiveteen minutes the show or the movie will be interrupted by adverising in this time the children switch to another channel and maybe even forget the show or movie they are actually watching but it gives ,6
3528, children who turn off the tv ,17
3529," the advertise start and do something better and healthier like going outside or make homework

so many television advertises are dangerous for the children they see a man who can fly or somone who swims with a crocodile the risk is big that the children are impressed by that and want to try it out by themselves that is very bad and dangerous

",14
3530, advertising is important for the big business but ,11
3531, they are in the shows and movies for young children not nessecairy advertises can have many influences about their life they are young and hava a lot to learn but it gives many better ,0
3532, to learn about something important about the life than tv andvertises i know that its probably impossible to watch tv without advertises but maybe they can be at the end or ,10
3533, of a show or a movie ,6
3534, the children would be less bored or animated to something they shouldnt do ,8
3535,"television advertising  aged  should not be allwowed
can you follow this statement 
in the following text this will be explaned 
the good things of television is that it could transfare things to children ",13
3536," they better lern how to speak or learnig motorical things also they are seeing new things and lern out of them they lern how to get along with people or lern to see things in an other way they have sawn them the parents are happy to have more time to do things without a kid but television dont have only good things
maybe the  aged children are sitting to near to the sreen and get problems witch their eyes later on children cant know that they have to sit far away and a tv is magic for children ",17
3537, they are going to near when children have a own tv in theit room and know already how to use it they may get not enough sleep because the screen let the brain thinking that it is day time and they have to stay up and not to go to sleep after that the kids hadnt enough sleep and cant concentrate the biggest negative ,17
3538," is that the children getting influensed from the televiosion and lern things wrong and everyone know things that you have learned wrong are very difficult to lern right afterwards the children couldnt understand erverthing and interpretate things wrong because they are made for older people and lern wong out of it
in the end ",6
3539," that children should be allowed to watch television but only one hour a day and at a normal day time this time is a golden hour for parents where they can relax or do something without their kid also they shouldnt watch erverythink because of brutal things and things that they are understanding wrong 
if i should answer the statement with yes or no ",17
3540, with the statement above because of many reasons you can influence young kids easily because in this age you are very naive now if kids see advertisments on television about toys and how cool they are they want to have this toy too they will ask their parents and annoy them untill they buy this toy you can say almost anything on telivision and small kids will believe it but if you dont allow ads on television you ,14
3541, shouldnt allow ads on posters or in magazines because they have the same effect on kids big companies shouldnt advertise their newest product to influence children parents should think alone about what they can buy for their kids but the kids will see new ads for toys very often and want their parents to buy it on the other ,13
3542, parents could just be strict and not allow their kids to watch that much tv or just dont buy every toy a kid wants,17
3543,"almost everybody has a television at home when you ask somebody about his childhood many people remember the series they watched but is childhood really only about watching tv
at the age of  children are supposed to learn a lot for exemple how to walk or to speak properly is it really good if they are watching tv at this time 

the learning process is important and tv hasnt any influence to the this they are only sitting there alone bettter would it be if they are socialising with their parents they would learn new vocaburlary and more or playing at the playground with some friends little children enjoy ",17
3544," the fantastic unreal word full of adventures but its difficult for them to see a difference between real and unreal
if they watched tv with this young age they would probably become kind of hooked on tv series ",6
3545," they are grown up 

when i was a child i wasnt allowed to wath television and i was fine with thatbecause ",17
3546," the childrern are forced to use their own imagination to have or do some kind of logical plays

this are only a few reasons why television advertising toward young children should not be allowed its the best time to learn about essential skills and better were not to miss this important steps in life 
going out there exploring the nature and being fascinated by the possibility of climbing trees is the only thing a child should care abouthaving fun with your parents is ",14
3547, youre little and this time should be used,18
3548,"for young children it is important that they play outside with other children because the have to make experience and to learn things like riding a bike or playing foorball because that are things which connect the children to the world outside their home an other important thing for them is the sunshine which they body need for vitamine c

lotâ´s of parentâ´s have not ",8
3549, much time for their children ,9
3550, work they are often out of power and wantâ´s to sleep ,1
3551, it is easier to sit them in front of the tv or ,1

3553, itâ´s sometimes better to watch with the family a movie ,1
3554," their are at home that has the effect that the children are not bored and it strenght the relationship of the family 

especially young children very like watching tv because there are lots of things they cantâ´s see in reality and it is very amusing for them to watch showâ´s like the tele tubbies but children can get easy addicted to things because the are young and didnâ´t really know what is important in live they are more interested in having fun ",17
3555, learning because they often think it is boring ,8
3556," they compare learning with things like watching tv


watching tv can have good effects on them too a lot of movies for children have more content than being amusing they have influence to them a good movie which is ",6
3557, about friendship can show children that it is important to be nice and helpfull they learn to be social and not egoistic on the other ,8
3558," there are sometimes movies like from the 

",6
3559,it is not god for these children to watch television for a long time because there brains cold not process the informaion from the eyes as fast older people it is not good too because the children maybe copy the behavior of the characters from the the movies or films but it can improve the speech from these children because they can listen hour for hour to people but they cant see the face from the person who is speaking because the sound is not the origional this is not good for the speech of the children because they lern things by seeing ,17
3560," walking but if they see a character jumping from a wall they could try it because the saw it advertising in this way is good for companies because these children want to get toys and if the see these they are very sure that they want this special thing but it is very bad for parrents because they have to buy this things else the children maybe cry the children get a influence by there environment more than older people because they learn to understand how there environment works and what the have to do and what they should not do for exmple walk lonely outside i thing it is not good to make advertising only for these yooung children because the language is realy bad and the maybe want to get these toys that they saw 
because of this reasons ",0
3561, it should be not allowed for children to watch a long time a day television because it is not good for there brain but ,17
3562,  a short time maybe half a hour a day is ok for them because they have to use these screen there hole life so ,1
3563, to the statement because of the reasons above,21
3564,first of all an advertisement  influences their perception because they learn how things are and people act and ,0
3565," i wouldnt let my young kid watch advertisements where they promise very unreal things like
furthermore the brain is ",14
3566, in its developing stage in that age ,24
3567," the brain could get manipulated by surrealist advertisements
advantages are acted and mostly synchronized afterwards as a result the voices are sometimes a few miliseconds too late what adults wouldnt even notice however the brains of young kids do and as i recently read its proofed that a brain that often watches television can be seriously damaged
another ",6
3568, is that the television channel sometimes shows advertisements of movies they are going to show the following day and even in the afternoon they sometimes show the preview of some crucial films my little brother ,10
3569, who is already eleven years old ,24
3570," gets horrific dreams because of such film excerpts which are shown during the midtime break of a football match 
the only ",6
3571, of an advertisement is that they are mostly funny and they entertain that even little children laugh as parents its clear that you ,11
3572," want your free time in which you dont have to take care of your son or daughter and if you choose the right channel there wont be too many interceptions with advertisements 
personally ",10
3573, television advertising directed  toward young children ,14
3574,"essay television

the statement television advertising  aged  should be not allowed will ",15
3575," essay be analyzed and end up with the opinion of my own 

at ",21
3576, there should be given positive and negative ,21
3577," of the topic 
to let children watching tv could be positive for the parents because they ",17
3578, have to cool down if they have a children which cries everytime ,19
3579, but in front of the television it is excited of all those colours and doesnt cry it is good ,6
3580, why the children shouldnt watching tv another ,17
3581," is that the children could get a more better use of words or learn new words in germany there are many tv shows to learn english for children it is easy because they explain every word for three or more times and repeat it 
at the age of  the children should be allowed to watching tv because of an hour could not be this bad for them maybe ",17
3582, they are in the kindergarden it could be worse because some of the other children watches television at home and they talk about some series but the children who doesnt watch tv because of the parents of him doesnt allowed it it cant integrate him or herself to them for the reason that at the society of today are electronic things social media the internet and ,17
3583," the tv is really important 
another reasons is that if parents dont want their children to be watching mad series the children could watch news and know in a young age many about what is up in the world 

a reason against that children watching tv in the young ages is that they maybe get mad and starts crying screaming and be really aggressive and angry often the children cant get along with those many colours and the moving at the tv it makes them mad in their brain and they could get crazy about it 
another reason is if they are often in front of the tv they want it every time like a man who take drugs it is something that they think to need ",17
3584, some times so they always asks their parents to let him or her watching tv and asks them all time long to the ,17
3585," where the parents say yes
another reason is that the children dont want to play with friends they just want to watches tv parents who doesnt look time for time what their children is watching are bad because it could watches series or a film which isnt for his age and the children could get paranoia or something else but it could be mentally destroyed 

in my opinion children should watch tv because the daily society it is normal to have a smartphones or watching tv even at a young age but parents have to see sometimes what the children is watching ",17
3586, they cant watch series or films which are for older children or not good for their mind because they could be mentally disabled  ,6
3587,i see no reason to not allow advertisments in the childrens program the company that sends the program out in television neeeds to send advertisments too because they need to earn money if they wouldnt earn enough money they  would stop their program children can be infuenced easy but they ,13
3588, have parents that decide what they buy for their children and what not so ,9
3589, its right that advertisments are allowed,11
3590,when discussing about whether television advertising  should be allowed or not you can choose between two different ,15
3591, of view there are several ,18
3592," that speak for and against it 
nowadays young children are already watching television their parents prefer to let them be entertained in front of the television ",17
3593, raising them up properly obviously the children are confronted with lots of information but because of them being ,7
3594, young it often doesnt matter what they are watching they cant distinguish nor memorise the information they receive from the television on the other ,6
3595," allowing children to watch television advertisiments may lead to damage in the longterm as they start requesting the advertised products
in addition to this a young child may not even be capable of thinking on its own ",14
3596, it may not link the idea of seeing a product on an advertisement and the idea of going to the store to buy it also children arent even capable of going to the store on their own ,2
3597, advertising for young children on television may really just be a waste of money in comparison one could ,14
3598," say that in the longterm young children may really feel the urge of buying advertised products as they were introduced to advertising very early in their life
in conclusion ",0
3599, television advertising  should not be prohibited because it probably doesnt affect the children in the longterm i would even go ,13
3600, far as calling it a waste of money because it wont be the children who buy the products but their parents,2
3601, television advertising directed  should not be allowed in the following text i listet a few ,15
3602," thinking about this issue
children of the ages  are way more influenced by prebuilt opinions than adults because most grownups can question different opinions and think about those critically ",7
3603," children as young as the mentioned age are more likely to not be able to do that therefore advertisements have a huge influence on kids and can make it harder for the child to learn to reflect their surroundings if they develop the habit of adapting others opinions
although getting premade opinions on such things as toys and food could help children to learn reflection from a very early age which may give them a more mature view on things in their youth ",0
3604, they are familiar with critical strategies if it gets to a more important decision than what to eat for dinner also parents can use advertisements to teach their children the concept of money and different values ,0
3605, the right amount of consume but it depends on the parents if they want to educate their child on their own or rely on the scholar system on the other ,8
3606," children this young probably dont want to learn about the values of a decent human life on this planet they only want to play with the toys from the ads
to conclude ",24
3607, ads aimed at children this young should be a thing because they are more influenced by the prebuilt opinions than adults and they would be more likely to adapt opinions even in their adult life if they arent teached properly altough advertisements could be used by the parents to teach children proper values and concepts but lets be honest aint nobody got time ,16
3608,"jung children and television 

every person now that children love television they look with realy big eyes if you say they are alowed to look but a lot of docs andacademics are agenst television they have good reasons for this

children under three see the pictures are faszinated but they donâ´t know what happend they can not realise and donâ´t understand young children learn to be social and a lot of ouser things with komunication they need a reflektion from the person they are komunicaed with kommunication ist ",17

 children have in teenager age problems with socialcontacts math sports her weigth and alot of outher things

so shoot television forbitten vor young kids it is a big question and a lot of academics impriesiatesd it but why is it than ",17
3610, diversed topic because parents like the television too and it is a nice thing that they have a half our time to do ouserthings ,17
3611," the child is sitting in front of the tv and at which age do you whant to take the cut if a child can cut watch television its are a lot of questions and a littel bitt of prograstination that is gulty for this situation 

but we have not to forgettthat the controvers in oure televison programm is alreddy a high discussion in oure society in this lands it are the kidsactors in this country it are the brutal action szenes

we cut do what we want to forbitt it is possible but ther are now ways to check it parents want to see her childs happy and healthy that this is not possible this two things together in that ",17

3615," they parents read  a book for his child the donâ´t have contact with televisions and other electric things in this age the donâ´t need in this young age contact with the media of the world it is not importen to do taht in thei age thy wont to have a nice childhood with much time outside and not in the livingroom also the children dont understand what is wright or wrong what the people do in the televison and they do the wrong thinks because the learn it from a show charakter  
but ther are many television shows for young children who thy can learn things for the kindergarden or the school ",24
3616, the parent musenâ´t sitt the whole time be the child the child look on the television and make nothing els but the child can learn ,8
3617, in the kindergarden or with pictur books and not with the television i found children dont need a television in this age because thy donâ´t understand this all and play whith friends or whith his or her perents is better than look the whole time for the television in my childhood i donâ´t watch much television because i play often with my sister and my parent when my parent had any time my grandparents came and we make much thinks with them ,17
3618, much time to watch televisions but somteims we watch learnig shows but than for on hour and that not very often,17
3619,"televison advertising towards young children
first of all do young children understand what the media says because they dont really have a good memory ",14
3620, they wont remember a certain advertisemend ,3
3621, they are at the toystore to buy a new toy if they see the advertisemend they would properly tell their parents ,20
3622, they remember theyd like that toy so later on they maybe get it thats how the world works you ask your parents if you can have something and ,20
3623," you get it thats how the world works isnt it no thats not how the world works then he would never learn how to save money from a certain income to get something he worked for some would say it is a bit early a the age of 2 or 3 but i think it cant be early enough to learn how the world works
but ",9
3624, i loved my childhood it was such an easy time you could eat sleep play with friend and do what you want ,8
3625, thats what childhood is all about the advertisemends only showed me at home what i could be looking for at the toystore so even today i dont really see any problem because if you want something as a kid you ask your parents ,20
3626, they have to dicide whether you get it or not ,19
3627," it is a question of education not a question of advertising blaming the adventisemends would be too easy 
thatss why i over all think the television advertisng directed  isnt a problem and blaming it for the huge amount of toys someone has is just way to easy it is a matter of education ",14
3628,it might seem that advertisements for children might prove usefull as children can choose for themselves what interests them ,0
3629, of view however there are many contradicting ,21
3630," 
for starters a child is too young to deprict whats good for itself and ",7
3631, cannot judge the value of a product ,23
3632, as advertisements are never neutral in addition children are easy to be influenced by the television and should be educated by their parents also children of that age are not ,14
3633, capable of handling money and most probably are dependant on their parents ,9
3634, of course children can always tell their parents what they want but its ,9
3635," up to them what they actually buy 
most importantly children watching television are missing elemental time else spent with framily and friends which normally provides much of future knowledge ",17
3636, the known words and moral values social capacities and other skills but advertisements often use wrong grammar in the use of puns taking ,11
3637," time for the child to learn but teach them wrong instead 
i ",7
3638, think advertisements are not to be allowed for children at such a young age    ,16
3639," write an essay belongs the toppic television advertising  should allowed or not be allowed
in my oppinion this topic is a very difficult topic because some children in this age can handel this elctric influence but many of them in the same age canâ´t do  that 
in that way i think that television toward young children should be not allowed because the kids canâ´t choose between fals and right tv topics they believe in that what they see in the television but if parents are ",13
3640," to the kids and they choose the serie or the catoon or what they watch together they can reflect if the show what is in the tv is good for the kids or not
when the kids watch allone some parts in the tv ",6
3641," that isnâ´t good for them to be influenced from many different and coulorfull advertising breaks
all in all ",11
3642," with the statement because young children  shouldnâ´t be as much as older persons be confrontated with big names of products and with their firm strategie to sell more products and to make more money with the small kids and their wishes

i hope that these answer is to some parts correct because i dont really understand the topic of this task ",8
3643,the topic if there should be television advertising  aged  is stated differently the advertisement could be a good thing for children that age because these products that are being advertised are specific for young children in that age ,13
3644," they cant get the idee of having to want a plastic gun or other things that arent ment for them also through these shown products children could develope a hobby by finding a toy that excites them and it shows them a range of what is possible today
 
on ",20
3645, these advertisements arent alwas good ,11
3646, they could show sweets and unhealthy stuff that could effect the children in their life then some parents dont take their responsibilty towards their children very serious and they buy them those things also these children are very naiv this could have effections on their expectations of presents from their parents and relatives another ,2
3647," is that in those advertisments the price isnt mentioned which is why children just want that toy but their parents cant afford it which could dissapoint the children 

all in all ",20
3648, talking about this toping is a good thing and that parents should talk with their children about this because every child reacts differently on advertisements and every child is effected differently by advertisements also some can afford those things that are being advertised and some dont ,16
3649, this makes a huge difference on how the children should take the advertisements serious or not,16
3650, is a good way to advertise because young children can be manipulated easily with good ads but ,16
3651, is abusing this weakness to make a good amount of money ,23
3652, the parents buying their children those advertised items because they love them basicly those advertisments abuse the children and their parents because the children are made to want the advertised stuff and the parents buy it for them on the other ,2
3653, these advertisments of couse help the companies behind the ads because they will make very much money out of it parents should ,16
3654," try to teach their children that they cant get anything they see on the television just because it is advertised
i ",2
3655, with the statement that advertising  should not be allowed if it is appropiate advertisment if the children are not forced by the ads to buy the advertised item i would totally accept that these ads would be shown in television on the other ,13
3656, if the ads would force the children to buy those items because they are presented as an item that the children must have ,2
3657, they actually dont really need it i would ,19
3658," with the given statement because the advertisment is just abusing the weakness of easily being manipulated that children have
if i had to decide if ",16
3659, there might be appropiate advertisment there is ,11
3660, more bad advertisment that forces children to buy the advertised item of course ads should be make the viewer want the item that is being advertised but if the viewer is too young to decide what he really wants to buy they shouldnt be manipulated by these ads in the age of  years  they cant decide what they want to buy on their own and ,16
3661, there shouldnt be ads directed to them,11
3662,today you can find in every house a tv and the most people cant imagine to have no one the most childrens starts to watch tv very early and ,17
3663, their parents or grandparents told them about their ,3
3664," tv they often start to laugh
the ",6
3665, tv was in the middle of the 20th century on the market the movies were black and white and have a button for switching the channels in this time the most people cant buy one because the tv too expensive but ,10
3666," a family owned a tv was watching tv the highlight of the evening

after the quick text ",1
3667, talk about the positive and negative ,21
3668," of watching tv in the young age of two to fve 
i start with the positive site 
one ",6
3669, is that the childrens could learn something in the channel for childrens are series where they could learn something new ,6
3670, about animals the nature or the world also the series like the sandmann in germany is a adorable serie to watch ,6
3671, the news that are produced extra for childrens are a good posibility for them because the people who worked there explained everthing easy ,6
3672," everybody could understand it

the ",18
3673," is that the childrens often dont want to go outside because they realy start to like watching tv sometimes because of that they lose friends and in this age is to have a friend very important
the most series for childrens are often in the early morning in the tv is another negative ",17
3674," because its bad to watch tv at 7am
the last ",1
3675," is that some childrens are learning some bad things from the serie or wehen they switch the channel

",6
3676, its okaywhen a children watch sometimes a movie or a serie at tv but only togehter with their parents ,17
3677, the parents knows which film the childrens watch but in totally ,6
3678,in our globalized and modern world media is getting more and more important nearly everybody is always online ,10
3679, a question must be asked if our society is based on media and of cause ,10
3680," on television why shouldnt we confrontate our children with television advertising to show them a part of our world and their future 
it is a ",14
3681," that media is one of the most popular things we spend our time with and dont you think that children should learn about their artificial environment very eary to be able to stand their lifes in a future of media
of cause it is important to show children their environment direct them into a content future but does media really lead to a happy childhood that is always a basic for a content future
media ",17
3682, destroys childhood captures young people ,7
3683, that they are not able to think theirselves anymore it is a big problem inowadays that children are that early manipulated in a direction that supports the destruction of our environment ,7
3684," as advertising that promotes and forms a whole character of a society a time children suffer from high expectations of their family and friends build up walls and hide themselves behind them chatting via a computer is easier than verbal conversations but that does not form strong characters who are able to express opinions because there is no chance to form an opinion
advertising  leads to manipulation and people who can be manipulated are wanted in a society that aims for simularities 
selfreflection does not happen anymore and dont you think that this danger of young people who may change the society by new ways of thinking isnt wanted advertising a shampoo may not sound dangerous but it advertisement expresses a whole character of time and ",11
3685, this character of time must be changed ,18
3686, offer  my children a childhood that forms freedom in their minds and no pictures of shampoo dolls and cornflakes in their heads because the age of childhood ,8
3687, it is not experienced in full consciousness forms a whole character and ,21
3688,"more and more children watch television all day  
that is why the question whether television advertising  aged  should not be allowed have to be discussed
first of all young children watch tv to have fun and to entertain themselves ",14
3689, playing with others but adults do it the same way they want to watch their favourite series without seeng annoying advertising ,1
3690, so why should children have rights to watch tv without advertising ,13
3691," their parents do not
the answer should be it would be pretty unfair children aged  can not really judge about questions advertising asks they cannot say i do not need the things the people show to me it is easier to manipulate a younger child than an adult who can judge better and ",2
3692," it shold not be allowed 

on the other ",19
3693, advertising cannot reach children they are not the group of people the advertising wants to react because they are not real consumers the advertising has a direct goal people who buy unnessesary things it would not be effective to place advertising in childrens tv but in that ,14
3694, of view there is not an ,21
3695,"
although advertising does not really reach them it is a question of morality 
people who cannot already judge about things should not be influenced by television it would be better if they 
 

",14
3696,"every company tries to get their product to the group of people who could be interested the most in buying these things so with any advertisements does not matter if it is a television advertisement an ad on the radio or adverstisements in form of print media the seller of the product tries to hit a specific group in the society so some ads direct toward young people and some try to convince old people to buy products of the company

the statement critisises television advertisings heading toward the youngest of generations aged betweed two and five years it says that adverstisements like these should not be allowed to be sent out by any television channel the very young kids are not able see through the advertising they just see the video in their tv devices and think that this product must be amazing they cannot build an own opinion on the product that got presented to them because their brain is ",13
3697, in such a young state ,19
3698," it is not possible for them to have some controversial thoughts on the clip they just have seen 

on the other ",19
3699, the kids somehow have to learn how to look at things critically and not just believe the ,7
3700, thing they see or the ,3
3701, sentence they read they will get confronted with this topic at any time in their life so why should we hide adverstisements heading towards this part of society ,21
3702, they get to them in a certain ,19
3703," of life anyway

in my opinion banning television advertisings that are specificly going  is just something to hide the reality from them but it would definetly help if parents try to tell the kids what the advertising is trying to do and how it tries to manipulate them so the kids have a basic knowledge on how adverstisements are made and how they work ",14
3704, they do not just believe everything they see in their television device,3
3705,"television advertising   should that be allowed
first of all there should be a way young children get to know about some specific toys or something to develop own decisions of what they like or do not like this will be important for their later life
but the media today influence children a way too much children always want to have the new cool things they saw in the tv because for them everything seems like a musthave the producers of the advertising uses colorful and loud gadgets in their videos to support this thought of the children so they make their profit based on the ",14
3706," that children can be influenced easily 
on the one ",7
3707, it is just a product like a toy ,20
3708, and why should the producers of it should not be allowed to make advertising for their product of course they want to earn some money ,15
3709," and they do not lie to the kids or promise them something absolut wrong mostly they make children happy with their product but to reach this they need to make some advertising for their tool
on the other ",2
3710, a tool can make a child sad as easy as happy when a child sees a tool and wants to have it ,20
3711," badly and even all hisher friends have this tool but the parents are just not able to buy it the child will be very sad and might not feel integrated to his group of age anymore 
summarized ",4
3712, televison advertising for young children is acceptable in a certain way it should not be too much and should not be based on influence the children to buy it just a simply introduction of a product in my opinion they are in a age they can start to develop a feeling for decisions in a slowly way but in the todays media  exists to much supply for them ,14
3713, that they are not able to have a wise decision,3
3714,many children nowadays are placed in front of a tv and are left there all day long the problem with this is that they dont only see tv programms that they should not they ,17
3715," see adverts that are s them the question now is if these adverts should be forbidden

first of all it is a problem that little children watch ",16
3716, there are a lot of things that chlidren that age should not be seeing but they do for example there are a lot of tv programms that treat the subject of monsters and other scary things that could traumatize them for their wole life ,24
3717, they are probably not even meant to do that there are ,19
3718, tv programms that are just meant for adults like horror movies if a child watches these kind of filmes it will defintels be traumatized because they dont understand that the things thar are shown in these movies are not even real they believe what they see in the tv and this ,6
3719," leads to the main problem with these adverts

children believe these adverts while adults know that most of the things that are said in commercials are exeggerated children do not know ",16
3720, if a character from their favorite tv programm says that these cookies that are formed like them are the best cookies in the entire world the children that sit in front of the tv believe this and go to their parents and want them to buy these cookies and the ,2
3721," time they go groceryshopping with their parents they will be screaming and will not stop until their mother promises them to buy these cookies

advertising isnt a bad thing but ",2
3722, it is directed to children it is very manipulative and shows them things that are very unnecessary but they want them anyway ,6
3723, they go to their parents and ask for these things often they dont even know why they want these things they just want them the problem eith this is that they are invented to this world of consum at a very young age ,3
3724, they grow up with this exeggerated consum if their parents do not do something against this the commercials bring wrong values to them the adverstising kind of raises the children towards a direction that is useful for them ,14
3725, many years later for example mcdonalds their adverts are very good and successful because they are s children and tell them that mcdonalds is very healthy and everyone is rella happy and if you go there you will be happy too of course ,0
3726, the children that saw this advert become older they will not believe this but on the inside there is something that ,16
3727," tells them about these values and connects them with the brand

",23
3728, that advertising s children should be forbidden but ,13
3729, that the laws that reat this subject should be a lot harder ,21
3730, that this manipulatve advertising is not aloud any longer because that is the thing that we should worry about,11
3731," to the quote in the task and give my opinion as a conclusion

as a ",21
3732, there is to say that children in this age are mostly not able to think about the products that are shown in the text so the advertising can influence the children that much that they want these product ,0
3733, much that they ask their parents whether they can get it if the parents dont buy it ,3
3734, angry that they have a big argue with their parents so in a worst case scenario it can have negative influences on the relationship between the parents and the children in the future if this happens very often another reason for forbidding the advertisements is that children cant even buy the products theirselves and ,2
3735, the advertisements doesnt have any impact on the children they arent interested in advertisements and just want to watch television so the only effect of advertising is that the children are bored of watching television because they cant watch their favourite tv show without having some interruptions by advertisements a reason against the quote is that the children get a ,14
3736," knowledge about some products that are shown in the advertisements in some cases it can effect that the children get a better education or that they have a better knowledge another reason is that the children cant buy the products theirselves so the products shown in the advertisements have to be bought by the parents which can decide whether they want to buy it or not 

in my opinion advertisements should be forbidden because it is boring for children and can bring problems to the parents",0
3737,"too many televesion advertising and too many influences but is that right that that the children aged  should not be allowed to watch these advertisings 
of course there are pleinty reasons against the television advertinsing one might be that the young children become influenced and directed by the advertisings if they watch them too often they might not decide anymore between lies and the reality in these speaches often the producers of the advertising of toys lie to put their product in a better view the children see the toys and want to have them but is that as good as everybody thought they have trust in a product which might be bad produced and ",14
3738," they will be sad if the toy does not work as they thought and how it was shown in the television advertinsing 
an other reason to hide the advertising toward young children might be that often the advertisings do not show subjects for  years old children usually they mention subjects for older people or videogames for adults what do the children would learn if they see brutal videogames like the famouse game gta yes they would think that the people how are destroying cars and killing other people is normal young children learn from seeing and doing it it would be a bit extrem to say that they would do the same like the people in the video game or other advertising but in this case they will learn that to hurt other people with play guns or as i allready mentioned in video games is funny they connect the brutal toys and plays with fun learning by doing
",2
3739," television advertising is not bad all the time through more often the producers of advertising are showing organisations for helping other children or to supply them the children can see these horrible pictures and often they want to help them because they can see their sameagedfriend in bad living conditions 
",14
3740, the children can be bad influenced by advertising and be joked be toysprudcts but often they can learn from advertising which announces for help or nonsmoking also the parent can controll ,2
3741, every free space every gap between streets and houses are full of advertisement webadresses and qrcodes we are told to scan to see the latest trends we have to learn how to defend ourselves against the masses of ads internet tv analogue or digital popup cookie sheet of paper those classical tv spots seem ,11
3742," innocent and informing just like a learning program to get ready for the rest of the adworld so should we present television advertising towards our young children or should it be prohibited
assuming that watching tvads makes our children learn how to treat the aggresive product recommention we have to accept that they evidently will be raised in such a capitalistical environment ",14
3743," they should actually focus on developing their own identity and learn how to socialize arent we consumptionfocused enough of course not according to the industries 
sure we could say that ",3
3744, young children will never remember the adverts they saw ,16
3745," they were at the age of 3 or 4 but anyway they are humans who have already developed a consciousness of what happens around them which determines their way of thinking independent from their memory 
additionally that typical adlanguage with its unnatural and super expressive sound can be understood by the grown up children in that case ",24
3746," seek for conversation to develop their language
although the consciousness of reality and virtuality mixes in the head of children ",8
3747, they are confronted with animations on digital devices a law to prevent the children from being raised by the consumption industries is unnecessairy in my opinion tvadverts can limit and determine the development potential of our children but the impact is not that heavy that parents should not be able to decide on their own on the raising and their childrens future it would ,13
3748, be better to trust in prevention and telling parents about the risks and the ,7
3749,the following text will handle the topic whether advertisment directed to children aged between  years should be forbidden there are pro and contra ,16
3750," which will be laid out 
on the one ",18
3751," the idea seems a bit unnecessary and like a typical burocratic decision people might think that the advertisors should be free to make advertisments directed to everyone but there are more pro agruments which support the stat
first children are easy to influence in ",16
3752, they can be manipulated by advertisments ,11
3753, in a bad way  because they do not understand the strategy of advertisments to make people buy the goods so they are not in the position to judge about the advertisment because they do not have the ability to decide what is good for them this could be bad for the children to be influenced in that way because they ,16
3754," need to learn how to handle advertisments and the advertisments should not be directed to them
in addition the children are not the ones who would buy the goods which are presented in the advertisments instead they need to convince their parents and this could cause problems in the family because children can be very stubborn if they want something for the parents it might be hard to explain that the goods which are normally  presented in the advertisments in nice ways to make the people buy it can ",16
3755, be bad for the children in ,12
3756, the role of the parents is more hard nowadays if the children are influenced in many ways and do not trust the judgment of their parents anymore this should not be supported ,12
3757, it is not good to direct the advertisment  instead it could be directed to the parents who are more able to handle the strategies of advertisors and who are ,16
3758," the ones to decide whether to buy it or not 
",23
3759,television advertising has become very popular in our community old peolple watch their news on the television the middleaged enjoy watching movies ,10
3760, young people are wathing their favorite series day by day children got entertained by the children programme on the disney channels but there is ,6
3761," a younger group who enjoys watching television the babies the young children between two and five should the television advertising be allowed toward this young group is this group too young for watching televison

the television advertising can be a good entertainment for the little if  the parents are occupied with their house workthe television can be an easy ",14
3762," to make the children sitting calmly in their chair and not distracting the work of the parents
the little children have ",8
3763," a possibility to learn something from the television there are a lot of children programmes which have the aim to teach the children 
but there are ",6
3764," risks which one should not exclude the programmes on the children channels are not always that informative and helpful there are a lot of entertainment which does not make any sense 
the television can have a bad impact on the health of the children their eyesight can get worse by watching a lot of television 
in my opinion the children group aged  should not be allowed to watch television daily the television advertising is not necessairy for such a young group the children should ",17
3765, be playing with their cars or barbies than watching television programmes there are better ,1
3766, to entertain the young children ,8
3767,"in this essay the positive and neative agruments on the question if television should be advertising s young children aged  should not be allowed are going to be presented
the ",13
3768, that agrees with the statement is that chidren should learn from their parents and not from the television because the stories that are told could be disturbing or teach bad habits to the children secondly the children should not be depandent of televion in such an young age because sooner or later it will happen anyway and the ,17
3769,  is that children will want to see more and more from hisher superhero and will want to wach television all  day long wich will have ,6
3770," on their health because they do not go outside enough
now the ",4
3771," against the statement will be listed
the ",21
3772, why children should have their television shows and ,17
3773, on is that they can have something they are passionated about but ,21
3774, they can have other things they like secondly they slowly get used to modern technology and are not overwelmed by it later on and ,24
3775," they have other influences than their parents books or kindergarden
all in all ",7
3776, that chidren should be able to watch television even in a young age but ,17
3777, the parents can decide what they watch and if they even are alowed to watch that way the possibility is there,6
3778,"advertisement is all around us and we are exposed to it from a very young age most tv channels depend on adverts which are addressing different groups of costumers one of these groups are infants as young as  years old this is a controverial subject

first of all young children are easily influenced they may not question the benfit of a product if someone else is evidentely happy with it they learn through copying others and ",0
3779," are drawn to want the same toy as the fellow child in the advert

children of this age who are exposed to commercials and are often unable to choose whether they want to watch the adverts or not as an adult one is more aware of adverts and can ignore or skipt them whereas children who watch tv usually do not differ between programmes or adverts this again makes them more vulnerable
nowadays ",0
3780, the availability of programmes on the internet the internet often containes more adverts which may not always be appropriate for children ,14
3781," tv adverts are a better option

furthermore infants are usually cared for by their parents who will buy them what they think is best for them it would be logical to aim adverts towards parents and not the children themselves ",0
3782," the parents will be the ones who might eventually buy the product
however children should have a certain influence to what their guardians buy for them adverts may help them to recognise the diversity of products

in my opinion adverts aimed towards young childern ought to be appropriate and ther should only be a limited amount ",0
3783, it often depends in the product that is advertied and ,11
3784, how it is presented children may be made aware of the existance of the product but should not feel compulsed to own it ,2
3785, it is to say that young children are in the phase to copy all things other people do so if a person do anything ,7
3786, ironic the child will do that too it is not good because they are learning bad behaviours in  front of other people without knowing what they did wrong if a joung child is watching tv in the night there is mostly advertising with pornographic content wich is not good for children because they can get scared for long time at the other ,17
3787, children ignore the advertising in the tv because they only want to see the series or movies when there is advertising they change the channel to another series or movie when they have to see advertising they wuld getting bored and they do another activity ,14
3788," the tv is running
in my opinion it is okay that young children are watching advertisement in the television because they mostly do not even know what is going on and only want to skip the advertisement ",14
3789, they do not even see advertisement they do not watching tv in the night because they are sleeping and hopefully the parents are protecting them to watch tv at night and the things they are learning from advertisements is mostly goodlanguage what can be no formal language but they learn the all daylanguage of all people wich is not wrong to learn the series the children watch in tv should not be allowed because they are getting more stupid per every year,14
3790,in the following essay i shall examine ,21
3791," for and against the motion television advertising  should not be allowed 
the ",15
3792, that agrees with the statement is this advertising should not be allowed because it does support the high amount of watching tv which can have health impacts on the development of the children if there is ,13
3793, a special ad of a toy which a kid loves it wants to see this ad and wants to watch tv more often another pro ,0
3794, is that the manupulation of the consumer with advertising gets support because the industry does start to influence the children from a low age to ,13
3795," ask their parents to buy a certain toy 

an ",20
3796, against the statement is that a ban of the television advertising would not solve the main problem children would ,13
3797, playing in the nature or with toys even the eyes or the brain could have health impacts because the motions and colours on the tv could be too much for these young children another ,17
3798, against the stament is that only the advertising has not a bad impact on the children because it is only seconds long and ,13
3799, has not any unfitting content like ,18
3800," againt the stamenet is that if these advertising can not exist anymore the economy and companies could get problems probably less people would buy their products because they do not know them or are not convinced of them

in my opinion the advertising should not be allowed anymore first this advertising supports watching often tv at a young age which ",15
3801, is not good the consumer should ,23
3802, decide and have his own opinion to products and not get influenced companies and their advertising ,2
3803, not at a yong age,18
3804,many young children now a days watch a lot of televison and ,6
3805," there are a lot of advertisnets towardas young children even some children from the age of  sometimes are watching televison about three to five hours per day but are these advertisments good or bad for the child and should the be allowed or forbidden
there are many advetisements which are directed to very young childrens that is good because ",14
3806, a mother dosent has enough time for her child ,9
3807, she can just put her child in front of the televison and the child and watch some movies which are made for his age and for which the child isnt too young and every mother knows that a child includes much time and sometimes they need time to relax and maybe for some women its not easy to find a place where they can give their child during the day ,1
3808," they can relax 
on the other ",19
3809," the child because she would be happy and she has enough time to play with the child and only watching television isnt good for the child because in this period of his life its necessary that the child can crab and touch things and only looking at different things on a televison is not enough for the healthy growth of the child and in a extrem case they can even get addicted to it  
",17
3810, advetisments towards young children should be forbidden because it only leads to problems the temptation for the mother is too big to just put the child in front of the television and this is leading to that every child watches television the whole day and dont play with real toy and maybe later they get addicted to watching television and ,13
3811," they have some problems in their later life
",3
3812,in the modern era of technology a massive influence is lead towards children starting from a young age through television mobile phones and social media a new way of entertainig is presented should advertisement directly chosen for children of young age  be allowed in the following essay ,0
3813, pro and contra the statement and ,21
3814," coome to a personal opinion

first of the television is a great way of advertisement and information when children get personal advertisements they know exactly which toys they want to buy as an example the children can see the toys or other stuff it is a better way than magazines because you have more than just one picture



there is ",17
3815, to that theme children get easily influenced by certain things like advertiment the product is maybe shown in a really good way but ,2
3816," that product is bought it is not that fun to play with or only the positive things of the product are presented a children of that age could be to naive to consider that because it has not enough life experience
on top of that children should not start to watch television at that age children at that age just started to live and ",2
3817, they are getting there own advertisements they clearly watch to much television as already said earlier because they are ,11
3818," they need to gather experience in life and learn certain things
maybe they even get addicted to television and can do nothing else than watching tv ",17
3819," they are older


after thinking about ",24
3820, i come to the conclusion that children should not watch television at that age because the ,17
3821, against it had more impact on my opinion,21
3822,"television advertising  should be allowed 
to start with an important ",15
3823," why television advertising  should be allowed is
that alot of young children can learn by watching tv sure they have to watch a programm ",15
3824," their age
if they watch programms in diffrent languages they can learn some words and important sentences
an other case is that their parents have more time for themselfes ",8
3825," they are less stressed and they have not to pay money for an expensive babysitter
it is ",9
3826, important to confront childrens early with electronic devises like the tv because actually you should have the knowhow for these things how they work how to find the right programm how to change language and ,17
3827," on if every child is allowed to watch tv just partly of the day maeby an hour or an half the children could have more the same chances later at kindergarden and at school 
but there are ",17
3828," some things which are contra watching tv in these ages 
a child which is just  years old should ",17
3829, play with other childrens outside when children pass a lot of time by watching tv they have no time to play outside an other bad case is that there is a lot of unimportant bad things in tv and children could be anxious ,17
3830," should not forget to do something with their child because it is important for a child
in my opinion televison advertising  should be allowed but just partly",14
3831,"today everyone is used to television advertises but nobody really likes it but for the businesses they are absolutely important but should it be allowed to direct them toward young children 

young children are easy to manipulate when they see something on tv they want to have it because it is often shown way different than it is in real life the people behind television advertises know and learn what children want to see ",14
3832, they create something that is stunning and cool for them for sure they ,19
3833, know that the children are the only ones who can change the adults opinions ,7
3834," they buy the stuff for their kids

on the other ",9
3835, it is good because as i said the young children sometimes are the only ones who are able to get the parents to buy things when the consumers invest money on a product the workers form the shops the producers and all the other people who have something to do with the production do not loose their jobs advertise could possibly ,0
3836, help the children to imagine how they could use some toys and other stuff ,20
3837," it is usefull for their fantasy

i have to say i do not like adversise ",3
3838, but as a child i sometimes liked it because i saw toys there i did not know they exist but i really liked to have all in one ,20
3839, advertising is that bad and it is necessary in our generation,11
3840," discuss whether television advertising towards young children should be allowed or not

the ",13
3841, which supports the statement is that children have to learn to deal with wrong information which means they have to learn not to believe everything the see ,7
3842, in television children in the age of 4 to 5 are already able to talk and to participate in conversations ,6
3843, some of them depends on how fast they develop are already able to decide between truth and lie in this case advertising is a good challenge not to believe everything you see of course they need support by their parents who tell their children about the lies that may appear in advertising ,0
3844," it is important that the parents participate at watching television at least sometimes
on the other ",17
3845, you have to say that ,18
3846, some children in this age are able to decide between truth or lies many of them are not if the parents do not take enough care of their children or just do not have the time the little people are put in front of the television ,24
3847," they are concentrated on something which is not boring this situation is pretty dangerous because in the case of less time the parents are not able to controll what their children watch or with what kind of advertising they are confronted
regarding this ",17
3848, you can say that children in this age are easy to influence by advertising lokking interesting if there is ,24
3849, a new barbie which is presented as pretty mostly pink and maybe ,20
3850," has glitter in her hair many girl can not resist and want their parents to buy it
it is a pity that many parents are not able to prevent their children from lies or wrong statements many children are very naive and stubborn ",7
3851, in many cases they believe  everything they see but ,3
3852," it is unclear whether this really is a danger because 45 years old children are not able to go to the store and buy stuff they saw in television advertising because in most of the cases the children do not decide where they spend their money on but the parents do
to sum it all up i can say that i ",2
3853, partly with the statement television advertising may not help the young people to learn not to believe everything but it ,13
3854, does not make anything worse maybe it supports their naive way of thinking in a way but that is a ,19
3855, the children develop and get older personally i would ,24
3856, read a book to the children than letting them watch television but sometimes time just does not make it possible this is why ,1
3857, television advertising if it is not too often is not the best thing children deal with but the ,14
3858, buying the product on their own would not appear in the most cases ,23
3859, that letting children watch television advertising is not negative but more unnecessary because they can not buy ,13
3860,today watching television became for many young children a part of their daily routine the hours in spent in front of the screen increase as the quality of images gets better and the variability of different programms bigger therefore many enterprises saw their change in advertising on tv channels to increase their profit in this way ,10
3861, young children get in contact with this kind of publicity but should it really be prohibitted or is a reduction ,12
3862," enough

it is known sine long that young children can easily be influenced by their environment of which television ",17
3863, became a part by watching television young children get in contact with adverts which were produced for teenagers or adults the content and type of this sort of publicity maybe isnt appropriate for their situatioun or age and can have an influence on their behaviour children can ,0
3864," feel wrong cravings like faim or the wish to posses the same clothes as the people shown in the advert this is mainly because children identifiy themselves with the people or animals in a adverts whose product they liked

on the other ",0
3865," publicity on television cant be forbidden many businesses couldnt sell their products anymore and only a few television channels could survive because they dependent on the money they earn by showing adverts of businesses products between their products
if we want to save children from ",15
3866, called dangerous advertising it would ,11
3867, have to be necessary to remove all adverts on panels and big screens in public like those posters on public transport stations or in cities new laws concerining advertising would have been made which would lead ,15
3868," to many unsatiesfied businessmen and women who saw their freedom of market endangered

",23
3869, that advertising directed towar yound children should not be abolished because mostly because of the severe influence it would have on industry it would ,13
3870, mean an incredible amount of work creating new laws and even removing panels and posters on public places this would definitely lead to many unsatisfied citizens and a lot of unnecessary upheaval in my opinion children would be better protected from unapropriate content by creating new places for family activites ,12
3871,in this essaay the follwoing statmement should be discussed wether its accurate or mostly inaccurate the statement ,21
3872," talk about is television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
first of all we need to understand why televison advertising toward children coul be a problem in presentday society in my opinion parents who allow their children wathing tv a lot during the day take a big risk about them concerning the own opinion of their children they may get influenced really fast and even stop thinking on their own if they realised that they may get everything they want to know in a simple tvshow this is really dangerous because they probably do not even realise that they are influenced and they may thing that everything they see in a tvshow is totally true this could be a problem for parents if the children get influenced really bad and than want to have everything they see in television advertising or even thing that it is totally necerssary to have like this special toy they showed ",14
3873," the televison advertising in a tvshow 
at the other ",10
3874, it is necesarry to say that there are many tvshows that are mostly adapted for children to learn about simple things concerning their age or they already learned about in kindergarten if a child is watching tv once in a ,6
3875, it might not be that dangerous to ,4
3876, show some advertising for children because if the tvshow itself is adapted for children this age the advertising ,14
3877, should be the problem just does not disappear with tvshows adapted for little children firstly its possible that children may see thing in tv ,17
3878, the parents are not watching and ,1
3879, pretty likely to get obsessed with several tvshows or thing shown in telvesision advertising ,10
3880," it is adapted for them or even more because of that
so to end this essay about the statement above there is a last pretty strong ",21
3881, agains tv advertising toward young children ,14
3882, many parents struggle with the amount of money they have to pay for raising their child good example for this may be singleparent moms that have to pay everything alone raise their child alone and ,9
3883," have to go working to gain money these parents hardly can afford money to buy expensive toys the child sees in tv advertising but if the parents can not afford this money the children may compare theirselfs to others and become pretty unhappy
so ",2
3884, tv adverising for children is not a good ideã¡ because it does ,17
3885,"it is a difficult question whether television advertising s young children affects them in a positive way or not
on one ",14
3886," it is very profitable for big brands to direct it towards them as children are easily affected by bright colours and more likely to believe what they are shown
many children probably learn about most of the offered products simply by watching television
quite often ",2
3887, through those advertisements children learn completely wrong stereotypes ,0
3888," for their gender or their age group their body images or materialism
images transported through televisions like exaggerated nudity sexuality in a wrong way and todayâ´s beauty standards already affect them in bad ways that result in eating and personality disorders",7
3889,we all remember the times we were allowed to watch televison as a child all those funny and interesting shows and the advertisements in between were an easy distraction ,10
3890," school often we would run to our parents afterwards and tell them of the new toy we saw that we want to play with immediately but is it right to show advertisements  as they are extremely easily influenced
children aged  are ",16
3891, learning a lot about the world surrounding them they often dont have their own opinion ,7
3892, thats why they are a lot more influenced by advertisements they want to own everything they see on television as they believe everything that is said there but they are ,3
3893, learning and if they are never confronted with advertisements they wont learn to resist them in this age they cant just go and buy everything they want ,0
3894, control them and teach them that advertisements only tell the benefits of a product if a child learns that and is able to do its research ,2
3895, buying everything that sounds interesting it has learned a mutual lesson of course it can ,23
3896, make children unhappy if they always want something they cant have and if they are never just happy with what they already own but the chanals for children ,9
3897," have to get money from somewhere if they have enough income they can fund better shows that are better produced
in the end ",6
3898, that advertisements arent extremely good for children but they ,16
3899, dont hurt them which is why i dont understand why they should be forbidden and if parents dont like their children to be confronted with televison advertising they can just limit their childrens access to the television there should be enough other things that children can do that are more creative anyways,14
3900,"television advertisment is more focused on small children aged  some people discuss about how good this could be for our children
people always complained about how brutal television gets but advertisment should be attractive for the children this age so the advertisment is clearly structured to be harmless they are ",14
3901," cute for example mcdonalds advertise with a funny clown a lot of other happy children and small toys in their happy meal that is a special thing just for children 
their goal is achieved ",20
3902, the children gets attractiv to mcdonalds they want to go there the ,2
3903, step is that they run to their parents and ask them to go there some parents say yes in two seconds other do not think that mcdonalds is that attractive but they take their children there in the moment they begin to force and annoy them because they want a happy meal and a meeting with the clown this is ,9
3904," good for the parents because they do not have to spend time in the kitchen to cook a meal that the child probably does not like
so they go to mcdonalds but here wait more negativ ",9
3905," that positive 
you have to pay money for a small meal and ",23
3906," two hours the child is hungry again because the meal got more calories and chemicals than a healthy meal that stops the feeling of being hungry for more than 4 hours
parents should care more about their children and they should raise them right when childern know they can easily force their parents to take them to a place that is not good for them the parents did not do their job to raise the children well 
actually it is not fair to focuse advertisment on children aged  they are like just new born babys they do not know anything about the world and its dark secrets they just can not handle the situation the advertisment gave them
all in one children ",2
3907, should pay more attention on playing outside or with toys in their room with playmates or ,24
3908, their parents it is a bad sign ,7
3909, parrents leave their babys alone in front of the tv they ,1
3910," need to pay more attention on the surrounding of its child
",7
3911, with the statement that advertisment that is  should not be allowed  because children can not handle the situation and parents just leave them alone if you want to have children you should spend time to  show them the world on your own you do not need advertisment to show them that mcdonalds has got a clown when you take your child outside for a walk it gets fresh air it moves and it ,13
3912, can see that there is a clown in froint of this restaurant but ,18
3913, they do not connect it with having a meal in there in some ways the advertiser just want to get through the children to their parents because they are the only one who got the money and who is able to take the children to its place children are just a bridge to the other ,0
3914,the following task is to state whether ,21
3915, on the quote television adv ertising  should not be allowed first of all it is important to know which gengre of all the things shown on the tv are shown to the kids watching tv in some reason it is important to contrast ,17
3916, young people with television and its dangers they have to get the chance to grow up with all possibilities of getting a bigger knowledge than others once but you ,17
3917, that children with the age of 5 or even younger cannot desicide what is good and bad or even desicide anything so parents have to take care of them and only those can descide what their children are allowed to watch on tv or not allowed they already got the knowledge of advantadges and dangers ,12
3918, to their kids they have to handle the problem if their kids watch some really awkward stuff on tv and cannot sleep at night or kids who are influenced by tv in another way but they can ,17
3919, desicide what the kids are allowed to watch and it could be very helpfull for some of the kids if they learn something new helpfull and ,6
3920, informative on tv to get a great knowledge so ,10
3921, you can say that there are lots of dangers in case of watching tv like dangers are our all problem in the whole world but ,17
3922, parents have to take care of their children until they are 18 years old and live their own life so parents should ,9
3923, handle the kids consumption of watching television maybe parents should get some help by specific people who know more about the consumption dangers and its reasons to sum it up and state my own opinion i totally ,17
3924, with the given quote on the top which says that television advertising  should not be allowed,15
3925,television advertising is a very strong form of advertisement the main problem with advertisments directed to children is that it makes them want what is shown in the tv small children are very influencable ,14
3926, if they see a lot of tv advertisements made for children they will annoy their parents by telling them i want thisi want that they will become children who want to have everthing when they are children that ,2
3927, of personality isnt a big problem because their parents are setting borders for them but the children wont stay children forever they will get adults and have an own apartment thats ,9
3928, the tv advertisements really become a problem that ,10
3929, of pereonality that has grown through watching tv will get the overhand and they are going to buy a lot of stuff they dont really need that will cause them to live in poverty later in their life another bad ,17
3930, of television advertisements directed to children is that there are ,14
3931, children who watch tv other people will be annoyed by adverstisments for stupid child stuff and they are going to switch to another channel so advertisments for children are ,16
3932, for the channel that sends those advertisements the ,11
3933, is that it makes decisions even harder for children ,7
3934," they are young if their parents tell them they can spend a certain amount of money and the children want everything they wont be able to make a decision in short time the only good thing with advertisments for children is that it shows them possibilities and sometimes it makes them discover something they wouldnt know about if they didnt see the advertisement

my opinion is that television advertisments for children should be forbidden because it could have bad ",16
3935, for their lifes do we really want to destroy peoples lifes just for a little bit of profit it makes no sense everyone is telling we should protect children from war regions everyone is crying we should save the nature but how can we do this if we cant even protect our own children,12
3936,television advertising toward young children is a complicated subject and brings up different ,14
3937,"

to begin young children are easy to influence and are going to believe the publicity 
if a special product developed for kids and good for their growth  ",2
3938," special items to play with is shown on television they will see it and want to have it but there are many unnecessarily things on television advertising too
children are not old enough to select good from bad decisions ",20
3939," the television advertising are eg funnylooking they want to have things which are actually bad for them or they are going to believe they necessarily need itmes presented by the advertising

however forbitting television advertising is not the best ",10
3940, to this problem the best way to solve this and give security  is to reduce the time they watch tv or parents who look ,17
3941," their kids parents can decide which things their kids need and explain to them why buying something is not necessairy or some things not good for them too much advertising is confusing children they have to quit watching tv sometimes to discover new things in their lives without general good and bad influence from television advertising 
 ",14
3942,in the 21st century technics and television are ,10
3943, things in life of the humaity  in the modern world everything has to be on the highest standards consuming is ,21
3944, a big problem in the society they lost the viewpoint on important things in life another problem is manipulation and influence in television to produce series for every kind of age they use advertising but how do ,17
3945," i
of cause there are many tipes of how this advertisement is put into the televisionsopes 
for example an englishtalking girl in a fictional environment a sporty young man battles against the antagonist always funny an far away from zhe reality teletabbies or other freaks dominate the everydaylife in the tv but is this the right way to confrontate the children with ",14
3946," with the idea of trelevision advertising direct toward young children why should they make the tv the children more intellegend no do they learn something from these soaps no 
another ",14
3947," is that the children could be influenced geprã¤gt werden in the wrong way furthermore the tension could be too complicated to understand the producers have just the view of an adult and can not pu t themselves in a young boy or girl because of this they ã¼berspitzen the soaps 
and they produce soaps exactly for the two genders a pink world with fairies and a glamorous kingdom for the girls and a blue world with dragons and superheroes for the boys do we live in the 50s do we have only male and female and every gender has a special position in life but werere a world with gender diversity young children could be confused ",6
3948, they grow older and they explore that theyre homosexual but the television telled them theres only man and woman and nothing else sorry but this is defenetly thw wrong way to bring up the reality to the childrenstop these series havent got the exercise to teach the children what they expect in reality ,6
3949," they grow older
a good example is logo from the zdf they create a way to tell the young children 5 the news and political structures in the world 
less is more and the closer it is to the reality the better
i ",24
3950," with the way of otday the can change sonething in m
 ",18
3951,"many people have different oppinions on whether television advertising  who are aged  should or should not be allowed
nowadays there are many children who watch television even the really young ones who arent even old enough to understand everything that is happening 
that is why they probably dont really understand the television advertising which is why it isnt dangerous ",14
3952," its  them the young children can only understand everything through their vision
when parents see the advertising which often is about some kind of toy that every children wants to have they could take that as an idea for a birthday present or something like that which would be an ",0
3953," of the advertising
but there are often children who act in this kind of advertising who are ",16
3954, young as the children that are watching these advertisings which is a thing that in my oppinion should be talked about ,16
3955, children who arent old enough to decide whether they want to act or not could be used by their parents for money which would be considered as child work the problem is that if this had to be forbidden it should be forbidden for every kind of television ,13
3956, couldnt act in movies or television shows and ,19
3957, again the movies would become ,19
3958," boring 
all in all there is no reason ",18
3959, why television advertising should not be allowed apart from the ,15
3960, that the children who act in the advertisings are too young to make that decision themselve because often enough the young children dont even understand what is happening in there,13
3961," write my opinion to the statement
",21
3962, it is a very important topic for the parents of the children because ,8
3963, the children watch tv the advertising it is a part which they watch everytime ,14
3964, it is good for young children aged  because if they watch something they had never seen ,6
3965, what they like they want to have it but the parents must take care of their own childs because sometimes in the advertising are topics or products that the young children will not understand and sometimes ,0
3966, it is an advertising about ,11
3967, electric products like a cell phone or something else the children want it too but ,20
3968, the children from the age  are too young for a cell phone because they do not understand how much money it costs and the can not use it like adults or older people the advertising must be for the children ,0
3969, that they understand the idea behind it and ,3
3970, children watch the advertising in the tv they want to have all of these things and that can be a reason for a big discuss with the parents but sometimes it is something what the children can talk with their friends about an other negativ ,2
3971, they watch the advertisings they are in another world it is not even real but the believe that all what the people in the tv say about the products is right and in this time ,3
3972, the children watch the advertising on the tv they can probably go outside with their friends to play ,1
3973," soccer or something else what make fun

i can say that the statement is totally right because there are many ",18
3974, which are against the television advertising the advertising take fluence to the whole life because the children watch it everyday and everytime so the advertising must be not allowed for young children,13
3975,"no doubt about it advertising plays a major role in our modern way of life as we are confronted by advertisement every day it determinates our daily routine and consumption behaviour
nevertheless is television advertising good to be seen by young children
or should television advertising  aged  be forbidden

the following ",14
3976," and counterarguments are about to answer this question

the ",21
3977, reason for forbidding television spots directed to youn children is the danger of their ,13
3978," young children are not able to realize the differences between reality and advertisement and believe in everything that is said in those televison spots however advertisement is often exegerrated
thats the reason why advertising is too effectible for children at these ages compared to advertisement of mcdonaldâ´s which is directed to children in a very special way it results in a lot of money for the companies and a lot problems for the health of the children


on the other ",14
3979," advertising directed  offers some opportunities

it allows children to react and to cope with advertisement at a young age which makes them to confident consumers



in summing up it can be said that there are some opportunities and problems ",0
3980," advertisements directed 
after weighing the pros and cons it is more important to me to cover young children from advertisements


",16
3981,television advertising is a controversial topic ,15
3982, if it is targeting young children as usualthere is ,12
3983," one right opinion
parents must be aware of the risks if they let their children watch television they should be aware of the ",17
3984, of this useful game if they just want to get their children doing something advertising targeting young children might have some positiv ,0
3985, since young children are very susceptable for new information including advertising the believe everything said in an advertisement if we take a milk promotion as an exampleconsidering milk is healthy the advertisement is telling that every child needs milk ,0
3986, grow up and become strong probably most of the children disliking milk ,7
3987, the ad will start to drink milk ,11
3988," they believe they need it 
on the other ",3
3989,advertisement on television specified for young children is very dangerous children are probably the most likely to get manipulated ,14
3990," how to evaluate information they receive so if there is an ad for a chocolate bar saying that it is very tastygood for children and even can replace a whole meal young children are likely to believe in this furthermore advertising  teachs them materialistic values already in their young age 
in conclusion the negative ",0
3991, overweigh the positive ones even ,21
3992, parents have a certain responsibility for their children it is unreasonable to place specific advertising for children of that young age it is not necessary to make our children already adicted ,16
3993, they are 4 or 5 not to television and not to other promoted goods including lots of sugar etc therefore we need to be careful what we promot,16
3994,tody the most of the parents of young children have not much time for their small children so they turn on the tv and sit the child ,17
3995," it so if they watch tv there are some advertisments  aged  schould these advertisement are not be allowed

on the one ",15
3996," are young children easy to covince they dont ask if something is good or bad for them they just belive it if a anime figure said that so the tv advertisement could achife that the children are not able to build an own opinion if they belive everything in young years

on the other ",2
3997, parentes they do not want their cildren watching tv could give them to a day mother ore to the kindergarden generally parentes who let their cildren watcing tv in such young years should not have children becase ,17
3998," much that they havent time for a kid or the dont want to have time with a kid
secondly is there no right witch could forbide tv advertisment just for children in yound years

all in all ",14
3999," that tv advertrisment for  years old children should be allowed because if the kid watch in these young years tv the parentes do not do a good job it is up to them












































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































",13
4000,there are different types of television advertisements that we are day by day confronted with some of them contain a drink ,10
4001, fanta some of them contain toys,20
4002," lego some people think that this could have a bad influence  between two and five years old but is this true should television advertising directed to children not be allowed

most of the television advertisements are completely harmless for children in that age drinks toys holydays i ",14
4003, watched a lot of tv ,18
4004," i was about five and i saw those kinds of advertising too but it didnt take any impact on me i thought nothing about it for me those kind of advertising arent dangerous for children 

besindes that children often watch tv shows that are specially made for children in that age ",16
4005," toggo or kika if there is some kind of advertising the producers are told to make it some kind of harmless for them in my case i seldom watched tv with my parents of my older brother if i did my mother had always an eye on me what i was about to see but that didnt involve any advertising we never thought about it in a dangerous way

if an advertisement should animat a child to buy something it has to ask their parents ",14
4006, so they have the last word about it it doesnt pose any risk if a five year old wants a playmobilehouse but the father says no parents must be a able to deny something to their children ,9
4007," to forbid television advertising to children

so ",13
4008, it doesnt make any difference if a five year old child sees television advertising or not it mostly depends on the parents how they teach their children to deal with this kind of things if their doing well no five year old boy or girl can be harmed by a simple advertisement  ,14
4009,"we all know the doll racer or horse advertisements on television now exactly these adverts  are controversely discussed in society

one uncritisised ",11
4010, is that parents get problems on their weekly shopping tours ,9
4011," their child has seen the new pink barbie doll on television what follows is crying in the supermarket the conclusion sad children and angry and helpless parents or a happy child and poorer and frustrated parents a child of this age can not think about its wishes and their pros and cons they want it all and they want it now  no matter what it costs and this is the aim of it isnâ´t it those firms could address the childrens parents instead persuade them to buy these toys for their children but they donâ´t that would mean less profit in most cases
but isnâ´t it the parents own fault if they did not let their children watch tv these kids would not see any advertisement that raises their wishes of new toys and games but let us be realistic it is not possible to keep your children isolated from all tv influences until they go to school it is not in their parents control what they do ",2
4012," they are with friends or in the kindergarden

so to draw a conclusion i can say that the aim of tv advertisements  is to make more profit by raising the childrens wishes and force their parents to buy the advertised toy or game this is why ",0
4013, that it should be forbidden it is unfair trying to raise oneâ´s profit by using the relationship between parent and child than just try to convince the parents with the product itself,12
4014,"advertisement is all around us we see it on tv in the newspapers and around us in the city especially younger children fall for these advertisements easily so should advertising for young children be allowed 

firstly ",16
4015, young children are easily manipulated which is greatly taken ,7
4016," of by the industry children rarely think about something they see in an advertisement on tv and just see the new toy they must have
this problem ",2
4017, would appear at an older age if advertisemnt were banned ,11
4018, children are not used to them and would just fall for the advertisemt ,2
4019," which would just delay the problem and not solve it
secondly there is advertisement for goods that are not supposed to be seen by childreen but you can ",16
4020, find them on tv  which is not intended but it is hard to controll ,1
4021," a ban would help 
advertisements are for all people and ",15
4022," they should be allowed it is very hard to advertise in public if this is not allowed for children which would cost a lot of money
there are products for children that are useful and banning advertisements for them would just be unfair ",16
4023," the ban to totally fail doing what it is supposed ti do there are some products that are not useful and should be banned but this should not be done with a general ban

to conclude there are advertisements that should be banned but ",15
4024," it is very hardly achievable if at all and 
",18
4025,in this century television becomes more and more important esspecialy for the younger generations now ,17
4026," comment on the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

an ",15
4027, for this statement is that children in this age can be influenced very easiely by what they see or hear that means if these children watch television and see specific advertising for a new product they will be very interested in it on this way the television can have a big influence on the children but it is ,0
4028, important to say that this influence can be very positive for example if there is an advertising for things you use outside like an bike or something like this this child wants to play outside where it could meet other children in its age and make some new friends this is a very positive influence on the social life an other ,0
4029," against it is that children in this age are to young and have not enought experiences in their lifes to know what is good for them and whats not that means that the child does not know if it is positive for him or not

to draw a conclusion i can say that the influence of televison advetising is very big on children so ",4
4030, the television have a closer look on what the children see there and if it is good for them or not it is not possible to take away every influences from  ,17
4031,it has always been a controversial topic if advertisements in eg television should be directed at young children in the age of up to five years or if it even has to be forbidden up until today toy companies have the upper ,13
4032," and every child can see their ads in the break of the favourite cartoon

the problem most people have with adivertisements for the younger children ist that they are very easy to influence the ad can tell them anything an they will believe it they dont have the experiene a grown up person has also the parents can control what their child is watching in tv but hardly what they see during the advertising break
on the other ",16
4033, advertisements always have that very ,11
4034," that everyone can discover new products that fit in their life even the smaller folks secondly every company has the right to advertise their products to a certain level apart from probably being against the law it would heavily damage many toy companies another problem is where you draw the line every company could just claim that their advertisement only interests children above the age of five so if it would be possible to just not allow some companies to advertise their products why should we make a difference in ads that are  elderly people or how can anyone guarantee that a law state like that doesnt get missused by corrupt poeple

all in all a law like that would maybe make sense on ",13
4035," sight but in reality is just not going to be possible
and ",18
4036, it were there companies would always find a way to go around it,23
4037,in the following text i analyse the state ,21
4038, for and against the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed and ,15
4039," that my own opinion

many people are convinced that advertising might have a negative influence towards children 
if it refers to childrens advertising the only harm which will follow is that the parents might get annoyed by their childrens wishes to get new things to play with moreover earlier or later children are confronted with the consume of advertising in our society its necessary to remember childrens advertising only shows some playthings and that very short maybe children are influnced to want to have what is shown in tv but ",14
4040," at this age they should learn that they could not get everything they want if the parents want to prevent the contact between children and advertising children cannot even leave the house because we are surrounded by it 

in general ",16
4041, advertising for cildren is not very harmful firstly its their parents challange to prepare them for becoming an adult and ,16
4042, advertising is a part of our daily life childrens should be teached to get along with it in spite of preventing the contact between them and the advertising ,16
4043, it is better to teach them why it is shown in tv and that they cannot get everything they want so ,17
4044,the world with all its developement sometimes shows cruel faces manipulating human beings ,21
4045, make them buy things they dont need and make them want things they didnt think of ,9
4046, is a widley accepted way of advertisement shops have their ways of manipulating people and ,11
4047, do the companies but a big impact ,23
4048," has found television we now have to ask ourselfs how far we want it to go
this is what leads us to the question if television advertising s children aged  should be allowed or not
 first of all we have to define what that actually means in my understandig this are advertisements in the tv that are made in a way that small children understand what it is about they should probably lead a child to wanting something and making his parents buy it should this form of advertisement be accapted or not obviously children that age are affected a lot by the surrounding but tv advertisements nowadays are not all made for children there are a lot of half naked women and men trying to make you belive you get a sixpack by buying a parfume we have to ask ourselfs if an advertisment s children and ",14
4049," made for children really is that bad 
manipulating children is obviously sounding really harsh and like something we wouldnt want but how far would our children be affacted by it anyways a kid aged  should not be watching tv for too long but ",17
4050, play or be outside an advert it sees in the evening for a short timeperiod should ,1
4051," not really have an impact on its life
i do belive that there are already a lot of adverts s children in tv and ",0
4052,that is okey i would ,18
4053, have my child watch an adverd s him and made for kids eyes than an advert made for adults the problem of advertising ,16
4054, is a lot more than only manipulating but it is a way of showing wrong ideals to people and children so i belive that any advertisement can have a bad impact on a child and that one s it is not even making a big change ,0
4055, it is not showing wrong ideas of humans and their behaviour,21
4056, the statement that television advertising directetd toward children in the age  should not be allowed has a good ,13
4057," and is true but cant be used for all cases where young children see advertisment on the television
 
there are two different kinds of advertisment on television you could possibly direct towards young children 
the ",13
4058, kind is the advertisment for products as toys candys etc which are designed and produced for children in my opinion these are the advertisments which shouldnt be allowed to show or produce to or for children in the age  like advertisments for adult people this tvspots have the purpose of selling as much products as possible but unlike an adult person a young child cant judge the product advertised it cant calculate the true value and quality of the product how much it costs and the fairness of the price young children are easier to influence than adults ,16
4059, a toy that was advertised and dont uderstand why their parents would possibly dont buy it this kind of advertisment just  leads to ,20
4060," it should be banned from the television 

the ",15
4061, kind of advertisment are spots or trailers for new tvshows or movies coming to the cinema this kind of advertisment is ,11
4062, not as bad as the advertisement for toys and simular products it can be easily tested if a tvshow or a trailer is fitting for the age of the children watching the programm and it hasnt the purpose to sell a product children can ask their parents if theyre allowed to watch the show or the movie and a ,14
4063," is easier found sometimes advertisment like this is necessary for the channel to draw attention to new shows or movies in its programm

my conclusion is that advertisment trying to sell products should be banned for young children but short informative spots about the channels programm or agefitting movie trailers should be allowed to show ",16
4064,"young children could be more confused with advertising and any other things eg supermarkets with many sweets or shops for plays etc the whole world and the modern lifestyle in cities could be too much for young children 
",24
4065, if we dicuss only about television advertising it is not enough telvision ,10
4066, with advertising or not might be too much for the little brains of such young children and there are some channels in germany without advertising but what is with the following situation imagine a child of three years watch eg mikey mouse a few days later the mother goes shopping with the child the child see a shirt or sweets or anything else with mickey mouse and it wants to have it but in the shop isnt only mickey mouse there aresuch more superheros that might be interesting for children isnt that the same as advertising at television advertising is a difficult topic but ,14
4067, it is more than television advertising ,10
4068, it should be the responsible of the parents that their own children havent too much influences form the television ,17
4069, and the whole world and lifestyle ,21
4070, discuss whether television advertising  aged  should be allowed or not i would always say it depends on the advertisements normally they direct advertisements about toys and food towards young kids because they see it and most of the times they go to their parents and ask them to buy it kids with the age of  ,13
4071, play a lot with toys and other stuff on the one ,18
4072, it can be really annoying for the parents ,24
4073, their kids see many of advertisements about toys and always want to have stuff the kids do not forget about things like that that easily ,20
4074, they keep on asking their parents for it until they get it on the other ,3
4075, for the producers of the products to direct advertisements towards young kids because it is ,16
4076, easy to get their attention and to change their minds about buying something if they are advertising for toys they choose bright colors short and melodical slogans and kids who play with the toys to get their interest kids do not forget and do not give up that easily well if the advertisements are about fast food ,0
4077, mcdonalds they offer meals escpecially for the kids the happy meal includes a toy the most of the time wakes the kids interest they see the toy and ,20
4078, the kids want to go to mcdonalds to get that toy also kids reallys love small portions like a small can of milk or some slices of apples and ,20
4079, they offer those for the kids they advertise with slides at mcdonalds with the clown and balloons they make it look like ,20
4080, much fun to go and eat at a fast food restaurant they try to tell you that it is not unhealthy at all to go and eat there it may helps them a lot to tell kids of such a young age that fast food is not bad for you and that they keep on going to that restaurant for a long time ,8
4081, it would be okay to show some advertisements about toys and food ,16
4082, make profit but not all the time if you watch channels on tv for kids they only show advertisements about toys and food and i just think that is way to much for the kids if they start bying things at this young age how is it going to be ,0
4083, they are at an older age they are probably not going to be able to behave themselves about saving their money and not to spend it,9
4084,the statement about the television advertising  young chlidren is a very interesting and ,13
4085, often discussed subject some people say its great because their children know that the television is ,17
4086, interested in young humans children who produce much noise are often very silent whilst watching television ,17
4087, it could be perfect for parents ,8
4088, the kids are busy they can work at home but the advertising can make the kids addicted to watch television and ,14
4089, their only theme they are talking about is something they saw in television does it really matter if advertising is  an adult or a child yes ,16
4090, because children cant understand that the companies who produce the advertising is only interesting in their profit lets look at an example which shows the nagative ,16
4091, of advertising directed to young aged people a poor family with two children sits in front of the tv that shows advertising for kids afterwards ,14
4092," kids want the teddybear theve seen in the tv now the parents have to explain to them that they will not get such a teddybear and the kids are very sad and disturb the inventar of the appartment the parents have to repair all destroyed things and have no money left for their hobbies 

in the end every person can decide if the advertising shall be allowed or not ",0
4093, young aged humans should go outside and not watching television all the time i would forbit my children to watch tv and it doesnt matter if advertising is for them or for adult people in the nature they lern many more things than at home in front of the tv finally ,14
4094, with the statement becuase the parents are maybe forced to buy the children things they have seen in television ,2
4095, they have not enough money for it,19
4096, of all children that are younger than five years old should not be watching tv at all because for several reasons its not good for their personal development but back to the ,17
4097, it definitely shouldnt be allowed ,12
4098," its really annoying for parents if their children are wanting to get something in the supermarket really badly they know out of a tv ad and was directed to them these kinds of advertisements make little childeren already wanting everything they see in the television which is already bad enough with children at age ten 
but i ",2
4099," tend more to make this a parents responsibility that they should not allow their young children to watch tv at this age and its their fault if the child wont develop as much creativity and imagination or the ability to have fun playing outside 
i dont really get why businesses would spend money on tv advertisements pointed towards young children i mean i get it for children at the age of ten because its always an emotional decision at this time and every child wants to buy whats advertised in the tv and looks cool to them 

regarding the ",14
4100, im not totally against the advertising  because ,11
4101, they become older they will remember certain advertisements and there is a chance they will buy some products which is a huge market for businesses but im definitely not supporting advertisements  ,0
4102, it is affecting their childhood in a negative way and it ,7
4103, has negative impacts on their personal development,7
4104, that television advertising  should not be allowed today every child spent a lot of time in front of the television watching tv advertisments for small children came in the early morning the most children watch tv in the moring ,13
4105," they see a lot of advertisments

if a child see such an advertisment in the tv  it will have this product the advertisment showes to the child that it should have this product immediately and the parents will buy it because they will have a happy child this is not good for children because the will have more and more products and they learn that they get the product if they wanted it 

today small children do not know how to play with natural objects in the forest or how to play games outside because they have everyting furthermore they spent too many time in front of the tv watching these advertisments if children have everything they do not learn how to share things with others or how to spend time without this products this is negative for their future their life become more and more tecnical and they forget how beautiful the nature is for example they do nor know from where the milk is they think the milk comes from the migros and not from the cow

managers earn a lot of money with those advertisments for young children this is not fair beacause parents could not forbid watching tv

my conclusion is that small children become stupid if they watch such advertisments they could not make important experiences like playing in the forest or outside they learn that they should have this product otherweise they will get sad it is important that advertisments are not allowed for young children",2
4106," out my opinion towards television advertising addressed 
almost every household has an televison in the 21st century advertising is getting more popular because it is an easy way to influence the society the impact of advertising is a controversial topic in our community
television advertising s young children should not be allowed because children are not able to understand the impact of most of the products some of them could be harmful and children would get addicted to things which are not good for their development on the other ",14
4107, even young children have the same rights than parents they are all potential buyers in the future and well watching advertisment doesnt imply buying this product maybe this specific advertisment helps young children to find out what they are going to wish for their birthday first of all i have a general question are young children aged between 2 and 4 interested in watching television i donâ´t think ,14
4108, it is proofed that advertisement influences a buyerâ´s decision at an age of 3 children should not be confronted with advertisment because they should better go out and play with their freinds it is ,16
4109," companies try to benefit from children if advertisement s young children would be allowed young parents who alredy got a low budget had to explain their children that they are not able to buy this product this disappointment is not good for a young character
if this kind of advertisemnt should be allowed we would definately need a law and an nutral institution that controlls this law how sould it be possible for this institution to decide wheater this product is s children at an age of 5 it is just logical that companies would say that their product is made for people at an age of 6 but it can ",16
4110," be used by younger children
overall i thing that television advertisement s young chiildren shouldnâ´t be allowed becuase of the mentioned ",13
4111," that television advertising  should be allowed

of course i understand parents who say that this advertising just makes children want more things to play the newest things the most popular things the most expensive things and that is true kids can be convinced more easily than adults to buy something or to let it be bought by their parents
but ",13
4112, how many companies do we have that are specified on the production and selling of toys advertising is a huge part of their marketing and without this they would not be able to present and sell ,20
4113, many new toys companies like toysrus would lose very much of their profit over the years that would be bad for the economy because ,20
4114," less toys are sold less toys will be produced and less toys will be exported               there are advertisements for everything that is just part of how our society works if it is on television or in a newspaper or even on a bench in the park advertisements are everywhere 
in the end it is the choice of the parents wheather they buy their kids these toys or not it is their decision if they want to teach their kids wheather they can not have everything they want or not
if think television advertising should be allowed even toward young children and if parents have a problem with that they should not let their kids watch that much television children will always want the newest and funniest toys because they hear about them from other kids or see it on other kids they are young and do not understand that everything costs money and that money has to be earned never ",20
4115, less parents should teach their children that they can not get everything they want because in life it is not that way ,9
4116,little max three years old hanging around the television all the time he is really into it his mum is a really busy woman her time for little max is limited so ,1
4117," she has to do important things for work she turns on the television for little max maxs favourites are the teletubbies he cant get enough of this colourful dudes who are hanging around in a surrealistic house he just loves them teletubbies is a nice programme for young children like max however during breaks in the programme there is made lots of propaganda of diverse things

young children are really into playing with things they like ",1
4118, they see the newest playmobil in tv after seeing that propaganda they just want that awesome playmobil as a result they go to their parents and ask them to buy it and not just one time the young smart lovely children ask them until the parents say yes and ,20
4119," the issue is by the parents it is a quesion of raise the money or a continued asking and nerving period of the children it is up to the parents

although ",9
4120, television advertising  should be allowed children are hungry to learn try and descover new things the world should be open to them no excuses children have to learn and the only way they are able to learn is ,13
4121," they make mistakes and such mistakes can be made by watching television 

to conclude it is a question of how parents react to television advertising because parents decide for the children television advertising is nothing bad it could help the children to learn so little max is allowed to ",2
4122,"advertisements are becoming more and more present in our daily lifes in many parts of life we are confronted with adverts very often there is a particular
group to which the advert is directed to ",11
4123," on the television in our times there are even adverts on the tv for the youngest members of our society
there has already been quite a lot of discussion as to wheater this should be allowed or wheater it is ethically not supportable
in the following essays ",13
4124," discuss the pros and cons of this

the companies directing advertisement would argue that it isnt ",11
4125," much worse to know what kind of games there are from television than from the old fashioned catalogues it might even be bettter to let children see what there is on the television because there are less products at once in television adverts

additionally some might argue that that young children dont even really notice the adverts or maybe cant tell children adverts apart from adverts for adults
they might not even be able to realise that theres difference between adverts and normal tv shows

finally it is ",14
4126," the task of the parents to monitor what their children are allowed to watch and what they arent allowed to if they know about some chanals which have for their taste too many adverts directed to kids they can just not allow their children to watch those chanals

however even it children might not always even identify and advert as such children are very infulencable if they see lots of colours and some fun looking products which maybe other children play with they immediately want to play with those things ",14
4127," they start to continuously beg their parents to buy it for them and this can cause a lot of problems

furthermore it is morally not quite supportable to direct adverts towards the most infulencable members of our society the members that arent ",2
4128," able to distinguish good and sensible products from other ones that are made big on adverts the publishing companies disabuse the infulencabilty of the children for their own purposes

weighing out the pros and cons i find that ",2
4129, it is completely possible as parents to stop your children from seeing those adverts or only seeing some on selected channels the ethical catastrophe of this situation overweighs all of the other ,14

children aged beetween  cannot distinguise between important things so the advertisment shwo a lot of things and the children have the feeling they have to need that this could affect how they buy things in the future because they couldnt learn which products are important because ",13

first of all you have to admit that young children do not think as much as adults about any ",4

moreover with advertisment children are led to be future customers advertisment leads them through their lives
as a conclusion ",13
4156, with banning television advertisment for children ,13
4157,"
advertisements are found found everywhere in our daily life in the trains on the streets and even on television on television there is by far the most advertising this is disturbing as there are really long television breaks for advertisements only the problem with advertisements on tv is that it isnt possible to ignore them the question is should such advertisement of television which directs toward young children be allowed

to start off it is safe to say that it is difficult for kids to find out about new things television advertising is only a way of showing kids possibilities which they wouldnt have known of without television advertising is all about expanding the kids horizon
moreover kids are being entertained by advertisements they see cool things in the television that they want but they probably wont ever have them this makes the kids dream about what they could have and entertains them it is important that kids never stop dreaming and that kids are entertained enough

on the other ",14
4158," kids usually want the cool stuff theyve seen in the tv the problem is that kids havent got any money first thing they do is they run to their parents and ask them to buy the toy or whatever the advertisement was for this isnt the best for the kids education kids should learn how to deal with money and how to decide whether they really need something or not
furthermore kids will find everything cool they cant judge if it is something cool and something usable or just something that has to be sold most of the things that are advertised on the tv are unnecessary things which are really bad quality and not usable

it is clear that television advertising for children is something that causes ",2
4159," problems that educating the kids kids should be able to watch television without being disturbed by advertisements which are turning them crazy

",14
4160,"today i would like to discuss the statement which says that television advertising  who are aged  should not be allowed

firstly the children could be manipulated easily children like this age dont have any life experiences ",13
4161," they dont know if they need theses thing or not
also they dont have any idea about money they dont earn any money ",3
4162," they have to borrow it from their parents if the parents dont want to buy the products which are supported in the advertisement children could cry or damage something at home which cause familiary problems

my ",2
4163, for allowing advertisment toward young children is that it doesnt matter if they watch it the parents ,13
4164, have something like the last word children need to ask their parents to buy the products for them ,9
4165," the advertisment towards them is close to useless because the parents will think about that
secondly they often dont understand the advertisement if there is a advertisement about something like a little bear children of age two wouldnt understand any word

in the end i would say that it doesnt matter if young children advertisement is allowed or not because in age like two they wont understand them and in age five they need to ask their parents if i need to be for one ",16

the advertising for young children is very attractive for them because there they show the young children new barbies or anything else the hypothalamus ",7

the reason of advertising is that it should make the people buy these things in the supermarket for much money 

all in all ",14

4177," dicuss if customer directed advertising should be allowed for children aged between two and five

almost everybody knows nowadays how advertising works and how the companies are tryieng to sell there products
they try to influence the customers by using smells or by eye pleasing pictures
so the companies decidet to show there advertisements and commercials to people who are not understanding what they are looking at or who donâ´t know how the machinery of capitalism works children

children who love to watch there favourite tv show should get interrupted by advertisements which are are s them the companies would ",13
4178, use there favourite charakters that would try to sell a special toy to a child there are some different things that could happen if the child would watch that commercial firstly the child would hate the characters now because they are advertising stuff which the child does not want or it would get scared by the advertisement secondly the companies would achieve what they want and the parents of the child would buy this toy and ,0
4179, the child would want the toy but the parents could not afford it ,20
4180," child would get sad 

it does not need to be only a bad thing 
the commercials could ",14

it could diturb the child or bring hate into a family ",0

firstly ",17

4195, have enough time to learn etc ,18

after that they can ",19

4198, theyre very young in the other case they can imitate the things they watched ,24
4199," a fight or something like that 
then it is quiet possible that the children get addicted by the tv so if they are addicted they can be agressiv if someone doesnt let himher watch the tv
finally the tv is ",17
4200," not good for the eyes if they watch too much tv it is possible that the child gets glasses and this can have a result for the whole future life 

my opinion is that children should be allowed to watch tv but just in a right measure if they watch too much it should not be allowed so if they watch sometimes they can learn something but if they watch too much they dont have time to do something diffrent like moving around or learning and they shouldnt imitate bad things ",17

4209, they see the advertising this is exactly the thing taht the economic want to sell their products and earn profit with them  ,11
4210,"in my opinion the advertising toward young children from the age  should not be allowed
the children in this age dont understand any of this commercials  and are not able to examine them in a proper way
if the advertising is about a game or something to play with the kids will only want this things and will maybe start to cry age two because they dont know how to tell their parents what they want
for children in the age of five it is not that difficult they already can explain their thoughts to their parents and can tell them that they want to have a new toy
another reason is that children in the age of two are not able to analyse visual things because they are not smart enough
because i dont see any positive ",16

children will start to compare with their friends what they have and what they dont have ",24

4214, is that children dont know whent it is enough ,7

in the end i am ",9

i hope you understand my ",21

4219, children could learn on the television there are some shows ,6
4220," for children to learn about the nature animals and the humans body if they watch these shows they could learn something that could help them in school maybe

but ",6
4221," the children could get dependent  on watching television in the small age of   it would be horrorbly to be dependent to watch tv every time  they wouldnt go out play in the nature and meet friends on the streets for myself it was the best childhood to play in the garden in the sand or on the street with some friends out of my village i cant imagine to sit on the tv everytime
on other ",17
4222," isthat the picture that are shown on the tv are too fast for the eyes of the young children the brain cant work with the information it gets from all the pictures it could be the reason for many health problems in the older age
the parents that let their children watch tv every day every time will probably see it in the grades of the children ",17
4223," they are students they wont be as concentrated as other students and wont be as focused and they wont be as creative as the other students that told their friends stories about their dreams

so ",3
4224," the children should have a childhood in the nature with their friends and not in the living room in front of the tv because it is important for the future if they only watch tv they could miss some lessons for life that make them normal human

in my opinion it is good idea that television for children  shouldnâ´t be allowed because ",13

4227," they are just watching it on television most of the tv series now a days are not ideal for litte children from the age  because they can just see an situation but canâ´t experience it in tzhe real life for theirselves maybe it is possible to find an compromise between watching tv in this age and getting advertised by the real life with real feelings and real situation where thy can learn from others how to react right

so ",24
4228, that is an good idea to forbit tv for little children but not for all the time maybe it is possible to have some time at the day where they can watch tv an some other time where they have to do something else like playing outside,17
4229,nowadays our tv is plenty of advertising and ,10
4230, to little childrens in the age of  in the following essay ,8
4231," raise the question if tv advertising dirceted toward young children should be allowed

first of all children did not understand or remember what they are waching because their brain is not that structured i mean we do not remember us on a happening ",14
4232," we were two years the things are not safed by the brain 
although you can not remember the brain safes it but a little child do not understand that somethings are manipulation and not true for exemple if something was said by their mother they will not tell them that is false

it is our new society we have to accept that and it is better ",7
4233, you get use to it in a young age it is simmilar to money if you guard your child from all the money they can not handle it ,24
4234," you give them pocket money and learn them how to handle it they will get use to it 
but you do not learn them how to handle with money in the age of two years it is differently to early

adversiting or general wachting tv is good for the structure of the brain it is an enritchment because they get an inspiring for ideas well maybe this is true but if you let them play by theirselfes it would be a lot better for their brain 

to summarize childrens can not participate if it is true or not it is not a good idea to interduce the handle but it is silly in the age of two year
 ",17
4235,"should television advertising  aged  not be allowed

no in my opininion every type of advertising should be allowed because ",15
4236," germany is a free country and you can do what you want

everything said to this topic 
",19
4237,in the following it is my task to write an essay about directed televison advertising for children in my opinion it is not a problem to create advertising like this because there is ,14
4238, advertising for adults and young adults but it hink it is important what the advertising is about and ,11
4239,"television advertising  aaged  should nor be allowed
agree or ",15
4240,"
in the following text i will name ",21
4241, for and aganist this theme and will discuss and coclude which site of view i ,21
4242," for advertising televison to very young children is that this early contact with technology and media is good to handle these things in future young children will knew how to use them they can entertain themself by watching soaps tv shows or films it is very possible that they learn something learnful from the televison by watching documentations and the daily news they are informed about the problems and situations at the world sice a age where they learn how to speak correctly through advertising these kids to televison they can maybe learn a better language and social life than kids without watching tv at a age of two years

arguments for this theme yes it should be not allowed
when young children at a age of  are advertised to televison it is very bad for the proceeding of growth they had a less social life and ",14
4243, the language they learn from the tv is too bad for a sucessful kid in future the eyes ,6
4244, can hurt by thisthey get a poot eyesight and maybe ,4
4245, a poor hearnesshã¶rverstehen a kid who is advertised to tv have no real and natural cildhood there are media in the tv the young kid isnt understanding they get a bad and wrong education by wrong news and documentaions which are ,7
4246," to inform people false it is too possible that they get physically hurt by advertising to tv at this age

my opinion is that it should be not allowed ",14
4247, defintely whith this statement and think it is nor okay to educate a child like this at a age of  it is not necessary that a kid is watching soaps or something like this at this age they lear how to get friend or learn the language it shoul not ne ,17
4248," some better some worse in this case 
the people in favor of a ban of advertisement targeted towards younger children will claim that this is manipulation much like all advertisment but targeted towards a group that is more vulnerable this comes from the ",16
4249, that these children will usually not have made many experiences with advertisement ,0
4250, and see anything targeted towards them as something they want to own with how children of this age act this can be somehwat of a problem for parents as alternatives beyond saying yes or no will often not be available and telling a small child it can not have something it wants will often lead to issues one could ,24
4251, claim that targeted advertisment as a whole is something that is questionable at best as it essentially abuses peoples general interests ,11
4252, manipulate them into buying something while this is difficult to pursue ,3
4253," targeted advertisement can quite often lead to problematic situations 
at the same time supporters of these ads will claim that it is merely companies doing business doing their marketing a company that creates exclusively childrens products might rely on advertisements like these and the children in turn insisting on ",16
4254, owning the product mentioned a ban would mean that ,23
4255, the company would have to quickly find another way to do their marketing or suffer a significant loss in profits meanwhile others will claim that if parents do not want their children to see these advertisements they simply should not let their children watch live tv and instead rely on recordings or no tv at all for parents that  care what their children see this is a good option ,14
4256," leads to a more enjoyable experience for children most of whom are very impatient which is something the companies creating the ads will abuse aswell 
personally i do not care much about this subject as i neither watch any tv nor plan to have children any time soon if at all  however i am generally not in favour of banning things for minor reasons as in this case there are enough ways for parents to work around advertising on tv just banning it would hardly do any good and ",14
4257, with as a few outraged people should not have the power to dictate what an entire nation can and cannot do so ,21
4258, my reasons and my resolve on this matter are ,21
4259, weak i do not support an action like this,19
4260,"televsion advertising  should not be allowed

nowadays televison advertising gets more and more in our daily life and it makes a great majorty of the hole advertising but scientists are unsure about these sorts of advertising because it is communally knwon that childern can be easely affected and our daily childs watch more televsion ",14
4261, ever so there is the question if telvesion advertising should be allowed in my essay ,15
4262," discuss exactly this statement

for beginnig ",21
4263, it is important to remark that childern will be our future ,8
4264, they are crossing a street we should ,19
4265, try to protect them in the virtual world and this world will become more important in future ,19
4266, it is even now bad influences to our childern like inmoraly advertising could have bad affectsto their character and ,14
4267," to their and our future too  
in my opinion the advertising branche should be concentrated on the adultes because ",16
4268, an adult gets influcend be advertsising which is actually the case ,16
4269," a child who belives mostly everthing which is told to him has no chance of an childhood anymore 

to conculse ",7
4270, it is important to remark onemore that our childern are our future and ,8
4271,it depends what the advertising is about  advertising which are about games and stuff children like is often not good for the children and for their parents because they make the children wish these things and sometimes is this hard for the parents if they dont have the money to buy them these unnecessary things children are easy to manipulate ,16
4272, thats the reason why the toy industries make a big profit because of their advertisings sometimes advertisings toward children are good if they entertain the children and ,0
4273, force them to buy their product these kind of manipulative advertisings arent good because they can be the reason why children argue with their parents or that they cry a lot because they wont have the product the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is a bit too extreme written or thought because why should television advertisings which are made for children be forbidden for them its better ,13
4274," they watch these sort of advertising instead an advertising which is about toys for adults 
it think television advertisings toward children are ok if they are not that manipulative that the children are forced to buy the product and have to argue with their parents about it when a child sees an advertising on tv he should think oh what a funny and entertaining advertising ",14
4275,  omg i need to bring my parents to buy me this toy,20
4276, it should be allowed that children aged  watch advertising in tv but there are reasons for ,14
4277," of this statement
first it should be clear that these children watch series for children so the advertising in these programs is for children too
someone would say if children watch advertising for children they get stupid because there are some methodes of them who are making advertising which are not good for children they only think about the best way for selling there products and sometimes it isnt good for the children who want to watch their series only
but on the other ",14
4278," what makes them stupid like many people say i dont see any reason for this
i said that children only want to watch their series if they watch spongebob eg and ",6
4279," there is for three or four minutes a break they play with other things because mostly they arent interested in advertising and if there watch advertising what happens for them maybe they want some of these products which are shown to them 
all in all there are some reasons for ",10
4280, but if some parents are against advertising in tv channels for children they doesnt have to let watch their kids watching tv und buy dvds ,13
4281,"in todays essay we talk about the question whether television advertising should be allowed to be s young children or not

to start off this discussion i wanted to talk about the possible times where children could be in this situation they often watch television ",14
4282, their parents are somewhere around the house ,1
4283, it should actually be in the responsibilty of the parents to look ,12
4284, their kids and to controll what they are watching on tv but ,3
4285, much advertising in the television programms nowadays ,10
4286," that the parents are overwhelmed and cant really controll it themselves 

the amout of information we ",7
4287, know from our life in the age of  years old is really small it is normal that we forget most of the things which have happend in this time of our lives if it actually is like that it does not depend whether the advertising is s the children or not because they forget about it in the ,16
4288, few days studies have show that there are events from your childhood which ,8
4289," have an impact on your life these studies show that parents should truely think about the things they show their children because it could have an impact on their adult life

last but not least children have to learn how to handle this overwhelming lifesytle where the individual is litteraly floated with information and advertisments they are born in a world where this is quite normal ",2
4290, they have to learn it early enough on the other ,19
4291," very sensitive and vulnerable and because of that they cam be affected by it very easy

in conclusion i would totally ",4
4292, whit the statement written above because children are ,7
4293, really tiny human beings are ,19
4294, vulnerbale and can be harmed very easy in my opinion there should not be any advertisements dirceted toward young children because parents cant completely controll it,16
4295,my opinion for advertising directed to young people has two different ,16
4296," advertising is important to sell products to the people
they have to know what kind of new products eg food is on the market 
for young people it is often funny and interesting to see advertisement cause of jokes or different pictures 
often there is kind of a slang or song ",11
4297, they can remember on they can say it to the parents and they know what the child want to have or is interested in these are the positive ,8
4298," for television advertising  young people
in conclusion to this is ",10
4299, watching tv they get used of different words and ,6
4300," it can be a practise for learning their language a little bit better  
on the other ",8
4301, the advertisement in tv is  often too difficult for young people to understand  for example how the product is used for or how expensive it may be  this is a reason for why the children often get nervous ,2
4302, their film ends or there is a break for parents it is difficult or not possible always to explain the child the advertising all in all it is not the best way ,6
4303, children are watching tv in their freetime every time they have to learn and do things with other people and have to do other ways of laerning their language better  the best way is to play with friends outside in the garden and to built something  or to play with a ball or something like that  being outside and have fresh air is very important for young childrens health it is not very bad ,17
4304, the child want to whatch tv for one hour in the evening or maybe in the afternoonbut ,17
4305,"television advertising  should not be allowed

",15
4306, for this statement one for pro and one for contra one negative ,21
4307, is that the young children donâ´t know what advertising is and the kids donâ´t know the background of advertising,0
4308, it is unpossible to show advertising in kids tv the advertising in the tv wantthat you see an product and that you would buy itbecause the products were presented niceras they really are then we come to the ,14
4309, by television advertising toward young children the young kids want all that they see and all thats look cool and nicethey are ,2
4310, easy to influencethe children see an product in television and they would have it the kids donâ´t know about television advertising and donâ´t know who the products really are ,0
4311," that the young children donâ´t know what good or bad is
one positiv ",7
4312," of television advertising  is that the productwhat is presenting in the tv can be more buy because more people watch the advertising 
in the end i would saythat television advertising shouldâ´nt  the kids are too young to knowif the advertising is good or bad young children are easier to influenceand to influence to by an product the advertising can be allowed ",14
4313, the kids are older and know abou this,24
4314,television advertising  should not be allowedbecause it is to early for these young kids to watch television in age  the children cannot react on this television advertising and dont know about the story of this movies in this age they should need they time in other way ,14
4315, play with friends or take time with the family in age of two years you are to young to watch tv when you are older you should need the television for the news or other things but not young childrenyoung children want to see comedy movies an not interesting seriewhich you inform about ,1
4316, topics in the world comedy movies or zeichentrick series exsist because of the entertaining those young children should not have enternaining in this way they should read a bookwhich help the kids learning to read or preparing the kids in age of 5 for the school stuff when  the young children start watching tv they cant stop and want to see more and more they are in other word addicted to the television in my view it is to early for this kids to be addicted of something in this time of life the kids dont understand the critics of televgision ,17
4317, the partents of them should be very strict in topic tv also it gives other ways to be entertaint ,6
4318, play not technological games or listen some cds in this way the eyes of the young children wont be bad some parents have not enough time for them children and put them in front of tvs  when they sit in front of televisions the parents shouldnt care about them but ,24
4319, in ages of two years the childrens need die nã¤he of the parents they need alot of care and zuneigung early watching of tvs lead the children in the future ,17
4320,"for me is the statement  television advertising directed towrad young children aged  should not be allowed a very important theme 

",13
4321, that children between the ages  should go outside and learn something about whats going on arround them and not sitting infront of the television  and wachting something very stupid for an important reason is aswell that the children could get more stupid if they just sit infront of the television like my parents often say they couldnâ´t learn something from it that makes me very sad  an other very important maybe an old school ,8
4322, is that our parents or even our grandparents are growing up without watching television every day for me there is no need that small chilrden have to watch television why cant they play with theyr parents or even witch theyr olderyounger siblings they definitly got better influence on them than some characters in a tvshow all this should be more fun for them ,17
4323," sitting infront of the television
often i ask myself why could parents put their little child infront of the televisionwhy dont the play and enjoy the time with them the time is running ",17
4324, fast and they would see it much later ,19
4325, the time is over but in the other ,18
4326, the parents could let their children wacht tv sometimes not too often ,17
4327, they donâ´t really have time for them ,19
4328," during cooking or something like that 

so like you could see i could found definitly more espects to ",18
4329, the statement tells the truth evenif some people wouldnâ´t see it for me it makes more sence that little childrens are playing out seid or with their toys but not with those electronical toys which be could have,20
4330, with the statement  television advertising  should not be allowe because ,15
4331," young children shall go outside and shouldnt be attracted by television 
many people would say that young children could learn from different television shows but ",17
4332," that the children arent old enough to understand everything for example the tv show dory this show should help young children to learn english in a very young ages but most of the children wont understand this and just watch little graphic humans doing crazy things 
i ",6
4333, think that it is not good for the eyes ,4
4334," young children watch too much television because they look at an very big screen the whole time and the animation istnt good for their eyes
also young children dont understand that their is a difference between them and the animated humans children think that they are like them 
an example is the show  die teletubbies the teletubbies had tvs in their belly and young children watching this show thought that they ",17
4335," have tvs in their belly and cut into their belly looking for a tv and died

",1
4336, television advertising toward young children isnt a good thing because the children arent old enough to understand the things in the tv they just watch it and ,14
4337, this they should go outside and play with other children that is much better for them and for their health,24
4338,"we live in a digital age advertisement is done mostly over electronics so it is not surprising that most comercials arent directed to all people but on a group but is really every group equally sensible for comercial or shouldnt advertisements be s young children
infants are easyly influencend by their environnement they repeat everything they heard they act like their partent and their speach resembles the one that television characters use but this is most of the time a  good influence which makes the children learn new words as comercials ",16
4339, follow certain rules which involve the avoiding of profanity those product promotions might be perfect for young children to get to know more words and evolve their grammatical skills on the other ,16
4340," this might lead to an increase of television usage of the younger generation which is a bit counterproductive as the children wont go out and learn something about the environement
whats more is that this may be the perfect way of communication between parents and their children often enough infants dont know how to express themselfes if they are in need of something but with the comercials the could just reuse the phrases they heard there and the parents automatically would know what they want but with comercials only for them ",0
4341," early in their lifes this might lead to an decreas in the quality of later generations as they might believe everything they see in advertisements 
comercials will alway be directed at certain groups and the younger generation is born into an age where everything is digital and communication happens mostly over the internet sooner or later they get influenced by comercials but on the internet there is most of the time no one which controlls if the rules arent broken ",0
4342, television might be the perfect method to influence young children in a good way,17
4343,"the following text is about that television advertising should not be allowed  between age 
but is it importent
it should be allowed ",13
4344, much stessed out their children are all the time in front of the television ,17
4345," must not play with the children some games or do activities also the parents could do more work and are able to do more money
it should be ",12
4346, allowed because there are a lot of informational television shows that could help the child by learning new things ,17
4347, the alphabeth or the one and one in ,18
4348," of that school would be much easier
nevertheless there are some bad ",19
4349," for the children in the television
one reason for this is that the kids are more indoor and not in the nature they could getting fat and a couchpotato because they arent play any games outside like hide and seek or running also the children woundnt get ",17
4350, much social expiriance with other children which is very helpful for the future because this time is the ,8
4351," of life where should make friends i gives you impressions how you should react to other people and how you shouldnt this is very importent for every future of every person because you need it in work and to create a family

yes ",21
4352, with the question television advertising  aged   should not be allowed because like in the ,15
4353, its an very importent time of life for the children they should go outside make some friend and should have fun together because in their future they arent able to this anymore they just have not enouth time,24
4354,the statement television advertising  should not be allowed is in my oppinion very controversial in the following essay ,15
4355," discuss the topic and its controversy

people of all ages are influenced by advertising every single day in out lifes and its not just television in witch we are contacted with advertisement it has become a part of our lifes if we want it or not we just simply cannot escape its influece 
therefore i believe it is unnecessary or even impossible to protect our children anf younger people in generell from advertising and its effect on the individual
i believe it is in the ",13
4356," of the parents to reduce the advertisings influence on the young generations by not allowing them to watch certain types of channels or going on specific websites that promote advertising s children 
in our socirty it is in my oppinion not possible to compete with the advertising industry
but ",13
4357," we are capable to protect our children from advertisement in our private lifes 

as a conclusion ",13
4358, that it is necessary to raise awareness to the negative effects of advertisement ,11
4359, it is possible to stop advertisement directed to children in generell,16
4360,a controversal topic nowadays is television advertising some people think that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed in the following ,13
4361," comment on that topic 
firstly you can say that these advertisments towards young chilren offer the producer a bigger frame of costumers often advertisments are s adults or teens ",16
4362, that they buy certain products ,3
4363, if an advertisment does not catch an adults or teens attention a young child can influence their parents to be interested in that special product ,0
4364," that they look at it again
furthermore ",3
4365, young children are easy to influence and ,7
4366, they believe everything said in the advertisment they do not have as many life experience as their older siblings or parents and ,3
4367, people who seem trustful alot and ,3
4368," it is a good advertisment they can get influenced by it very much
young children at the age  should not be allowed to watch television or television advertesments in the age of  they should play outside with friends they should not sit inside and watch television alot perhaps in the evenings the children program but there are no advertisments in these special shows for young childrentelevision advertisement can influence their personalities in wanting everything young children who watch much television or television advertisments can get badly influenced by these because they often tell you that you should definitly buy the product and ",14
4369," their character can get influenced in wanting everything
to sum it all up ",3
4370, that these television advertisments towards young children should not be allowed in the reason that it could influience their life in a bad way and noone wants that for their child,13
4371,"who does not know it  little brothersistor or even cousin is sitting in front of the tv and watches the advertisement between his two favorite series the eyes getting bigger and bigger with every toy they see 
discussions with mom and dad about buying them this and this seems everyday business but is it okay to direct advertisemnt to these young kids in the following i will give a statement to this topic

first of all you can say that children aged between two and fived do not have that complex progress of will like we do as adults or young adults they see the advertisement like the toys that are pictured and with the ",0
4372," episode of spongebob it is no longer interesting for them additional to that the children are not the ones who can buy these products in the normal stores because in the most cases they will only go shopping with their parents
but actually advertisment that is driectly directed to the children can somehow influence them in their future consumer behaviour the advertisemnt and the way the parents treat their childrens wishes could optimise or make their former consumer behaviour even worse if a kid gets everything it wants it will possibly buy everything it wants as an adult too and gets selfish additional to that there is some kind of social pressure the parents of the children who are directly confronted with the wishes of their children probably can not afford the toys the comparism kids do about toys puts a thirtend social pressure on the parents and could ",2
4373, be an indicator of wealth in society the advertisement made for children is ,0
4374," kind of dangerous because children can be teached wrong moral rules or they can not estimate the symbolism or clishees the advertisement often uses

so all in one ",16
4375, there should be an optimzed advertisement for children or the quote of advertisement for children should be controlled by the government ,16
4376," that there is no more sociual pressure and no room for wrong interpretations
",21
4377,everyone knows comericals and in the television are comercials for ever age group but the question ,6
4378," disscuss today is if comercial pointed excactly for young children age 25 should be allowed or not
the ",4
4379, i hear something like this topic is why should this force any kind of problem itâ´s only commercial but if you start think a little more intense you rekognice some ,21
4380," witch tell you to not do this 
but ",18
4381, start out white the positive ,18
4382, of the lokal market children have parents who pay for them if the childens want to have someting they have seen in the comercisl they want to buy this this is good for the market i ,2
4383, think it would be not that much of a problem because ,19
4384," the most children do not totaly listen to comercial but to this what their friens have bought 
but ",2
4385," which indead lead to an other oppinion 
children are manipulativ which means if you produce a very good commercial every kid would like to have this because the have not a own oppinion they just learning what others tellâ´em and ",2
4386, the commercial tellsâ´em to buy this beautifull product they want to have this without thinking about it also you could force big economic crisis trough this a government like the usa could export ,23
4387, plastic figures using ttip witch the kids threw an ey on because of the commercial to europe and the kids need to have this than they buy it and get ill trough the bad plastic of the usa if the chew on the plastic they could maybe even die and all this because the commercials directly towards young aged children if there where no commercial only a few to non children woh would have seen this in the lokal store would have bought this and got ill than the government would stop the import and lots of less deaths would have been caused by this plastic figures from the usa ,2
4388, would forbit commercial directly toward smal thildren because they are to simple to catch with a good commercial ,11
4389,the topic of television advertising toward young children is a much discussed topic in the following ,14
4390," discuss this statement


to begin with tv advertisement should likely be allowed ",15
4391, be supervisioned by the parents if parents allow their little kids to watch tv they can ,17
4392," watch the commercials nevertheless parents should always control the amount of time their kids spend watching tv and set rules with them advertising toward children should not be forbidden but it is in the parentsâ´hands to keep and eye on their kids

furthermore allowing television advertising for little kids will lead to them growing up with a lot of media use it is a lot more improtant ",14
4393, that they grow up with friends and play games and ,24
4394, sit on the couch all day kids should ,1
4395," sports or clubs or even play with others 

on the one ",18
4396, if television advertisement is allowed children will probably ,16
4397, sit in front of the tv a lot but will ,1
4398," get in touch with other media soon this may help them to learn how to use those with early age since the use of media has taken a lot of influence on our society this might help them a little to understand the function of it

on the other ",17
4399, it is way too early to start watching tv and the tv advertisement already at the age of two such little childern should ,14
4400, start to speak and even start writing ,18
4401," watching tv and use other media it will not be helpful for their developement and will probably lead them to become addicted from tv very early in life and this should be prevented by not allowing television advertising 

in conclusion i am of the opinion that television advertising should not be allowed toward young children aged  because it has negative influence on their developement and it is much more important for them to learn speaking writing and even reading skills ",14
4402,"the debate of advertising  is a debate which people talk about now and which is important for the future and the new generation
making adverts for young children can be seen as a smart idea because in this young ages the children always try to convince their parents to buy them the things they see ",16
4403, in supermarkets if they see a toy in the advert and ,20
4404, in the supermarket they will ask their parents ,9
4405," that they buy it for them

4406, is that adverts might stay in the childrens mind and ,0
4407," they grow up and see products from the same name they might think of the past and connect the product with good emotions this is securing the future group for buying their products
but at the other ",23
4408, young children dont understand complicated advert they only see the product and ,2
4409," they dont understand the product right they might use it wrong and not what the people who made it want it to be used
another ",3
4410," is that young children dont buy themselves products and if the parents dont buy it for them the advert will only be in television and not sold good in the markets
to connect to my ",2
4411, i close this argumentation with my last ,18
4412," 
for many parents it is usual to let their children watch television but they are parents who question this adverts and products they might manipulate the children to make them to buy other products from them in the futureit is an education question to forbid televison for young children because only the parents decide what their children do in this age the question of advertising directed  is another but is indicated in the education

personally i ",14
4413, with the statement because i think of bad manipulation ,21
4414, i think of adverts internet and other things people shouldnt focus on advertising their products good to children instead they should think of educate young generations right to manage a friendly world again,16
4415," with the statement i mean its not the job of the enterprises not to try to reach kids its the job of the parents to say no honey not today
its normal that there are television advertising for condoms or sex toys and nobody asks is it okay to make television advertising just for adults ",13
4416, theres a tvspot about spitex nobody asks if its okay just to make television advertising just for elders  what ,15
4417, say is that kids are just another customer group and shouldnt be questioned well i understand that some people say its not okay that you try to reach customer groups who dont even earn money but to be honest thats just business like a lot of other stuff  i mean the ubs hangs up some posters with the writing on it that children should come and bring their sparbatze to the ubs and theyd become a toy  ,16
4418, this isnt okay to let kids bring you their money just ,9
4419," you the bank can invest it and hope it works out 
so from my ",18
4420, i wouldnt ban television advertising for kids from the tv i mean ,13
4421," if this concerns sells more stuff they pay more taxes and switzerland gets money if switzerland gets money we can keep this county clean pretty just like we know switzerland  isnt that worth these maybe 15 seconds of television advertising for playmobil
television advertising  kids is nothing else than just usual television advertising and ",2
4422,television advertising is shown on every canal at every time on tv there are different advertisings some are more specific to adults others to kids but most of the canals do not seperate their ads and ,10
4423, young children sometimes could watch ads that are not made for their age group but advertising ,16
4424, can be inspirering or useful in the following ,21
4425," discuss the pros and cons of advertising and if it should not be allowed to show advertising 
on the one handside advertising which is directed ",15
4426, toward kids in the age between two and five years could inspire if ,8
4427," kids are shown who are playing instruments doing sports or help inside the house the kids who are watching these scenes might thing that this is really cool because these kids are on tv and what happens on tv often seems great  so they might decide to do things like these too 
another ",6
4428," ads that are teaching things especially on american tv there are often programs for children which are showing how to build certain things if these programs are shown in television advertising kids get informed about it and are going to watch them and learn something
but ",0
4429, there are some things that seem good about television advertising  there is ,10
4430," ads often show new toys and want the kids to buy them so the children go to their parents and tell them about the things but if the parents do not buy the stuff the children can get very angry an ennoying if these things would not be shown on tv kids would not know about them and would not want to buy them
in addition advertisings are mostly very unrealistic and show things very differently and better than they are so kids get a wrong image of maybe even important things and if their parents do not care about what the children are watching or do not teach them how things really are these children might get problems in their future
in my opinion it can be very useful not to allowed television advertising  it can protect the kids to belive the lies that are telling on tv and to be content witch the things they have without always want to buy new toys",14
4431,advertising to children up to five years is a quite questionnable method if a producer launches a new toy for small children it wouldnt be intelligent to advertise to adults ,16
4432, they arent potential customers the advertisement has to be directed to the target persons and those are ,11
4433," small children 
the question that we have to ask is now is it correct to use the childrens inability to think by themselves what is necessary to have and what isnt the problem is that their age is to young to estimate if the quality of a toy is comparable according to the price children want to have everything that looks new and interesting and the toy producer knows that he can make profit ",20
4434, that small children are easy to influence by a television advertising but this thoughtprovoking method isnt just a bad way to gain more profit we shoulnt forget that children by themselves cant do a lot their parents have decide what is good and what is not necessary for their child advertising to children is in this view not ,13
4435, normal advertisement sure adults are less easy to influence but on the other is the children advertising not profitable if the parents dont buy the product the rate that an adult will buy a product for themselves is probably higher than that would buy a toy for their unconscious child,16
4436,"it is the time of media of all sorts and forms young children grow up with it and are influenced by it every day there is specific advertising for products that is made for young children a question is if television advertising  should not be allowed
 
the ",14
4437, against this is that is good for the companies selling these products they have young people who grow up with this advertising for these producs and who really want to have it and play with it when they grow up with it and make many memories with these toys they may buy it for their own children ,20
4438, is that many parents cannot say no to their offspring and often buy everything they want to have a ,9
4439," plus for the companies 
young children are influenced nearly everywhere they go many toddlers do own smartphones or tablets and are confronted with advertising so why should it be forbidden on television
a ",14
4440, is that it is part of our society and capitalism to earn as much money as possible ,23
4441," it is ok to use everybody

the ",21
4442," for this statement that young children in the ages  years should not be influenced already is that tehy do not understand completely what they see and what they should do with this information it is too much for their young brains 
a seciond ",7
4443, is that companies are using these children and their parents to make more money of course people are always used ,9
4444," it comes to advertising but this should not be done  because they do not have their own money and do not know how to use it in the few cases they alreay have money
in this society it is important that you have money because only ",11
4445," people start using the most naive and innocent part of the community and this is not ok

to conclude it should not be allowed to direct advertising toward young children
",16
4446,nowadays there are many people buying products they have seen in tv ,10
4447," this may show how the advertising influences the consumer

everytime we watch television there are advertisements between films they show new and revolutionary products everybody should buy to make oneâ´s life better but they are often from brands that are very expensive ",10
4448, the people who see the new things on television screen think that the product is new and different but there is not always a difference to the products they developed ,23
4449, difficult for brands to get the consumerâ´s interest without advertising because the people who go to a shopping center are often stressed or they only buy the products they had on their list but ,11
4450, they see new products in the advertisements they are interested and they want to experience the feeling of having this new product this leads to higher numbers of selling ,23
4451," the firms do spend much money on their advertising but they get more peopleâ´s interest
in addition it is much easier for parents to buy presents for christmas or the childâ´s birthday if the children have said ",0
4452, what they wish for the parents who do often have much work to do do not want to spend that much time in looking for presents to make their children happy ,9
4453," they are happy about the exact wishes 

on the opposite there are many children watching television who do ",3
4454, get to know the new articles the products are often specialised for channels which are for children because they like everything that is colourful or that seems interesting children and ,0
4455, parents want their children to have the newest toys ,20
4456," that they may invite their friends to show them off 
when the parents go shopping together with their children the parents become stressed because their children want to have ",9
4457," the new speaking doll or the moving horse their playmates have got or they have seen on tv  when the children ask their parents for these things they often buy these things because they want their child to become silent or they only want to be good parents 
these shopping problems can not be solved by stopping firms making advertisements on television because products can ",2
4458," be published on the internet that is nowadays much used by many children

in my opinion the parents have to decide what is good for their children the firms should be allowed to publish their products in television to get a high selling number the parents should be able to make their children clear what is good for them and what is not 
",2
4459,today mostly all famalies have a tv at their home some of the young parents grew up with a tv theirselves ,17
4460, it is normal for them so many children start watching tv in a young age i ,17
4461,"
in this case some people think if it could be bad for the kids to see all the advertises shown in tv normally advertises are no bad things cars clothes websites or everything else is shown there but that could be the problem with it everything sometimes there are advertises for movies maybe a horrro movie things children could be scared of maybe they can not sleep at the nights 
we all know how easy it is to trick a child they believe mostly everything the same with the advertises they see so it is easy to tell them wrong things the things are shown there better than they really are so the kids want to have everything they see there it is ",14
4462, amazing for them cause they believe it but right this ,3
4463," a reason to let them watch it from the view of the econemie the toy industrie lives from advretises the children see it in tv and want to have it 
so ",20
4464, there are some advertises that are not good for the chilldren but if they just watch the channels made for kids it is okay ,14
4465, that these channels show advertises for dating websites or horror movies are they and i watched tv too ,10
4466, i was young and i did not fail my life i hope,18
4467, give a statement to the debatte about telivision advertising for children but ,13
4468, let us watch at the positive and negative ,21
4469," you can say that everybody needs to have the same rights so why not for children when there is advertisement in the television just for adults many children will lose their connection to toys grown up they will not have any memories about toys or things they can connect with their childhood
childrens have ",13
4470," a right to be informed about the outcoming of a new product many childrens love a speficial firm which products a rare type of toy and there is no way for childrens to actualise their mindset 
on the other ",20
4471, childrens can be easier influenced and manipulated many firms build on the simplestricted mind of children they used to put only the good ,7
4472, about the products and hide the negative that ,23
4473," that many worker in china have to work for this product for low money
and why should they not everybody puts his positive qualifications in the front and his negative in the background this is a normal human behavior but the differance is that childrens are not able to notice these things and adutls are the adults are ",23
4474," a very important factor of firms in television advertising adults will be forced to buy toys they actually do not want to buy but do it anyway just to make the child happy 
in the end you can say that television advertising should be allowed all rights for everybody and if the parents have the feeling their childrens get manipulated by this advertisement they should inform their childrens about that",14
4475,many children often look television in young age in their freetime just for fun in the following ,6
4476," discuss wether this is good or not in this young age 
first ",8
4477, say that it doesnt make sense ,18
4478, you just let your child sit on the sofa and watch televison ,1
4479, their mother clean the house ,9
4480, television isnt good for the education and the most kids who watch often television in their freetime arent ,17
4481, its really bad for the education and ,4
4482, later the school life but ,8
4483, i understand that watching television is better for children ,17
4484," reading a book 
children often are boring in their freetime and mostly they are too lazy to read a book ",8
4485, they just sit themself on the sofa and watch television because its ,3
4486," much easier 
furthermore television doesnt help in school because the most children series doesnt make sense and they are just there ",17
4487, that the children arent boring and they have funny things to look in the television if the children would read a book or making something productive they prepare for school and already know how to write a good text in german lessons ,8
4488, moreover they know more words and how to combine them in their texts ,19
4489," that the text get a good structure and is good to read for the teacher 
i come to the end that it isnt good for children in young age to watch television 
my own opinion is the same as the conclusion children should better reead a book or if they are too young their parents should read out a book for them ",17
4490, watching television furthermore the connection between parents and their child ,17
4491, get better if they do something together like reading a book in addition their child is ,1
4492,first of all itâ´s important to place one thing on the top advertising changes us all daily and it has such a big influence on our behaviour it became ,11
4493," usual for us that we canâ´t imagine living without because we donâ´t realize the gravity like blind children who believe in everything 
but now we have to ask the question can we live a life beside all those advertisings and medias should we ",10
4494," protect children from this influence
on the one ",7
4495, we have to realize how much responsibility we have for the children of today because they are the strong ones of tomorrow adverts influence their ,16
4496, of view more than the ,21
4497, of view of adults because their knowledge about deciding between good and bad is much smaller children believe nearly everything they hear or see and that is the dangerous ,7
4498," 
another problem is that we never know what the advert a 4year old child sees makes to him and how it changes his future maybe in one hundred years the people behave like roboters because the future generation is on that consume trip ",2
4499," we have to live in reality and we have to see how far technologies developed in the last years and how our society changes with them day by day we canâ´t take our children to a different universe and we canâ´t make them close their eyes sooner or later they have to live with advertising in media and they have to learn how to handle them 
at all i have to say that i can understand the statement and i see the affect behind it but i donâ´t think that itâ´s possible to create such a law not today not in this world 
coming back to the question abovewe canâ´t protect our children because we all bahave like children in this society ",12
4500," with the statement
one of the reasons why ",21
4501, with it is that the television advertising could help the parents to find gift ideas otherwise they would ,0
4502, buy old things and would be aware of new games ,18
4503, why it shouldt be allowed to advertise directly toward little kids because they wont just go and buy the advertised product they would ,16
4504, have to ask their parents it is much better to advertise directly toward them than advertise for products they wont buy in the ,16
4505," ten years another thing is that the parents know that the kids would see just things for their age if the dont change the channel
 i ",17
4506, for the companies because the will advertise and about 85 of the viewers would be a potential buyer so a winwin situation ,10
4507,"

 but the comanies should stay fair and shouldt brainwash the kids otherwise it woulb be very hard for the parents because the children would want to buy one thing ",12
4508," another they shouldnt just think about how to make the most sales and lie the whole time the kids would be sad and that should not be the case

to sum up i dont see a problem with companies that advertise directly toward small children ",2
4509, they stay fair and dont try to sell them as much as possible ,23
4510,in times like these it is normal for us to watch tv and the advertisement which comes with it for most of the people the advertisement is not great but fine for young children it is another story today ,14
4511," argue if the television advertising  should be allowed or should not be allowed
on the one ",15
4512, television advertising  should not be allowed the children are influences by a lot of things around them already they dont need another source which tells them what to do or what to buy humans always compare each other it begins in the kindergarden kids compare each other who has the newest toy who brought the better food then ,14
4513, kindergarden school begins and again who has the best grades who is the prettiest than ,18
4514, school real life begins and most of the people have to work and start a family and it is obvious that everyone is comparing again when do my friends have their ,24
4515, child what amount of money does my brother get and on and on so ,9
4516," that you should influence children which are not even in kindergarden to compare themselfes with their friends 
on the other ",7
4517, television advertising  should be allowed because the businesses which want to sell their stuff are better on if they have young watchers the time where youre influenced the most in your life is the age ,15
4518," and the age during school so if the business is able to catch you one time they are probably going to have a futurecustomer another obvious thing is that kids like to buy new toys if they are allowed to watch television they are always up to date 
in the end ",0
4519, young children should be allowed to watch television advertising but only if it is the right amount most of the television advertisements are very long and they dont really hold a lot of useful information maybe the advertisement people could put some short  knowledge shows in the time of advertisemnt ,14
4520,nowadays pretty much everyone owns a television this ,10
4521," but is it a good idea to allow little children around the age of  free access to the television 

little infants are way more naive than teenagers or adults and ",17
4522, easier to manipulate so everything presented on television could influence them ,10
4523," not to believe in everything that is told on tv especially advertisement  youg children has a big influence on them and leave them wanting uneccessairy products mostly toys which are not a good quality and probably over prized eventhough the advertisment is not affecting the children mentally it could stress out the parents who are experiencing a midlife crisis anyways so it is understandable out of their perspective why those adds should get banned on tv 
however i do not see a good reason why it should not be allowed ",14
4524," it does not badly affect anyone whereas it would not be really beneficial for those companies which are responisble for these adds for children the product would be less popular and less people would consider buying it 

in conclusion to answer the question no ",4
4525, that television advertising  children should get banned however what should get banned are silly shows like teletubbys or spongebob which are making our children go braindead,13
4526,many young children watch a lot of television because of that they ,17
4527," watch and hear a lot of advertisements for toys food and other stuff children would want to have 
this topic is discussed controversially and ",2
4528," about forbidding television advertising directed 

the advertisements effect and manipulate children a lot they see a new toy in the advertisements presented as colourful and really nice they immediately want to have it and want their parents to buy it for them so they do not really think about it and just want to have the toy because they have seen it on tv often they actually do not really use it ",14
4529," they have it beacause it is not as nice as it has seemed forbidding these advertisements would stop this manipulation and make the children think about what they want a little longer

but is that really true would they think about it longer isnâ´t it normal that children in the age of  years make fast decisions and want to have a lot of toys etc
and would forbidding television advertisements directed to children of that age group really stop the manipulation there are many other ways to make children want something ",14
4530, in movies if the people in the movie all have a certain type of toy the children could ,20
4531, want to have it in that case it is ,18
4532," much manipulation as in an advertisement
another ",11
4533, against forbidding these advertisements is that later ,15
4534, these children are older they are manipulated in many ways ,7
4535," by advertisments shouldnâ´t they learn early how to deal with these manipulations and how to resist them

all in all ",11
4536, be allowed and that parents should decide themselves if they want their children to watch television and the advertisements,13
4537,"whenever you want to watch a movie in tv you will be unterrupted by advertisement if you really pay attention to those ads or if you use the break differently is up to you however if you have kids you will probably have your child coming at least once to you saying that it wants something it has seen in tv but is that ok should television advertising s young children aged  not be allowed

to begin with nearly every big company uses advertising in television as a good marketing option people are used to be interrupted during a movie or a tv series these ads show what is new on the market and a good one makes the viewer wanting this new product advertisement can appeal to out senses to our emotion or to our humour it kind of influences us 
kids are not able to see the difference between reality and fiction that is why children fear monsters under their bed they have seen in their dreams or in movies ",14
4538," 
as an adult we know what we need and what we do not need we are sensible we are more annoyed by television advertising than our kids 
children have no idea about what they really need furthermore they are highly manipulative they may think that they really need a certain product maybe because other friends have got it ",2
4539, you can say that they have parents who are reliable for them that they tell their kids that materialism is not ,9
4540, thing in life on the other ,18
4541," some parents do not care or are no ideal for them 
the products which are often advertised are not really useful and kids cannot relate they have not got the experience of an adult to make sure they really know what the people in the ads are talking about 

in my personal opinion ",2
4542, that tv ads are annoying ,10
4543, for kids the content of their advertisement is often not even useful because they are about toys or sweets which,16
4544,television advertisments bring in lots of money for their producers ,10
4545, for the tv programm that cuts them in but are they good for our society do we like them or are they just annoying do they actually cause us to buy a certain product or use public institutions in between all the ,23
4546, about this topic there is one specific quetion ,21
4547," talk about now and that is whether tv advertisments that are clearly directed to very young children should bee allowed

 at ",13
4548, sight there is no actually big harm towards the kids directly if they watch tv advertisments many children might not even be interested there is no harm to them to spend all their money on a productjust because they didnt think about it ,2
4549, the parets pay and they make the decisions ,23
4550," where is the problem


there are many problems about tv advertisments that are directed to little children many mothers let their kids watch tv for daily periods ",14
4551, that they can chill out for a ,1
4552, none of them thinks about the advertisments in between the tv shows that their kis might watch ,10
4553, when a tv commercial appears ,10
4554, about kinder chocolate that might not have any effect on the children yes it does have an effect as soon as the children have seen the advertisment maybe even without actually realising it they ask their mother for chocolate so that advertisment had a direct influence on the children that kind of influence isnt good for young children they dont realise that the advertisment was the reason why they wanted to have chocolate young children can be influenced very easily they see something in ,0
4555, a toy and they want to have it immediately no matter whether it is healthy or smart to buy that product in that moment this can be a huge problem for mothers they already need to convince their children day for day that they do not need for a toy or sugar cand ,20
4556," this  kind of influnece is not good for  the growth of their character and it might cause a wrong image of the world furthermore in advertisments only ideal kids play there are no ugly or fat ones this gives the children a very wrong image of the world and might cause depression or other disabilities  the only way out of  this disaster is to eighter forbid your children to watch tv or to forbid tv advertisments towards children

4557,"television adverts for the youngest generation

a four year old boy is watching tv in the afternoon this days the new set from lego kingdom will be released and the tv speaker announces the new castle with 15 knights 4 horses a wizard and a dragon the boy is amazed and he wants this set for every price is it legit the lego company shows adverts in tv or isnt it just horror for the poor parents with kids who want the newest toys

despite lots of poor parents it will be difficult to get a law which forbids those adverts most of the discussed spots will be about toys a toy is not dangerous it doesnt lead to being fat it is important for kids to play with etc all those ",14
4558," speak against the headline and isnt it better to show toys on tv than letting the children watch people smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol on tv before interrupting toy adverts they would better forbid the alcohol and tabac adverts
an other ",13
4559," is that the children aged  maybe wont understand what they hear and see in this case it isnt as important to stop showing toys on tv

on the other ",17
4560," it is not easy for the parents to bring the children doing something else than watching tv and press buttons on their phones no toys on tv might help them a bit additionaly the kids wouldnt insist on having this and those toys from the spot last night anymore

in the end it is important the parents educate their kids well ",17
4561," they will face less problems with their children dreaming on the newest lego castle first it is more important to forbid dangerous adverts for things like alcohol and tabac 

",13
4562,in my opinion there should not be television advertisments for young children because the parents have to deal with all the stress to find these things ot they will have to tell theire children why they will not buy these thingson the other ,14
4563,  if these things are good for the childs evolution like learning how to talk or how to write or read it would be a great idea but often these advertisments show onlky things you do not really needlike a talking puppet or something like this another argugemnt against is that many people does not like these advertisments because they have to wait untill they can watch theire movie or theire series also many people does not even watch these advertisment and they will zap to another channel an ,0
4564, for it is that it is easier to find things that youre child likesso you know what you could by for hisher birthday if you loook at it in the ,8
4565, of the guy who buys the time to show his advertisment you can see that he has to make these advertisments ,11
4566, the world knows that he is here and that he has some really cool things like fast cars or an airplane ,18
4567,because he would not get as much costumers as if he would have his advertisments and commercials only in magazines or in the radio ,10
4568, agains advertisments in television is that there will not be ,10
4569, much people who comes to his shop just because he has some advertisments in television he has to have a nice shop good prices and maybe a page on the internet ,11
4570, as i told you earlier i am straight against television advertisment,15

4573, that it is useful for a company to make television advertising toward young children on the other ,13
4574, nothing will happen if a child watches a television advertising it wont affect the child in a bad way because a company wont do an advertise that young children dont like so in the small clip there would be toys or other things a young child wants to have  the memory of a child is different too the brain of an adult can recognise things he saw somewhere like on television ,14
4575," a child wants to buy something only because he or she saw a television advertising 
these were only a few of the ",0
4576, for this topic in my opinion it should be allowed if a company wants to risk doing an television advertising  ,15
4577, they should do it im not sure wether there is a ,19
4578, for doing that or not because of the reason ive written about in the upper half of the essay if i were in the promotion departement of a company i wouldnt do a television advertising for young children but i dont see a reason why it shouldnt be allowed it doesnt affect the child in a bad way ,13
4579, there is no reason to not allow it ,12

in my opinion the advertising toward young children should not be forbidden at all but it should be important that the product is healthy udn good for the children and ",2
4585, there is an advertisement for the product shown in tv there should be less advertising for candy or softdrinks but more advertising for fruits and vegetables made for children ,16
4586, want to eat the sweet looking strawberries from tv than the unhelthy yoghurts with way to much sugar in it,18
4587,a lot of children are watching tv daily this has something to do with the programms and everything children are advertised in the tv if the children are watching tv ,17
4588, often they will get bad eyes and even they will not go outside this is really bad for the health of the children but if you can put the children in front of the tv at times you need to do something like preparing meals or journeys it is nice that children stay in front of the tv watching tv ,17
4589," young children need to do something else
if the children is shown something on tv they often want to get it ",17
4590, parents are nerved by children who just want to get the toyce or whatever by advertising the children the tv producents just need to work with nice colours pirates or unicorns and ,6
4591, they catch the children there are ,8
4592, parents who are not that rich that they can buy everything the children want to have but on the otherhand the children are shown thinks which they maybe want to get for birthday or christmas if they have no idea what they want to get they get inspiried ,9
4593," they can make wishes out of it
finally you can  say advertising toward children is not good because they just want to get exactly those things and the parents are under pressure ",2
4594, they sometimes or often can not buy the child what he or she likes to have it is horrible if building groups starts in the age of two in the kindergarden they can start building groups of cool and borring people easier just because it is easy to impress little children you should not do this everywhere and non stop advertising should be stop by the tv industry or it should be forbidden by the tv channels ,2
4595, they do not show the advertisising,11
4596,"in the last years the television has become an ubiquitous part of our home after a challenging day of work you like to go home sit on the couch and watch some tv some people prefer watching sitcoms or series and other people are more into blockbuster or action movies what nearly every tv programm has in common is that there are those annoying and long advertisements during a pause or between a change of the programm there are all kind of advertisements on tv nowadays from which companies benefit but what about advertising  should they be allowed or not

on one ",15
4597, the advertising is important for many entreprises who make their money from young children products nestle one of the biggest grocery producer in the world produces all sorts of groceries for young children on the other ,0
4598, there are more ways of advertising successfully one can advertise in news papers screens in public and ,11
4599, it should be allowed because there is no need to be against a television advertising ,15
4600,the statement television advertising  aged two or five should not be allowed says that television are directing advertisement towards children what ,13
4601," is not okay 
when a child who watches tv always sees those advertisements where children their age are playing with ",14
4602, dolls and that child whose watching this ad sees these smiling and happy children they naturally become jealous if this child is living in a household that has not enough money to buy expensive toys it might feels like as if it is not as cool as the other children who seems ,20
4603," lucky to have those toys 
in return the family feels sorry because they just can not afford certain things and ",20
4604," difficulties within the family 
children ",7
4605," see the world with other eyes and they get influenced really quick so if the advertisements are always presenting the newest and coolest toys they are not able to catogerise and analyse these ads the way we would 
i ",0
4606," think that little children should not be confronted by advertisements because there are too many information too many impressions to handle
furthermore some children might get the impression that evrything they ever see in the tv is perfect symbolises the perfect life and they live under the pressure to live the life that gives the impression to be perfect and what happens ",14
4607, we live under a pressure with ,21
4608," high standards that we have the feeling to have to achieve we fall into depression we get the feeling that we are not able to handle ourselfs anymore and we will never learn how it is to love ourselfs the way we are 
sure it might is leading to more profit for the firms but only because of the families who are able to afford all these expensive things for there children what is happening to the ones who are not capable of affording these things when they are older they are getting bullied because of that 
children are stupid sometimes it is already enough if one child does not wear expensive clothes and they are getting picked up on it
i say no to advertisements s young children and even us teenagers because those impressions we are getting through the ads are leading to jealousy and pressure to be like the ones in the ads to live a life that does not excist or at least not for everybody",2
4609, most of the children arent used to give statements about specific things they cant understand how advertising works they dont know that advertising tries to catch the attention of the audience and they will think that everything the advertising says have to be true they wont speculate about the truth of the advertising theyll just try to persuade their parents to buy the things the advertising presents these are ,0
4610," which support the opinion that television advertising for young children should be forbidden 
but ",13
4611, children should watch advertising because thats the best way to teach them that not everything television says is true if the parents explain that they wont buy a product from television advertising and why they wont buy it children will be able to understand that they cant own everything furthermore they have to make their own experiences about whether a product from advertising is as good as the advertising claims or not to learn about the methods of advertising in case their parents buy it thats why i am of the opinion that ,14
4612, children should be allowed to watch television advertising ,13
4613," there are only products for children the content of the advertising  
of course the advertising should only show toys or film trailer ",16
4614, things the children know and want to play with because other advertising elements arent on the childrens mind and there shouldnt be advertising about political ,0
4615, as an example things children wont be able to understand and criticise furthermore the advertising musnt show trailers of films children cant deal with like thriller because many children would get nightmares because of those the advertising for children should be ruled ,13
4616," of television advertising that is 

firstly television advertising is quiet okay because nowadays we live in a world full of advertising so why should young children not be able to expire television advertising toward them we do not live in the 19th century no more the young children have to build their own future and it would be helpfull if they get to know our world in their young ages
on the other ",14
4617, television advertising toward young children is very bad for the thoughts of children through the television advertising de children do not think by themselves they believe everything what tehy hear or see and with advertising they will not lern how they should have their own oppinion because they never had to think ,14
4618,"

in my eyes i would defenetely not allow television advertising toward young children they should lear how to think by themselves and get their own ideas ",13
4619, advertising toward them is the worst thing we could allow if we want them to be creative and successfull in life  ,16
4620, refer to the given statement that television advertisings that are  should not be allowed i totally ,15
4621, with this statement because at ,21
4622," children who are that young are not old enough to understand the sense of an advertisement 

in my eyes young children should ",16
4623, not watch much television and ,1
4624," it is important that there is not much advertising during the specific shows or series these advertising would influence them too much because they are too young to understand what an advertisement is for and how it is not always realistic 

especially all the advertisements for toys should be forbidden because a child will never be happy with its toys ",14
4625, there is always something more actual or better on the tv so the advertising ,10
4626," influences the childrens behaviour what should be avoided because these young persons should be allowed to grow up without the sounds and jingles of advertisings 

but there is ",14
4627, if children watch tv and there is an advertising with a ,14
4628, flying boy they could try to imitate his behaviour but they are too young to dicover the danger of jumping like a superhero from something high to prove that they can fly higher than the young boy in the advertising but  i admit that  something like this a dangerous situation can happen because of a normal television show ,6
4629," most of the tv  shows today are controlled by organisations like fsk that declare for what age this film is suitable for 

as a conclusion i can say that ",6
4630, the young kids need to be protected if they already watch televison one opportunity to save the youngest is already installed in the most of the new televisions in germany it is called kindersicherung and it doesnt open specific channels without a code ,17
4631, that the children cantt watch these shows or series the parent can choose which channels they include into the kindersicherung and they can change their list of forbidden channels at any time ,6
4632, their children are getting older old enough for some of the channels and their program but i ,1
4633, think that young children shouldnt watch that much television ,17
4634, there werent any advertisements in it,11
4635,television advertising has much to offer for many different generations but there are cases that are dangerous to direct adverstismnent  aged  but what is ,10
4636, dangerous and what are the ,4
4637, young children dont understand everything they see in television when they watch ,6
4638, an advertisment for dolls that can say what ever you want they believe it and want to get oneat this age children are ,20
4639," really naive but there are often lies in all these advertisments and young children get easily effected by all these things that arent true and are shown in television 

also its hard for parents to say to their own children that they cant have somehingchildren always cry and are really sad about it things that are shown in advertisments are often really expensive and for parents who are ",2
4640, poor its hard to stay strong ,18
4641, children want something and get really angry they cant convince their children easily with ,7
4642," and expect their children to understand their money problems they always want things they cant have without knowing the problems behind it
 
young children ",9
4643, dont watch televison very often at that age they should play with other kids and start to grow with learning by doing when they watch tv at this age they maybe get used to it and always watch televisionthis has a big effect on their future because its not healthy to not move or do other stuff ,17
4644," homework and just watch television that means that its often not allowed to watch television because their parents dont want their child to watch it so theres no chance that the adverstisment is popular to kids its a waste of money for all the advertisment companies

as a conclusion its not good to show avertisment at televsion toward young children because its for ",17
4645, a waste of money children are too young at that age to watch televsion or ,17
4646, to understand every word right,18
4647,"there are often discussions about the topic television and young children if they should watch television or not
",17
4648, that it depends on a few things when you let a two years old child watch tv the whole day it isnâ´t good for his or her development because the child is just inside and it doesnâ´t meet any other childs then the child just learns from the tv series but not from social contacts in my opinion as a parent you should set clear rules ,17
4649, how long and what your child is allowed to watch tv because if not the child maybe watches some tv shows that arenâ´t good for his or her age also it is important to control a bit how long it watches tv and that it sometimes goes outside to learn ,17
4650, things from the nature and the people around the child on the other ,8
4651, it isnâ´t good to control your child or doesnâ´t let it watch tv at all because ,17
4652, it just learns from the family or friends which isnâ´t bad but it should ,8
4653," learn things from television 
essaying ",6
4654, that you should let them watch tv but with some rules,1
4655,most of the time television channels have to decide which kind of products they would like to advertise certain factors are looked upon to choose which advertisement fits best to the content of the channel problems seem to occure ,10
4656, because people are not sure wether television advertisement for children should be allowed or not obviously children should not have access to advertisement for cigarettes alcohol or any other kind of drug which could potentially be damaging but if a child is able to watch channels that present such products it probably shouldnt be allowed to watch those channels ,13
4657, depending on the age group television channels show advertisement that fits best and ,0
4658, advertisement where the companies can be sure that the viewers will buy their products so ,11
4659, a child watches a channel meant for kids it will probably see advertisement for dolls or cars or other new games that are available on the market which isnt a problem at all on the other ,14
4660, some people think it even is controversial that young children have the chance to watch tv out of fear parents dont allow their child to watch tv thinking that their child could easily switch the channel and see something they arent meant to see for exemple advertisement for the latest horror movie in conclusion advertisement can be damaging for a child but with the newest security systems on tv it should be possible to let a child enjoy childrens channels and seeing avertisement that is s their eyes,14
4661," state my opinion on the question wheter or not television advertising toward young children should be allowed

of course its fun for small children to watch their favorite shows on tv but on this way they ",13
4662, get in touch with digital advertising very easily while on special channels for children its most likely some kind of fun games on channels for older people almost everything could be advertised in general advertising is quite manipulative making the people want to buy the stuff they try to sell  and small children can be manipulated very easily when children see a new game they probably beg their parents to buy it for them because they are obviously way too young to purchase something on their own then its the parents choice wheter or not their child is allowed to get a new thing to play with also ,0
4663," children never get to see advertising its way harder for them to deal with it later in life 
but advertising may ",16
4664," trick the children into thinking everything they see on tv is real especially for very young people its hard to make a difference between reality and a fictional world

in general i dont see something wrong with television advertising for young children its interesting to see the new games they may probably get for ",0
4665, christmas and most of the time they enjoy seeing advertising that is directed to them of course the children shouldnt spend too much time in front of a tv but thats the thing parents should be keeping an eye on normally also they should be aware of the ,0
4666, that they need to show children how to deal with digital advertising the correct and best way ,13
4667, just forbid them to watch tv for all their childhood because this ,17
4668, its on a healthy dose may even help them to understand life and growing up in the world theyre living in ,4
4669, advertising is an important part of todays society,11
4670,"advertising is a very contradictory subject and there exist many diffrent opinions about it should television advertising s young children be allowed or not

the factories who sell the goods which are in an advertising make a lot of money with it because children want to have the things which they see in adverts and often they evan manage to persuade their parents to buy them it brings ",14
4671," much profit to the factories

secondly the state would influence the privat live of people which would contradict the freedom of everyone to do what they want

on the other ",23
4672, children are very manipulative and advertisments which they watch have a big influence on them they do not realize that advertising often doesn not show the reality but a better picture of a product childern believe everything what they hear and they are not able to distinguish between reality and lies if they see ,2
4673," an advertising which they like they want to have the product without thinking of its downsides 

the whole lot of advertisments for children makes it very difficult for their parents too because their children always want to have the products which they see in the advertisingthe parents ",2
4674," always have to expain them why they do not buy them these things

another reason not to allow advertisments for childrenis that this confronts them very early with materialism we live in a very material society nowadays but the children should not learn this materialist attitude too early

despite the ",2
4675," that advertisments are good for the economy and a prohibition of advertising would contradict the freedom of everyone to do what they want it would be much better for the children not to be confronted with advertising because it has a bad influence on them

",13
4676,"a normal saturday evening a family is watching a film on tv the film is often interrupted by advertising there is advertising for almost all you can buy the children are interested in short advertising films about toys they would love to get the pink barbie or the toy cars to christmas
should television advertising  be forbidden

first of all young children are influenced by advertising more than older ones they can not realize that the promises made in tv does not become true so if the barbies speak or the cars drive of her own maybe there are disappointed in the presents they wanted to get but now they are boring
i guess there is no advertising directed to children that influences their live in an bad way
so why should it be forbidden ",14
4677," young children watche tv chanels like kika and i did not remember they show advertising 
of course parents have to control what their children are watching but ",14
4678, the advertising that is  is not a risk for them ,11
4679,"telivision advertising is an very important topic in our every day lifes nearly everybody who watches something in the television knows about all the advertisings
today ",10
4680," give you my opinion to the television advertising directed  

an ",11
4681," for advertising in the young age is that the children get prepared for their lifes in an highger age when they grow up with the advertising their parents will propably explain to them how they have to work with it and they should not let influence theirselves from the advertising 

but ",0
4682," in an higher age how they can devoid the influence of the advertisings from the television they will propably not change anything on their attitude to watch television and to watch advertisings 
another ",14
4683, is that children in this young age can not understand the advertising completely and they want to have all of it if their parents would allow this here is an example if there is a toy ,2
4684, a dog in an advertising and a little girl 4 years old is watching it in the television ,10
4685," she would ask her parents directly if they can buy them for her her parents would propably say no and the little girl would be very sad this example should show that the children let influence theirselves too much from the advertisings because they do not understand what the producers want to reach and their parents can not devoid this 

as you propably can see in my ",2
4686, that children in this young age should not be confrontated with this advertisings,16
4687,"should television advertising  be allowed or not
first of all ",15
4688, that it is important to mention that the children are very young and could get influenced by the television advertising for example ,13
4689," they see a commercial of barbies they want a barbie or want to look like it moreover they get to know a very wrong role of a woman like looking good and being thin cook all day long and think thats all they can do

on the other ",3
4690, not many young children in age 2 to 5 watch tv regulary ,17
4691, it minimizes the chance to get influences by wrong roles many parents just want their children to read and hear music and not watch the tv so they dont get influenced in addition the young children do not think ,8
4692, much about the things in the advertsing ,11
4693, they do not know whats behind it and just want one thing it is more dangerous later ,3
4694," they are teenager and think about the roles and being thin

",24
4695, that the parents should not allow their children to watch the tv ,13
4696, young my opinion is that the advertising is ,16
4697, no problem later it is a problem in puberty ,4
4698, the children think about it but it can ,7
4699, start very early it is a very controversial theme but it is the best ,18
4700, to not allow the children to watch the tv ,1
4701, they do not get in touch with advertising,11
4702,"everyone knows and see it the happy world of products and advertising in television most of us arent really interested in watching it but if something is very colourful and loudthe most childeren want to see it so there offers the question if these kind of advertising which is  childeren shouldnt be allowed

the most interesting advertisings for childeren in age of  are toys musik or nearly everything thats loudnow imagine parents with their child are going through the supermarket and there is the new super cool waterpistole of cause the child want the toy but the parents say no the young child starts to scream cry and rolling over the ground these situation is anoying and embarissing ",14
4703," for every other person around the positive sites are only seen by the company of the product many parents want to stop the terror of their childeren and just buy what they wantand the company sees much money 

",2
4704, it is not possible to stop the adverrtising directed to childeren in age of  because its a big deal for the companies and they wont stop it but i would ,16
4705, that it should not be allowed to make these kind of advertising ,11
4706,"                    advertising

there are many reasons for why television ads specifically targeted  should not be allowed but in my oppinion one of the strongest is that children aged  often cant differentiate between a good tip from their friends or peers  maybe for a toy  or just plain advertisements that means that those kids would often bug their parents about a special toy just because they saw it on tv once their brains are simply not able to evaluate what they see as much as that of an adult can

but ",14
4707, most tv channels do need those advertisements ,10
4708," cover the costs of producing and sending the childrenfriendly content that theyre offering and to keep it all running if their would be no ads the channel would need a different way to make profit which in most of the cases results in premiumchannels

so the big question  that you have to decide for yourself  basically is whether you want to be able to recieve and watch tv for free or you want your children to grow up to childrenfriendly content with no ads which means you have to pay a premium

in my oppinion there is no perfect ",14
4709, because some familys dont have the leftover money needed to subscribe to a premiumchannel and ,10
4710," that is the case tv ads targeted to children have to be allowed or the children of those familys wont be able to enjoy content made for their age at all


the problem is not that i dont have the vocabulary or grammar necessary ",13
4711, write more but simply that i hate essays,18
4712,"advertising toward young children

i would ",16
4713," the following statement that television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed because a child at this age can be easy manipulated by the advertising

the manipulation of our society is a big problem and shouldnâ´t be supported by anyone also children decide about their own life without beeing influenced by any organisation or an advertising in the television 

the only positive ",13
4714," for this statement is that the company who does make the advertising towards the children can easily win new people which will buy their products so the company is the only one who has a use for this advertising toward young children

young children are not in the position to buy products of a company ",16
4715, they have to annoy their parents till they buy the products the parents are the one which will try to make the manipulation undone but it will end mostly like the parents will buy the product for the child  ,2
4716," it is quiet itâ´s really unfair for the parents and they only prevent their children from the manipulation if they wouldnâ´t allow their children to watch television or the advertising towards young children shouldnâ´t be allowed

so there are only positive ",12
4717, for the company about the advertising towards young children and only negative for all the other people ,16
4718, this kind of advertising shouldnâ´t be allowed ,11
4719," take position about the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed 
in our world we live today is advertising a thing of our all day life we find ads not just in the tv there are many other ways ",15
4720," ad walls 
you could now say why should the advertisment not reach everybody children included well there might be some ",16
4721, that could support this statement one might be the growing rivaliation between companys and labels they obviously have to communicate with the customer to stay alive but ,23
4722, there are children aged at  which should play outside and gather lifeexpierence children that are sitting all day long in front of their televisions are often having social problems in their ,17
4723, life ads for those support the tv consume ,10
4724, because children are way more open for those ads you could now argue well there are parents they have to controll the consume yes that is true but there are familys with problems where the parents dont have enough time especially for them shouldnt kids get that effected the labels have ,16
4725," the oppurtunity to create ads for the parents that would let the children uneffected and they could have a lovely time as a child
my opinion is obvious dont create ads for children in that young age try to focus on adverstisments for groups that are able to handle the influence    ",0
4726," argue on the thesis that television advertising  should not be allowed
advertisements are basically everywhere to be seen in our daily life since younger people ",15
4727, use mobile devices or use the internet to watch ,1
4728, youtube where ads are playedtoo i would ,11
4729," television advertising say that online adnvertising shouldnt be allowed too 
advertising ",15
4730, is used to manipulate and influence the thoughts of the audience and bend it to the companys will and ,23
4731, watching the add over and over again the effects on the audience are unforeseenable but ,19
4732," all adults are already able to defend themselfs against strong advertisements most grownups know what they need can properly decide what is good or bad for them 
but we are talking about young children from the age 2 to 5 their brains are not as developed as the brains of adults during the age of 2 to 5 the human being is ",16
4733," learning everything he aquires through his senses they are most of the time leaded by emotional and not rational thinking advertisement is easily accepted by the young children they would be overwhelmed by the manipulative pictures and slogans an example on the disney channel is the ad of a lego game shown the young children see these colorful images and are easily convinced that they want to this game the parents relentlessly give them what they want and lego profits from the advertisement instantly
 children at that age cannot decide what they want or dont want 
in conclusion i can certainly say that television and internet advertising  aged  should not be allowed ",14
4734,advertisements are invented to get more and more people to buy a specific product young children ,0
4735, aged  are very easy to convince to buy something and mostly the parents ,9
4736," buy it for them but should it really be banned 

a lot of people think that the advertisements wich are made just for kids are mostly the ones for toys but that is wrong often they tease stuff like sweets just for kids and if they see them in the supermarket they must have it and the parents often allow it because ",16
4737," the kids would scream through the whole supermarket 

in my opinion the bigger problem is not the advertising it is the parents because the parents should theach the kids from ",16
4738," they are young that they can not have everything they want and often the products from the advertisements are not as good as they are told to be tha is something the parents should teach the kids too 

you could protect the kids with not allowing advertisements s young children but ",2
4739, they need to learn it ,3
4740, they are older and once you have learned it correctly you know it ,3
4741,"in my opinion the statement television advertising  young child aged  should not be allowed isnt nessescary
",13
4742," it depends on the parents of the young children because if their are parents who think its okay if their children watch television who cares
it is their child and ",17
4743," the parents know what is the best for their child
so ",9
4744, there are a lot of parents who can say what is the best for their children and if their could watch television but ,17
4745, many parents which can not do this job and there maybe decided that there children could watch a film or a serie on television and ,17
4746," it is too bad for them and there couldnt handel it
",19
4747, you can see the televisionno for young children aged  in the ,6
4748, depends on the question what because if the young children watch a film about animals or a film like frozen i didnt see any bad ,6
4749," on it but if the children watch a horrorfilm or something like that it isnt good
there is just one other ",6
4750, we must checked if the statement should worked and that is who checked this i mean ,21
4751," there is a statement like that who says that the parents do that and their children are not allowed to watch television or something like that
",17
4752, it is very difficult to handel a statement like that and it is ,21
4753," with the statement television advertising  should not be allowed 
clearly you can say that their is no big difference between children seeing the new toys on the television or getting to know about it by their friends in the kindergarden but ",13
4754, the television with its television star has a much bigger effect on the children than their playmates another ,17
4755, for advertising  is that it is easier for the parents to find good and fitting presents for their child because automatically gets a lot wishes through the advertising but this could ,0
4756, lead to a problem if the child has ,4
4757," ten wishes and the parents buy only three presents the cild maybe gets unhappy and cant even be happy about those
in my opinion it is wrong to show young children aged  advertising because they are not able to understand the meaning of the products this leads to the situation that they cant decide which product is really important for their life and which stuff the truly need
in addition most of them dont have own money ",0
4758," they are not able to deal with it and to have a feeling for the worth of the product 
furthermore ",3
4759, children have a pretty big phantasy ,8
4760, it is possible to imagine things adults couldnt even think about concluding they are able to use ,24
4761, old toys or stuff from nature for their playing and it is not neccessary for them to have the newest and best toys ever and ever again this is often good for the character of the child because it becomes more creative ,20
4762," for the job life
all in all ",18
4763, that advertising  is a good invention for the concerns but not for the moneybag of the parents and the eduacation of the children ,13
4764, it would be a good ,18
4765," to make a television channel where the parents are able to decide if they want to turn the advertising on or off this means that is in their on hands if their children can watch advertising or not and how often and for what time space they can watch it
but ",13
4766, it always the decision of the parents if the children are allowed too watch advertising or not if the children are able to see the advertising ,14
4767," the parents are watchging television it is not that effective if it is forbidden for them
",17
4768, good that parrents allow their children to look tv in this age the reason ,17
4769, is that its very easy for children to switch between the programs and ,24
4770," they are able to look films like james bond or something like that so the children are able to see maybe death people or people which kill other people this is very fatal and very easy for the children

on the other ",6
4771, its a good thing to allow children in an age between  because today you can see many programs which are only inventioned for little children this programs can help your children to learn math english or german but this effects are combined with fun ,24
4772, your children want to look tv and have fun and the parrents are ,17
4773, happy because they know that their children learn something another ,8
4774, is that there are many systems for the parents to safe their children one example is a system that block all oher tv programs ,12
4775," the children are unable to look films like james bond or a system that conrol how much time the children spend looking tv and if they look to many tv the system turn off the tv

honestly i would say parrents can allow their children to look tv because their ",17
4776, many systems to safe the children and the effect that the children can learn something by watching tv is ,17
4777," good due to this the children have much fun and this is  very important 

",8
4778,"i am of the opinion that such advertising should not be allowed

firstly it targets young humans who are not able to critically engage the content of the advert in addition to that an adult may be able to tell whether or not he or she is manipulated as adults are capable of selfreflection ",16
4779," such abilities are absent in young children

while some may argue that children would not be easily manipulated as they can tell fantasy and reality apart this ",7
4780," neglects the hyperrealistic nature of many adverts today making it hard for the child to tell apart advert and reality this could lead to developmental impairment as the development of critical thinking may be slowed down by such a delusion
another ",0
4781, that could be brought forth is that such a prohibition would harm the market by shutting off a portion of the customer base this ,23
4782, fails to mention the negligible purchasing power of young children instead of targeting the children to get them to nag on their parents the adverts should be targeted towards parents these parents are the ones buying the advertised good ,16
4783," way which would probably not lead to a noticable decrease in the sales of the products

this could even lead to more sales as parents could be directly advertised to convincing them directly of the ",2
4784," of the product
such a ban could ",23
4785," harbor benefit for the children a large number of young children are obese probably tied to fastfood adverts targeted towards them a ban on these could significantly improve the health of children

in conclusion ",13
4786, with the statement because of the potential harmful effects of such adverts on ,11
4787,the amount of televison kids watch these days ,6
4788, the tv was created is higher ,10
4789, kids spent their whole time in front of the tv or other specific hightech systems kids ,24
4790, young ones can be distracted by the advertisments and can believe everything said in a 3 minute tv spot for example the advertisments where unrealistic content is shown like things that are on paper or package start living and flying around or animals like unicorns get real and run through the living room another ,14
4791, of view is that the kids spent too much time in front of the tv ,17
4792, they stop spending time with friends or just watch spongebob with them there are ,24
4793, special ads which kids will always keep in their mind the ones with violent content halfnaked women or a lot of action stay in their minds and afterwards in school they tell friend about it ,0
4794," 
but ads are not always bad and inappropriate sometimes they just want to make us realize how good we have it to have a home food and just a family this concept goes ",11
4795, with the unicef advertisments those show often poor kids without food and family if little kids get such a message is questinable ,16
4796," for ads is that are able to learn something new any may they can understand just a little how the big world works different pictures make different and impressions and different impressions make a more interesting place to live on 
one way or another the influence of television and advertisments is bigger ",11
4797, our kids use some of their short time between shows  and cartoons to go out to remember what the real world looks like things ,6
4798,the given statement proposes that television advertising that is s young children should not be allowed personally ,13
4799, young children around the proposed ages between two and five years are easily manipulated adults and teenagers are heavily influenced by commercials ,14
4800, they contrary to small children know about deceits ,7
4801, false advertisement and what it is ,11
4802," intended to achieve  to lure potential buyers for certain products it doesnt necessarily show the truth
so if an adult ",16
4803, watches a commercial targeted towards their age group they may weigh the pros and cons of the product be it consciously or not ,0
4804, of the respective product being shown and emphasized children dont automatically do that they would ,2
4805, see the pros of what theyre seeing but they dont ask for the negative ,3
4806, that come along with it thus they can be easily tricked into fully believing commercials convince their parents to buy said product and ,2
4807," come to be disappointed or simply desire more
furthermore it could potentially convey false messages or imply things to manipulate the childs mind as already mentioned above children are very easily influenced the goal of advertisement is ultimately influencing the potential customer ",0
4808, the television specific mindsets towards certain topics can be planted into the little ones head ,6
4809, they even know much about it which on a long run may turn out harmful to them or others if as a very extreme example faschist propaganda were somehow hidden in commercials targeted towards children that would ,7
4810, for the child but their environment and the people around them ,7
4811, in general the chance of any of it being intended propaganda is relatively small but whether intended or not it does take part in the childs life ,16
4812," now that television is playing a large role in the lives of many kids
however it is the firms responsibility to sell their products and directing their advertising to this age group may secure them a much larger number of customers ",14
4813," every parent wants to satisfy their child and make them happy
but therer are other ways for firms to secure this part of the market without having to drag in small children who dont know much about advertising and are ",16
4814," prone to its effects they dont have the responsibilty do deal with this 

",19
4815,"in the following text we discus the topic televison advertising  between two and five years should not be allowed
the ",15
4816," against this statement is that young children can learn a lot if they watch a something about the world or about the nature but the problem here is that most of the children watch things which arenâ´t good for them
 another ",17
4817, against this statement is that donâ´t have any idea what they can do because  the perents of them donâ´t buy things with them they can play against this you can say that ,21
4818, can go out and with four or five years you have friends and you can do better things ,18
4819," watching tv for example you can paly football or play catching other children
the ",1
4820," with this statement is that it is not good for there young eyes to watch tv because maybe it can destroy there eyes and it is very bad if you need with young years glasses 
another ",17
4821," is that it is very important to have social contacts to other people maybe they can help you with a few things for example they can help you to speak or to went
in adittion you have to make your own experience and you canâ´t make your own experience if you sit on the coutch and whatch tv experience are very important for the future of young people and without them you have a harder live ",6
4822," others

at last you can say that it isnt good for young children to watch lots of tv but i donâ´t think that the statement television advertising  should not be allowed is a good statement
",13
4823,"today nearly nobody can spend without watching television sadly parents sit their young children in front a tv that they can do other things and must not care for their children but is this the wright way to deal with the short freetime you have if you are parents

on the one ",17
4824, it maybe solve the problem for the parents that their children is not silent or is getting on their nervs ,12
4825," they have to do the household or work

but ",9
4826," it is not okay to sit a young child in front of a televison channel for adults this can build a trauma in the mind of the childsome parents do not care about what is on the televion tehy only want silence for a time

eventhough parents show their children channels for kids it should be a ",17
4827," for more than an hour although some series try to teach the children speaking but you can not compare it with the social contact to the parentsother family members  

in the future these children lose the ability to deal with social conflicts and ",6
4828, to know new people they are not ,3
4829," educated and have it harder to get a good education because they had no good skills you need for it

in my opinion television advertising  should not be allowed because the rate for risk and danger is much higher than for the positive ",15
4830," the government should make a law which forbid it these children will be the future for humanity and the whole planet

",12
4831,in todays day and age it is impossible to not come across an advertisement every once in a ,11
4832, wether its written on bilboards or seen on tv a persons day always includes some companys attempt at luring them into buy their product so why should children be excluded from such an apparently mundane day to day occurance the answer is that simple they shouldnt just as with a lot of things in life if you want something there is some kind of tradeoff ,2
4833, if you as a parent want to be able to enjoy a brief moment of silence and let your child be educated by the television you ,17
4834, have to live with the ,19
4835, that companies will want to enthice your child by showing it new toys etc ,20
4836, off if you dont want these ads to have an effect on your children dont let them watch tv second off why shouldnt they be allowed just ,13
4837, that you as a parent can have a good nights sleep without beeing tortured into buying that new toy car for your son who has no other cares in the world no is the answer either you as a parent are rightous enough to stand up to your child and say no or you give in and enjoy those 5 minutes of silence in which your child isnt bored already with its new toy prohibiting companies to make advertisements directed  would ,13
4838, impeed the business succes of companies which have that target group meaning that if everyone can make ads for their respective target group eg makeup for women viagra for old men but they cant ,11
4839, that wouldnt be a fair market for products that arent harmful finally those ads arent out to harm your children but to give them an incentive to buy a companys products in other words exactly what all the other ads do to you so if you really dont want to have your child want what other children already have at its age ,16
4840, dont let her watch tv and close its eyes ,1
4841, you go out in public or start to do some actual parenting in stead of limiting toy selling companies from blossom and crippling the market so do yourself a favor and let the children be children and let the companies do marketing,20
4842,"in some talkshows they worked with the question whether television advertising  should not be allowed 
so the question is ",15
4843," very interesting for many parents who have growing childrens

at ",8
4844, it is a kind of freedom to make advertisings for products in the style that every customer think about it there werenâ´t a rule for a long time period against it and it damaged nobody ,11
4845, why should it be changed now young childs ,12
4846, there are new toys on the market further on the parents pay attention on their childrens in these ages and they do not have their own money to waste it for well done advertisings but ,2
4847," the young childs are getting influenced by the advertisings and because the childrens are only interested in toys and sweets so they propably spend their small count of money to buy some cheap but useless toys as a result to stop the growing influence on childrens by advertisings in a digital world it might be useful to not allow these kinds of advertisings 

i ",16
4848, be allowed because it is a kind of force to disallow these advertisings further on i donâ´t know childrens who are seriously influenced by these advertisings and who were damaged by them ,16
4849,"we often see or hear about children who watch a lot of television they regulary watch television for some hours a day of course it is normal to watch tv but not always four hours a day children dont have to spent too much time on television they should go out with their friends play football or do something other outside it isnt good for their eyes to watch television for a long time the advertising between the series are very bad for the children sometimes its special what the matter of the advertise is
when the children often watch television and see a lot of the advertise they want all of the beautiful toys they only speak about this cool car which they want or the new barbie or whatever after a ",14
4850, their parents buy them this things the children get it and play one or two times with the car and ,20
4851," it isnt interesting anymore some kids take their toys to school and show it their friends so it begins a quarrel about the best toy and perhaps one of the friends destroys it 
it is nice ",20
4852, the children change their toys ,20
4853, everyone can play with an other toy and be happy but the television advertising cant help to be happy when i was four years old we played with the toys from our older sister and we were happy i know that every factory will sell their toys but ,20
4854, you always see the new things which are better than yours you cant enjoy your life if you always have to be better than the others i have often played with plants or stones you can make a nice house of stone and the plants are the people who live there ,18
4855, with all these television advertising we stole the fantasy of our children ,14
4856,everybody knows those annoying commercials that interrupt a good movie many companies are trying to win the people for their product and they mostly succeed because ,11
4857, theyd quit because its not worth it and they couldnt afford it anymore often their aiming at young people ,19
4858, generate new loyal customers because once they like your product theres a high possibility that theyll always buy it ,23
4859," answer the question whether this kind of commercial should be allowed or prohibited 
commercials are often responsible for addiction in any way if you eat at mac donalds ",11
4860, youll get to see a lot of young people like  years old and ,18
4861," you see them eating those happy meals you can conclude that they were inspired by these remarkable advertisements from the tv spots but from now on theyll always eat at mac donalds and over the years theyll most likely gain weight what damages their image and perhaps they be bullied one day 
but ",3
4862, you think about i bet youll come up with some good ,18
4863, the importance of those advertisement i mean think about our economy it needs to work like this companies are supposed to grew and enlarge all the time and they generate new employers what reduces the number of unemployed workers imagine the government would forbid commercials for those people companies would get stuck and wouls have effects for other companies like ,11
4864, the companies who deliver products and ,23
4865," on 
so imagine commercials for young people were forbidden companies would have a big lack in perhaps twenty years what would ",13
4866," companies like lego do if they didnt have any customers anymore 
in my opinion it would be ridiculous if the government didnt allow commercials directed to young people anymore they would restrict their own economy system and made a huge mistake they cannot be frogiven for",0
4867,"
since many years there are advertisings in the program of kids television show 
exspecially american television systems use them by hard
in the following agrees and disagrees of this topic will be showed

one the one ",14
4868," advertisings have to be in the program because the company of television were financed by them
so they are the reason that many programs are cheap or for free

on the other ",10
4869," this advertisings make kids lose their time which could be used to play outside or make other funny things
furthermore the children believe this advertisings and get lost to them the kids see these products and they really want to get them
so the parents would have many problems if they maybe have not enough money
maybe they are feeling than as bad parents or between the adult and the child will be more trouble and much more stress

",0
4870," with the statement
in my opinion television advertising direct toward young children aged  should not be allowed
",13
4871, companys use secondary programs for kids like zdf and kika so they get more money from zdf and not ,23
4872," much from kika
relations like this could be used as an idol for other television companys
",10
4873,"

in a society where nearly everybody can take part of media advertising concerning young children is an issue
so it should be considered if it should be forbidden to advertise directly 

on the one ",16
4874, it is very easy to influence children in that age they have no experience in life and are not steady in their mind so if they are manipulated in young age it can have big influence on their later life and on their behavior of buyinglater in their life it could influence the way how the children as grown up spend their moneywhich is ,7
4875," the background why big companies advertise they could get in financial problems

on the other children in that age have no oppurtunity to buy things so if they want something they have to ask their parents and in that case it would not matter if the kids are manipulated or not you could ",2
4876, consider that companies have to advertise in television and ,10
4877," directly to children and adult would never buy an toy because he wants it he does that because the children want to have a specific thing so if a company wants to sell something they have to make the children see it since most children watch television it is the only oppurtunity
furthermore children in that age should not watch ",20
4878," much television at all it is already an issue that big c0mpanies have a reason to make such advertising

all in all i think it should be allowed to direct advertisements toward children ",13
4879, in few cases it can influence the behavior of children ,4
4880, children can not buy something by themselves in that age it is not that big of a problem and what is really striking is that companies have to sell their goods ,2
4881,since technical things developed much faster children start to grow up with more technical things like smartphones televisions computers and ,24
4882," on than in the past at least every child grows up with a television and thats why there could be the question if it should not be allowed to show television advertisings  
it is obvious that children ",14
4883, in this age during  are easy to influence so whenever they see something they want or someone tells them to buy something cause they really need it they change their mind ,24
4884, they really want it then they always get on their parents nerves and were sad ,24
4885, the parents do not allow buying these things also they learn from television advertisings if the guy or kid in the advertisement is doing something which looks like fun or something like that the children watching this want to try it out too even if it is dangerous also in these newer times the advertisings are often about ne apps and ,2
4886, on which pushes the children more and more to the technical ,8
4887, they stop playing outside or something they trust in things the television is showing them ,24
4888, they even expect the things which are showed them in the advertisings ,3
4889," it is physically not possible or something else 

on the other ",18
4890, the people making games and ,18
4891, on have to show it in a way to children and ,8
4892, on otherwise they would not earn enough money to go on in their production also the television programms have to earn enough money to pay their costs that is just possible with advertisings and ,10
4893," on so many jobs depent on this

all in one ",23
4894, young children aged  watch television because of parents who have no time or are just not amused to play with their children the children watch everything in television ,17
4895, telivision advertising in the following essay ,10
4896," discuss whether television advertising directed young children should be allowed
firstly ",13
4897, mention that there are a lot of channels for children they are ,6
4898," made for them to sleep well or just to laugh a little bit and get some kind of distraction they are made to give the parents time to calm down or to do other things like the dishes this sort of channels have no bad influence on a little child
furthermore children do not watch television that much because they go to the kindergarden and spend time with their parents 
another ",17
4899, add is that every adult has do decide on their own whether it is okay for a child to watch television or not there could be some parents who want their children to watch television advertising parents have to make decisions on their own beacsue this is their job they get a child to take care for it ,14
4900," own decisions and an own opinion how to raise a child
the last ",9
4901, mention is that children aged between two and five are not that interested in television they like to play outside or to meet their friends usually they play with dolls or with other toys to have fun sometimes they have to spend the whole day in the kindergarden where they play with their friends every single ,17
4902," and where they do not have the possibility to watch television
to sum it up ",6
4903, that it should be allowed for lables or brands to have the possibility to make television advertising ,15
4904, children will watch it there are different channels and some ,6
4905, it should be a task for parents to raise a child in the right way and tell himher which things are allowed and which are not,12
4906,"we are living in a world where technology is a very important thing and many people cant live without either the smartphone or tablets are in our hands but often we like to lay on the couch an watch television but should television  be allowed

this statement is a controversial theme 
the children are even more younger ",17
4907, there starting to watch television and some parents dont care because the children are busy and couldnt go on there nerves on the other ,1
4908," it isnt good for them because they can become bad eyes or dont go outside anymore 
the young children will be learn the wrong things and if they are looking to much television they can be stressed and want to look even more tv
in our society it isnt possible to say that the young children shouldnt watch tv because its a very big problem ",17
4909, everyone is watching it the whole time and they musnt in comparison to that ,19
4910," important for there rising to have freetime and play outside with friends 
if they are watchuing television the whole time they are sitting in a room without freshly air and forget the time most of the time the parents dont think about this problem because of our technologe societiy
finally its important for children to go outside and communicate television can make them nervous and often they watch the wrong things ",17
4911," they learn bad vocabulary for the future and mostly havent the same experiences as others 

in my oppinion it should be allowed for children to watch tv but not that often ",17
4912, they have enough time for using there freetime to gain experiences television adevertising  should be allowed but parents should pay more attention on it and ,17
4913, not every child is watching tv that often ,17
4914, there are only a few with problems ,19
4915,there are advertisements in the television that are directed to children between 2 and 5 now i want to show some ,14
4916, for and against this and ,21
4917, positive thing that comes in my mind is that these advertisements are for the childrens age and not ,16
4918, some advertisements for adults this can ,16
4919, be good for showing the children new things and maybe if there is an advertisement for a toy ,0
4920, they want to have it and they can ,3
4921, play with it also there can be interesting advertisements for children ,0
4922," they get interest in new things which are shown in the television or something like that 

but there are ",6
4923," in these advertisements one thing is that the children maybe dont even understand one thing which is said also it could be a problem that they get addicted to watching television if there is an advertisement they really like and which they want to see all the time also there can be advertisements which arent liked from every child and that is not good if they start to cry from some advertisements or if they have bad dreams about something which was shown on the television 

the question is now if television advertisements directed to children between 2 and 5 should be forbidden or stay allowed 
in my opinion they shouldnt be forbidden because it can be interesting or it can show things which are nice and which the children ",14
4924, some negative things but for the most things it could help that the parents overwatch their children ,4
4925, they watch television so if this is the case there should almost be no problem with these advertisementes and i think it is okay to allow them because there arent ,16
4926,"nowerdays often the question if young people should watch tv comes up to our mindstoday many young children watch tv because their parents have no time to play with their children
in my opinion it is not good for ",17
4927," young people to watch tv the hole day children in this age should play outside with other children in their ages it is important for them to have social contact to know how to act infront other people young children learn the most with other peolpe in the same age
when they watch tv it is ",17
4928, possible to learn new things ,18
4929," you have to know the difference between some channels some channels are very helpful to learn the language or the numbers but other channels do not have a learneffect they are only there for entertainement what is not the best for little children
young children should play with friends in the same age or with there parents and other familymembers at a special age it is okay to watch tv but not the hole day ",17
4930, a two years old child do not have to watch tv to be entertaint it should play to have fun ,1
4931, with five years it were okay ,19
4932," the child watch half an hour the day tv 
so ",17
4933, you have to know the differnence between the age of a child and the tv channel it is ,6
4934, important to look at the time how long a child watch tv so ,17
4935, every parent have a other opinion to this theme and have to know it for himself,8
4936,"it sais that televison adversising direct toword young children
to begin television has a big place in our society nearly everyone is wathing tv nowedays because of the big number of tvshows beside the tvshows witch are just for fun or to relaxe at the end of the day ther are ",17
4937," tvshows were you can lern new things but should it be allowed for young children to watch it

on the one ",17
4938, as its been said television hasnt only tvshows witch arent needed in life witch are just for fun ,17
4939, we have to split the wort television in two parts if children learning something with the televison ,17
4940," there is a tvshow were a child can learn how to speek better or maybe how to draw it could be good for the kid because he or she is not wasting his or her time because in the young age children dont forget what they hear or see everything stays in their mind 
but ",6
4941, this kind of experience can the child ,8
4942, by talking with its family he or she has there ,18
4943, the oppertunity to learn with other children by playing the child gets ,8
4944, a better social life and learns that its ,8
4945, part opf television are the tvshows were you dont learn something you are just watching something happen ther the children ,6
4946, with the statement because in this age it is verry imortant to lern by doing and this in socitety the children aged  dont know really much because they have to learn everything new its importand to show them only good things and something good to lern because it will stany for the rest of hisher life,8
4947,more and more houses in our countries get a television at home today it is standard to have minimum one television at home now we have like three generations on our planets the oldest one who havent any technical stuff in there childhood and learn about the new technical things ,17
4948, they are very old for those people are the new technical stuff new television is something that they are know the most the ,6
4949," generations are the one who lived with the change to the new technic for those it is already standard with the modern technic and the latest generation are the one who do not know something else since they are on the planet they are surrounded by the newest technical thing one of this technical thing is logically the television from this new technic it is even an older one but some people have the opinion that in very young age you should not have to be allowed to have already contact to this new modern technic like television
firstly that is because they think with this change of childhood they are loosing old good values if childrens were introduced in the life just with the new technical things they really dont know something else so they are loosing the contact to important values things like this can leads into a big social trouble with other humans generally humanity is getting loose we have to take care on this values the new technic can easily destroy old important values if the children are watching televison it seems everything to look perfect but thats not our reality i know that reality isnt perfect in the oposite of the technic world but the reality is what counts 
but ",17
4950," i guess it doesnt need rules which are saying that childrens arent allowed to watch tv it is the job of the parents to look for the children they need a good relation between the reality and the virtuality so they can do easy the different between this two worlds additionaly they have to know that the world that counts is the reality
overall i guess it is too hard to say it needs rules to forbidden television for children that are values which should be given from parents if parents think they dont have to watch tv they can decide that but the ",17
4951, is that television isnt hard enough for children that they are completly lost,17
4952," with the statement television advertising  should not be allowed

",15
4953, at the age of  no child has to watch any television at this time there are ,17
4954," many other things to do for example playing outside with friends or have walks with family in the woods learn something about nature and animals in real life is really worthful
some people have the opinion the children could learn things about life ",8
4955," watching television sure there are some informativ documentaries but what kind of child wants to watch this boring stuff

another ",6
4956," against using a television at this age is the children who sit infront of computers or ipads or smartphones or televisions all day or can we say atleast too often get fat they not get enough fresh air and they do not move so they eat and lay in bed and thats really bad for their health

the parents have to be very careful because there are ",17
4957, many possibilities to get in contact with some kind of media in times like today ,10
4958," parents have to protect their children

for parents it might be easier sometimes to take their children and set them in front of a television they do not have to pay attention to them any longer they do not have to prepare exiting trips or something but it is ",12
4959," important to play with your children and to give them love and time

dear parents please spent some time with your young pieces of gold ",8
4960, you are able to do and ,18
4961," they are not too old to want to play with you


",24
4962,"as children have very visualbased beahviour young children often feel the need to get something as soon as they see it somewhere frequently therefore television advertising is probably a very good strategy for the companies to make those children want their product

however it is questionable if children aged  should even already be confronted with advertising they are ",14
4963," in the stage of getting to know their environment and getting to know their families during this stage advertising can slower their progress as they get confused between the virtual and the real world

do you think the ads should be s these young caracters should they even be watching television often enough to get affected by those ads 
the most amazing childhood is the one about which you can tell stories to your own children later do you really want your child to tell stories about the television series to your grandchildren

",0
4964, there should be television ads s  year olds they are in the middle of finding out who they are and who they want to be ,24
4965, they should be influenced by anything else but their families their friends or their teachers other than this ,7
4966, they should not be sitting in front of the television often enough to get affected by ads a child only really wants something if it has to look at it over and over again they do not admire something ,14
4967," they saw it once they forget about it rapidly if they are not confronted with it another time
so ",3
4968, the more appropriate statement would be young children should live their childhood ,8
4969, than watching television often enough to be influenced by advertising ,10
4970, with this statement because a lot of young children use a huge amount of electronical devices in young age so they are not as communicative as the ones who grew up without any television or with not a huge usage of television furthermore it is not helpful for the young generation because they only get a knowlegde about the digital world and not about the real world so this could be a problem in addition to that a lot of families use these electronical devices because they want a break from their children and ,17
4971, this could be a useful gadget but i doesnt become to habit otherwise if you travel in another country and spend their your vacation  and you use the restaurants in the hotel there you can see a lot of families with young children who sit infront of a television in this case it is not a common tv but through the digital century you can use other electronical devices like mobile phones tablets or comnputer these devices allow you to stream films or series ,17
4972, these devices are the modern tvs you easy can take them with you another ,10
4973, can watch films and series in the common tv channel but more and more people use stream websites like amazon prime netflix maxdome sky on demand to watch their favourit films and series through this kind of development which we can have during the last years we have to do something against this trend the children need a real childhood which is not based on electronical devices they need a childhood which is based on normal things like meeting friends or to spend the whole day outside we have to find a conclusion in this case because ,17
4974, the tv have a huge influence on the young children otherwise they are not able to seperat these things and what they see in the tv or what kind of things they see are real  ,17

children are sweet and everybody likes children they just give us a great feeling this is a ",8
4976," why many people use little children for their advertising but is this good for the children

when the children are little they believe everything what adults are saying they have no own opinion and can not talk for themselve they do not choose for themselve others are choosing for them so they can not say if they want to make advertising or not 
many parent with sweet babies just try to get their little children on tv it is a simple work and they get paid for this even ",16

but with 5 year you should be in de position to say what you like to do and what not when you force the little children to do stuff like this than they can not reaise up like they want it can be irritating for them ",24
4978," they are growing up with doing advertising and suddenly they have to go to school and have a normal way of life it could bring many problems for the children 
it ",2
4979, can be that they do not like it that they were in a advertising and ,11
4980," they are older they are ashamed about this 
in the most advertising where chidren are in there are just there for thir cuteness so we are using the cuteness from children to make advertising that other people buy stuff 
but is it really ",2

i do not believe that sure it is not good ",11

the everydaylife of children many even become addicted to it
there are critists who think that television advertising  should not be allowed

",14
4989," now explain
many children in their early age choose somebody or something to  look up to to gain motivation or to become 
inspired of course there is nothing wrong about it but in some cases it can be very dangerous for their
",7
4990," development children become easily manipulated and if they watch the wrong things it can have
a negative impact on their life 
especially advertising is something of which young children are easily passioned about they see things
they may not have and become fascinated they start to think about what they have justb watched or listened to 
and it starts to influence their mind
an example for a problematic situation which probably became worse because of advertising is obesity
advertising of food has a massive impact on peoples diet because it makes them want the things they have
just seen at the advertisement this is the same with young children if they watch television advertising directed 
to them they  may form theirselves a wrong opinion abo",14
4991,"in the last years electronical devices like television are getting used more often also small children often watches many hours television per week where they come in contact with television advertising but it is well known that small children are very influencable by television advertising

as quotet above small children are very easy to influence ",14
4992, by well made television advertises because they are young and arent able to make their own thoughts about  aproduct ,2
4993, their lack of experience for example i have seen this ,3
4994, my brother was younger and we went to the cinema at the ,18
4995," and during the brake there were many advertises like movie trailers and food advertises while i wasnt interested in it my brother wanted to go eating there

on the other ",11
4996, it is very difficult to achieve the goal to get no television advertises to small children aged  because you cant ban channels fron every channel which a small kid is watching because on every major channel their is a small kids watching ,13
4997," they have to ban advertises from every channel
also advertises is the main money income of the most television channels and without this income it would be impossible to provide free television channels  

although small children are very easy influenced by television advertises it is very difficult to achieve the goal not to get any advertises to small children on plus television advertises are the main income of most television channels without them most channels would go bankrupt as a ",13
4998, it is possible to do payable televisio channels on which isnt any advertises this channels will earn their money by monthly paid prices from the consumer ,10
4999,"it is widely discussed whether young children aged  should be confronted with television advertisement
a reason why many people are against it is that children are often more easily influenced by their surroundings than children of an older age teenager or adults as they are ",14
5000," at a strong developping stage
as advertisment is often used to manipulate people into wanting certain products or buying themthere is ",11
5001, a difference in trying to manipulate adults that know the sake of advertisment and are able to reflect about the things they are facing ,2
5002," than children that take most things in without questioning them

yet there are people older than the age of five years old that are ",7
5003," as easy to manipulate
eventhough you are not as strongly developping at the ages of 6 and everything above ",24
5004," developping

but shall it therfor be forbidden directing advertisment towards young children

as we are living at the age of social media nowadays children are often introduced to the world of social media at an early stage so it is not possible for them to not be confronted with adverstisment at all whether it is s them or not what toddlers see is what they most likely want to have whether it is the phone their mother is holding in her ",16
5005," or whatever they see on television

also earlier or later they will be the ones who the advertisment is directed at at some ",11
5006," as they will reach they will eventually reach the ages of 6 and older 
whenever that may be they should be prepared and used to the advertisment when advertisment is part of your daily life you start to not listen to it that exactly anymore it becomes something like a backgound noise ",16
5007," than something that takes up all of your attention as it is new to you made extra interesting just to influence you

that is why ",21
5008," advertisment dirceted toward young children
",16
5009,"telivision advertising  should not be allowed because they are to young to be victims of the industrie and their aims 
for the industrie it would be great to give the children pictures of things they would like to have and suggest them wishes because the children will tell these wishes their parents and forced them to buy the wished produktthat means industrielle profit but the parents are the ones who have to buy unnecesary and expensive things to make their children happy they have to spent more and more money to fullfill their childrenâ´ wishes and not every family has enough money to mess with these capitalism standarts
in my opinion children should not be manipulated and influenced like this they are just watching television and have never heard ",14
5010, now they want to have them the children are not as lucky as they were ,9
5011, they started watching television now they are unconfortable because of the influence by the wish ,1
5012, this sertain produkt and are not able to play and live as freely as ,23
5013," they knew about this product
in addition the children start to compare each other and want to have the same things the others have
this leads to social unequality and conflicts between the children and their parents because they do not buy the things for the children whish they want to have and ",2
5014, to conflikts between the childen because they are jealus of o,7
5015,there have ever been a big discussion about television advertising what should be allowed what shouldnt especially advertising  children is a big topic because there are many proponents but at least as many opponents in the following ,14
5016, name and compare some of their ,21
5017," 

first of all we all know how children are easy to influence so a great ",7
5018, for the advertising is that it is really effective and if a five year old boy sees a toy he likes he will try to convince his mother to buy it until she does but anyway it is really manipulative to just show the children this things and make them to want the toys and the advertising tries to own the mind of the child to meka it think of the new toy or whatever the whole time ,0
5019, it is morally pretty incorrect to show this advertisement to children because they are not as used to advertising and to think ,16
5020, of the things mentioned in the advertisement ,11
5021," of the things behind it 

an other ",21
5022, which goes in the same direction is that children are more guided by incentives than adults are ,7
5023, if they always see the advertisement of one particular thing they will decide in the store automatically for this thing or ask their parents to buy this thing because the only thing they know is that they have already seen this somewhere ,0
5024, it is probably a good one this is a strong ,18
5025, but opponents say that tese  year old children dont even understand and get what the advertisement is about ,16
5026, it is kind of useless to make advertisement ,11
5027," for this children 

additionally it is in the sight of many people unnecessary and unuseful to make advertisement for children because ",16
5028," the parent have to buy the things so it would be much better to make advertisement which is  the parents explaining them how the children are able to profit of these things and if they are able to cpvince the parents they will buy it and the company makes much more money than if they convinced the children because yes maybe they want the things afterwards but this doesnot serve anybody because they can not get it and the company can make no profit and if they direct it directly to the children maybe the parents are even more shocked that they do something like this and they are not going to buy it out of this reason

on the other ",0
5029, it doesnt hurt somebody if they make advertisement for the young children and the idea of companies is maybe to try it once and to watch if it helps to optimize their profit and if not they can make a different ,16
5030, advertising line and if it works they can go on like this ,11
5031," it can be seen as an experiment

all in all there are many pros and contras but ",21
5032, the contras are much better ,19
5033, because the manipulating of young children is a dangerous topic and ,12
5034, it does not hurt anyone it should not get more and more and at a ,4
5035, in the future our children are just brainwashed babies which follow all the advertisements and i guess it is even more profitable to direct it to the parents because the big influence they have on the children is not useful if it is not the same influece on the parents because children alone provide no profit,2
5036,young children can be manipulated quite easy they ,7
5037, have to learn very much of their environment and mostly the take older people as their vorbild if they grow up with a television and its advertisements the toddlers ,24
5038, whatch it with full attention or they arent really interested and dont take it too serious but if they love what they see television advertising can make them to want the shown product or to be like the childrenpersons who show up in the ads,10
5039,first i am sure very few people like television advertising because it divides the mostly valuable real tv content on the other ,10
5040, advertising is essential for many companies to earn money and even to survive tough a large part of their revenues is advertising so how to decide whether to decide an advert is  or toward their parents or even other people ,11
5041, this would be extremely difficult and if such a law exists there may even appear some court cases where parents do not ,9
5042," with former decicions
on the other ",19
5043, tv adverts are quite manipulative expacially if  such advertisers want children to annoy their parents until they ,2
5044, buy the advertisers product additionally adverts shown  will burn into their memories ,11
5045, in other words these children will be secretly unknownly influenced and manipulated during their whole life but to really prove these statements it is necessary to look up some studies already existing in this area so how about other advertising young children are inevitably seing whenever they watch television in ,14
5046," be influenced by these this thesis leads toward denying every single advert which is economically simply unpossible
to sum up there are definitely real problems but its a very difficult and dangerous question where to draw the line",11
5047," with this statement 
television advertising  should not be allowed because of the danger such advertisment can do in relation to a young childrens brain 
when children watch television in a young age it will kill more brain cells than in an older age also the children want to watch more television they are getting confronted with advertisments for kids ",13
5048, they want to have them very annoying for parents ,20
5049, the child asks the whole time if he can have that toy maybe so the parents buy the toy for the kid only to stop this annoying questioning this is buisness the firms are playinmg against the will of the people and because of that they are making more money they are not interested in the health or the wishes of the people who can decide children can not decide they see something they want to have and can not decide if it is good for them or not the television is something everyone got today it was getting important during the last years because of that many firms are doing advertisments in the telivisionmany children are watching tv nowadays and ,20
5050, they exploit it only to make profit,23
5051,"advertisements in television or in the internet are oftener  today
the question is should those advertisements be allowed or not and that is the topic i am going to discuss in this essay
well one ",15
5052, for this kind of advertising is that people at every age are advertised ,11
5053, why not the younger ones ,24
5054," what is the problem with advertisement for even younger ones
in the age  you are very predictable and easy to influence with certain tricks and the advertising in television uses those tricks to kind of controll the young people who are watching it when a child sees an advertisment like this the desire of getting the product is imense ",16
5055," for a toy when kids in this age want something like this it can get very complicated because it is easy to disappoint them 

so my personal opinion on this controversial topic is that those kind of advertisements should be more or less forbidden the most simple reason for this is that children in this age are ",16
5056," easy to influence and this can cause serious problems 
",7
5057,"a lot of parents all over the world are worried about the influences with which their children are confronted in advertising on television and the radio 
every where you go you will be faced with advertising and ",14
5058, you cannot make it unseen for you children futhermore it is important that the children learn to handel with advertising and maybe they get some information through it like the advertising for a history book or the ,16
5059, history film in cinema in addition to that children have ,6
5060, to learn that they cannot get everthing what they have seen on television and ,8
5061, in the supermarket how often a child runs to his mom and show here a chocolate or chips and ssy to here that it has seen it on the advertising and it should smell ,18
5062," good and it want to try it in addition to that a lot of parents by these things for theire children and that is the problem with this bourggt they help the firms which make these advertising for their products to do more
on the other ",0
5063, you can understand the parents ,9
5064, they say advertising which is not s children of the age  years is not good or unbelievable but the advertising which is for these young people should be okay because we are everywhere confronted with advertising our whole life long aqdvertising which is not directed to this young people is not okay ,16
5065," they should become a bad influence or do bad things but it must be not 
",7
5066, in all ways of advertising a bad advertising could ,11
5067, show a childre that it will not do it anytime because it is ,7
5068, bad or has got such worse ,19
5069," for the person who do it or for all the other people which were involved
in ",21
5070, with the fear of the parents because ,7
5071, it is more a help for the children ,12
5072," they are confronted with the good and bad sights of advertising in young ageno one could help them later to decide if they need this or have to seen this film or not if they do not learn it from youth on 
",0
5073,first of all i aree with the statement there are multiple reasons ,21
5074," and few against it
the main issue is that children in the age of  have a different mind set up and not all behave the same way this leads to different perspectives ",12
5075," more factors that have to be included
but if we ignore that and just focus on one certain type of child the most common one which is naive and inexperienced we come to the conclusion that they are easily manipulated which follows by a child begging his parents to buy the advertised object one the one ",2
5076, if the parents say no which is more likely than just saying yes the child is perhaps going to cry and stress them on the other ,9
5077," and buy the advertised object lets say a toy the child will be satisfied but for an unknown amount of time children tend to have interests in many things and change often their focus on new things all in all the child will be satisfied for a short time until it sees a new advertising which repeats the whole process over to an endless circle of unpleasure for the parents

boi",0
5078,"which person hadnt seen ever television television is a part of our daily life we watch it to relax for entertaining reasons to informate us what happen around the globe most of the humans cant imagine a life wihtout a television but what is about the younger part in our socierty should they watch advertising television shows is it good that there exist shows for such young childrens or is it a danger for themselves

it is proved that television isnt good for the childrens intelligence if they are watching television to often they are getting dumber the best example for this statement are the teletubbies a lot of professors and psychoanalytics worked a long time to bring out a programme which would help the children to learn there have been some parents who believed in this programme and let their children watch it some children who watched it too often have now big speech problems because they dont use the normal language in the teletubbieshow

on the other ",17
5079, yound children need always something new and interesting at television exist a large amount of shows which are the best entertainer young children love watching television ,17
5080, why wont we let them there are series like bee maya peterson and findus or wickie to look at this series is like to read a little story ,19
5081," if the children like to hear a good and entertaining story they just can turn the television on

nevertheless television contains the danger of getting addicted to it if we take a look at our society we can clearly see that there are some people which cant live wihtout a television or a mobile phone young childrens are getting used to television they stop playing with lego and they stop going out it is ",17
5082," possible that they are getting angry if they cant watch television anymore it is the obligation of their parents that they take care of their children and play with them if a child has a choice between playing football with its dad or watching television it would always choose playing football so it lays in the parents hands that their children dont watch to often television and get addicted to it

television shows are the best programme that a poor family could have if the parents are woking all day long and they cant buy their children some toys the children can watch television to entertain themselves if the parents are at home they an watso there is a possibility to pass by time as a family with watching television the family would be happy

in my personal opinion ",17
5083, that televison is a bad thing for young children if i was around this age i always went out to play make sports if i stayed in the house i played with my legos the children which dont do such things in their childhood dont know how to have a conversation and they loose the connection to reality it is truly sad that people at my age keep staring at their phones ,17
5084, speaking with each other or having a good time everything must be photographed everything must be posted it is a tragedy you are may questioning yourself why i am talking about phones television an phones are somehow the same ,10
5085, of them are entertaining humans and you can have an addiction to ,19
5086, of them so the dangers of television are the  same as the dangers of the mobile phones so it is nessesery that espacially young children dont watch television to often,17
5087,televisions are an amazing thing for young children they entertain them with colourful creative pictures and adventurous stories no matter ,17
5088, no matter how a child could spend all day long in front of the tv staring on the screen even ,17
5089," a advertising break interrupts the serie or the movie the children wont take their eyes away from this big black box so is television advertising just a genius idea from the capitalistic industries and can it hardly influence the childrens grow up should advertising not be allowed on the kids channels
in my opinion advertising shouldnt be hidden for young childrens eyes  it should be forbidden ",14
5090, advertising is like creating illusions of things you have to have for beeing succesfull or cool or whatever and it works especially with young children they see something fabulous on tv and the months ,0
5091," they wont stop stressing their parents until they get it and they will get it 
if you are a father or a mother and youre against tv advertising  you just shouldnt allow them to look tv seriously is it better for your kid to stare hours and hours on the screen watching stupid series than watching advertising spots make them go outside discover the world and feel free children dont realy need tvs neither they need advertising if you get them anything they need  and i speak of love freedom and peace  they will never be catched of this illusions created by capitalism 
theres just one way to fight advertising  fight capitalism",14
5092,i often encounter advertisements for children ,16
5093, watching television at home boring short scenes which often are simple and ,6
5094, stupid to be honest just yesterday i saw one during the break ,19
5095, watching a football game the advertisement was for some egoshooter and it didnt seem appealing whatsoever and ,11
5096," i started questioning advertisements made for young viewers does it really make sense to show them

for one the ussage of digital devices is getting more and more frequent and the age of their users is dropping drastically my neighbours son has his own ipad ",16
5097, hes only fourteen years old he doesnt use it to learn or to do research he ,24
5098, goes online and surfs the web watches all sorts of videos plays games and every now and ,1
5099, a short video pops up advertising what often seem to be war games now the ,11
5100, that those videos appear is something i can deal with i mean advertisements are all over the place we see them ,11
5101, watching the news even in papers you find them on each page but presenting children with a subject of violence a major cause of the worlds disasters namely war thats simply wrong if people want to launch ads for healthy food or for doing sports with the aim of fetching children from their screen and outside to play id totally support that but if you try to sell some product linked to violence to children ,16
5102, young they dont even understand whats at stake you should seriously question what youre doing and as ive said ,24
5103, children dont have the rational thinking of grownups ,7
5104, they dont always think of all of the ,3
5105, there are wich is perfectly fine but you shouldnt attempt getting them to do something they dont know the risks of if you make a child download  a game fine if it by playing it learns something perfect but if the child ,24
5106, suddendly clicks on a button within the game and pays real money the parents money without really realizing it ,9
5107," thats the right way of doing it

so ",18
5108, advertisements meant for children are prefectly fine ,16
5109, their content and the product theyre trying to give to those children is sensible and childrenfriendly,16
5110,television advertising should not be directed age25 their brain is not able to comprehend what kind of information they are given they have not learned how to make reasonable decisions ,14
5111, or tell the difference of necessary and not necessary a child sees the world in a complete different way than an adult not only do they not realise that what they are watching is meant specifically to make them want it ,8
5112, do they not realise how much the wished for object would cost this brings me to another crucial ,3
5113, children at that age do not have their own income by gods sake they probably do not even quite understand the value of a money give a kid a hundred bucks and the worst case scenario would be him or she ripping it apart they should stop using diapers ,9
5114, being abused by adults advertising stuff wanting nothing less but the kids parents to buy the mercendise advertising toward people of such a young age can cause them to have future problems with investing their not endless source of money ,2
5115, the parents not paying for it anymore they are practically forced to take place in the industry and its demand of consuming ,9
5116,television has really invadad our society in americn homes ,17
5117, eat or go to bed ,18
5118," watching tvthe tv is always on not only it ismanipulating us the society with all their food commercials and every little thing that is out there but they lso dont give us a choice not to have to live with it

its every parents own responsibility what they let their kids watch and do ",17
5119, minor they can watch their movies their tv shows and listen to the music channels  they want to but all these things have one thing in common the kids decided they wanted to watch the movies shows or music channelsbut the commercials arent the kids choice anymorethey are being put there directly ,14
5120," the kid gets attacked directly and is pretty much forced to watch them if it intents to finish whatever he is watching at the moment 
 
manufactrues use the break time between movies shows and talkshows to advertise their products adults ",6
5121, they might like on thing in the ,19
5122, think about it more carefully and waht the consequenses might be but kids they if they see a thing they like they want it some kids are easier than others and might get distracted by other things in a blink of a ,24
5123, but others might have attention issues or other problems and get obsessed with that one thing they see their minds cant get off that thought that they want to have this toy ,20
5124," 

in the end it all depends on the parents but oftentimes if the kid gets really annoying with that one thing he wants they give it to him ",9
5125, he stops complaining and whining this leads to a circle the kids figure out a way of getting what they want and the parents just keep going with it because these days everyone has got less time and wants to have a good time without being annoyed so ,9
5126," if a kid always screams around and annoys them they sure want to make it stop 

its ",7
5127," a good way for the company to make a huge amount of money they only have to put a big effort into their advertising section but otherise they dont have to do anything anymore the tv does everything for them all they get out of it is kids wanting to have their things and parents wanting to buy these products to satisfy their screaming and unhappy children thats the new way of getting costumors

5128, it is a good thing to do because now in our society everything runs through television and advertising thats all we do obsess about something and buy it weve got to be an isolated population and ,23
5129, i think its unfair to ,19
5130, fasten up this whole unnatural prpcess ,18
5131, to drag the unknowing kids into it ,8
5132, of all i think they have better things to do ,19
5133, wath tv all day and get spoiled ,1
5134, innocent that everyone is just profiting from them ,3
5135, for this subject is that kids who have  years dont know what is useful or good for them because many games are just useless and dont bring much joy as ist is shown in the television an other ,8
5136, against the advertisment for little children is that they influence them too strong for an exemple a poor family with a little kid who is watching tv sees an advertising about a toy for children the child starts asking his parents if they could get them the toy but its too expensive ,13
5137, the parents have to say no the child notice that it will never get this toy what ,20
5138," say is that because of the advertisement poor people can feel sometimes bad because they havnt enough money to make their childs dream come true

the cons are that the producers of children games should have the right to advertise their products in the television the dont create a harmful advertisement for children they jus try to sell their products an other ",14
5139, for the advertisment for children aged  years is that ,16
5140, i was a little child i liked to see advertisements for children games because i wanted to be informed what was new on the market or  what i could wish for christmas an other ,0
5141, for this topic is that the advertisment of children games make the parents life easier because the child know what it wants ,0
5142," they go to a shopping center without the advertisment children would cry in the super market because they couldnt decide which game their parents should buy and that would end in a discussion 

in my opinion children aged  are too young to know whats good or usefull for them and because of the advertising in the television they are wrong influenced the adverisement lie often ",2
5143, its better that you go with your children to the supermarket and look by your own what could make them laugh or what isnt harmful because of this ,4
5144, that television advertising  should not be allowed,15
5145,nowadays a lot of children in our society grow up with electronic especially young children aged  which havent ,24
5146, been at school spend a lot of time watching tv but can we ,1
5147," with this phenomen

today there are a lot of televison shows in which children can learn ",6
5148, how to act in our society their are some shows in other languages in those the children can learn how to count to spell or to write also for parents it is sometimes really practical ,8
5149," the parents are busy the kids chan watch tv the children grew up with the new technicals and electroncis in our world

when the parents dont have a lot of time little children are sometimes watching to much tv they spent the whole day inside and cant play outside with other children in the same age this influences their social compartment and has an impact on their behaviour sometimes i see little children in the bus witch are watching televison during the whole busdrive and they dont even recognize their enviroment 

in my opinion televison has positive and negative influences on young children ",17
5150, it is really effective to learn ,18
5151, languages but if they are only sitting in front of the tv and dont play outside or with other children their are negative impacts,17
5152,it is common knowledge that televion advertising or adverts ,10
5153, do have an influence on our subconcious for we ,21
5154," tend to make different desicions without us actively noticing so should this be not allowed for children aged 

given the ",12
5155, of what ive mentioned on top ,21
5156, people who arent concious about that ,3
5157, shouldnt watch to much advertisement ,10
5158, most of the children but ,7
5159," you should raise the restriction age at least up to eight or ten for children below the age of five hardly watch any tv with adverts if the parents are responsible 
another ",13
5160, is that adverts influenced children if thats the case almost never make any desicion on their own i mean a 5 year old wont go to the supermarket to buy that cool toy he saw on tv wich is something that the parents should prevent ,14
5161,"
i could imagine the opposite to be the case more often people who really could do such things with more serious stuff like expensive shit or their food should be warned so id ",19
5162," suppose you prevent such people from being subconciously influenced by maybe having a warning sign show up whenever adverts are shown that says somthing like warning adverts can subconciously influence your later desicions or something like that

id find that more helpful than banning children stuff adverts
",13
5163,today many companies advertise their products ,11
5164," on television 
this is a good idea because the companies can reach a great amount of audience with this method but should these advertisements be allowed for young children of the age of 

on one ",16
5165," the children are to young to understand that they can not have everything that is displayed on advertisements on tv if they see toy in an advertisement they automaticaly want to have it this puts great pressure on their parents because they do not want to dissappoint their children
in conclusion the young audience is used as a huge marketing strategy the companies put their advertisements for child toys only on the tv channels that are watched by children and not on the channels watched by the parents ",2
5166," they are the one who have to buy the toys the companies aim on purpose for the innocence and naivity of the children

on the other ",20
5167," there are alot children who do not put their parents under pressure and gentely ask them wether they can have the toy in the advertisement or not the major part of the childrens behaviour depends on parenting and on the caracter of  the child it is the bad parenting for he kids that shoult be blamed and not the advertisements on tv
in addition many children do not even watch the advertisement because they are annoyed by them the advertisement interrupt their favourite series and are considered annoying and unuseful by the children

in my opinion the advertisement should not be banned but somehow reduced also the parenting should be adapted to the digital generations this means that the parents should be able to say no whe a child asks them the hole time about new and expensive toys and should not spoil their children this way the children will get less effected by the advertisements and the parents do not spend to much money",14
5168,"chewinggums sweets toys and many more products that trigger young childrens wishes are broadcasted everyday on hundreds of different tvchanels but is it moraly correct to try influencing these young children at that age already 

young children receive information different and their conciousness is not ",2
5169, far developed to resist sublimental influences they start to think they need these good ,3
5170, just wanting them many adults even are easily influenced and manipulated by media and the effect on children is significantly bigger this influence leads to a diminishing of choices the child can do on its own ,7
5171," the preset ideas are already made up by television and can only be changed hardly 
another important ",10
5172, are the parents of a certain spout as the influence becomes bigger over time of consumation of these media parents should actively control the amount of time children are allowed to spend with television and media if this generally were the case as it clearly isnt in many of todays households advertising would have a smaller impact on these children and ,14
5173," could be tolerated more 
as a conclusion id say it is not toleratable to direct adversiting toward young children and should ",12
5174, be prohibited by law or be reduced by the companies broadcasting them media can be usefull in some cases like news and documentals but in this case it just isnt changing anything for the good as they teach the children to obtain a materialist mindset which is already too widespread in todays society,17
5175,"the question here is should it be allowed that televison advertising be   aged  it is something that concern a lot of people almost parents who are interested how they children should get adults 
the ",13
5176, de advertisement would be allowed  that mostly the shops or the people behind the advertisement who are trying to sell something could better do this than young children are simple to manipulate because if they see something in the televison the want to have it so the parents have to buy it because they want to see their children happy the ,13
5177," could be if young children can choose if they want to watch an advertisement or not they could influence that 
on the other ",13
5178, for example children aged  are kids and they do not really think about what they do or watch on the television they just want to play and have fun and do not think that they become manipulated of any advertisement an other ,17
5179," young children watch to much television they can end up being alone all the time and do not have any friends or other hobbies they forget that it exist an other world outside and they might become unreliable at school 
but who say that children aged  even should watch televison and ",17
5180," young children should live their life as a child and play a lot with their friends being outside if they want to rest for a time alone they could read a book or something like that but they should not spend too much time watching televison and get manipulated of different advertisement 
for conclusing ",1
5181, that children aged  are too young for television or ,17
5182, using to often applications on the smartphone they should not be confrontated as young kids because they do not know always what they really want or need and what they just want to have ,24
5183,"in this text im going to write about a difficult topic named advertising it includes the discussion whether direct advertising should be allowed for children aged to to five or not

in my opinion advertisments at children aged  should be allowed but it should be seperated and limited also the firms have to check what theyre going to advertise in their spots and ",16
5188, the parents have to watch their children more carefully and protect them     ,7

5190, includes the television channels for children but is that ok should the children aged  see advertising ,14
5191," for expensive toys

one important ",20
5192," for advertising  is that the advertises would be fitted for the children that means that advertise which are shown on tv channels for adults wouldnt be shown on the kids channels so the children would only see things that are interesting for them that could be advertises for other tvshows or interesting and new toys 

an ",0
5193, against these topic is that advertises ,11
5194," for toys these toys are always shown better than they really are children up to five are not smart enough to get these advertising tricks they always belive what they see or hear with this intention the advertising companys use the kids to sell their the product they advertise for

in my opinion television advertising should be forbidden on tvchannels made for children up to seven or eight years after this age most of the children are intelligent enough to get the clue behind the advertise the companys want to sell their products and often show them perfect ",14
5195, that every child should have on of these so ,8
5196, with the topic that television advertising  should not be allowed,15
5197,"essay
 
the topic of this essay will be should children from the age of  have direct contact to the television to advertise childs with television or should that be forbidden

the television is some you find in every house every appartment or even in a camping trailer noone want to miss something exciting happen in another part of the world but televion is ",17
5198, for informing everybody about the newest topics it ,23
5199," should entertain and teach you in several things 
but they arenâ´t only adults watching the tvtelevision there are ",6
5200, childs  wathing even the ones who are two years old and many critice want to change that they think that the children will get silly ,12
5201," they are whatching tv at that young age and that they should play in the garden to grow up like they did
but do really get more silly ",24
5202, you are wthing tv no because their is no proof for such an argument and ,21

but they are ",6

5206, they just let them sit in frotn of the tv and do theire job with homeoffice that is not ok children like wahtching the tv and this is okay but the parents need to showup some borders and let their kids know that their is time for tv and time for somthing else like sport or reading a book these two things are ,17
5207," important for kids and their need to be a mixture between all things a child need to grow up just like it ever has been the only thing that changed is that with the tv there is a new option to get childs something to know but it shouldnâ´t be over used because that could leed to adiction and children can not use their time for sport or somthing like that

all in all you can say tv as a tool for children to learn someting and for their advertaisement is okay except it is not over used and ",17
5208," it should not be forbidden


 ",12
5209,"should television not be allowed toward young children at the age 
there are a lot series for young girls and boys at the television there are different kinds of television shows for childrens in this age so that there are shows that amuse the boys and girls and ",17
5210," there are shows that teach them something like the show dori on nickelodion 
at the one ",6

5214, that the girls and boys like to watch them this kind of show is good for the kids to teach them some ,6
5215, thre school starts the television might be something like a ritual in the lifetime of a children a lot of children in germany watch sandmã¤nnchen and ,17
5216, go to sleep often the whole familie watch this kind of series ,1
5217, that the children have a good time with his or her familie this shows and series are forever in the heads of the children and may they will watch it with teir children and ,6
5218," on the tv is a important thing for them
at the other ",1
5219," there are a lot series that are just for fun and the children just watch them because they have nothing else to do the children just watch this series and dont go outside this is not good young children need a lot of sport to grow up good and healthy 
another ",6
5220, is that the language in series for children ist often grammatically not right ,8
5221," that the young girls and boys learn it wrong a good example for this is the serie teletappi 
so ",8
5222, television in the young age isnt that bad the parents of the children just have to look that the kids don other things like meeting friends and play outside it is ,17
5223," good to look what kind of shows the children watch and that the kids not got addictet to them if the television is used just at some times and not the whole day it is a good thing 
in my opinion some of the series for young children should be forbitten because they are a kind of weird and not helpfull for the growing up from young children but the television should not completly be forbitten for them",17
5224,today the television advertising is directed to all people no matter how old they are those advertisings have a big influence on what we buy or what we wish to have i remember as i was a child i used love the things which were presented in the television because they seemed extremely magical but ,14
5225," got them theyre less special
one downside of television avertising toward joung children is that as soon as they see all those cool toys they start to want more and more which their parents maybe cant afford and nor the children neither the adults are happy with heir situation another contra is that the toys always look more special in the television advertising than they are in real i remember to be very sad ",20
5226, i realised that its not the same as it is in the television for example as i wished for a farm from playmobile the animals werent that realistic as they were in the advertising and ,6
5227," youre a child you expect exactly the same because you dont have this knowledge which is essential 
a big disatvantage is that there are ",8
5228, advertisings for weapons which are called nerf and ,11
5229," its only a toy it can cause harm 
for sure there are ",4
5230, like the promotion of the firms their products are better sold and their income is highly raised anyway the whole awareness to the firms which present their things in the television is raised the ,10
5231," about television advertising  is that they know better what to wish for and its easier for their family to find a good present for their birthday or for christmas 
to come to a conclusion ",10
5232, that television advertising shouldnt be prohibited because the fims have to promote their products to make money but it should be presented more realistic,15
5233,"the major issue that this type of advertising comes up with does mostly relie on the parents and not directly on the children 
sure the children watch these adâ´s but the parents ",16
5234," buy the products the adults should be aware of what their kids actually need the parents may have some problems with their child if it really wants this product toy or whatever but the parents are the ones with the power of the decision they make
a positiv ",20
5235," that might appear through the advertising on television could be that the adults get information about new products for their children which could actually support or help them they might get to know about aout the reason because of which their baby is crying there once was an commercial which dealed with a special kind of illnes about which most people dont know about
another ",0
5236, which should be mentioned referring to this statement is the ,21
5237," that many children with this age dont even watch tv these advertisement can not actially reach that many viewers and if it should be the case that kids watch these commercials they propably wont be able to understand the content they cant hanlde these information 
in conclusion ",16
5238, that this type of co0mmercials should not be allowed ,15
5239," that they wont have a major impact and if there should appear some problems referring to whishes the kids have their parents should hanlde these little problems
in addition to that i ",12
5240, think im not able to argue and judge about that statement  because im not really influencend and i dont watch tv that often,17
5241,many parents who are out of their nervs or are just busy let their young children sitting in front of the television they are watching series for children and they can learn from the characters which are shown there with series for kids they can early learn how to count numbers or they learn to write a word but out of this is television really good for them maybe they find out how to change the programm and ,17
5242, they are watching a movie or a serie which are not allowed for their age also they can be influence by different spots on the television maybe there is a spot for a new candy or something like that ,1
5243, the children want to have it they want the candy ,20
5244, much that they are get on the nervs of their parents they buy them the candy because they does not hear that anymore and the child is happy but ,24
5245," the child watch another spot maybe for a teddy bear the want to have the bear maybe the parents are buying the bear too but in time they are realize that the child wants more and more not every  child is like in the example but it can happen

finally ",20
5246, that children from the age  should not be allowed to watch television at this age it is easy to influence their mind because they believe what is saying in the television on the other ,13
5247, the parents have a reason to let their kids watching television and they are watching over their children ,17
5248, they can not change the program or something like that it is their own decision to let their children watching child series on the television,17
5249,young children are very easy to manipulate which many advertisers take ,16
5250, of colourful commercials with loud music and fun settings are everything you need to get an infants attention but is it fair to take ,16
5251, of a small childs impressionable minds nowadays many parents will sit their children in front of a tv ,17
5252, get a break the young ones sit quietly easily entertained ,24
5253, seconds ago they were having a temper tantrum it is an easy ,19
5254," that doesnt require much effort 

many times as a child i remember wanting the useless toy advertised on tv my father would always reply to my wishes with scorn well knowing that i would lose interest quickly today i know that he was probably right 

advertising is unacceptable in many cases for children ",20
5255, as adults grown ups are ,8
5256, easily manipulated as children but we just do not notice ,7
5257, it is done in a more sublte manner ,21
5258," with the statement that television advertisement made for two to fiveyear olds should be forbidden because it is bad for the children

in the time of digital media television became a big part of our lives parents quickly get annoyed by their children and let them watch tv for hours companies use this to make advertisements directed to little kids in this young age it is hard for them to spererate between want they need and really want or want someone told them they need they canâ´t make decisions by their own and directed television advertisement use it to sell stuff ",13
5259, toys that the kids will play with once and never again they see funny advertisements with other happy kids and screams for their mummy to buy them the same toy most parents ,20
5260," they will buy the advertised product to make their child happy and quiet after some time the house gets stuffed full of toys that nobody plays with because it is not as nice as it seemed to be and the kids didnâ´t really wanted it it is just something that somebody from the commercial told them to buy

after all those advertisemets should not be allowed because it is not okay to use the childish mind of a fiveyear old to make profit this is not humane  ",2
5261,"the following essay refers to the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed tv advertisement directed  is a very controversial topic

",15
5262, to the statement because exspecially young children are easy to impress for example an andvertisement for a new toy could have a very big impact on the kids it could be possible that they really want to have the toy advertised in the tv because it impressed them and if they donâ´t get it they are very sad also it is possible that the cildren are going to be even more addicted to the tv because they like to see all the new things they could own the ,0
5263," against tv advertising directed  would be the pressure for the parents it means that the children are going to ask their parents to buy the things they saw in the advertisement now the parents are under a lot of pressure because they have to decide if they are going to buy the stuff of the advertisement or if they arenâ´t going to buy it 

summarizing i can say that tv advertising  is a very controversial topic and itâ´s not easy to decide to allow or to not allow but i definitely thing it would be better for young children and ",13
5264, for their parents if it would be forbidden,12
5265,"many young children are watching tv every day now some critics have raised that television advertising  should not be allowed 

an ",14
5266," for television advertising  is that it is not different from an advertisement in a magazine or on a paper children get informed about new things which they can play with and with the advertisement they get an idea of what wishes they have for their birthday or for christmas
an ",0
5267," against television advertising for young children is that the concerns use their fantasy and the influence they have on their parents to sell their toys it is much easier to make a child want to buy something than to influence an adult and the concerns know this too
another ",13
5268, against is that the concerns use unrealistic figures for their advertising their toys ,2
5269," dragons or unicorns young children can not know that these figures do not exist because thy are just too young and do not have any life experience the television advertising could give them a wrong knowledge about the world because they start to believe in dragons unicorns witches and many unrealistic figures more

all in all you can say that television advertising  should not be allowed because it influences them too much and makes them believe in things that do not exist ",14
5270,young children get fascinated way faster than older people do often they see things they like and than they want them immediately they do not consider if they really need something or if they just want to have them because it looked cool in the television so if they see an advertising they like they go to their parents to ask if they could go and by it as many parents can not restist to fullfill their childrens wishes they have to go and buy the stuff sometimes the children literally have to beg their parents to buy it ,2
5271," it is really unnecessary or they do not even need it 

in my opinion you can not say that it should not be allowed because than the parents would have to forbid their children to watch television and we all know that this is never going to happen but ",12
5272," many companies nowadays try to promote their new products by showing them in the television it is a very good thought of them because everybody who owns a television is able to see those advertisings  and who gets easier fascinated than young children

of course there will always be people who say that it should not be allowed because it is not fair for the parents to disappoint their children if they will not buy the things shown in the television i do can understand those people but ",14
5273, you just have to let your children watch television and we have to consider that there are ,17

5298, with the statement that television advertising  children aged  should not be allowed they are two young to see the difference between television and reality and its easy to manipulate them to get money apart from the ,13
5299, that too much television is not good for children ,17
5300," for the ones making it
 ",18
5301, with the statement that television advertising  age 25 should not be allowed in the followed essay ,15
5302, is that the age of a human do not matter in this case because in every age you were influenced by new technologies and media ,24
5303, advertisements in the internet every group of age watch tv inclusive the advertisement between two shows and is there really a difference its not the case that children in this young age watch more tv than their parents ,14
5304," they did not get a higher influence 

my ",19
5305, negative that the kids see advertisements they can ,16
5306, decide what they wanted for their ,9
5307," it is in a way much easier for the parents to get presents if the kid has an idea what he wants to get and which things he could like in the other case the parents did not know what the kid would make feel happier

my ",9
5308, is that the young children could want things which are showed in the television advertisements but they can not buy them the decision take the parents and if they did not like her child to get the new bobby car they did not get it simply in general the childrens want the newest things which are cool and if all the other kids in the kindergarten have it automatically they want it too its not an influence by the advertisement ,2
5309," it depends on what the kids are interested in and that they do not want to be an outsider or something like that 

my fourth ",24
5310," is that the kids learn that they can not get everything they want if the parents decide not to get her kid the newest sneaker it learns that it can not get everything and it could be helpful for their life if they would always get what they want they would maybe become a snob and maybe a little bit to selfconfident it would not be good for their personality 

summarized ",8
5311, its not good to say that the advertisement should not be allowed for only children aged  in some cases the advertisements even help the children and if it should be forbidden ,16
5312," it should be for every group of age 

",8
5313,"the following essay is about the question if the television should or shouldnt advertise stuff directed to children between the age two and five 

my opinion is that the statement shouldnt be allowed the biggest problem with young children is that they completely miss their childhood ",13
5314, watching tv all day with the power of the advertise they want to have whatever they see on the screen young children cant understand the neccessary and the needs of the ,2
5315," games or toys they wont stop wanting stuff they dont need just because they see an advertise about other kids who love to play with the stuff children in this age can get really annoying and most of them wont stop crying until the get what they want

that leads us to another problem with the advertising focused on young children theyll stop apprecciate the presents and toys they already have or get theyll start wanting more and more and this will damage their character and the raising

another reason against television advertising towards young children is watching tv at all in the century of the technology most people or children are watching tv playing computer games or chatting online the whole day especially the younger generations have problems with the consum and year by year more people join the hype the damage for younger people is higher and stronger than for older people that is another problem they start to live in their own digital world and stop playing with friends outside thatll damage their social life and their character 

all in all television is bad for everyone but younger people are more affected by the risks so ",14
5316, that it shouldnt be allowed to advertise directly towards young children and maybe its for the best that they shouldnt watch tv at all thisll raise their social life and improve the relationship between parents and children and ,13
5317, theyll raise up with an healthy handeling for the technology   ,3
5318,"television advertising s young children should be banned

in the the year 2016 television has become a normal thing in most housholds the quality and variaty of programms are better than ever ",14
5319," it is no surprise that many people from all ages spend much time in front of the tv it all starts at a very young age what do you do if your child doesnt stop weeping the corresponding answer of the 21st century you put it in front of tv but this might harm the child in ways the parents might not even be aware of the things the child sees on tv might be explicit or the advertising might harm them

the brain of such young children is not developped ",17
5320, important that they get good imputs from their surrounding ,8
5321," develop if the child now comes in contact with an advertising that might block the learning process of more important things for the child 
then the question arises why should there be ads dirceted to such young children at all 
at this age children can hardly make something out of the things they hear on tv and ",14
5322, they can do you really want that the ,19
5323, word your children says is playmobil this age group makes up only a split of the people who watch tv adults are rarely interested in the same things as childs  ,6
5324, if they really want to advertise it there ,11
5325," are better methods

on the other ",21
5326, are worse things which can be advertised on tv and some children might even learn some words or anything from the advertisement because if those ads are directed directly at them they might pay more attention ,14
5327," they may not pay any attention at all at alternative imput sources like books

i ",3
5328, that for the most children those advertisings are harmful and i ,16
5329, hate to watch those ads because if you arent it that specifc age group it is really hard to find those ads interesting at all,11
5330," discuss the statement television advertising  should not be allowed often the television advertising for children are for toys or games 

in my opinion the statement is right because young children ",13
5331, children between two and five years are too young to understand what the television advertising would like to say also young children can not differ between right or wrong an other ,2
5332, for the statement is that kids are very easy to influence they get easier excited ,7

the ",16

every advertising can change our life if they say that beef is bad you can ",10
5370, and you will try to stop eating beef in a young age we are really easy to be influenced by advertising or somthing like that especially in toy advertising in tv many childreen will say that they want this toy because the kids which are playing with this toy looks very happy and looks that they have a lot of fun this is an strategy of the big toyfirms itâ´s really good for the firms because they get profit of the young kids who wants this toy on the ofter ,4
5371, itâ´s relly bad for the parents because young childreen allways want everything and if the advertising looks really good with a lot of colours happy kids and maybe toys which are living in the advertising want that this costs a lot of money for the parents and if the parents say  no you wonâ´t get this toy  the childreen will be very sad the advertising have to influence the people who watch it ,14
5372, for young people itâ´s extra coloured in pink green red ,18
5373," the firms will get the attention of the young kids but if the advertising is forbidden the firms have to close and stop producing their products the most of the firms in the world life from their advertising without this advertising a lot of people wonâ´t know that maybe hotâ´wheels exists

5374, that the advertising shouldnâ´t be forbidden because the most firms lives from the advertising and only with an advertising the firm will get the attention of the kids so why should it be not allowed  there is no illegal strategy ,13
5375,buy it  youâ´ll be happy or you absolutly need it to survive are well known slogans which you can hear everyday ,23
5376, watching tv most of us think that they are resistant to those slogans which wannt to make you think that you absolutely need this or that new proeudkt but what about little children it is ,2
5377," eays to influence a child from letâ´s say  years old shoud television advertising  young people not be allowed anymore

",13
5378, itâ´s very important to show your child that it doesnt need too much to survive or better to be lucky its important to explain and show them that it doesnt always need the latest things from tv if you did a good job and explained this to your ,17
5379, the risk to be influenced by this is not that much anymore but never the less is it okay to show advertising which is  young kids ,16
5380, it shoud be illegal at ,18
5381, because little kids canâ´t buy thereselfs somethink like a 16 years old could so if a kid wants this one puppy the adults have to buy and pay it ,9
5382, itâ´s not okay to use the wishes of children made by advertising to earn money becuase it is way to easy to convince a child that it wants this or that if you show an advertising to a child in which you use sentences like it makes you happy or youâ´ve always wanted or some videos of lucky kids it influnces the kids and make them to want something if you show advertising like this maybe for a smartphone to young man from 20 30 ,16

i wounâ´d forbit or allow advertising directed to kids iâ´d go a ",13
5390, way making a compromise in my opinion it should be allowed to show maximal 5 minutes advertising during a programm made for kids it shoud be a change of serie and advertising like half an hour tv and ,14
5391, 5 minutes advertising iâ´d say it should ,11
5392, be forbidden to say certain sentences like you barely want this these are tricks which a little kid canâ´t understant ,8
5393," it wantâ´s this
but never the less such a reform will never be allowed by the man who run tv",10
5394,the question wether television advertising directed to the group of  year old children should be allowed or should be denied splits the opinions of parents and socialogy professors an ,13
5395, against this kind of advertising is the ,11
5396, that children get influenced by these pictures and start to annoy their parents and to show of their superiority over other children by comparing their toys and games with such a young age you arenâ´t able to reflect wether the toy is good or bad because bright colours and funny music influence your brain to tell your parents to buy that specific toy even if actually playing with the toy isnâ´t funny at all or might be boring the good advertising shows of the perfect toy that you need to have on the other ,20
5397, you should ask the question why children at the age of two or even five years are watching advertising on television parents should care about their childrens behaviours and should be able to stop them from doing things they donâ´t want them to do if you donâ´t allow advertising for this group of children you are actually censoring the television by denying concerns to show of their products which is against the freedom of speech you ,13
5398, influence the market and are responsible for huge drops of the soled numbers of toys in my opinion the state should not influence the market and should allow the television advertising as a coparision you would have to ban all movies shows and advertising from television that could influence children in a bad way watching advertising for toys is ,2
5399, a lot better than watching parents to have an ,9
5400, so last but not least the parents should be responsible for everything they donâ´t want their kids to see they should decide if their four year old boy should watch television ,12
5401," playing with his friends and if he watches television which channels he is watching


















",1
5402,"if advertising should be allowed in all kind of tv channels is a question people keep discussing about
some say it does affect our choices influences us in our thinking and has a negative impact on the watchers the influence they get through watching tv on a regular basis is unmanagable experts think
on the other ",15
5403, they get influenced by in a negative way the fun ,3
5404," is bigger for them
however a topic which is even more discussed is if it should be allowed to direct television advertising towards young children in the age of 
as always the opinions are splitted
in the following the given topic will be discussed and analyzed 

for many parents tv is a helpful thing their kids sit in front of it being amused and enjoying themselves ",14
5405, the parents have time for other activities in a household with a working mum ,9
5406, this could be really destressing coming from work ,18
5407, having laundry to do television is something that holds a helpful ,1
5408," activity for their kids
the children themselves mostly enjoy watching tv relaying to their heroes or simply experiencing other values
even advertisements are topics or almost shows kids like to see if its the new barbie an other toy or a chocolate cookie tv holds a variety of things children love or would love to purchase that seems like something really positive 
they get to experience a lot of different themes and topics ",17
5409," that they kind of get an idea of life outside their homes even if that just might include life in kindergarden or their friends house
also the parents profite from their children seeing a lot of cool things on tv getting them birthday presents ",24
5410," is a lot easier

but ",18
5411, kids in the age of  are willing to believe everything the spectre of advertising has to offer ,0
5412, that they are in a phase where they are easy to influence is the chance which a lot of companies take the youngest are the best clients indirectly ,23
5413," 

parents who already figured that advertising ",0
5414," does not influence their children in a positive way try to hold them away from it
trying to relay to certain images on tv is nothing that is supporting the development of young kids during the time from the age of  they are the easiest to manupulate 
not having ideas being uncreative and more agressive are just some of the negative ",7
5415," that might occur out of the watching of tv advertisements

in my opinion it should be forbidden to influence children by the help of advertising in form of television clips it is not supporting or helpful at all at least not for the development o the children 
companies do get a lot of profit but that is not the ",14
5416, society should focus on raising kids is an important part of society aswell children are the future of society ,8
5417," it should be our wish to raise them the best possible
relaying to others is not a big part of it ",12
5418,nowadays children are used to electronic items like computers televisions etc in this essay ,8
5419, examine the question if advertisement  should be forbitten or not so ,11
5420, give some pro and contra ,21
5421,"

in television there are a lot of different channels made for children as in every channel there is a lot of advertising children ",14
5422, get in contact with advertisement they usually watch advertisements about toys or computer games and more one ,0
5423, is that they are able to look what new toys exist and ,20
5424," they know what toys they would maybe like to have 
furthermore they learn how tu use the new toy they bought because in adverts they often show how other children play with these objects 
thirdly children get new ideas by watching advertisments they become more creative because they learn what sort of things they can use to play and ",0
5425," they are able to invent something new in the way they use their toys

on the other ",20
5426, mention is that children at this early age  should not watch tv at all adverts are showed in tv to make people buy the factorys products so ,14
5427," children watch that they already believe the things the adverts are saying 
moreover it could ",14
5428, be disturbing for the parents of the children the children always ask their parents to buy the new item which can be exhausting for them because it is ,20
5429," a question of the money the family earns in the salary 
lastly the adverts have a big influence on the children because if the children wont get the toy they may behave badly

in my opinion we should not let children watch much tv ",14
5430, not adverts i imagine it must be horrible for the mother that her child keeps asking for a new toy which may is too expensive for them ,20
5431,television advertising  some enjoy the vivid and sometimes funny breaks during a movie or tv show some hate it from the bottom of their hearts as there are ,10
5432, many children who already are allowed to watch specific series and cartoons the advertising which is  those children is booming which ,14
5433," has a big influence on the children is it a good idea to already try to buy little children is it even necessary to get them used to the world full of advertising and desires or should this kind of advertising even be forbidden
well ",16
5434, its true that young children are the ones who learn the most in their daily life they make experiences and learn they get to know many new things and learn   and they get used to our society and learn how to act and react how to behave how to deal with certain situations therefore its absolutely necessary that they already know how society works and a big part of modern society is economy more specific shopping and selling regarding this ,8
5435," its only normal that even very young children already are confronted to advertising and its effects its undoubtedly part of our daily lifes
moreover young children can quickly be the outsider ",16
5436, they dont know the latest toy and trend regarding dolls or lego this makes clear that advertising can ,0
5437," be helpful to integrate children and let them be part of their own world
on the other ",8
5438," it must definitely be mentioned that advertising can be irritating for children especially little children are usually not used to the colourful advertising with speakers who are too loud and too quick and toys which get bigger and more spectacular every time you watch tv advertising can simply be too much for them and disturb their carefree time watching cartoons etc 
furthermore its ",14
5439, sure that advertising makes children want to have more and more toys because they think they need it to compete with other children i know myself that i often wanted to have many things i saw on tv only because they looked sweet or funny ,0
5440, i normally didnt play with such things regarding this ,18
5441, you can say that advertising makes it normal for children to wanttohave which is a developement that causes worries ,0
5442," we think of all the children who havent even enough food to survive it makes children lose their connection to reality
all in all i can say that i know that advertising for children belongs to our society but ",2
5443, it causes the wrong developement and image of our world which can irritate little children too much which is why ,4
5444, that it generally shouldnt be allowed ,21
5445, many advertising in our daily life we are confronted with advertising nearly every single minute in the bus in the morning in the internet during work or even during the break time ,11
5446, we watch a football game on television with our close friends or family but is the advertising ,10
5447, positive for the evolution from the little children aged  in this short essay ,8
5448, for the television advertising  childern is ,0
5449, their is a advertising with toys or attraction eg funparks when there are politic propaganda in child television ,14
5450, it is a problem because children can not difference the good  from the bad things ,7
5451," they are not able to make their own opinion 

a ",3
5452, their is non children advertising in a child television programm the reason for this ,16
5453, is more in an economic way you should not be allowed to make money because of the little children they ,12
5454," live in their own world and we should not disturb them their 

finally ",19
5455, it is better that it should not be allowed to show advertising  aged  it is not fair to give them no choose because they are ,16
5456, to young and maybe to stupid to see the ,3
5457,there are a lot of children in television advertisings ,0
5458, they cant really decide it for themselves their parents are responsible for them and probably ,9
5459, decide if they do it or not of course they probably ask the children but is a child able to make such a decision ,12
5460, everybody knows some decisions of their own childhood they would make differently nowadays so maybe some people would even regret it later that theyve done such an advertising in childhood most of the children ,0
5461, dont know or are not ,19
5462, able to understand what it means to be shown in television so ,6
5463, theres the possibility that the parents decide right fo their child and ,12
5464, give them the money they get for the advertising but i think it shouldnt be allowed those young children cant already decide for themselves but television advertising isnt a thing parents can decide for them children of an age of two cant even speak ,13
5465, its not their own will to make television advertising and ,10
5466, children older than two probably just do it because their parents want it ,24
5467, those young children are just not able to make such a decision they even may regret later in their life because they arent able to understand the meaning of being in the television for me these are the main ,17
5468, for my answer and i ,18
5469," with the statement 
i could understand if there were parents whod need the money but even ",9
5470, it would be the childs decision it cant make because its too young for it there are often parents who decide for their children want them to do things or want them to become famous and i am totally against it ,12
5471,today a lot of people watch a lot of television most of them watch series regularely and everybody of us knows that feel ,6
5472, somebody is pointing with a gun on somebody else the intensity increases and ,18
5473, suddenly an advertising break comes those advertisments are even most of the time absolutely boring and ,11
5474," face 50 year old people or children this leads us to the following question should television advertising directed to children be allowed or not

there should be a free market which allows everybody advertising their group of aim with their news about their products it would not be fair if you cant advertise directed  because the companys who produce things for young children would have an enourmous drawback to other companys who can advertise freely
there would ",16
5475," be the question where the borderline is and what advertising is  or not 

on the other ",11
5476, you can say that children cant think all that rationally as grownups can do little children often dont know what they really need and what isnt necessary they see a product once in an advertisement and ,24
5477, they really want it if it is fairly affordable kids ,9
5478," dont use the things they bought or they only use them for a very short period what makes it sort of a waste of money 

you may now think this wouldnt be all that tragic because children have parents that pay attention that they wott buy all that much thing they dont need but ",9
5479," often kids can controll their parents pretty well and by threaten them yby doing certain things they often get what they want parents often cant say no because its the child they want to make happy and the one they love 

generally it wouldnt be fair concerning the free market and such a changes impact on it but morally one has to say that its ",9
5480, not all that fair to influence their customers the parents trough their children ,9
5481,"television advertising is important to get your products on the market its the same procedure for everyone children aged tow to five years included but should it be allowed to advertise products for young children on television

young people cant understand that advertises arent real or show things which are not as right as they see it a child cant protect itself from television advertising it will be influenced by the things said and doesnt understand that it doesnt need the things etc 
also a child that age is normally accomanpied by its parents but parents arent able to watch every show with their child or to basically be there every minute it is possible that the child will be afraid ",14
5482," what it has seen during the advertises other emotions are possible too how should the parents know it comes from the advertisements on tv 
another problem is the inability of a child to draw a line between realitys and fiction the advertisements may confuse it some more or promises things which cant be fulfilled for the child so ",2
5483," the child may be unhappy or sad because its parents cant fulfill its dreams or arent able to buy the things the main aim of products is the happiness of their buyers
on the other ",2
5484, the market for products for children is really big enterprises have to have the right to promote their products or they will not have the chance to grow enterprises are as important as children for our future and they cannot survive if they arent able to sell their products beacause of missing advertising there is no other possibilty than to do television advertisements because you can be sure that people ,0
5485," children will watch it 
moreover ",6
5486," it is forbidden to do advertisements on tv for children aged 2 to 5 where should you draw the line not all people can understand the meaning of advertisements and react to it like child when you start to not allow advertisements for children you will end up with forbibben advertisments for adults as i already said companies need to promote their products and that is not possible without tv advertising
also it isnt the companies obligation to protect the children from the bad thing in the world it is the exercise for their parents and if they allow their children to watch tv they know there will be adverts enterprise shouldnt be punished for missing parents

to conclude it isnt easy to say if television advertisingfor young children should or shouldnt be allowed ",13
5487, companys need the right to advertise their products to everyone even children they will soon learn that televison is not the reality and that they cant get everything they want ,13
5488," discuss whether television advertising s young children aged  should be allowed or not
advertising ",13
5489," influences the person watching it by telling how great the product is and how useful it would be for them 

often there are wrong information or the advertisement exaggerates
especially for children this could be kind of dangerous because they are easier to influence and  believe in things faster than adults children dont think about the pro and contra ",0
5490, of a product they just see it and see how nice it is and ,3
5491, they want to have it mostly it seems to be fun but ,3
5492," have it its not half as good as it was shown in the tv
that is the main negative ",6
5493, children are disappointed quickly and because advertising often doesnt tell the truth its most likely to disappoint children that ,2
5494, causes that the kids want to have the ,24
5495, thing because it might be better than the ,18
5496, one they have no doubts that the ,19
5497, product could be as bad as the ,23
5498," one and thats what the companies use its highly questionable how enterprises use the behaviour and the development of children they know that the children want to have all these things and they know that the advertising wouldnt show the truth they act calculating on children who just dont know better

but you ",2
5499, can say that the parents dont have to buy the things the child sees and ,9
5500," that there is a little protection for them
according to the exaggeration and wrong information it is important for children making their own experiences they should see for theirselves that the tv does not always tell the truth and that they are not always protected by mom and dad who watch over them and tell them what is good and what isnt
but at last it is way too early making these experience aged  however the children should ",17
5501," have the freedom to experiment a little and to test how cool the products really are

for conclusion id say that advertising s young children is okay it should be more precise and it should be proved that the information given in the tv are true but ",14
5502, its an experience for the children and they should have the space to test some things they see in the tv,17
5503,advertisment here advertisment there in the television on the radio or on the street ,11
5504, we all know it we have to ask us is it good or helpful for us or do they just want our money we are ,23
5505," influenced by advertisnig we do not really recognize it 
in the following part i discuss the question whether television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
we all know young children are ",13
5506, fascinated of television phones and this kind of stuff when they are confronted by televison advertising is the danger that if they watch ,10
5507, an advertisment for some kind of toys that the children want that toy and more and more and ,0
5508, the parents can not say yes to everything ,9
5509, they dont understand with their young age why these children in the televison are allowed to have this toy and not they furthermore ,20
5510, against television advertisng should be allowed for young children is that you often see things which is not for the eyes of children with  years ,13
5511," advertisment for ciggarets condoms alcohol or whatever they are too young for this stuff and would not understand the world anymore because this all is new for them
but ",16
5512, advertisment is not just bad and that is it the things what i have written in the ,11
5513, many children which can not taken the content of advertising in their mind they dont realize what they are watching these young kids are just fascinated of the colours which are changing all the time on the monitor ,0
5514, it depends on the child,8
5515,nowadays the world is full of modern techniques smartphones or computers which make everything easier the people think so itâ´s nothing special ,23
5516," you see a small boy playing on his smartphone the whole day anyway heâ´s not even in high school i donâ´t think that this is something normal because itâ´s much to early for using smartphones in such a young age
so ",24
5517," televison advertising  shold not be allowed 
of course the young kids grow up with this modern communication smartphones and televison like the generation ",15
5518," grew up with something else which was typical in their time another poinjt is that they will get used of all these computers and smartphones anyway only a few years later  
despite ",24
5519, that the age of  is much too early to watch tv itâ´s really bad for their concentration this is something adult people realize twhen they use their smartphone ,17
5520, the time runs and you donâ´t really realize that ,18
5521," chatting or srcolling through facebook the concentration suffers a lot with all the social media 
especially young children are ",1
5522," in their head and watching several tv series with funny characters isntâ´t really helpful in this time 
of course some stuff in tv they can learn something from wonâ´t be that bad and maybe they understand it a little bit better because of pictures noises or special characters the problem is that children  arenâ´t even able to read in this age ",6
5523," they are able to read a book
",8
5524, that children should be able to read ,8
5525," that the television doesnâ´t even need to produce a programm for young children 
",6
5526,"there are multiple reasons why television advertising s young children should be allowed or not
some might say it should not be allowed because children are much easier to manipulate than adults and ",14
5527, it comes to advertising for a product a different opinion could be that certain products that are made for young children need to be advertised directly towards them ,13
5528, that they know that it exists in the ,3
5529, place and have a chance to form their own opinions and decide whether they want it or not if ,12
5530, christmas is coming up and the parents ask their children what they wish for and they do not even know what their options are it could be hard for them to decide what to wish for on the other ,9
5531, children from age  are very young and most of the time they ,24
5532, already know what to wish for bacause maybe one of their friends owns a toy they like or maybe they saw something in a store so most of the time it seems like they do not need advertisment on television to find out about certain things because there are a lot of other ways to do ,0
5533," 
another arguement against advertisment for children on television could be that children of that age should not be watching television very much ",14
5534, but instead they should be playing outside or with friends this would ,1
5535, there are not a lot of children watching television all the time the ,17
5536, of advertising on that particular platform would become obsolete most of the time kids will not pay attention ,16
5537, the commercial breaks come on because they are only waiting for their show to start again for those reasons the advertisments on television might not be profitable for the companies making them also it is not right to start manipulate a kids mind in that way at this very young age it is bad enough that adults are manipulated with advertising on television or anywhere else but the big difference is that most of the time they can choose or differ from ,14
5538, they are not children are not able to see the difference ,7
5539, easier to trick into thinking they need a particular toy ,20
5540, think they really need something ,19
5541," in reality they do not 
in conclusion ",19
5542, that advertising s young children does more harm ,16
5543, should not be allowed the reasons against it overweigh the ,12
5544, that young children need to be informed about products because there are other ways to do that other than commercials and most of the time the parents are the ones who really know what is best for their child not a commercial on television,2
5545,"should television advertising  yound children not be allowed
many people argue about this question if young children should be directed by television advertisingand this is a very important theme because children in the age  years are in the state where they get to learn and start getting used to a specifichome
in my opinion televison advertising diricted toward yound children should not be allowed because ",14
5546," children in this age should not spend that much time in front of the television
first  the advertising which probably will be about toys and games which are avaible in toystores  and this could be an effect why children begin to crave on having these things and wanting all the toys also ",17
5547, that these television advertising which is  the kids has the effect that children start liking to watch more the television because there are things shown in which they are interestred and in my ,14
5548," of view kids should not watch a lot oft time  often tv in this age
in the other ",17
5549," that the television advertising is somehting very important for the companies to win costumers and the attention of the people
if the television advertising is direceted to childrens in the age of   the companies will get exactly the result which is that the kids see the products  they are probably interested in and want to get and buy them
but ",14
5550," children in this ages should not be influensed by the companies and the television advertising 
the main reason for  me why this the advertising should  not be direceted toward children is  that children in this ages should not get to many ideas of something to buy and something to get  ",13
5551, this is the goal of every companie but this does not have a positive effect on the childrens behaviour and ,12
5552, not on their interests because normally children should not me watching tv the whole day  ,17
5553," this they should be playing outside 
espacially in this ages children get really really quickly influensed by something and they are in the part where they start to lern

to sum this up  television advertising  children should not be allowed
",14
5554,we see advertisements no matter where we go only by switiching on the television or walking through the city we are influenced by any kind of advertisements our children are ,11
5555, affected by this and they are ,19
5556," influenced by advertisments but this is nothing to be afraid of 

nowadays it is a common thing to let your child watch television or to let it use an ipad ",17
5557," there are a lot of advertisements in the background
it is true that children have fun ",16
5558, watching advertisements which are directed to people their age because they usually contain things that makes children want that specific product mostly those products are connected to unhealthy food ,2
5559, it can be dangerous if young children start eating too many unhealthy meals just because they are influenced by advertisements on the other ,4
5560," have the control over what their children eat and they can easily control this 

furthermore you can mostly see some speaking animals experiencing adventures ",7
5561, using that special product that should attract a child ,0
5562, it harldy happens that television advertising for children contains violence even ,14
5563, they get influenced by young age and they might force their parents to only buy a specific kind of product because they prefer it ,2
5564, having seen the advertisement many times the main power ,11
5565," remains with the parents 

in my opinion television advertisting for young children is not something to be afraid of because ",13
5566, parents control what children buy and what they eat there is no danger for me it is evident that anything can be dangerous to children but that is ,4
5567, the reason why they have parents to look ,9
5568, them and to make sure that they do not spend too many hours a day in front of a television and ,1
5569,since we use television any things have changed people spend a lot of time watching tv ,10
5570," older people spend time watching tv some parents let their children watch tv no matter how old they are how long they watch it or what they watch but is it really a good idea to let children of the age of two years watch horror movies

the age between two and five years is the age in which children learn a lot of things it is important to show them the life in different kind of ways how they could learn to communicate or to talk or how to behave ",17
5571," being with other people it is important to let them ask all the questions they have to be curious and to make experiences
on the one ",8
5572, it can be good for them to watch tv because they could learn something from the movies but ,17
5573, most of the movies dont show the reality ,6
5574, it is possible that the children learn things which are exactly the opposite than in reality ,7
5575," they can make great mistakes
but on tv there are documentaries or news which show the real things that have happened for the children it can be interesting to see what happens in the world outside ",17
5576," they can be interested in things which they havent never without the tv
but there arent ",17
5577, many films for the youngest watchers many movies are horror movies of which the children can be scared of or maybe get some fears or phobias other movies are too complicated for the young children to understand ,6
5578," that it doesnt make any sense to let them watch them
while watching tv the kids dont move very much they are just sitting around but it is important ",17
5579, for young children to make physical experiences to get to know their own body to make friends and to use their time spending time just watching tv includes nothing of it ,8
5580," for the children

in my opinion it is important that the children go outside watching tv for kids between two and five years should absolutely not be allowed",17
5581,often parents let their children watch television without observation thus these young kids are on their own and can do whatever they want in ,17
5582, many times they are even too young to decide what to watch or to do so they get automatically influid by everything they see ,24
5583," the advertising

 i have often seen short clips about kinder schokolade or about apps which are  this could result a wish of them toward their parents maybe now this kids always ask about choclate and annoy their parents the same situation might happen with a new app which was presented in an advertising although the parents have not given any electronic advice to their children they get to know tablets cell phones and could become a victim of the media society 

an other reason why it should be forbidden could be the health of the children often their brain can not handle all the pictures which are shown in television advertising in worst case their eyes could be harmed maybe they even get a wrong imagination of the world 

at the age of  years they are not able to differate between what is good for them and what is not so everything seem exciting and intersting to them this is not any good influence they are overwhelmed from impressions and irritated at many times young children do not get the message of the adveritsing ",14
5584, it is not usefull i totally ,23
5585, that it should not be allowed ,21
5586,before i take position in this particular case ,21
5587," my liberalism that is based to a certain degree on the theory of freem from john stuart mill who said that the only reason that one man or mankind is allowed to intervention in one mans or a groups doing is to protect itself
either ",21
5588, by producing commercial for young children they get used to our theories of economy ,0
5589, capitalism because children are the consumers of tomorrow they learn that there are maybe some things they want to have but ,9
5590, the have to learn how to deal with labor and with money those lessons are most times learned during their teenage phases but many people will ,9
5591, and say that we should not show our children these highly accepted role models of our society ,12
5592, leftist will hardly oppose of calling young children consumers of tomorrow because the leftifts might think children were naive those people do not want their children to see this role model for society because it is not quiet reality but ,2
5593, you think of the stories the generations ,8
5594, had been listening every eveing in the bed those stories have not been quiet realistic and it might be good this way to give your children the immage of a better world a better future than we live in today and ,8
5595, those movies and tv shows for kids show us a different world that wants to encourage children to use their creativity and immagination but these movies have to be worth their production costs ,6
5596," that they have to show commercial
by forbidding commercial that directs toward young children you enable these young human beings to develop their own position towards the advertised products and you enable these young human beings to speak for themselves i personaly think many people are not aware of how reflected and strong these young human beings are",13
5597," give my opinion about the statement television advertising  agend   should not be allowed 
first off we need to clear that children in the age of 25 do not or are not allowed to watch television in many homes in the most families the parent allow them to watch channels that do not advertise and that are specially made for children that means the switch from one cartoon to another is without advertisments 
the ",13
5598," thing is that children are not able to be manipulated from advertisment if they want toys they say it not matter where in the store or if they watch  television 
it is usally for children that if the see something they want in the television they forget it as soon as the advertisement is over so parents do not have to fear that they will not stop wanting that 

the ",2
5599," thing is that children in the age of two do not understand the adverts adverts that are synchronised are to difficult for children
 
thats why ",16
5600, that there is no need to stop advertising for children because ,13
5601, most of the children do not even see the adverts and ,16
5602, they do not get effected by them,19
5603,"in many families young children in the age of  are watching tv the majority of them are watching advertisment during the movie break 
but are advertisments a quite good influence of these young children
first of all lotâ´s of people support the idea that children have to have as much influences as possible so children learn  much things and can decide very early about many questions because of their knowledge 
in this case parents have to explain the general using of advertisement to their kids 
but itâ´s quite clear that children in the age of  canâ´t understand the using of advertisement 
furthermore young children connect the presented dream world in the advertising with their real life on the one ",14
5604, they arenâ´t confronted with the really hard real world and ,3
5605," they have the opportunity to live and think about the new created dream world
on the other ",19
5606," children canâ´t decide between the dream and the real world and sometimes their life is damaged
thge last ",7
5607, iâ´d like to mention is that young children wants to have all presented products in the advertisment the famalies are confronted with a crying child who really wants to these products companies can easily influence children in this age because of their small knowledge in this case companies sell more and more products ,0
5608, it should not be banned from the television it should be more controlled not banned for example they could make a maximum of minutes advertisements for children can be showen on a channel per day or you could set a time ,13
5609," it can be showen a channel manager can that think if it is really worth it
it is right that this is manipulation and that this kind of adversisements are not good and really unmoral a child could fall easier for an adversisement than an adult but it is the wrong way to ban it it would destroy a hole work sequment and many ppl would lose their jobs it is ",12
5610, the mission of the parents to prove what her child is watching on the television if they do not want her child to watch this they could turn off the tv and do another things with the child or they could teach the child how to avoid getting caught by this type of manipulation advertisements for children are ,17
5611, anywhere else banning just from tv would be really inefficiente u ,15
5612, have to ban it from every other medium that includes such advertisements like the adbanner on roads for example mcdonalds advertisements are placed a few meters in each direktion ,15
5613, a restaurante from mcdonalds to make the children interested and give them enought time to say it to their parentes that is ,8
5614, a harder and more unmoral kind of maipulation because that canâ´t just be turned off,19
5615," discuss the topic whether telivision advertising  should be allowed or not
for it speaks that many children want to have everything they watch in the television advertising and many parents cannot afford every wish they have because ",15
5616, they do not have enough money to buy the toys furthermore children in this age  learn at lot just from looking they see how their parents behave to different situations and imitating them because they think it is right in additon it is the same thing ,20
5617," they are watching television advertisements they see the happy family with a beautiful woman as the mother a succesfull man as father and most of the time a boy and a girl they think it always have to be like this and wondering why it is not like this in their life 
now the reasons why this should be allowed if ",12
5618, about this topic i recognized that there is already television advertising s young children and till now evrey child watched this advertisements and what happend the parents have to say more often no to their children like my parents did furthermore we have to think about the companies they have to sell their toys etc and how it could be better for them ,14
5619," they direct their television advertisements toward young children who wants that toys what they sell
",0
5620, that not allowing the television advertising only helps parents to save money but it does not change the behavour of the children,13
5621, a much discussed theme who does not know those ads where they promise you the world or even more or the new trend getting younger insteead of older seems to be ,23
5622," for those who reach the thirties so what my question would be is should television advertising be allowed in common but thats none of my buisness

the television buisness is not dumb they are aware of their strengths they know that they are able to give a reason to buy something which is in its whole unuseful especially the aged  have no idea about the tricks an advert has in its backpack they will just see the goodlooking new toy in the television and the ",15
5623," thing they will do is to annoy its parents you have to buy me this please mum and dad please

but what if the adverts get used in a proper way in a way that children would learn something for example it would be nice if the adverts could visualise some serious themes as criminality children at this age take much more infos out the pictures than by hearing

another ",16
5624, i do not understand in the statement is the ,21
5625, that it only should be disallowed if it is  ,21
5626, every kind of advert which has no pedalogical effect for the children should be disallowed so ,16
5627," all adverts we all know that this never will happen

so instead the parents have to overtake this part in my eyes they should not let their children watch television adverts and if they watch those adverts they should explain them that this is not the reality furthermore the best thing they could is to prevent the children before they start watching tv the parents should search for a discussion with the children the pedalogical effect would be much more than ",14
5628," the parents would explain them afterwards







",7
5629," answer the question if television advertising  shoudnt be allowed
i only ",15
5630, with this statement in some ,21
5631, i dont think that children in the age of two to 3 should watch any tv at all in that age they ,17
5632, play outside or with normal toys but ,20
5633, they would not have known about these toys without the adverts they see in tv everyday the main problem is what and how much the ads are advertising often there are ads for girls that show babydolls that the little girls can take care about this can be good and bad for example it is very positive that the child is able to learn the ,2
5634, things a bout taking care of something or someone ,18
5635, this would strengthen their feeling for responsibility on the other ,19
5636, could ads like this push these girls in the gender roll of the stay at home housewife the same goes for boys another positive ,11
5637," is that many of the toys really support the process of learning basic stuff like numbers colours or even some letters
a problem ",20
5638, criticize is that there are ,21
5639," ads for childs on the childchannels in tv and in these ads they could see content that is not good for them
",16
5640, that adverts for children are not generally bad ,16
5641," the children can learn a lot of things with the toys they see in the ads


ps this topic sucks",20
5642, there are lots of ads in the tv who direct  if the children look tv they get attracted by this advertisement then they would really like to have this product mostly toys the children are easy to convince if they see a toy and they think its cool they want to have it when i was a child i used to watch tv sometimes i know how that feels ,0
5643," you see a toy in an advertisement and you really want to get this toy thats just manipulative kids are easy to manipulate
",20
5644, youny children in this age shouldnt be watching tv to often anyways the should ,17
5645," go outsiede and play with other children run around and have fun
maybe in these years the children dont even recognize whats going on in the ads perhaps they dont even know whats going on ",16
5646, they watch a film i guess the advertisements direct to older children as a child you just think this toy is awesome i want it you dont mind if you have a hundret of toysevery child would say its a paradies to own ,20
5647," its just all about the money the ads direct to such young people that the company who builds the toys earns lots of money
",20
5648," for and against television advertising  aged  years at the end i will say my own opinion on this theme 

the ",15
5649," thing i can say is that its important to know what advertisments are meant  some ads for cereals or ads for toys as example if its the right ad maybe the kid will have more fun because it didnt even know that something like that existed and than the parents can buy it and get the child a better life 

the problem here is that  ",0
5650, the child see something that it want and theen thee parents dont buy it it will be unhappy ,9
5651," if friends have the thing fromt the ad but the parents are not rich enough to buy it and they kid cant have it

another ",20
5652, against ads for young children is that they cant see whats realistic and good and whats bad its very easyto cahnge the opinion or the view of a kid that is ,16
5653," young and companys or partys could use this to change the view of the kid in there use

a goood ",8
5654," for the ads is that childrencan learn that u cant trust everything you see and need to be critical parents could  teach the kids that not every ad say the truth 

with ads for young children children could be maipulated very easy and thats not good ",0
5655, but thats not a question of allowed or not allowed the companys wanna make profit and thats not there fault the capitalisim force them to try to make profit in my opinion its the foul of the parents to let there childen watch tv without it would be no problem or question of allowed opr not allowed because the children wouldnt even watch them but many parents didnt know what to do with there children and just let them watch tv and get dumb because its easier for them letting the children watch tv ,17
5656, doing something together with the children,8
5657,"in the following text iâ´ll collect some reasons against the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed

",15
5658, that television advertising  should be allowed because itâ´s the role of the parents to say what their children should watch and what they shouldnâ´t watch if they donâ´t want their children to watch advertising in television they have to safed their children against the advert this is not a problem of a brand or the television programm the brands only want to sold out their products and ,13
5659, advertising in televison is a very good strategy of marketing to support their products and in this part of time it is a very normal thing also the children could be in contact with advertising in other parts of their life ,14
5660, in a magazine or at a poster in a city ,11
5661, the brands want to show the toys that the children could get at christmas there nobody can say that it isnâ´t allowed because the most of the brands does it so my opinion is that i ,20
5662, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed when i was younger ,13
5663, at the age of two or three i were not allowed to watch any television and ,17
5664," i was four i were only allowed to watch a programm that didnâ´t show advertising kika 
all in all everybody has to say for their own if it is okay to show young children adverts in television or not if they didnâ´t want that ",14
5665, there children donâ´t has to watch advert in television,14
5666,"
insane advertising or normal funny ads

its totally normal today to have several commercial breaks between your sitcoms or the movies you would like to watch we have adapted to this over the time but its ",10
5667," annoying for lots of people but have you ever wondered about the impact all this ads have on a litte five years old child

its totally clear that the channels couldnt survive in their branche without the advertising companies which are spamming with all sorts of ads the prices for these short and sometimes shitty ads are insane high but they have to work out for the company ",10
5668, they wouldnt do it but most of the advertising companies have no ethic code and would sell everything to the viewers if they could make money out of it but an ad doesnt have the same effect on a litte child like it has the effect on an adult litte children are very sensitive about other opinions so ads full with liars could misslead these young humans on the wrong track and could mess up their real life we can see the reflection of this on the generation which is about ten years old today mostly all of them have a smartphone today and even better most of them are informed about the latest trends and want to have these new trending toys too and what does a litte child without enough money or even without the permisson to buy it do it runs to its mommy and is begging to get this new toy most of the parents get soft ,2
5669, their litte child is crying and ,9
5670, they buy it but it could ,3
5671, go the other way the child could go ,8
5672," a refuse of its parent to a stranger and ask him to buy it or even steal it by it self and all this trouble just because of the groupe pressure to have this toy it may sound like a exaggeration but we cant underestimate the power of groupe pressure on little children
on the other ",20
5673," that the responsibility is with the parents of the children they have to explain their children that it dont need this toy or whatever the advertising companies are trying to sell at the moment so if the parents are doing a good job by protecting their child from stupid ideas and decisions because of all the ads the litte booger will be allright
but there is ",2
5674, which comes with the ads for adult people were talking here about sexual advertising and dating websites which are getting more and more popular these ads arent meant for children but it often happens that a child sees them and some illusions of the shiny friendly world are going to disappear its a big problem ,16
5675," parents are watching a film with their child which starts at lets say eight oclock and in the later commercial breaks the child is going to see some soft porn
there is a very heated debate going on about this issue and there are ",13
5676, existing some laws which wont allow the channels to promote this ads ,15
5677," a certain time but is this enough
for me ",18
5678, i have to say that ,18
5679, i was young that these sort of problem werent really existing ,7
5680, i cant speak about my personal experience but  ,19
5681, is clear that we have to improve the security of our children by invent new laws to shrink the influence of the adver,12
5682,"today i am gonna write about my opinion on if television advertising toward young children in the age of  should be allowed or not
on the one ",13
5683, it is obvious that children can get influenced easier than a normal adult person for example ,7
5684," a children sees some sweets it might just wants his parents to buy him them and if not it would may begin to cry because of that 
another problem could be that there are some advertisements that are not even made for childrens attention and could influence them in a bad way 
on the other ",2
5685," there is to mention that you can not disallow an advertisement for just one explicic target group
in my opinion advertising has to be allowed to be seen by everybody and it should ",15
5686, not exists advertisements that interfluence the behaviour of children and all other target groups in a bad way than that advertisining should not be allowed toward a special target group i ,13
5687, saw a lot of advertisements in my childhood but it had not got such a big influence on me ,0

",19
5689,"everyday people have contact with television advertising and many people say it should not be allowed to direct this advertising towards children under the age of five years
 when children at this very sensitive age see an interesting advertisement they are very interested in it and want to have the product 
for the companys itâ´s easy to win the children as their consumers they make an advertising for television channels ",14
5690, for a barbie the children think they need this toy and ask their parents to buy it of course itâ´s a big ,20
5691," for the company because they know that young children are important main consumers but now itâ´s the question if directed advertising toward children should be allowed
a reason why it should be allowed is that the companys donâ´t  the children to buy the product of the advertisement and the parents could say no also the company has to sale their products and ",16
5692, they produce children toys itâ´s okay to promote it but ,20
5693, children at the age of  are very sensitive and ,24
5694," they see an colorful and interesting advertisement they are leaded to buy this product  

",11
5695, it should not be allowed to make an television advertising  because they are very sensitive and naiv at this age and ,13
5696, they see an advertising with the goal to impress them and lead them to buy the product itâ´s not okay they plant this thought of the new and cool product in their heads and controll them and this should not be allowed,3
5697,in this essay i am writing about the statemant television advertising  aged  shoud not be allowed i am giving some ,15
5698, for and againt this statement ,21
5699, one is if very young children sit every day infron of a tv they dont make sport they dont run outside and look what you can see in the nature and thats bad for the health for example a child who is 10 hours a day in the natur an makes sport have a better body becouse he is not ,4
5700," fet and you have fun to run outside
an other ",18
5701, is that his body dont say to ,19
5702, much things in the natur oh its against me and not ,18
5703, many childs with a life like this have ,9
5704," for the statemant is that the children have to lern in young years you can have fun without tv becouse if a child dont play often outside in young years they never play outside if they are big children
the last ",17
5705," for the statement is that it is better for the child if real persons do something with them and not a tv

now i am speaking about some ",17
5706, one is that it is easier for the parents to let se childs infornt of a tv as to play with them outside the parents can do something in the house ,17
5707," to wash the clothes and the childrens are heppy that they arte alowed to watch tv
an ather ",1
5708," against the statement is that the children can learn something in the tv for example there were some shows in the tv who teach them wath is one plus one and this can help them in school
ihe thierd ",17
5709," against the statement is that the children likes it they are happy if they are allowed to watch tv

all in all i agee with the statemant becouse ",17
5710," it is amportant for the live of the children that they learn in young years you could do something without technik you need only a ball to have fun 
and it is very good for the heals of the children becouse every thing the child meets in young yeas in a good way the body dont defends aganst it and the childs dont have ",4
5711, regarding the topic of advertising ,11
5712, targeting children aged  for example ,12
5713, that children in this age category are easily influenced and should ,7
5714, not be the direct target of adverts even if they are only spotting them ,11
5715, seeing their parents are watching tv however the amount of influencial content shown to kids could be regulated by their parents simply by telling them to turn off the tv there would ,17
5716, be controls on the content of the adverts themselve through organisations like the department of security for youth  the stongest negative ,16
5717, is the development of the children in the ages of  many children start to develop their own individual interests and that should be state in which they are able to think for themselves ,8
5718," buying them of them to get the most profit out of it  
i myself would ",23
5719, strongly with given statement and think that children should be able to show interest in things without having to have seen the advertisement in the media for it sadly today certain patterns are allready seeable ,13
5720, noting that the varying trends today show a great deal of change from generation to generation depending on what is on the tv and other media and what is not ,6
5721,"many little children already watch tvshows on programs that are aspecially for them often there are many advertising between the movies or series thats why many people dicuss if it should be allowed to show television advertising directet  aged  
we live in a consume time where its important to have many different and new things but children at this age are too small to understand the value of many things so its not good to train them already at this age for buying and that it is cool and neccesary to have many ",14
5722," toys often the little children can not even understand or realize what this advertisings are for
but we ",0
5723, should consider that nowadays children grow up with media and all of the modern technologies we should try to introduce them in the media stuff ,17
5724, try to hide it litlle children should already start to deal with the big amount of offers in this world or with the electronics also there could be a big problem to realize this wish of no advertising for little children because often there are only two or three children programs on tv and there are times where the shows for older children start but sometimes the 4yearsold children watch them too ,14
5725, with their sipplings then they ,19
5726," see advertisings and you cant fully isolate the little children from the advertisings it would be too complicated to seperate the shows for different aged children on different programms 
",6
5727, this is okay to show advertising on show,15
5728,"we are humans who have the best oppertunities to become great when you are one of the lucky persons who got the change to get born in europe you have won in a land where our wealth increased and most of us living a modern lifestyle so why should we forbid our kids to watch television advertising 

well our kids are getting lazier and are unable to learn important things thats an alternative ",14
5729, sure its not their fault why should it be it isnt their fault that they are growing up by watching television ,17
5730, going outside and discover our enviroment our kids are destroing themselves because they dont even build a social life just because they have nothing else to do they are to focused and they are ,8
5731," fascinated that they forget the reallife 

however why we should forbid our kids watching television i mean they arent able to contact the companies who are advertising and most of the products they are offering arent even usefull for kids they dont need a dating ",17
5732, because they dont want to fall in love they dont need a lawyer because they are not in trouble they dont need a new car because the arent able to drive ,3
5733," so most of our advertising is made by adults for adults additionally it is our fault that they are watching television because we are rolemodels for the kids if we did other things than wasting our time in front of the television our kids would look up to us this leads us to a new way of life without the necessary usage of a television  

in my oppinion its not that bad that kids watch television advertising the only thing is that they miss the oppertunity to get in touch with reallife you wasting ",14
5734, much time by watching television sure the kids should grow up by themselves and maybe it isnt that bad to watch television but i cant appreciate that the are missing ,1
5735, much just because they dont know something else than watching television ,3
5736,nowadays it is much more common to advertise with some hidden messages than 50 years ago this hidden message is often based on a sexual meaning for example the new pneu egger advertise it is about a snowman with spring feelings but ,11
5737, that kids do not get the sexual meaning of the advertisement ,16
5738, it is not that dramatic advertising on a sexual base is ,11
5739," common because it wakes people up and makes them to pay attention on the product 

children are really honest ",2
5740, insecure they often believe everything what the company tells them about the product sometimes children can get confused and dissapointed ,2
5741," the product in the advertisement 

to my opinion it is really important to take care of the time ",23
5742," these clips are shown on television if there is a company who advertises for sex toys in afternoon a lot of kids will see this which is totally negative for their developement
 
on the other ",2
5743," kids will be able to learn about new products and know how to use some toys they learn how it feels to have a desire and get taught to wait until they get these products 
in my childhood there was a song of the toilet paper candoo which i loved to sing with my mother and my sisters in this case i was able to learn something from television advertising it is really important to create television advertisements who are funny and easy to understand  

after thinking about the pros and cons of television advertising for young children i can say that it is totally okay to advertise toward children ",0
5744, they are suited for the age of them to my opinion there is no need to forbidden television advertising  ,14
5745," with the statement that television advertising s young children should not be allowed 
i am aware that at a young age children are very sensitive to input from their surroundings of any kind which includes their family friends media they consume and ",14
5746," on in this time period a lot of the base for the life they will live is being set and traumatic experiences can damage someone into having a troubled personality or fears their whole adulthood 
by being exposed to advertising at a young age the children are getting used to the fast constantly changing consumefocused lifestyle of our world which is a negative thing but ",2
5747," that this can be completely stopped by banning television advertising 
its just not realistic because ",15
5748, see ads that are directed to older children or adults and they will grow into it eventually anyway i ,24
5749, think that many of these ads are ,11
5750, s the children but to their parents too and it is primarily them who push their children into this consumefocused lifestyle by constantly buying them new toys if people start to see the problem in this way of thinking and living ,2
5751," they will realize that it can not be changed by simply not allowing advertising towards children 
in my opinion the real change needs to happen with the parents because they are the ones who have the biggest influence on their children if the parents do no want their children to see tv ads they can simply stop them from watching tv in our days there are other ways to watch shows or movies ",14
5752, on streaming services like netflix where no ads are shown this way the content they consume can ,10
5753," be controlled stopping them from watching unintelligent and unfunny tv shows  
before this can happen people ",12
5754, need to change their way of thinking and start to fill their lives more with memories and knowledge ,7
5755," than things they dont need 
to comparise my answer ",21
5756, that television advertising towards children should be allowed because the change needs to happen within the families and the way the children are brought up and not in the way of what is on tv in my opinion children shouldnt watch as much tv anyway and putting a lot of effort into banning these ads is a waste of time and energy because it simply will not help as much as people may think,13
5757,pro advertising advertising is an important instrument of a company to make their products or brands popular this is essential for the economy stricter regulations would ,15
5758, hurt the marketing business they would have an infect on every business and ,23
5759, swiss tvchannels a law only in one country could not work at all ,10
5760, all the other countires with tv channels that are available in switzerland would have to do the same ,10
5761, it wouldnt work and its not probably that ,19
5762, many countries would see the need for stricter regulations of advertising its ,15
5763," problematic to say which ads are  children between two and five not five to seven etc
 marketing is only necessary because a company needs to be popular to sell its products the market can ",16
5764, regulate itself without any difficulties if a company addresses ads directly towards young children and peoople mind they could just stop buying the products of this company if it really matters more than just a few people will boycott the company and ,16
5765, the enterprise will change something ,23
5766," and stop the problematic advertising



contra advertising opinionating advertising that has an influence on little children is dangerous because young children are easy to manipulate therefore they aint able to distinguish between true ",13
5767, and only advertising elements that make the ad more intresting like ,11
5768, flying toy cars if there were an ad with toy cars who would start flying during the ad little children would buy them because theyd think the cars would fly at home ,20
5769, affect the developement of the young children ,8
5770, they are very easy to controll because they cant know ,3
5771, how the world is working,21
5772,"should there be televisoin advertising directed 

in my opinion advertising shouldnt be made specially for children there are many channels for kids who use long advertisments to keep showing their program often the advertisment shows new toys the children want immediately because they are ",14
5773, easy to influence and sometimes dont even know what the advertisments are besides some advertisments are made for another group of people ,11
5774, it has a bad influence on them on the other ,4
5775, a huge part of the channels that are available in this country need the advertisments to keep the channel running they cant afford to show movies or tv shows without it yes there are channels who dont really use advertisments but usually they are not made for children this age  years it isnt possible to leave out advertisment from the channels ,14
5776, parents should talk to their kids instead tell them what adertisment are how they work and that they are often made to bring someone to buy their product that would ,2
5777, help the child to evolve a better sense for things they need or better dont ask for another option is to not let the child watch tv but that isnt really a ,17
5778, because from time to time its possible that they do it anyway i wouldnt stop showing advertisments  but to choose the shown advertisments better in addition i would reduce the time of the advertisment breaks to lower the amount of advertisments directed to the children another possibility is to stop huge companies use the easy influence on kids to make them want something from the advertisments maybe there should even be a special  advertismentfree time on channels made for children young age,16
5779,"essayshould television advertising  no longer be allowed

firtst of all lets discus what are television advertises  mostly the thing trying to be sold with these advertises are toys but the vaiarity of toys is huge these days there are plenty of electric devises for kids like nintendos or cumputer games but there are ",15
5780, outdoor toys for exemple a bike if a kid sits in front of a tv to see a nintendo it really would like to have for playing inside well this is questionable but if a kid maybe a kid that berly leaves his room to go play outside sees a bike it wants to have and ,20
5781, it goes playing outside thats a good thing but on the oder ,18
5782," wealthy that thay can easily and every moment afford a bike and if this is a big dream of a kid to have  bike not getting it can be really stressful 
but as a kid does not have any money for itself the danger that it would go and just buy all the things that looked ",9
5783, great in that advertise and ,11
5784, be broke is not existend this danger  is greater in the adult world as ,9
5785, adults are not always suchan adult as thay should be but tis text is not about this problem ,7
5786, lets focus back on the children and discus this problem from another piont of view what would it mean to a company ,12
5787, its avertising section is shut down television advertises are most important advertises of a company thats because ,10
5788, many people at once can be directed thats why ,19
5789, a company in our time can not survive without television advertising ,10
5790, all its competitiv compenys have the same problem and thats why ,23
5791, the benefits for a child without television advertises is to small to out weigh the disadvantige  ,17
5792,television and other electronic devices are becoming more frequently used by younger audiences this movement is rapidly developping as its always more normal for a child to have a smartphone to own their own tv or their own laptop it is a widly discussed controversity among scientists psychologists and other professions promoting a product over the tv which aim at young children ,17
5793," normalise this tendancy and can manipulate young children  is this a bad thing

young adults and elderly people argue that in their childhood they didnt have things like a smartphone or a pc at home they only had a couple of channels on tv and in the case of the older generation these channels were in black and white which this meant is that they say they have spent much more time outside interacting with friends 
futhermore having advertising aimed at young audiences can unconsciously plant an idea inside their heads young children are very easily manipulated in that sense ",14
5794, if they see the new barbie or action man they immediately want this new toy and ask their parent sif they can have it often it does not matter what the product is exactly ,20
5795," it looked cool or cute in the advertisement 
on the other ",18
5796, having a growing audience businesses unsurprisingly want to take ,23
5797," of the situation esecially because there is less competition for this target age its a big opurtunity for smaller firms too in effect to forbid this kind of advertising would mean to limit chances of product sellers
in addition it isnt always a bad thing for a young child to desire something they see after seeing that new doll on tv young girls might think oh i want that for my birthday whatever happens it results in something being learnt for example a girl 3 years of age sees a pink unicorn toy in an advertisement then the girl may ask the mother if she could have it if the mother was to say no the girl may be disappointed but understand she cant have everything in life if the grirl was to get said toy it may have to work for it or get it for her birthday 

in conclusion ",16
5798,"television advertising is a very common topic in daily life many people ask themselves if advertising directed  is a good thing
the difficulty in advertisements for children is with the parents because they always need to reject the wishes of their children as they cannot buy everything for them ",14
5799, they wanted to in general kids are very believing and as advertising is always at least a little bit manipulating ,2
5800, that they could have problems with dealing with lies in future life for example playmobil advertising always shows the figures moving on themselves but in reality they are very static even by this little movements children might be confused about the unmobility of the figures ,7
5801," they see them its difficult to find an example for advertising towards children because almost everything they show does not really work like it is shown or does not even exist
nevertheless television advertisments have ",16
5802, for young children it could ,4
5803, be that they learn to handle with rejections and understand in early age they cannot get everything they want also the television advertising will always be present for them ,0
5804," advertising kind of prepares them for the adult life if children get confronted with problems very early they have more time to learn from them
in my opinion there is no need to forbid television advertising s young children if there was not such a great amount of advertisements for adults too i would have thought about it again but as children have to deal with advertising until their death they should ",14
5805, learn to deal with it in younger ages to me the lies in advertising are not a problem for children too because ,16
5806, it is important to not limit their imagination and to support it fantasy is only present for children and we should let them believe in it as it is ,8
5807,the statement asks if television advertising  agede  should not be allowed a big adventagen from that is that the children would not know which new toys their parents could buy them ,13
5808, there would not be any ,19
5809, about buying the latest stuff but ,23
5810, the children do not have any ideas what they could wish theirselves for their birthday or for christmas so the parents would have to walk into the toy store and there the kids would see even more toys and everything at once ,20
5811," that they could not decide theirselves and it would take a lot of time and money the difference would be that the children could see the toys in reality and that could be better because children in this age cannot understand that the reality is different from the tv and that the advertisement wants to influence them
but to see it from another perspective there happen a lot of funny situations because of children who understand an advertisment wrong they just asked their parents about it or they are ",20
5812, that everyone in the family really needs an own vacuum in addition you can think that this children are ,9
5813, much advertisement but it is a chance for them to have a break between the series or the films they are watching ,10
5814, that they can go to the toilet or get some food in addition the brands and fabrics should have the chance to show their products to everyone it would not be fair if they earn less money than other shops just because the others are selling things for adultes ,12
5815," that they are allowed to show advertisment
so ",11
5816, that it is okay to show advertisment in the tv  because it is an fair possibility for everyone and it is part of the everyday life and if anyone is against this rule maybe they should just let their children watch less tv ,13
5817," answer the question of wether television  young young children aged  should be allowed or not allowed

television even in all its forms is a relatively young invention today most people in western civilised societies own a television just like the newspaper the radio etc it is a form of media the purpose of media can usually be divided into two main subcategories information and entertainment for example many of us watch television to catch up with the news and we watch documentaries to educate us on certain topics in the same way television can be used as a form of entertainment and education for children its a different and exciting opportunity for them to learn new things about the world they live in ",17
5818, having fun there are many tv programs that cater to the aforementioned things some better than others another positive ,6
5819, worth mentioning is that showing television to children is an easy way to relieve some stress from parents by letting their children watch their favourite tv programs parents have more free time to do the things the need and want to do whilst ,17
5820," keeping the children happy and entertained 

however letting children watch tv comes with its downsides firstly watching to much television has been linked to having adverse health effects ",17
5821, in young children aged   another problem is advertising a lot of channels create and use advertising targeted directly at young children the ads often include the endorsement of unhealthy or unsuitable foods ,14
5822, as advertising many unnecessary consumer goods additionally several studies conducted on this particular topic found that children watching too much tv were prone to become dependant the activity was ,14
5823," strongly correlated with reduced physical activity which could result in young children becoming overweight or obese 

in conclusion the negative effects of watching tv appear to ",17
5824, twoards a ban for young children aged  as they outweigh the benefits ,12
5825,"television advertising is seen by everyone daily companies are advertising their products and special offers adults know how to deal with advertising but we were asking ourselves the question if television advertising  shouldnt be allowed 
advertising made for young kids is usually about toys or cartoons its made colorful with lots of big impressing pictures which is why kids think its interesting to watch if there is an advertising about a brand new toy the children always want to have it ",14
5826, they go to their parents and ask them to buy it the kids are too young to understand that people always want to sell their products and kids are the best way to do this because parents usually cant say no to their young kids they ,2
5827, dont understand that all of these toys cost a lot of money nevertheless children at the age of  dont understand most of whats said in advertisings which is why ,20
5828, that it doesnt really matter if companies use advertisings or not ,11
5829, because they wont be able to remember it the very ,3
5830," day 
in my opinion television advertising for young children are very tricky because kids with their positive minds believe everything and they get impressed easily so ",14
5831, a few advertisings can be allowed if they are made carefully but there shouldnt be as much ads as for adults ,16
5832, the kids can focus on their cartoon without beeing interrupted by multiple advertising also parents should try to explain to their kid that they cant have everything thats advertised ,0
5833, its important for kids to know that,8
5834,television advertising is pretty controversal ,10
5835," for young children
while watching tv the majority of young children is influenced by the music they hear or the colours they see 
they often like colourful and noisy things which make them laugh or dance or sing most of the television advertising is just like that today and ",14
5836, that these children are really into this kind of advertising when they see a cool toy advertising with a nice song you keep in your mind they admire to have it and start to annoy their family because they want it as a gift for christmas or their birthday otherwise television advertising is good to help the kids making decisions about their wishes for christmas eastern etc there are tv channels only for young children which dont show any advertising and ,0
5837, that this is very good there are only the tv shows and no advertising for adults which could be bad for the education of them many terrible things happen daily and young children should not get the brutal impressions of terror and pain because that could be bad for their view on people in their later lives you can ,6
5838," make advertising for useless or bad things and use nice characters or colours for it as long as it makes them happy the young children dont care aboout the content of it for example there is much advertising for sweets which re not good for young childrens but they want to eat them because of the interesting tv spot
thats the reason why ",0
5839, with the statement that television advertising for young children should not be allowed they start wanting to have the newest stuff and they only get influenced by colours and sounds because they arent able to think about the content ,13
5840,in todays world television included the advertising is a big topic almost in every home there is a tv and even the youngest in the household will use it this leads to early confrontation between children and commercials many companies use advertising especcially directed  ,14
5841," sell their products the strategy behind this is that the children will convince their parents to buy certain stuff as they are much more likely to fall for such commercials many parents may do not even recogniced that the childs new desire comes from television advertising also television advertising directed to young people is often seen on children channels and inbetween films for children by placing the commercials this way they make sure as many children as possible get to see their products
because children are much more naiv it should not be a thing to show commercials designed for them one main reason therefor is that children aged  are not able to buy things it is the parents job so there is no sence in using commersials directed to children it may be a good strategy for companies but it is not a fair concept
in my opinion there should not be any advertising directet to people ",0
5842, who are unable to afford anything it should not be allowd in ,12
5843, televison on paper or on the radio ,10
5844,"today you can see a four year old child on the playground with his new iphone and playing games on it also there are lots of children at home in front of the television and not outside anymore that is our new generation growing up with technology but is it healthy for a child or should it not be allowed for young children to watch television

on one ",17
5845, i understand the issues they have with children who are just watching television or are already having an iphone with four years ,9
5846," beacause they are very young young children in this age should play with toys or outside on the playground and should make games with their mothers and not with their phone

on the other ",24
5847, they can learn something on television there are plenty of good series for kids ,6
5848, dora who learns the children counting or the coulors also it has an social ,6
5849, if the other children are allowed to watch television and your child is not ,17
5850, your child can be excluted there are ,9
5851," lots of disney films who are for children and who the parents can watch with them furthermore the child can learn about moral and friendship 

in my opinion you should find a balance between it i played often outside in my childhood ",6
5852, watched television and learnd something from it propably you should not allow it to a two year old child but a five year old can defenetly learn something out of it it is ,8
5853, important that you care if you do not care about your child watching television they can be in front of a television for hours then ,17
5854," it is not okay
in conclusion it is every parents own decision how long and if they even want to allow it their childrenâ¨watching television",17
5855,when you turn on your television nowadays you more often are confronted with ads that advertise ,10
5856, toys for children even under the age of six are those ads really necessary and are little children already allowed to watch ,16
5857, much tv that there should be ads for them ,10
5858," that it is not important to show ads on the television for children under the age of six

firts of all ",13
5859," that those ads should not be allowed because it would only encourage young children to watch more tv children at the age of two arent even able to understand what the television wants to tell them

secondly because it is a waste of time for little children to watch more tv ",13
5860," it is not necessary to show ads on television that espeecially are for pre school children

on the other ",13
5861, parents of young children at any time cant spend time with their kids the parents just put them in front of the tv ,1
5862, that they are entertaint and ,3
5863," that the parents are left in peace and can do what they have to do and if those children are watching a channel in which they show ads  children with their age they are more likely to like what they are watching also to put a child in front of the tv is another way to learn the language and for the parents to teach them the language without talking to them

in conclusion my opinioin is that advertising  shoulnt be allowed because children under the age of six shouldnt anyway be watching tv ",13
5864," often that there should be ads specialised for them
",11
5865,television has a huge impact on people and ,10
5866, on children and teenagers the biggest influence is the advertising the world sees a product being advertisied and ,2
5867," they think about buying it because the product is well presented by the company or because it is useful in the household but under what impact are the young children and teenagers the question for this essay is if television advertising  younger children should not be allowed

on one ",14
5868, the children are too young to understand the message of the advertise they will look at the presented product and wont associet it with themselvesthey may think it looks nice and that they wanted it but they would soon forget about the toy ,0
5869, instead they would wait impatiently for their favourite show to come on again only their unconscisnous would remind them perheps that there is something that they wanted on the other ,1
5870," people cannot be sure if the child really doesnt pick up the images of the product maybe the child runs to the perents instantly and they have to buy it and if they dont the child is going to be angry

furthermore it depends what kind of advertising it is if it is for a doll or a ball it is not dangerous because every child has something like a ball but what if it is a gun for playing soldier or games with shooting in them that is ",2
5871," it will be dangerous this kind of advertising could have a big impact on younger human beings they could turn into a whole other person in the future they might like shooting guns or the idea of taking drugstheir future could change

i ",16
5872, think that television advertising  younger children should be allowed because iitit,13
5873,"i once visited ma aunt whose children are two and four years old i saw them looking television at seven oclock in theevening first they saw a film than the film was interrupted by an advertising i heard the chilren asking their mother to buy some thing that was presented in the advertising so i was wondering if this advertising poses a problem or if not and if it poses a problem if it should be prohibited 

on the one ",14
5874," there is no obligation to look television parents are free to decide if they want to let their children looking television if the parents think that the advertising has a negative influence in their childrens behaviour they can stop letting their children looking television
andeven ",14
5875, it could be a problem the problems are far more alarming in other ,19
5876, super markets put the candies on the level of the childrens eyes to make them asking their parents for those candies we should ,2
5877," to those huge problems  
and ",21
5878, everybody has the possibility to open a television chanal ,10
5879," why should one not have the permission to show in his chanal what one wants

on the other ",19
5880, if there was a regulation the owners of the chanals would ,19
5881," have other possibilities to make money they could make advertising for older children for exemple 
but the children are not the only victims of the advertisin the parents have to buy all the stuff and this is not fair for them so the parents are not entirely free to decide if they want to let their children looking television because there is no television without advertising
for me ",14
5882, that children are easily influenced i ,7
5883, think that it is without any respect to use this for making money such a thing schould clearly be not allowed,23
5884,"
if i walk down the street young children do not greet me anymore ",7
5885," this is rude and that in my childhood i would greet every older person because i was afraid of them i had a huge respect towards elderly in my opinion the technology is a possible issue which causes rudeness

many parents do not know how the raise their children it is likely to give them a mobile phone or to let them watch television for hours the time of goinig outside playing with neighboors is gone when i look at the problem from this angle it is plausible to me if they are not allowed television would be less watched imagine the your favourite television series would not be released no more you would not watch television ",24
5886, i guess this would work quiet the same for children as a result children would not go more outside but they could get a distance between the television and ,17
5887," this would be a huge development

on the other ",19
5888," the economy would gain less money furthermore some television programms have an effect of learning in my childhood i got to about some animals by watching television if i had not the possibility to watch television i doubt that i would be interested in animals now

rudeness has to to with caracter ",17
5889, that i had not been rude in my childhood because my parents knew how to raise me from my ,18
5890," of view the television has an impact on the caracteristics of a child additionaly chldren who are busier in watching television than in other things often do not know how to act proparly in society

in essence i see the ",17
5891, of the statement children get a lack by watching to much tv i am pretty sure that this trend can not be stopped that easy but if we do not make something about it will get worse by striking advertising television we could create an impact towards the children in a more positive direction ,14
5892,"the statement that advertising   should not be allowed is false 
one of the most commonly used ",15
5893," is that the influence advetisment has on the young children is too big the fear is that children belive everything they get told and think it is a hundret percent true this fear may be reasonable but it is just how the world works later in life they will get linked and the earlier they learn that not everything people say on television is true the better it is 
another agrument the supporters of this ",14
5894," use is that advertisment has an affect on the brain funktion of kids generally speaking they mean that it makes the children dumb but that is not true studies have shown that people that watched a lot of television and advertising are not going to be more or less affected in their ability to think a way more greater danger lies in how young children spend their free time because is going to affect their succes in sport 
this is because the age we are speaking of is the best age to learn new movments and develop their skills like throwing catching or jumping if the children miss the oportunity to do ",14
5895," because the just sit infront of the television watching tv all day long they will have struggles to keep up with their classmates in sport
in conclusion you can say that showing advetisment  is not going to have a bad affect on the chlidren instead we should worry about the amount of time they spend infront of a tv not being out in the nature running aroung and developing their skills if we not manage to do ",17
5896, we will have a generation that might ,19
5897, be as smart as the generations ,8
5898, but might not be able to properly play footbal or do an other type of sport as good as generations ,19
5899,"nowdays in mostly each hose is used a television but there are a lot of discussions about the use of children a lot of  people think the youth is to  much time on their phones and televisions but what is with the use of young children aged  shouldnt they be allowed to watch tv 

the use of a television can help with their education they can already learn in young age things about the world and this in a way with fun and pleasur 
there are a lot of series which include a good preparation for the school and this in a way the children like to watch it 

on the other ",17
5900, young children should go out and play with other childs ,8
5901," sitting along in front of the tv the children should be outside and have fun there are to many dumb series in the television which doesnt have any avantage for the childs one example is sponge bob 
parents should look for their childs and make little advantures with them the family can go to a museum of dragons a hike through the mountains and the childs will have a really good day with a lot of memories in opposite a child wont have good memories of a day iin front of the tv 

in my opinion children are allowed to watch tv a little story befor they go to bed isnt got bad at all 
 but if the parents just let their childs watch tv all day just that they dont have to look all day long for their childs it is wrong children should go out and be in the nature and in the sun 


",17
5902,television  advertising specialy for young children could drasticaly improff the money wich large companies wich produce toys for young children make because the children see the toys in television and ,14
5903, want they parents to buy it annother ,9
5904," would be that this adviserments only run on television channels which are especialy made for young children with this method the adviserments would be only seen by their target group the television channels for the young children would get a lot of money this way and can use it to show film and series with higher quality

possible reasons for not allowing television advertisaments for young children could be the kids of this age cant realy differenciate what of the advertisament is real and what is only a special effect at this age the children dont have a real own oppinion ",14
5905, if the advertisament say that they need this toy and everybody wants it they think ist true and ,20
5906, want this toy a problem with the advertisaments on tv channels for kids would be that kids dont like it to wait but if the advertisaments are like the ones for adults ,20
5907, the children would have to see 15 minutes of advertisaments just to see the last minutes of they favourite series for some parrents the advertisaments would be ,14
5908," a problem because they want to know what they have to expect what they children see on tv for the normal tv programm you can just look it up but you never now which advertisaments will be there and if the special advertisaments are shown on the normal tv channels the adult people would just get annoied by them because they are not interrested in in unless the yhave children in that age also there wouldnt be as many kids like on the channels for children to watch it
as we can see there are more reasons agaist special television advertisaments for kids than for allowing it ",14
5909, it would be a good desicion to not allow it in my oppinion its ,12
5910, really important to protect the children from content which is not good for them ,12
5911, the advertisaments shouldnt get allowed,11
5912,"the following text is going to discuss wheter it should be allowed to direct advertising on tv towards young children 
children in the age between two and five years are easy to manipulate an example ",13
5913, that children who come from a family that smokes are more likely to start smoking in the future ,7
5914, of the companies it is easy to find good ,23
5915, for advertising products by manipulating small children they will see things they like on television and are going to tell their parents that they want them ,0
5916, as a result children are going to have a lot higher standarts towards presents and other things similiar to presents either they get them right away and develop a thinking that they can get what they want just by asking their parents often enough or they get mad at their parents for not buying these products maybe because one other child has it furthermore children should not be watching a lot of television in this age ,20
5917, that children who are watching a lot of television in their childhood are more likely to get a bad eyesight earlier than usual and it has other negative effects concerning development of the body ,17
5918," 
in my oppinion it should not be allowed to direct advertisements at children between two and five years not mentioning the ",13
5919, that children are not supposed to be watching a lot of television in these years anyway because it is an unfair way of manipulating human beings into the habit of consuming and buying everything they like even in young years parents should take care of what their children are watching on tv if they let them watch television at all children should be outside as much as possible ,17
5920, they are young and not waste their time inside watching brainless series on tv and buying some toys full of toxic ingredients however as a company you can advertise as much as you want and direct it to the people you want to direct it to even ,2
5921, it should not be allowed there will probably never be a law which is going to stop companies from doing that ,23
5922, i was like 3 and the i watcched my dvds ,6
5923, children are supposed to play outside and enjoy the life and not sit the whole day in front of a televison it is ,17
5924, the responsibility from the parents what their children are watching when i was young i hardly watched televison and till today i can not watch any horror move or something like that from my ,17
5925, of view there is not that much diffence between televison advertising  and adults of course it is always a good way to make money little kids are watching tv an they see something what they want and i can tell there are things every little girl always wants puppies who can talk and barbies with long blonde hair who can sing an ,10
5926, on the problem is that many children have ,4
5927, an imagination of something wich isnt real but their parents have to tell them but just because there is advertising doesent mean you have to buy these things your children have seen it is the part from the parents to say no otherwise your kids see something interesting like an advertising from a zoo or museum ,0
5928, get imputs and learn something new what might be a problem is how you deal with itif parents think it is not good for their children they have to decide if the kid can watch tv included advertising or not ,17
5929, it is not an option that advertising shouldnt be allowed for many people is this the way to make money of course i ,11
5930, find it kind of annoing ,18
5931, there is that much advertiting in the tv from my ,10
5932, of view advertising should be allowed for everyone and if it schouldnt ,11
5933,"the topic is that children between  dont watch tv
the ",17
5934," agument is that children dont go outside and learn by doing it is importat that children learn thing for examble they need to hurt himself or build a snowman if the watch tv is a way this thing by watching not doing 
then children learn bad things like bad words or violence because in the tv are a lot things with violence or hate also children need to run and go outside to get stronger and itâ´s a training for them real social friend are more importent ",8
5935, friend in tv because friend are importet to have a happy life ,6
5936," as child then if your are lonely u get depressed and sad a other agument is that children get problems with her eyes and need glasses
on the other hand they can lean things about politics or economics if they watch tv they can use it for her future or the parents can do things and dont need to play with the childrens a other positiv agument is that childrens learn things by childshows at last tv can be good if it is the right show and not bad content about useless things then they can learn writing or speaking with this shows
in my opinion i think it should not be allowed because tv is not good for children and the parents need time to play with his children if they donâ´t have time they donâ´t need to make childrenbut if the parents had no time they should get his children into a babysitter or daymother",17
5937,"for many people television advertising  should be banned because it affects them to much and they do not understand that they are being manipulated

firstly the advertising can affect and influence young children very heavily ",15
5938, there is an advertisement about a toy they most likely want to have it and they will not give up unless they get this toy but ,20
5939," they watch this much television that they do not give up until they get this certain toy one should blame the parents and not the advertisements

secondly the children do not understand that they are being manipulated in being or liking a certain toy or cloth et cetera but the parents have the responsibility to explain the use of advertisement to the child in an ",2
5940," that they understand that the toy they saw in the television is not that great as they expected it to be 

furthermore advertisements  children or just business strategies which are aimed a young children that their parents have to buy more products are ",20
5941, in supermarkets with the stickers which they can trade with each other and glue in their album but the parents only get these stickers ,20
5942," they buy products for a certain amount of money which results in a big profit for the company

in conclusion ",23
5943, with this statement because the responsibility lies by the parents and they should make sure that their child understands what advertisements are and that their child does not watch to much television and because there are much more ways where young children are used to make mor profit ,13
5944, children get influenced easier by adverts than adults but ,0
5945, it should be allowed to create advertisement for every product you cant forbid advertisings for toys or other childrenstuff because ,15
5946, the products wont sell and the people who sell the products have a ,23
5947, other companies that sell things which are allowed to advertise it would be just unfair but you cant ignore the manipulation in these advertisements children get manipulated by them very easily advertisements show children products in a way that they really want to have them and they almost force their parents to buy them and the problem is that parents get pretty annoyed by their children ,16
5948, they always ask for new stuff they saw in the tv so they will buy the toys for their children just because they want them to be quite the advertisements for toys ,20
5949, are often made very colorful joyful and crazy to catch the minds of young kids but this happens in every advertisement in the tv because the people want their products to get sold so i dont see a problem in making ads ,0
5950, for children because its made almost ,20
5951, for adults ads are made for the interest of the people who are seen as the buyers of the shown product and why should we make an exception for children in the end its their choice to buy new stuff and its ,16
5952, thei fault the same as it is my fault if i would by new videogame i saw in tv or if i watch a new film just because i saw the trailer and ,18
5953, i expected it to be products need to get sold and ,23
5954, need to get advertised everybody should care less about things said in advertisement because often the producers lie to support their product it is the responsibility of the parents to buy toys for their children and if they buy things that arent that great it is their own fault parents should decide if the advertisement is bad or good but i dont think advertising for young children should be forbidden that would be wrong ,16
5955," young children are easy to manipulate and they think that everthing what in television are shown was real and partens have the problem that they should to explain the children that advertising often lies and do everthing to sell the products they show in their advertisting
one the other ",14
5956, many children arent often outside in shopping centers with their parents ,9
5957, they dont see maybe what they want on ,3
5958," brithday when young children see television advertising they can easyer know what they wish for maybe christmas or on birthday 
furthermore partens should look out that their children only watch television advertising for the age of hisher child 
otherwise the quantity important ",14
5959," because young children should play with toys or doing something outside to learn more acout the world und do more expericenes 
so ",8
5960,this generation is called the socialmediageneration almost everybody has any technical object ,23
5961, a mobilephone tablet or television even young children have these things and the question is if television advertising should be allowed or not for young children aged  theyre ,14
5962, many television advertisements these days that its nealy impossible to control what your children is watching all day long these advertisements can include some terrible images and words ,14
5963, sexual abuse crime scenes or things that can lead the watcher to buy products and get trapped by that ,6
5964, lucky games or something like this when young children watch television its most of the time movies or series specifically made for children with toys animals or something to learn so if the movie is over there are advertisements made for children ,6
5965, with new toys or movies for kids but if the child switches the programme they could see advertisements they shouldnt because theyre made for adults maybe the new trailer for an action movie or an alcohol advertisement ,14
5966, some advertisements should be allowed for children because theyre not brutal or something and the kids can watch these without there parents watching over their shoulder in the season ,16
5967, the children dont know what they wanna get from santa claus advertisements for kids are very useful because parents can watch these advertisements with them and if the kid likes one of the toys it can be the present for christmas but there is the big problem with this social media thing every young kid has a mobilephone and their parents cant control what theyre doing and what they get to see on these as a parent you can control a little bit what your child is doing on their smartphone beacause you can download some kind of safety app which only allows some games and not apps like facebook or instagram but exacly these games incluse advertisements whether you want to see it or not you cant avoid them because the app only works with these advertisements so if a kid just wants to play a minigame on their phone they could accidently see an advertisement for a brutal game which includes weapons and murder sometimes its the case that you click on one of these advertisements and ,16
5968, you get directly to the appstoreplaystore if a child now likes the game but this game costs money its a big problem for the parents to check if theyre not buying things there not allowed to the children coud download this game and the parents get the surprise that they have to pay for it you can say that the internet and these television advertisements are not safe for young children ,20
5969, aged  because they dont know what theyre watching or doing and it can cause some trouble for them and ,24
5970, for their parents all in all i ,9
5971, with the statement that television advertising  children should not be allowed because its not safe for them to watch advertisements which are not made for them in my opinion television advertising ,13
5972, made for children are ok like the ones with toys if they not include crime or something like that but the other ones shouldnt be allowed for these young children ,12
5973," discuss the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed and support my opinion
advertising ",15
5974, is known for manipulating the brains of their viewers and indicating them to buy specific products especially in television these advertisements have started to use psychological tricks to really get into the viewers mind and trigger certain feelings of course in an advertisment they only show the positive ,11
5975, we are really fascinated by it for us adults it is a lot easier to realise this and ,8
5976, think about the negative parts of this product children at the age of  dont have this kind of critical thinking ,2
5977, an advertisement of a speaking doll they dont understand the ,11
5978, this doll might have so ,18
5979, they see this advertisement where they show this really cool doll that can talk to you and repeat what you are saying and even connect to your smart phone they will go to their parents and ask for the doll ,20
5980," long until it gets what it wants 
this example has been argued a lot about recently in the news there was a doll on the market that could be connected to your phone and wifi in you coul tell her what to say with your phone a lot of children ",24
5981, young girls got this doll until the law made this doll illegal it was used for secret services like the nsa and could spy on families that own one of those dolls children would not recognise dangers like this and not realise the bad ,20
5982, of their toys as i said in advertisements only the positive ,20
5983, of the product are shown and in cases of childrens products you can ,2
5984," only see children playing with said product or toy and having the best time in those advertisements they use a lot of bright coulours and sounds that appeal to the younger viewers to get their attention and keep them interested 
also if a child really wants to have something ",0
5985," it is not dangerous or harmful to them or their families it is very hard to say no to a crying child they start to throw tanrums and make a huge disaster out of it until their parents give up and buy them what they want so if the telesvision advertising is always directed  who are very influencable the chance of getting their attention and fascination is a lot bigger than with adults
",14
5986, that television advertising should be completely forbidden for products that appeal to younger children but it should not be directed only to them in general ,13
5987, disney channel or nickelodeon should be completley advertising free ,16
5988, parents can control what their children watch on the television with no doubt children are a lot easier to manipulate and this should not be abused by companies that want to sell controversial products,2
5989,television advertisement can be very controversial it can be very usefull to build up economics as selling children furniture is a wellpaid business these days butit can ,14
5990," be a factor that can damage childrens education and pushing them to controversial materialism

as we probably all know children are way more influencable than adults they can not measure the value of money and furniture ",9
5991, do not plan things into the future it often happens that they become a present ,18
5992, are fascinated by it for one or two weeks and and ,18
5993, they dont use it anymore they ,19
5994, dont see a reason to save the small amount of money that they get for the upcoming needs it easily happens that they splurge all their savings at a time on something not always satisfying getting a toy that was advertised and that a lot of friends have is a good reason to do ,20
5995,children are known for being cute and innocent ,8
5996, getting what they want can be way more easy ,3
5997, for other people like me we all know that they master the art of seducing their parents to get what they want ,9
5998, walking down the aisle of the toy store ,18
5999," if the saw that fun new toy on television earlier they will more likely try to get this toy with which they are already familiar this influence can be damaging for thej kids education as they don not learn how to evaluate the value of something on their own

it is ",20
6000, a huge business and a wellpaid market but allinall ,23
6001, advertisement for children should beforbidden because it seems that they get ,16
6002, influenced by it that it feels like children get ,7
6003, a part of their education,8
6004,"advertising

whats my opinion about the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed so ",15
6005, mo matter such young children can not be affected of a television advertisment or not because they to young to think about this things they sit on the sofa and watch into the screen of the television and they only think about amusant things they see in the screen ,14
6006, i think the aimgroup of television advertisment are children with the minimal age of ten years and there wont be a law of showing these things to children aged  another ,14
6007, is that the main goal of a advertising will take peoples interesting to buy some things and the statement that parents of  years old children buy them all things they need ,0
6008, makes the statement on the top unorrect i can ,21
6009, understand that there is a discussion about this topic because young children often watch tv and to much is naturally very bad ,17
6010, there any many reasons to make this statement correct i am not good enough informed to say if these sentense is correct of false or if i ,21
6011, with it or not but i think its important to look that children dont look to much tv because in younger age it is better to make experiences outside and not the hole time ,17
6012, a screenmy opinon is that it makes no matter,21
6013,since the last few years television became a bigger part of our life there are not just more possibilitys to watch television ,10
6014," there are more and more movies and television shows for young children more and more we have to ask us how good is that 
with watching television comes with less time to be active children which grow up to watch television in early their age are more depence on television today there are television shows for everyone and specially for young children this television shows promote that children learn important things with watching television the television shows want to teach children math or english with little games this games are easy and should be fun that moves more and more parents to give their young children the apportunity to watch television in this time the parents do not have to look ",17
6015," their children because they are watching television 
if the children are older they ",1
6016," want to see television because they grow up with that to play outside is something that many children do not know how to do with bad concequenses 
we find more children in our time who needs glases the most of them are ",17
6017," in kindergarten thre is a connection between the qualitiy of eyes and watching television sincetists say the children need glasses because they have started watching television with an early age
there are good things on television ",17
6018," i am sure children could
in my view of ",12
6019, television is not just bad but young children should not watch television to often one or two times in a week will be enought ,17
6020,"advertising is all about knowing how to influence the audience 

kids between 25 are too young to be influenced by television

what do you want this is a really hard question to answer nowadays when i was little ",14
6021, i remember knowing way better what i wanted and what i didnt everybody did this is why advertising young kids is ,8
6022, much easier theyare predictable easy to influence and with that to be fooled by ads they will look at this clip on the flatscreen and ,11
6023," the advertising market knows exactly what they are doing those kids will be sure that this is the thing they need now they will go to their parents and beg for this toy this way the ad is working through the kid to reach the parents it gives the advertiser an easier job but are we really aloud to use kids for business

at this age you could call most kids naiv they live their life day per day like they would go through a big gameeven ",0
6024, they do forgive and forget way faster than adults do  there is dohave litlle fights quite often a tease hera and another there it doesnt need more for a kid to start crying most young children get their ,24
6025, experience with the different moneystatus of their family vs theone of another this wouldntbe anything bad if it wouldnt mean that they havent got something other kids got im not talking about a rugby ball im talking about those expensive toys which get advertised in tv and a few families just cant afford it after a ,20
6026," those expensive toys get to a trend and those kids with the poorer familiesget bullied because they dont have those new toys 

",20
6027, that advertiser shouldonly be aloudto promote something to someone who actually understands whats happening there is no reason they should be aloud touse kids to reach the parents ,16
6028, this would be the easier way for them they should be able to choose without any in,19
6029,"television is a big topic in our society nowadays everybody has a television at home and knows the evenings were you just sit on the couch watching television the following text deals with the statement  television advertising  aged  should not be allowed  this questions is connected to a very controverse topic
 first of all the adults should decide if there chilldren are allowed to watch televison there are many channels ",15
6030, only for children eg disney channel nickelodeon when children are watching these programs ,6
6031, it is good to have directed advertising for the children because the television can be very dangerous by showing some murder scenes or something like that and for these sepcial channels it is okay to have advertising only for young children but ,14
6032, you send advertising like this you have to know the risks of these ones in this young age the children do not know what is good or wrong ,16
6033, advertising directed to children can change their opinion mind or development another ,0
6034, is that little children like i already mentioned do not know what is good or right and you can influence them very easily in every single way besides you ,7
6035, need to be informed about the risk that the children can be very sad if there parents do not buy them the newest presented toy the children do not understand if  they really need this new toy the parents might can not offer ,20
6036, much money for this stuff but the children are ,9
6037," they will get there parents to buy anything they want 

in my opinion you have to be very soft with these television advertising  aged  because you can not know what an influence it has on young children to sum up ",0
6038, it is better to have advertising directed  than showing them some dangerous scenes but you ,11
6039, have to know that you easily can manipulate childrens so i ,7
6040, and television directed  should be allowed but the parents have to controll there children and ,12
6041,i grew up without television and ,17
6042, that wasnt that bad nowadays the problem is that alot of parents use the technology more often ,24
6043, the child just watch tv without do something with the neiborhood childrens the kids can watch tv thats absolutly no problem but they have to do ,17
6044, important what they watch on tv if they watch some shooter movies is that acutually very bad but kids ,6
6045, could learn from watching television ,6
6046, they watch documantary about animals that isnt that bad beause they learn something ,6
6047, the parentes should watch what there children watch on tv but like under five years ,17
6048, they shouldnt watch at all tv at that age the kids have to learn more important things at this time they arent even in the kindergarden but you cant say that it isnt allowed because how do you wonna know that the parentes should make the decision ,17
6049," i say no to thatcits actually normal that today the people work with more techonolgy or just always use it a live with out smartphone alot of people cant imagine that so its just likely that the kids grow up with that even if it would be better with out
for me it would be no i wont do thati know alot of kids which grow up like that but writer now we cant make a decison ",12
6050, this generation is at our age we can tell not ,19
6051, a day ago i read an article about parents which dont care about there kids ,9
6052, thats just an excample how it could end if you wonna chill with your friend and just because of that your kids watch tv its worse,1
6053,television advertising  is a controversial topic some people think it is okay at the age of  other people think it should not be allowed in the following text ,13
6054," give reasons for and against it and tell you my opinion about this
one reason ",21
6055, advertising could be that children get in contact with the medium at a young age like in todays world they grow up with such influence a reason against it which is mentioned often is that children ,14
6056, young children will become numb because of the huge influence that the tv and ,17
6057, advertising have another reason against it is that the parents of the child should have the control over what they buy for it of course they should look at the wishes of their child on the other ,2
6058," there are things being advertised which are not suitable for a child and these wishes should not be accepted a reason for the early advertising could be that the children can specialise themselves on what they like and what they do not like
all in all ",16
6059, there should be this form of advertising it does not harm the children in addition the parents need to have the control over what their children are watching not ,14
6060, they are older but at this young age    ,24
6061," discuss the question wheter television advertising direct toward young children  aged   should be allowed or not

to begin with there are a few ",13
6062, against this kind of television in general the children are influenced by the media in a very young age nowadays they are a lot younger than they were ,17
6063," ten years ago by forbitting a television advertising these young children one may be able to stop this development or even trend

another ",14
6064, for young children against watching television is the ,17
6065, do not spend a lot of time outside in that young age it is important to experience things by themselfes and ,24
6066," seeing them on television

on one ",18
6067, there are all these negativ ,21
6068, about television for young children ,17
6069, for allowing it first of all the parents can control the time that their children spend in front of the television watching it once a week for a short time means a huge difference  ,17
6070," watching it every day for a few hours

secondly some  tv shows for children can actually help them to learn new things without them even noticing it for exemple a foreign language in germany there excist a few tv shows that explain english vocabulary and grammar by telliing exciting adventures to the kids 

to sum up my opinion i find the ",17
6071, that the parents should control the time their children spend watching television the most convincing because the children in that young age  shoud not be influenced by the media all the time in my opinion you can not replace talking to your child or ging outside with them by letting them sit in front of the tv all day if they just watch it once in a ,17
6072, they can actually learn a few things therefore i thing that television advertising direct toward young children should be allowed ,14
6073,"advertising is everywhere it influences people and makes them buy some unnecessary stuff but is it right to influence young children by television advertising 

children are very influencable they imitate and copy to learn their dependence from adults is huge small children are not ",14
6074, able to think in a complexe way they often can not even say what they need or want so it is not right to show them television advertising  they will want whatever they see without really knowing what it is they are helpless and can not understand that they are influenced if television advertising gets a normal thing they may be more influencable ,14
6075," they are adults

on the other ",1
6076, they do not have a long term memory when they see the product from the television advertising in a magazine they will not remember the television spot so the advertising may have almost no influence on them ,0
6077, that the advertising adresses the parents they imagine the joy their children will have with the product and maybe they will buy it ,2
6078," to make their children happy

in conclusion i do not think that television advertising toward young children is useful maybe it has a bad influence on them and it would be better to forbid television advertising  but ",14
6079, that it adresses the parents and not directly the children because they can not say what they want ,12
6080, it makes no sense to forbid it      ,12
6081, i can understand why someone would say something like that advertising and its rules is something which is really hard to define many people are getting annoyed if they are watching television and every twenty minutes or ,15
6082, there is about ten minutes of advertisement for some random products and stores but ,11
6083, people are getting annoyed this advertising is ,11
6084, neccesary for the people selling a product and it is working because many people will actually buy the shampoo that they have heard about and not the one that they dont know especially in television there is advertisement for almost everything sure it depends on the channel and on what time of the day or the year you are watching but beause of that it almost seems like a logical conclusion that there is ,11
6085," advertising for products which are demanded by children aged  

in the view of a producer of a product for kids ",16
6086, a doll i totally get the ,18
6087, if you are making advertisement for your doll on a kids channel and around christmas your sales will increase ,20
6088, is that children in that age can be annoylingly demanding and if they see advertising for a toy or on my example a doll they want to have they will beg their parents ,24
6089," it is written down on their wish list for christmas

on the other ",3
6090, works the other way aroud because if you are the parent of one of those kids the situation can be very hard and stressfull everytime your kids watches tv it will see all these fantastic toys and everytime it will come running to you afterwards and beg you for one of them and what should you do now its no good parenting if you always just buy your kid everything it wants but you ,20
6091, dont want to have the same ,18
6092," everytime your kid had watched television or maybe you want to buy your kid that new doll it is always talking about but you just cant afford it as a parent the situation is bad and i can understand why they would make a statement like the one which had been made in the task

as i mentioned in the ",9
6093, it is okay to make television advertising  because ,15
6094, this belong to a free market system and is an important ,23
6095,in the private channels exist a lot of movies for very young children and ,6
6096, a lot of advertisements in this eesay ,11
6097," answer the question wether this should or should not be allowed
on the one ",12
6098, adverisements for young children are no good idea because they are unable to way up the ,8
6099, of the product and simply want to have it ,23
6100, they do not need it the companies use the simple brains of the young children to make them think of their products but ,2
6101, these children have not the money to buy the products they want and ,2
6102," they need their parents money and until the age of five i got no pocket money with this step the problematic becomes much smaller because the childâ´s parents should be able to decide whether this advertised product is necessary or not and if they are not one will have to forbid all advertisements 
another ",2
6103, is that the young children are the customers of tomorrow and with the advertisemnets they get an overview about the varieties of toys sweets or games in our modern world and if you are realistic they will always have to deal with adevertisement ,0
6104," why not start in their early childhood
furthermore ",24
6105, that the adds are not really for the children the companies try to influence the parents if they use the direct speech from television to child and want to make the parents think about spending money for this product wich seems to be directly made for their child because the television says ,2
6106," many humans are really naiv
the only real ",21
6107, the children have to watch the advertisement until they can ,16
6108, watching their movie episode or whatever but this problem counts ,18
6109," it does not support the cons
finally ",21
6110, there is no real risk we live in a free country and should not simply regulate everything becaues we can and ,4
6111," there is a risk it will not happen because the economies influence would stop every law to this issue because they have to be able to earn more money
so ",19
6112, we should not forbid advertisements for young children because it does not make problems because the children have no  money and it even helps them to see the possibilities in stores and to think about their real wishes and like explained at the end the question has no sense becauese nothing wwill ch,16
6113,during the last couple of years television advertising became very popular and today nobody could imagine watching television without seeing any advertising television advertising is made of many different categories ,10
6114," food health fashion and toys especially toy advertising towards young children is a much discussed topic
in the following text ",2
6115," state my opinion on the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

first of all ",15
6116, young children between age two and five shouldnt watch too much television ,17
6117, play with real toys or play outside ,1
6118, that this is way better for their general development and health ,12
6119, that sometimes parents need to take a break and it is an easy way to put your child in front of a television and if in this case its just about few hours a week its totally fine ,17
6120, in my opinion parents always should have on mind that their child gets manipulated by advertising ,16
6121, most of them already have experienced that the child requests much more toys ,20
6122, this isnt just the case in age  ,24
6123, as an adult or teenager for example ,7
6124, you see the new iphone generation in the commercial break and think about your old phone which hasnt got enough space for all the applications you desire you want to buy a new mobile phone ,23
6125," its not the new iphone but just some newer better one but you have to have in mind that as an adult you should be able to resist and as a child which is verey easy to influence you havent really got a chance to resist all the toy advertising

in conclusion my opinion is that you shouldnt allow any advertising on television channels for children because its not fair to influence them ",14
6126," they cant really decide that they dont want to see the advertising
",11
6127," with the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

first of all there are many advertises for young children ",13
6128, in television for example in the city in the radio and you can see advertising for children on the internet that is nothing new there are ,16
6129," many children in the world and it is a big group companys want to make money with 
watching television is for many children something really important and they do it often very much so why should companys must not use this way of advertising anymore esspacialy ",14
6130," the parents decide to buy the product or even not 

but ",9
6131, there are sometimes advertises wich are not that good for children in this age because of different ,2
6132, with this statment because of the ,21
6133,"
is television advertising manipulating our young children


we need to know wich effect television advertising has on the young children aged  ",14
6134, we can decide if it should be allowed or not one of the problem is that its very hard to tell if television advertising has an negative effect on our children if ,13
6135," it shouldnt be allowed 
we can say that the age is the problem why it should not be allowed children in that age cant differencate what they are seeing not like adult person we know that what is sayed on the tv is not always the truth we know that companys often lie about their products in the television advertising to promote them and ",13
6136, to sell more and to gain more money in contrast ,23
6137, young children see something on the tv they can be ,17
6138, facinaded about it that they wont to have it this can become to a problem because the companies can manipulate or childreen they are trying to hunt of the young children with barbies hotweels dolls to sell their products because they know that parents can not resist the wishes of tehir children on one ,20
6139, we can say it sholdnt be allowed but in the other ,21
6140," its very hard to forbit it we can say its impossible
altough advertising on tv can have an negative effect on young children ",14
6141," it shouldnt been forbiten we live in a free world and in a free economy in the ages of internet and youtube the most young children dont even care about tv they dont watch it and the partents can always forbit their young children to see tv    
",17
6142,"everyone knows that parents are not interested in that there young children aged  watch television but should it not be allowed
in our world young children watch television but are they influenced by them ",17
6143," much that they would not play anymore

on one ",19
6144, television has a big influence on young children they want to be like ,17
6145, superman or batman when they watch television they see that the superheroes can fly and want ,18
6146," to fly and probably do not understand that it is not real and that they can not fly without for examo an airplane

on the other ",3
6147, is television a big part of our modern world and everybody watch some series if we do not want that our young children watch television probably we must stop it too or watch only sometimes ,17
6148," sleep 

furthermore young children have the oppertunity to play with friends with their parents or with toys and everybody knows that children have lots of toys so they can use their time better than to watch television they must learn to play with their self and probably they ",1
6149," msut learn to be ennoyed

an other ",18
6150, is the break between the series the children see new toys and want to have them when they would not watch television they would not see this new toys from the market parents clearly not have to buy this toys for their children and they probably not buy them every toy but parents want to make their children happy but that is the wrong way children must learn that they can not have everything they want and that they are not the middle of the world and ,20
6151," they do not learn it in younge age they probably never learn it

in conclusion ",8
6152, that it should not be allowed or that it have olny onetwo hours in the week i ,12
6153, think that young children must learn to play witih them self and to do diffrent things like playing outside or  drawing it is interesting for their life to can do something alone and that they do not have someone to entertain them they must entertain themself ,8
6154,"television advertising is a quite big part of our daily tv programme especially on channels that are meant to be watched by kids there are countless spots about games toys and other inventions that kids might like do kids already understand what they see in tv and how are they influenced by it
while watching tv children may see a new product that they like they are inspired by it and have new ideas of what they could play or paint for example they can find another way to use a toy they already havesuch experiences support the development of the childs creativity and provide it with new ideas 
however ",14
6155," how they are influenced by the media every product seems to be perfect and a lot of fun on tv but they cant see the marketing stategy and the lies that are hidden those children may be disappointed once they recieve their new toy or game
furthermore by showing kids the wide range of toys that exist parents are pressured to come ",2
6156," every of their childs wishes in addition these products often are quite expensive which enlarges the parents problem even more 
to conclude ",9
6157, mention that television advertising should be limited ,15
6158, it is wrong to use naive children to sell as many products as possible without them noticing how they are influenced ,2
6159,"television advertising  influences them in their young years if they see things in television they thinkoh thats cool 
and than they ",0
6160," want this super cool new toy from the ad the children think they need these things to have fun with their friends and to be popular
because advertising want to show them that they absolutely need these things 
television advertising can ",20
6161," give them inspiration that they can build their own opinion of toys and other things
but children shouldnt be influenced by television advertising they should have their own opinion and they shall decide at their own what they like
",0
6162, tv advertising toward young children shouldnt be allowed because the children dont have the possibility to be individual ,13
6163, they are influenced like this its important to show the children to be an individual person ,7
6164,"should television advertising  between the ages of  be prohibited

first of all advertising is not always a bad thing but if we as a society ban a television advertisement for young children we would be censuring the media advertisement is in our favour it is true that companies profit through advertisements but it is their job to sell their goods to us consumers therefore it would be a bad thing to ban advertising which is directed to children because companies have to do marketing somewhere and the best place ",14
6165," is the media

on the other ",19
6166, children can be influenced a lot easier than adults they would automatically want to buy something that showed up in the advertisement thus children would be aggressive and sad ,2
6167, their parents do not buy for them ,9
6168, the pink toy in the toys rus store this would change in some of their behaviour in the future futhermore they would start to not listen to their parents from an early age which does not have the best outcome nevertheless advertisements are boring and definitely not interesting enough for young children ,0
6169, why should companies invest in more advertising and ,11
6170," spend more money on marketing their products if it is not a hundred percent sure whether or not the children and their parents would actually buy the advertised products

to sum up advertisement toward young children should be banned because it would have an impact in their behaviour with their parents and companies would spend more money on advertising their products ",16
6171, they can not be sure if the chidlrens parents would buy their advertised products,2
6172, its not a good idea to set the children ,8
6173, much false and dangerous advertising because the child must have much contact to other children and even to the partens thats the ,16
6174, this statement further in the television advertising there is ,10
6175, much humbug and that shouldnt see young children for example from a movie where real persons were killed or something like this later the young child have much dreams of it or dont dare to be in a dark room ,6
6176, the child goes to bed so now ,1
6177, the television advertising should be more normally than now on much tv channels when the child once look television ,14
6178, the parents should switch to a childchannel like super rtl or kika because there are childfriendly channels which the advertising is more friendly for the child when it is such a channel i would maybe ,17
6179, with this statement but its ,21
6180, not good for such a young child to watch the hole day television the child must have social contact to other childs or sure to his parents but a ,17
6181, the children look to his partens and do is like they do it so ,7
6182, with this statement because there are ,21
6183, much other actvities for such young children ,24
6184, drawing or go in the forest this way the childs could learn something about the nature or something for the future life thats more helpful for the life ,8
6185," discuss the topic of whether young children aged  should be allowed to get directed by television advertising 
since the sienctist know that much information is captured in our brain without that we would even notice it ",13
6186," this is a contraversial question 
first there should be said that watching too much tv isnâ´t good for kids for adults ",17
6187, but for kids even less so do we want our children to watch tv programms frequently however not all the parents have time for their children the whole day they would wish ,17
6188," but its reality so sometimes watching tv seems an thinkable option 
but if the tv channels would not be allowed to show young children ",17
6189," how would they pay their programm the stream of tv shows is very expensive and advertisers pay a lot of money for the advertment so there would be lesser tv shows for kids because they donâ´t make a lot of money with it 
",6
6190, that if there would be lesser tv shows the kids definitly watch lesser tv and like i said too much tv is not good for humans every age because with less variety you would not be able too choose between different shows you allow your child to watch and ,17
6191," you allow your child less tv 
on the other ",17
6192," could it be right that tv shows for kids are able to transport a lot of soicially valunerable lessons often the episodes of tv shows for children are about the moral and the friendly treating of other people about tolerance and courage and that are important things to learn for the process of growingup 
so we just decided that watching tv can sometimes be helpful even ",17
6193," itâ´s not that healthy but should television advertisment should be forbidden 
the poor children watching these programms should not get attacted by the big pharmer and human rights hurting industries i donâ´t even think they underatnd what they are listening but the danger that in this young years during the structure process of the brain some information get stucked in their mind is very high so i donâ´t understand why there should be any advertisment on kids channel because it directs children that are too young to even understand the meaning of it and as a ",14
6194,effect the parents get adreesed too but ,7
6195," it is absurd 
all in all my final ",19
6196, is that there should be no television advertisment directed to children between two and five it is not nessecary and children should watch lesser tv anyway ,13
6197, if they want to bring in the television advertising do it in programms for older people ,10
6198,more and more young children between the age of  watch tv ,17
6199, playing with other kids in the garden or drawing a picture or something like that has this change something to do with the parents who are to busy to look ,8
6200," their children 

when the mother and the father of young children have to work they often cant pay attention to their kids and ",9
6201, they allowd them to watch tv children who can watch tv are mostly calm and because of that the parents can relax ,8
6202, a hard day to watch tv is ,18
6203, less expensive than to pay for a babysitter who look ,9
6204," their kids 
but the negative ",9
6205, of watching television advertising as a young child are strong young children should better use their spare time to play outdoor and together with other kids they should enjoy their age because they have ,14
6206, much energy many children dont understand what the people on the tv want to say and what the background of an advertising is its ,14
6207, that children who see something on tv they like ,6
6208, a special toy they always want to have this and ,20
6209," its difficult for the parents to say no 

i personaly think that young children shouldnt watch tv advertising because they are to young to understand this stuff and they schould learn to play together witch other kids and to see how the nature functions and ",14
6210," state my opinion to wether television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not


of course children ",13
6211, of that age are easy to manipulate and i definetely see the danger in ads for children but ,16
6212, the children are actually manipulated to the ,7
6213, that they would buy a product advertised to them because ,11
6214," of the day the parents are the ones who have to buy something for their children and have to decide what their children are going to get 

apart from that it is important to say that children are influenced from everything around them not just tvads friends family kindergarden and ",9
6215," the series they watch in tv when you say you dont want your child to be influenced by ads you have to keep it locked in a flat room with no windows

also ",14
6216, this kind of advertisement would be allowed parents would or at least should be aware of that ,16
6217, so they can decide to not let their child watch tv ,12
6218," they dont want it to watch those ads 


so ",11
6219, nobody could complain about ads for children in a world that is full of ads and different influences and ,16
6220, you are aware of such things as a parent you can prevent your child from getting in contact with something like that also no child would walk in a store and buy something irrationally simply because they have no money to do ,2
6221,"should young children watch television or not

in todays society it is commun that young children are allowed to watch television during the day or even in the evening for parents is it easier to put on the television ",17
6222, playing a game with their children parents are able to do some cleaning or some work at home ,1
6223, the children are mostly quite by watching television at the opposite it is ,1
6224," important that parents spend time with thier children outside its the only way for children to learn about our nature and dayly situations in real life

another ",8
6225, is to look at the health of young children it isnt healthy to spend all day inside and never get in contact with dirt or bacteria for young between two and fivenit is necessary to get a good immunsystem ,4
6226," they cant get easly sick or ill 
 
as a parent you have to show your children animals nature or a new environnement on televison ",12
6227," it is easier to show those things because you dont have to leave your house but it is never as good as in real life

in my opinion watching television in young age is not a good idea to replace time with parents or other children it can be a possibilty on a cold day but it doesnt have to become a habitant even ",17
6228, it is lot easier as a parent to put on the television im sure that children appreciate spending some time  with their parents without a television or a mobile phone,17
6229,the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed opens a very complicated topic in one ,15
6230, there is a big responsibility for older people to protect younger children against television programs which could have a bad influence to younger people but in the other ,17
6231," interesting television programs for young children which could be helpful to learn a bit better or something like this

in generall ",6
6232, that the most television programs are not ,10
6233, we need to protect our younger people ,12
6234, they cannot see them but ,19
6235, some programs could be very helpful for them ,24
6236," we shouldnt be allowed to hide those programs to younger people

another interesting ",12
6237, with the statement is that younger people shouldnt waste to much time in watching television ,17
6238, many activities like readings books or doing something outside ,1
6239," which are even better than wasting the whole day on television

but im not quite sure whether we are allowed to hide something to younger people because these people could find another way to do this things ",12
6240, talk about television advertising towards young children in my opinion i think advertising is anoying doesnt matter wich kind of advertising but there ,13
6241, are differences if you create advertising for adults they have to deal with it it is nessesary for brandsfactories to advertise to sell their products but it is wrong to create advertising  children or young children they dont understand what advertising is and they just think the product is ,16
6242, great they will ask their parents to buy it and they will probably say no now the children think their parents just dont want them to have fun and they will get mad this is really bad for a family and ,20
6243," i think advertising towards children should not be legal 
but if zou think about television advertising it should be a different discussion if parents let their little children watch tv it is their own fault it is wrong to give young children a tablet or a smartphone and it is ",13
6244," wrong to let them watch tv if these children see some advertising on the tv or in the internet it is the fault of the parents and not the fault of the brandsfactories 
in conclusion i think it should not be allowed to advertise  but television advertising is okay because young children should not even be allowed to watch tv",14
6245,im beggining with some pro ,18
6246,"

no they should not be allowed because these young children are more easy to influence ",12

beautiful colours happy song whitin the advertisments sometimes yust straight lies about products
all in all things and stuff elder people know yust better

by pushing all these advertisments about products into the kids brains they learn that only the price matters on toys not their worth
when this progress proceses this bad influended kids will ever have this revealing damage of not knowing the difference between things costs and what theiy are really worth because there can be large intefferences

childs could get really mad ",2
6248," they dont get the things they want if the parents know things better and its up to hope they do they will be the bad guys because they want whitout any measuring reason their kids to not get these toys

if they get want they want now they will start to want to have other things right ",20
6249, they get those things they wanted ,3
6250,"

now i am giving some contra ",18
6251,"
they should be allowed because in tho most cases their parents sit ",12
6252," watching tv to tell them what these advertised products are really up to

they should be allowed because the kidschannels have to get their money anyways ",2
6253," why not about advertisments

even kids arent that easy to influence ",16
6254," that they want to have everything yust because they yust saw an advertisment they have forgotten already right away

in the end ",3
6255," directed to children in age of  advertisments should not be allowed because these kids have no idea of how the world really works
they of no idea of how does money works at all where does it come from how does thing work that makes the world function even tho i dont really do its better for kids in these age to be in contact with humans ",16
6256," with the tv what they would need to have if they want the see advertisments
actual the telivision has a to strong force about peoples meaning for examples those people who watch really much rtl when kids in the age of two stgart to become bound to the tv they will not have an easy life although it can be pretty frustrating ",10
6257, a kid wants to see this one special episode of whatever and every 15 minutes it has to see some advertisments he gets close related to the these products if they have to do with whatever they see right know all in all advertisment for kids of the age of under 6 is actual pretty bad,0
6258,is it reasonable to advertise things directly towards young children that are easily influenced this topic has been discussed for a long time and today ,16
6259," disscuss it here

first of all you have to think about the childrens well being and health if a child is tricked to believe that certain stuff ",7
6260, candy is really great and healthy because the tv says ,4
6261, it is going to influence the childs eating decissions for all of their life and that would not be ,4
6262, regarding this topic bechause colorful and sweet drinks or foods are often made for children and ,8
6263," advertised towards them

on the other ",11
6264, you could argue that it is the parents responibility to look ,12
6265, their children and they should prevent wrong decisions they should clarify things for their childrens mind and influence them into making right decisions it is not the firms responibility to look ,23
6266," every child and if they sell a product for children they shuold be allowed to market them towards them 

furthermore you should think about morals morally it is not right to take ",16
6267, of children that age or any age they are not grown up ,24
6268," and they do not have the ability to act like an andult if they cant act like an adult you shouldnt be allowed to market things towards them just like towards adults

advertising could ",16
6269, be seen as a promotianal entertaiment and entertaiment may not be forbidden for anyone in that case you would ,21
6270," have to fotbid certain movies and shows that include product placement and that are directed  towards children

in addition marketing toward children could ",13
6271," influence their mindsets towards the world in the future and could move or destroy the self image if a young girl only sees advertising with perfect young woman telling her she should buy this or do this it is going to mess withher mind forever

finally i ",0
6272, think that advertising towards children should only be allowed if the ad is approved by some kind of group that looks  ,16
6273, that it is morally wrong to take ,21
6274, of children but i can ,18
6275, their and teach their children well enough ,7
6276," that they are not influenced by wrong information 

",7
6277,the questioon if advertising for young children should be allowed is a highly debated topic in the following text ,13
6278," comment on that topic

at ",18
6279, we have to mention the bad impact that if the children see ,12
6280," many things they want to own they cant create their own lives because everything is already made up by the advertisers 
but seriously why would children not be allowed to watch advertisement ",14
6281," that the impact of advertisements are not that huge as some people believe its the parents job to not buy their kids everything they want and think of this if the children wouldnt watch those ads everything would be dictated by their parents and i bet that the same criticz would stand up against the parents and want the kids to be influenced by ads 
furthermore i beg you to not come up with the arguement if those children watch adverts they get stupid i believe that if you dont want your children to get stupid by watching ads on television just dont let them watch tv at all and in todays world all these kids own ipads and ",13
6282," on where they watch ads for grown ups and that is what should be stopped

6284,"since the media plays such a big role in our current society and you cant prevent young children from watching tv and being influenced by its advertisment i am asking myself wether tv advertisment for children should be forbidden or not
first of all
people could say that poor familys made not be able to make their children happy anymore because of their growing expectations of what they see on tv and that they could get into some financial problems because of that these children ",14
6285, are not going to be able to stop watching any other commercials ,10
6286," they would have to deal with advertisment for the adults which is not better at all
children could be tempted to think that everything they see on tv is the truth and that they can believe what the tv says it could lead to the ",14
6287, where they think everything they do has to be like in the comercial they saw and maybe are going to lack creativity ,3
6288, be used in another direction where the children learn how to deal with advertisment at a very young age because they are going to be confronted with it for the rest of their lives ,16
6289," it would be bad to just throw them into the cold water 
the advertisment could lead to surroundings where children jugde each other by how many toys they have from ",20
6290," specific brands they saw on tv like lego or playmobil and that this could lead to them always wanting the newest and the best toys there are because they want to be accepted by the others
but ",20
6291, they see the advertisment and get all the information about the toy they want they know how much it costs and they can compare that to other things they see on tv ,0
6292, they could learn how to be responible and to get the best there is with the least amount of money or affort ,8
6293," they get a feeling for how much the toy they play with is actually worth and they learn to respect that 
because of the ",20
6294, it would be useless to try to not allow advertisment for kids on tv,13
6295,when i was a kid i loved to watch tv it was not ,17
6296," important what i watched but more that i could watch and in my experience i was not the only children of my generation which have the same story to tell so for a child it is great to watch tv but is it good for them or should it not be allowed

first i have to say there are more than one ",17
6297, are important for this topic one is the sort of programm a child watch in this age in the young age of two the educational progress of a child is much better than now ,6
6298," everything that the child sees will have a more or less importance for the child so if the parents would show them a savage shooter this would be a catastrophe for the young person but some shows for childs can be good for the experience

furthermore there are some ",6
6299, of quantity to much tv is not really good and healthy for every age ,17
6300," for childs so this is the responsibility of the parents and there are sadly some parents which let her childrens sit behind the tv for hours there are naturally more than one cause for such sceneries like not time or much work or simlpy desinteressting

nevertheless it would be difficult to make a law which not allowed tv advertising sing for young children even tough it would be possible to make this rule it is hard to control such a law so ",14
6301, it is not the responsibility of tv canals to prevent advertising but the parents should look for her childrens on the one ,14
6302, the canals should show less advertising ,11
6303, is is the renponsibility of the parents,9
6304,"television advertising  is it too bad for young children


television is a big part in our daily lives the tv program und advertising have a very big influence on every human even young children from age  are influenced big time 
because of that there are opinions telling how bad the big influence on young children can be and that ",14
6305," advertising for those kids should not be allowed 
of course this is an understandable opinion but are children really influenced as huge as it is told
surely they do behave like it is told in television sometimes but ",16
6306," i do think the biggest influence on them is really given by their parents they are the ones telling them how to behave and how to have a good life and not the television advertisements 
the children should be able to differ between advertising and real life often there is a not existing world shown in television this is the biggest problem of those how have the opinion that television advertising should not be allowed i guess 
but they do have to think about the way children watch television kids at the age of  do not understand everything shown in television they just look at the little movies that advertisements deal with
because of that ",14
6307," advertising for children should be allowed in a helping way they should show the real world and not the fictive worlds because it is very difficult for the young children to differ 
but ",16
6308, television advertising is a normal part of our ilves and even their lives and it should be allowed even for younger children,14
6309,young children need a ot of attention from their parents their siblings and the whole families this can be very difficult and busy in situations in which you do not have a lot of time the problem of children who are looking for attention in such situations can be solved very easily place the child in front of the television ,24
6310," it is quite and you have the time you need to cook your meal tidy your flat or do other housework 
nowadays there are a lot of tvprogramms which are ",1
6311," made for young children there are some happy colorful animals who sing together some songs and your child is happy isnt it perfect for a baby

in contrast to this attitude there is the question if it is a good ",20
6312," to leave your child in front of the television watching some child programms during the family which is responsible for the wealth of the child every time even on busy days is occupied with other activities if they do not have anough time to manage the housework  and their child should they even become babys 
watching television in young ages is totally bad for the childs wealth kids are not able to understand what is happening on the fluckering screen because their brains are not enough educated 

in my opinion watching television as young children should not be a daily activity although i todally understand young mothers who allows their young kids watching television for some reluctant minutes because they are very busy and had to made really important stuff ",17
6313, being a great mother is a big challenge because children needs a lot of time and patience ,8
6314, it is comletely normal that mums allow things from which they know it is not the best thing for their loved child watching television eating sweets  ,17
6315, thing ist that a child feels constantly the feelings of love and belonging,8
6316,"should televison advertising  be allowed or not 
the question is clear of cause the ",15
6317, impression is that it is manipulating these kids also the parents will be involved because their child wants to get what ever is in the show on the other ,6
6318," adults surly can be influenced too so we have to ask ourself not if it should be allowed to direct it toward kids instead we should ask if generally it is a good thing 
furthermore these people who produce these things need it it should be a right to show their products to potential buyers that is how it works without advertising how people could know about it
for kids in age  it isnt a good or bad thing ",16
6319," why not in their live there will be always a way to influence them if not on tv than in the kindergarten or at friedns house
the ",7
6320," is that the kids need to cope with things they cant have they need to learn not to get everything someone wants to sell them later on in life it will be there day in and day out thus they need to learn it early 
also if parents doesnt want their kids to be influended they shouldnt let them watch tv at all 
even more imortant is it to ask should children watch tv without their parents during that age 
furthermore what is the fifference between five and six and how could they possibly manage it if the kids see something for older ones they ",17
6321, want it also some kids are ,18
6322," an other ones or they want things which are normally for younger ones 
for the conclusion it souldnt be forbidden television advertising is influencing young and old ones there is no line that we can say these ones yes and the other ones no parents should be capable to leed them into the right direction",13
6323,"and once again five minutes of bright clips of dolls and guns are being seen on the tv screen loud noise and colorful lights explain in a very disturbing manner five yearolds why this or that toy should be bought and it seems like they actually succeed kids today grow up with media with advertising with the internet and many more things but should it be allowed to manipulate little kids into buying to manipulate them into the world of capitalism and consum in that early stage of life on tv

in my opinion yes

my main ",14
6324," that this a new age it is simply not comparable to the childhood of my mom it is a new form of danger yes but children should be as fast as possible be able to deal with that kind of influence

others will argue that children have no understanding for this up until this ",12
6325, with that i grew up with television and i understood very early that ,6
6326," of all television advertising is annoying concidering its length and how often it is placed i simply never thought of it as a platform to find new things second of all children are way to selfcentered to constantly even care about what some people tell you there 

yes ",14
6327," sometimes i saw something and was tempted to buy it but buying it would have needed my mom and it was her resbonsibility to teach me how to consume in a good way you cannot simply turn off ads fearing your child might get spoiled parents need to confrot this topic as early as possible

what i often heard ",2
6328, was that parents are tired of their children begging for things they might have seen on tv crying for attention and material things a world in which children are only satisfied ,9
6329, they hold the toy they ,20
6330, desperatley wanted in their tiny hands well parents ,9
6331, that had to fight in world war ii ,18
6332, there is any room to file complaints about being bothered by your children who want stuff stuff that you could potentially buy because we are living in the ,9
6333," world  priviliged in most ways

which brings me to the ",21
6334, nowadays it is not just television ads its youtube ads that can influence our children or a billboard maybe only an oldfashioned ad in a magazine if you want to protect your child from all this you would have to move into the woods there is no ,14
6335, in only not allowing television ads you ,15
6336, go all the way or you drop it this is the century of the media and is protecting your child in this way really the ,12
6337,"

and more importanty i wonder if this question is even relevant there is no way companys will stop making these ads so what are we even talking about we should ",11
6338," talk about how to introduce children to the media which i now often recommended and pointed out parents need to learn that there is no other way the internet keeps growing smartphones are a part of our every teeanger sometimes even childrens lifes now if that is wrong or right should not be the topic of the discussion accept it and deal with it 

what strikes me probably the most about this question is that less and less people watch tv it is going to die eventually 

meaning no allow ads directed to children on tv confont them talk to them and make them grow up with it ",17
6339, they are not heavily disturbed ,1
6340, they are old enough to dive into the world of social media etc the actual world of manipulation and mainstream movements ,24
6341,first of all it has to be said that adults are responsible for their children so if a child around the age of  is watching television ,17
6342," his or her parents are responsible for this so why should it be forbidden is the influence on these young children to big or can they handle it
on the one ",12
6343, against advertising would be that young children can not decide whether something is good or wrong so an advertise is influencing them more than older people who are educated and responsible for themselves so because they can not decide if the advertise is good for them it should be forbidden another ,13
6344, would be that their parents have to controll their children all the time ,7
6345," they want to watch television because they can not know if there is a rude advertise so to stop them the parents have to watch their children all the time
on the other ",17
6346, this really should not be a problem with television advertising young children can learn what different things there are on television and they can even learn something from it maybe they see their ,14
6347," birthday presenttheir future dream job or even a good education plattform so advertising does not have to be negative if there has not been television advertising than they would just watch more movies or series 

to conclude this topic ",0
6348, mention that the state should not be responsible for two or five year old children by making laws that forbidd television advertising ,13
6349, that the parents of our community are the only ones who should say what is right or wrong for their children but clearly it can influence little boys and girls ,7
6350, they see advertises that are not made for them so to be really sure that your children is not watching any advertise you have to stop them from watching television and let them play outdoor where they can learn even more from the real world because this is what life really is about to go out and experience the different ,14
6351, write about television advertising dirercted toward young children this topic is difficult because ,14
6352, their are children who have to be protected and ,12
6353," their are the producents the companies which have to sell their toys

television advertising is absolutly normal nowdays but if children are in the focus there are huge problems
first chrildren are easy to manipulate and this is nothing than maipulation the companies which are publishing a new toy and praise this in the television they want the children to buy this 
another ",14
6354, is that the german law declares that children are not be able to save them selves from influenes from outside as well as this their are ,12
6355, under the protection of their parents the parents have the ability and ,9
6356, that they must protect their children from these influenses now you could say that the parents are ,7
6357, do that and why the state has to forbit the advertising for child toys yes you could but many parents are unably to know sometimes what is good or not many very young parents or single mothers or fathers have to time to be there for their child and ,20
6358, they set them down in front of the tv and the child watches tv without any protection this is maybe the minority but there are some outside and they ,17
6359," must be proctected 

also the companies have other ways to raise their sells the advertising should showed for the parents or for adoults not for their children the parents can realize what is what their are showing

all in all ",16
6360, it is helpful to forbit the television advertising which are directed  in an age of  these children should not be allowed to decide what is good or bad they parents have to do this and the state should help the parents at this ,13
6361,companies spend  a lot of money on advertising and one of the major advertising platforms is the television during the advertising breaks they try to reach several different customer groups not only acccording to their age ,10
6362," to their education living standard and relationship status but should it be allowed for the enterprises to stream advertising in television which is directed  or schould it be forbidden

first of all you should ask the question if the young children understand what is meant with the advertising do they realize that it is played and not real during the early years a child is influenced by many factors how do the parents treat them what are the doing in their free time how do the friends treat them and ",14
6363, what they see in the television during this process the personality of the children is formed now is it good for a child to see that another child has the newest bycycle and it has to ,8
6364, drive the one from two years ago this could lead to some serious problems ,18
6365, that the child is depressed because it never gets new things ,8
6366," its parents which can not afford a new bycycle for it

but you could ",9
6367," say that if you are allowed to advertise directing all the other age group why shouldnt you be allowed to direct small children for the companies it could be highly profitable because children can be very hard to shut down if they want something and if a child sees another child having fun with something they want to have this kind of thing too to have fun 

from my ",16
6368, of view it should be allowed to advertise directing young children as long they are themed and made according to their age for example that no violence is shown or something illegal happens and why not make an advertise for the new bycycle or just a chocolate bar as long the children are not afraid of it it should be allowed,16
6369,influences from the new media ,6
6370, from ads has already become a big part in our live ,11
6371," me often does not realise it but should we let the media have such a huge influence towards young children too in the following i will answer the question if televison advertising towards young children should be allowed or not

first of all its true that children aged around four years usually dont really know what money is how it works and that their parents dont have infinite money ",14
6372, they see something on tv and are like i want that now no matter what you say now and drive their parents insane furthermore is it true that children should not get anything they want ,20
6373," their parents got the money for it

but its ",9
6374, true that tv ads are not the only ads towards children that may have a great influence and tend to annoy their parents until they just want to scream at them in our time its not that unusual that kids even that age are given a tablet pc with some kids games like talking cats and jumping little monsters and if you ask me thats just fine but those apps are usually for free ,14
6375, they contain ads and the producers now that children are playing their games ,6
6376," there are usually some ads for children there too so the problem isnt just the television

furthermore there are many other opportuinities to force parents to buy useless things theyre children dont need eg the in germany ",14
6377, called quã¤ngelzone is one of them if you walk into a store at least here in germany there is usually a huge billboard ,11
6378, to the cashier containing lots of candy ,18
6379, the customer waits for paying his items his kid is watching at all those chocolate ,9
6380, to him and will start asking for some until his father is ,9
6381, stressed out that he will say yes and that is just one of many opportuinities just have a look at the advertising strategys in the shopping centre its everywhere ,18
6382," stopping just the tv ads would prevent nothing

the last ",15
6383, to argue is if thats even an important question i mean clearly its arguable if there should be such a huge influence from brands and famous products but is that really the thing that is putting children in danger is it there where we should start to protect them how about dangers on the internet which is nowadays used ,12
6384, much by children and theyre parents dont have a clue what they are even doing there another example related to the tv is what you can see on tv ,6
6385, the ads in germany you are allowed to send nearly anything ,11
6386, they send nearly anything and even what you can watch ,18
6387, that time is very questionable and often disgusting you have naked people dark horror storys and even the news may disturb little children and you may say yeah but i control what my sondaughter is watching id go like dont fool yourself ,17
6388, protect them from watching ads thats not the ,13
6389, all its definetly arguable if you should forbid tv ads because they have many cons but if you forbid tv ads ,15
6390, please forbid anything else that may have some influence on children too and please ,4
6391, take care of the real dangers ,18
6392, you play the godparent who is just annoyed by his or her child wanting more and more stuff in our world its naive to think that you can avoid the media and ,7
6393, calm down a bit and focus on the real problems,18
6394,one qustion is really often asked shoud tv advertising  aged  be allowed in the following text i show my opinion about this topic and present my ,15
6395,"

first of all many people may say tv advertising toward young children could be a negative ",14
6396, it might be boring for parents or other adults another ,1
6397," is if the breaks between the episodes are to long the children would likely lose the interest in seeing this channal

this ",6
6398, part i show the other sideâ´s ,21
6399,"

firstly tv adverting could be helpfull for the children learning to speak the children could ",0
6400," speek about their birthday or christmas wishes and this would be very great action for parents who donâ´t know what they should give their children secondly the tv advertiving toward young children might help in the education to modern western mass consumers it would help the children to assimilate themselves into the mass consumption community really early thirdly the children would be selected by their gender und could get differnet advertising the gender mainstreaming would be sificantly helped the children would be helped in their development finally it is the parentâ´s decision if there children are allowed to watch tv and advertising no child is forced to see tv advertising

in conclusion you see ",14
6401, speeking against tv advertising toward young children the most ,13
6402, are for the advertising and this is exactly my opinion about this topic,11
6403,iâ´m going to dicuss the statement television advertising s young children aged  should not be allowed ,13
6404," text

first of all one could say that the young children havenâ´t got any idea of advertising ",16
6405, they would be beeinflusst even ,19
6406," the parents doesnâ´t want that itâ´s possible that the children would own all things they see in the television but sometimes the parents havenâ´t got enaugh money to buy those things or itâ´s even possible that the children have got enaugh ie toys so the children could get sad if the donâ´t get what they want and the parents would feel bad if they canâ´t buy the things what the children want

on the other ",17
6407," the children could get new ideas for toys maybe as a birthday present or for christmas 
and maybe they could share the toys with other children in their age which already own them 

in conclusion one could say that the ",20
6408," for advertising in the television  are stã¤rkerbecause in reality no children would own all toys they these anywhere and for the erziehung is it sometimes better not to erfã¼llen all wishes of the children

my opinion is that television adversitsing  should be allowed if itâ´s not too much in my childhood i saw advertising of toys in the television too and i didentâ´t want to own all things i found it even cool to look at these toys in the television because i werenâ´t interested in the most things i saw  ",14
6409," explain my opinion on the topic of advertisements for young children in television
an ",14
6410, of the people creating those advertisements could be that children are just younger people ,16
6411," they should get advertisements as the grownups get them too 
but an ",16
6412, against it could be that children get influenced by those advertisements in a bad way so ,16
6413, an advertisement for a car for children which is maybe bad for the environment they are simply too young to understand that this is not a good thing they are just ,2
6414," overwhelmed by the effects and the happy children in the advertisement that they think that this must be something good
that is why i believe many people think that advertisements for children should be forbidden they get influenced right from the ",16
6415, of their lives and are not able to make up their own opinion on things so this will ,3
6416," they are adults 
also it is just wrong in an ethical way to force young children to have the opinion on things that the media want them to have because ",12
6417," it is always the goal to make those children critical and make them really think about whether something that is being told to them is true or right

so ",7
6418, with the statement because they are too young to understand and its ,7
6419, easy to influence them in a bad way it is better for the whole society to forbidd advertisements for young children ,16
6420," and maybe change something in the world for good
but probably the creators of those advertisements and the whole company will make it very difficult to forbidd those advertisements at all ",11
6421,nowadays television advertising is commun in quite every country and for every type of person so there are ,10
6422, lots of adds s children but is this ok or should this be not allowed there are diffrent ,12
6423," for and against this and in this essay i try to explain some of these so for exemple the infulence on the children with the result that they want to have everything 
firstly advertising directed children influence them a lot as a result ",0
6424, they want everything they see in the television this causes a lot of discussions with the parents and if they do not get that the classmates would mob them because they have not got all the new things so this causes a lot of trouble with the parents ,24
6425, with the colleques it is hard to show a child that it could not get this article because it do not understand this so it will end in tears and a big catastrophe as a resualt the parents are probably going to buy it ,9
6426," the goal of the sellers is achieved 
as i have shown this type of advertising and influencing is ",11
6427, a good tool to sell a lot nevertheless ,23
6428, we should not alllow television advertising  children firstly the cannot buy things themselves and ,14
6429, there are too many discussions with the parents and unhappy chidren ,8
6430, nevertheless there are many sellers who need this type of advertising to sell there products in my opinion advertising for childproducts but toward the parents would be a middleway so the parents are ,16
6431, influenced and would probably think about buying it but there will not be that much discussions with the kids the sellers could sell their products even this way futhermore there are ,2
6432," other types of advertising so if it is forbidden in tv  there would be other ways to make adds  children 
to sum up i can say that it is not good if we make advertising directred towards children in tv but we should allow it ",14
6433, in newpapers etc we should find a compromiss ,23
6434,television advertising towards children is a complex topic some people think it should not be allowed for children aged  in the following ,13
6435," allowed and some why forbidden

on one ",21
6436," it ist very important for the marketing to manipulate young children it is the easiest way to sell a produkt it is less complicatet to make a child to want a product than a parent but the child can manipulate hisher parents to buy the product

on the other ",2
6437, it is unfair to manipulate young children to buy products they do not need in the advertisement the product looks ,2
6438, amazing and it seems you need it to have fun that is all what the children see they are not old enough to decide is it unsefull or not so they want this toy ,20
6439," and they go to their parents so what parent would say no you can not have it to his own child
also advertising in television never shows the reality so in television advertises you lie to the watchers because of that you lie  children which are too young to understand that it is not the reality that you will not have friends or fun just by having that product

in conclusion ",2
6440, that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed it is just a easy way to manipulate parents to buy something for their children by using the children which cannot decide how usefull the product is,13
6441,"more and more childrens get influenced by the television adverising thats what i hear sometimes from young parents
but is that correct and should we forbit that
in the follwowing ",17
6442," for an some against this statement

",21
6443," to this topic isthat we cant be sure that these young children understand the advertising and became influnce

but if it is ",16
6444," for this statement
the first and really important ",21
6445," are the false impressions trough the advertising of drugs like alcohol or cigaretts they could think its a good thing so the chance to comsume these drugs in the became more attractive
in addition another problem is the much showimg of food the childrens watch to ",2
6446," many unhelathy food that they became influence and eat more and more of them that they could get overweight in the near future they lost their natural kind of eating
in this case they learn that the people have to be beutyful neraly perfect like these in the advertising they study it ",23
6447," the little childhood
the last an and even bad ",8
6448," is that they see many new and all times better toys as they just have they want to get the new better and cooler toys they would be never happy about the things they already have 
if we look into the future the familiys which have not enough money to buy their childrens ",20
6449," many new things the childs would have complexes of less
 ",8
6450,"the advertising in television can be seen from everybodey who is watching the right program also childre4n between two and five years old are able to see this advertisment is that good for them

advertisments have an influence on everybody who is watching the adult people are able to know how to work and live with these information but young children maybe arenâ´t able to see the difference between the shown world in the advertisments and the realitiy they canâ´t understand the task of advertisements and interpretate them in a wrong way these wrong understandig can have a bad influense for there coming life they maybe can understand from an advertisment about chocolate or other sweets that unhealthy food is good and makes happy the advertisement gives the children no chance to get informed about the negative ",14
6451, of the products they only shows the good and happy world you might have using the product but ,23
6452," that is a problem the children thing that if you use the product everything would change like in the advertisment but that ist wrong and the children arenâ´t able to understand that 

but ",2
6453, is the television advertising a part of the life of a normal person and later of the children too so why shouldnâ´t they learn ,14
6454, early as possible how to understand these advertisments when it wouldnâ´t be allowed to show these advertisments  than there would be a ,11
6455, the children were able to watch this advertisings and arenâ´t ,16
6456," in the higher age able to understand this in the right 
way if they learn very early how to understand they will later have nearly no problems 

",24
6457,on every channel you can see fucking television advertising its not fucking funny you kow the concern or wheever  is behind this advertising will make lots of money but they ,10
6458," give aout a lot of many becaus advertising special in the televison is very expenive

children are ",14
6459," young and they cant make a difference between reality and and this shit they send on tv 
",7
6460," its like a kind of proboganda in tv television advertising  should not be allowed becaus the young children today are oure futur  also a lot of parents are working and didnt know what the children of them is wathing on tv the big concerne arent interesst in what is happen whith this kids later the only thing they interesst is to make money to make a lot of money 

so that was the negative ",14
6461, thinking about this topic for several minutes i havent a good ,21
6462, televisin advertising  should be allowed only one ,15
6463, tell you some times this advertising is a ,11
6464," fucking damn shit that i only can lough about this some times i ask myself what kind of a bastard you must be to make a advertising like this i saw 

 so you can see im not a big fan of this advertising on television ",11
6465,nowadays if you watch television there are many adverts adverts for shampoo cars new technologies ,11
6466," the children can not even afford these things

",9
6467, it is actually strange to advertise directly toward young children first of all many of the children wont be able to even understand the advert they just see something in the television like a toy and they want it it is kind of manipulating that is why advertising  is actually pretty brilliant nevertheless children aged  normally do not have money ,16
6468, their parents have to buy them toys and i remember from my childhood that i was able to get many toys by just crying and the interesting thing about it is that i rarely played with the toys which i saw in television i received so the television actually manipulated me too the advert showed a kid playing with a toy i somehow noticed that this kid was happy and because it is in human nature to reach happiness my brain connected the toy and the happiness as a result i tried to get the toy too however adverts about toys which manipulate young children can ,20
6469, be useful for their parents maybe the parents are looking for a new toy they want to give the child as a present for birthday or christmas in this ,20
6470, of view such an advert is pretty useful nevertheless there are just few parents who watch these kind of tv channels for kids ,14
6471," they possibly wont even see the advert

in conclusion there should be more such adverts in tv channels for parents because ",16
6472, that it is a better ,21
6473, to show the parents what toys there are because they have to buy them than manipulate young children and give them the feeling of needing something they actually do not even need,20
6474, taht in the usa or in outer countrys children acting is very popular mostly are behinde evrey childhoodstar a strong mother or father witch push the children to go one or to bee better than outhers the children have ,6
6475, a dificuld live and not a normal childhood if you see a smilling on the face of a childerstar you can not sure that this smailing are reel  because they are trained ,7
6476, this are the resaons  i am ,18
6477," with taht televiosion advertising diseted toward young children should not be alloed
so i said behinde every childrenstar are parents or one parentpart witch push her child to do this the child can not dicide be her own because they have not the mentale talentd jet so they do waht they parents said because they trust them and belive parents are allways right they have no mobilitys to say waht they want ",14
6478, allon shoud be strong enough to push tis disishon to a ,19
6479,"
that the children do waht outhers people want they have not a normel childhood so they go to spezial kindergarden or scholssometimes they not even have enogh time to play with outuers childs because they have to go with her parants to a shoting or to a casting for an outer roll this children have to learn in a age of two waht is mean to sit quiet on a chair and not waht is mean to play with outers the oll day long it is that the right way for a child to grow up ",8
6480," not
what ever i said here it dosent metter even the child is not happy but that is the dificult part ",9
6481," you can not be sure taht this children are happy because they trained this for castings ect mostly the chids had all toys they want because they earn many jet but they can not reely paly with them are thise children happy with this waht they do and waht they have 
",20
6482, a children shoud have a childhood and not a perfekt futre in the show bisnues they shoud have fun because in the childhood is the only time your live is perfekt if your are growing up the mashic of the wolrd goes a way ,6
6483,so the question is if television advertising  aged  should not be allowed let us discuss about it and look at the ,15
6484," 

firstly young children can be easily manipulated without noticing it they could use this ",7
6485," to influence the kids to buy stuff they do not really need and it is not their money they use it is money from their parents so the parents have to buy stuff the do not need the children do not really understand the economy system and in cause of that they will get sad if they do not get the things they want to have 

on the other ",9
6486, the parnets are the ones who decide if they buy these stuff for their children they have the authority to tell what their kids can have and what not so no matter what the children see in the advertising they have to ask ,2
6487, they can have the advertised stuff even if the kids get sad or angry the parents get the same problem ,2
6488," they go shopping with their children but there it is more embaressing 

what ",9
6489, could be important is the ,21
6490, that parents have to deal with the complains of their children it can be stressing if the kid always argues about things he wants but this is a question of how to raise a child and this have every parents to deal with if you do not want to deal with stress ,8
6491," you should not have children 

eventually it does not really matter if there are television advertising because the child do not have the power of buying everything they want it is the decide of the parents ",14
6492,  advertising is a good way for the companies which are running the tv shows to get money and ,10
6493, they can use the money for even better shows ,19
6494,"today the television is not that popular like in the past especially the youth views much more youtube videos or videos on social media plattforms in comparerision to the television but one big problem for all this media plattforms is advertising sometimes it feels like there is more advertising than the movie itself the question of the essay is if television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
first of all how should it be controlled which channel the kids are looking the only possible way without beeing really expensive is a channel ",14
6495," for kids aged two tow five the young kids should not watch television at all they should play with other things because in this young age it is important to learn basic things although the advertise is made for everyone only the advertise for people over 18 is late in the evening 
",14
6496, advertising  aged  should not be allowed because they should learn the ,16
6497," steps about life there should be a channel for kids with kids programm only and without advertise
as a conclusion i can ",6
6498,"should it be allowed to have ads which are directed towars young aged two up to five years old children

as you watch tv television u probably have seen many commercials they used to be s older people like teenager or adultes but they are getting directed more and more towards young children is this okey should there even be ads for this kind of viewers im trying to find answers to those questions

 with the help of those ads parents or realtives have it quite easy to find gifts and presents
lets say your cousine has birthday in 2 days and you dont know what to get her in an instances she sees an ad for a new barbie which she likeswants without breaking your head and even ",16
6499," not finding something good you know what to get her

those ads are ",18
6500," helpful for the parents because of those ads parents are up to date with the toys which are popular 
imagine your daughter wants a scooter and you decide that youll get her one but which model you dont want to end up with an old unpopular one which she wont like at all 

 but its quite known that ads show toys etc differently better 
they often show things in commercials which arent there in the real toy for example in the commercial youll see a legocastle with moving princesses sure they are writing down that they cant move but those young childrens probably wont see that and are impressed with the moving toys they dicide that they want it and as they get it they are disappointed

 children dont know the value of money
they will see these toys and want em they dont know that their parents may not have enoght money for it because of that they get sad 

",0
6501, ads for young children aint bad but lets be honest here they are often done out of a false idea they dont want to show the kids the toys no they want to sell it to the kids they often use effects to make the toys better than they really are with the idea in their mind to directly sell it to the kids they often dont care whether the kid will be disappointed or not they just want to get money out of em to sum it up ,16
6502, commercials are good because they show kids and their parents whats great at the moment because of that i think commercials directed s should be allowed not the ads should be prohibit no they effects they use to make the toys cooler as they are should be prohibited,14
6503,"many people have a television and watch tv every day allthough many parents take care of the children because they donâ´t want them to see bad things from which they will get nihtmares because of this many people discuss about the question if it should be allowed to show television advertising toward  between the age 
one thing is that it is unnessacary to say that only children betweeâ´n two and five are not allowed to see this advertising because many young children donâ´t realize what they see in tv it would be more logical to make this persicion for children between six and nine
an ",14
6504," theme is that the children collect in the age many expierience and talk about that in the kindergarten and some advertising they coulnâ´t understand and maybe they are confused about what they see
an other ",8
6505, against this is that young children shouldnâ´t sit for the tv the whole  day because they can play outside or meet freins and ,17
6506, on so it would be really unnessacary to make advertising ,11
6507," agegroup
because of all these themes i have the opinion that it should be not allowed to make advertising  aged  ",16
6508,young children nowadays spend their time in front of the tv more frequently than in the past during this time they are confronted ,17
6509, with the television shows s them ,6
6510," advertising clips geared towards young kids some say these television adverts should not be allowed 
on one ",14
6511, the television adverts give the children the opportunity to find toys that they would like to have and that they could wish for for their birthdays christmas or other holidays it broadens their knowledge of things they ,0
6512, wouldnt know about on the other ,18
6513, these advertisings can lead to the young children developing a need that they ,16
6514, wouldnt have for those material things they create a sense of importance for material things in the childrens minds this can go ,8
6515," to children getting jealous of and starting fights with other children for having toy xy that they saw in a certain television advertising
television advertising is always a manipulation and deceive of the viewer to some extent adults and adolescents are able to see past the appealing ",2
6516, of the product being advertised young kids ,16
6517, lack that ability to judge and are ,3
6518, bombarded with information that they cant properly comprehend a child viewing ,7
6519, an advert for popsicles in rainbow colours will want these popsicles just for their colour ,11
6520," adults and adolescents will be able to tell that the rainbow popsicles will taste like any other popsicle of the same flavor
i believe that television advertising s young children should not be allowed because of the negative effects it can have on the child",16
6521,"while watching tv young children are exposed to advertising s them should these adds be allowed

",14
6522, children that young do not watch a lot of tv on the other ,17
6523, young children might be more influenced by television advertising than adults for me television adds are annoying and have always been ,14
6524," i barely watch tv and dont think that tv adds influenced me at any time we dont want to pay for our tv programms and they have to earn money somehow it might even be a good preparation for the kids for their future life during wich they will be confronted with loads of adds and will therfore need to keep distance

if you think television adds are bad for your child just dont let it watch tv what it doesnt know it doesnt miss there are many other things to be discoverd",17
6525,nowadays watching tv is normalevery child ,17
6526, at an young age is watching tvwhen they watching series or film which ar made for kids the topic of the media is made for kids and there are no ,17
6527, why theire shouldnt be allowed to watch them between series or movieparts there normaly are breakes for advertisingin the afternoon and in the evening there are adds for every type of products at some sender there are no breaks for advertising an example ,10
6528, is kika threre are no breakesnot even for something like puppy and ,18
6529, this is because kids could be influenced easily by the clever marketing of the comanies for kids it is very importent to have an peaceful childhood which is not influenced by addswhen young kids see a lot of advertisments maybe they want to have all these cool things from the tv and ,2
6530, they are never happy with what they own tvsender like kika choose the right why for making tv for kids but the mayority of the tvsender is presentinng advertisments all the time and for these its important to ssend adds ,17
6531, it must be allowed the responsebility is by the parents for looking ,12
6532, their children and what they do or watch  ,7
6533,"televison advertising  schould not be allowed is the thema of this essay

so why shouldnt it be allowed whats wrong about that agreeing or disagreeing the problem is that kids are really easy believing and ",13
6534, easy to beinflussen next negativ part is about generaly watching tv in young age the kids are sitting in front of the desktop and dont have to have own ideas or dont even have to play somthing the tv has something really magnificant even for older persons altough there are negativ parts there are ,17
6535, many good parts if there is televison advertising  kid  shows which learn you words or things about animals can be a great oppertunity for the kids to learn by themself even they havent been ,6
6536," to elementary school when kids see things on the tv and choose that they want for exampel the toy whats wrong about also you cant have to be in fear that your kid will hurt him because heshe is savely on the sofa 

in my oppinion it should not be allowed because i think that these kids shows arent what the kids will help in ",17
6537, live they should have own ideas and should chose by themselfs what they like and what not ,12
6538, on the statement there are ,21
6539, many overweight kids as never ,24
6540, also a negativ auskirkung from watchin tv ,18
6541,"the question if television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is very complicated because it may influence what young children think and learn in their early years and this could change them for the rest of their lives

there is no doubt that it isnâ´t that good for young children to watch tv because they can get sick or they only want to do this all day long but in some cases itâ´s very good and helps to develop the child and but it on a better way for his future ",14
6542, that the programmchannel which the children watch is important because if they watch somethign like spongebob firefighter sam or other series and films from this category it could have a bad influence on them because there is no real content int this type of movies and it is only funny and for any form of education but ,6
6543, there are documentarys on bbc or national geo about ,19
6544, wild animals from afirca asia or there are documentarys about the history of all live on the earth and this is a good type of tvprogram for the childs because they learn something about the earth and the history and may can think by themselves about the earth and maybe they start early to think about how to deal with todays world problems like clima change or bad enviormental behaviour ,6
6545," they can maybe influence it better 
but as a counter to this ",19
6546, you can say that most of the children are to young to understand it right and the only important thing for them is to watch tv but ,7
6547, because many young children are very smart and some of them can  think about complex task like adults so i have no sided opinion about this because i think it depends ,8
6548, on the childs which watch tv and ,17
6549, how they use this informations given to them from the documentarys the ,23
6550," are the adults which mostly choose the program for their child because they can direct the development of their child to a better direction by choosing the right program for their child 

but if i had to choose one ",8
6551, you have the right program their is no porblem wiht this question,18
6552,"advertisement has become a debated tobic in our modern society most specificly in the world of television advertisetments inspire people from all ages to buy a product which they sometimes dont even need especially children are easy to be manipulated by advertisements the question is should television advertising  be prohibited in this essay i will list the pro and cons and come to a rational conclusion

for a start children in the us and all over the world spend a lot of time in front of their televisions watching their shows once in a ",15
6553," the show stops and some loud advertisements fill the room with an annoying sound children go to their parents and scream about new toys they have been seeing in the television that is a problem because most of the children are not capable to understand that they are just tricked into buying some cheap toys so the children are manipulated by the brainwashing advertisements to spend money

on the other ",6
6554," how are tv studios which air a children show supposed to earn money or creators of kids shows or movies that would damage the whole television industry because children entertainment makes up a big part of this business

in conclusion ",6
6555, it is cruel to manipulate children i must say that it wouldnt work to ban television advertisments because it would create great finincial losses for different participants,13
6556,"we live in a world in which we can not live without the newest technology you will find it everywhere
ipods iphones tvs and more
people started reading books on their ipads or ibooks they are not reading real books anymore 
in a few years everything will change 

the ",23
6557," is that children do not know whats right or wrong 
with advertising they can change childrens mind and their opinion wouldnt be right or honest 
what the children see on television seems right for them

 ",24
6559, with the statement on top of the page ,21
6560," it is not right to direct advertising  because they can not seperate which part in the advertising is true and which one is not correct and the people of the industry only mentioned it to make the product more interesting for the user
",11
6561, most of the advertising which is directed  belongs to toys or other things to play with but these things costs money and the children donâ´t pay for them by themselfes because they do not earn any money and in the age of  they donâ´t even got pocket money the parents would pay the toy ,0
6562," with it
even if the kids are older than five and get pocket money of their parents ",9
6563," itâ´s not fair to manipulate them just because the toy industry wants to earn more money 
many toys are really expensive and sometimes they arenâ´t as good as the advertising promised in that case the children could be sad and ",20
6564," they lost their money on a toy which is not that what they wanted
the innovation of new products is really fast there are coming more and more toys and kids canâ´t seperate between those which are really good and will last you forever and the ones which are not good so they always want to have everything and because their parents wont buy it for them they will have an arguement 
because of my ",20
6565," for and against television advertising it is an controversial theme because it  between two and five

these arenâ´t the right pictures for a young child as well there are trailer for films or series who are dangerous and children arenâ´t old enough for films of this types for example the children see blood and canâ´t handle with these pictures they are afraid of this and maybe canâ´t sleep anymore 
but it is difficult because young children nearly only watch tv shows for children and there arenâ´t any advertisings who arenâ´t for their age as well itâ´s possible that they donâ´t understand the advertisings for alcohol and things like that so it isnâ´t a problem that young children watch television advertisings 
",14

6570,there are many advertisements in television ,10
6571, the ads are for every age group some of them are specialized towards adults some for teenagers and others for little kids the problem with these advertisements is that the little kids are often fascinated by the big amounts of advertisements ,16
6572, they always want to watch more and have the things which are shown in the adverts that is one of the biggest problems with modern television advertisements the little kids are building up a kind of addiction to the tv ,14
6573, theyre not in the age to understand and fully know whats happening in the advertisements ,16
6574, most of the parents arent even allowing such little kids to watch tv for ,17
6575, long most of the kids are only allowed to watch one episode of teletubbies or sandmann in their freetime ,17
6576," they dont even encounter advertisements which try to get the kids attention
on the other ",16
6577, many parents mostly in socially lower parts of the society do not really care what their kids are doing all over the day ,24
6578, the kids turn on the tv and watch it all day until they encounter advertisements after that they want all the new things shown to them in the adverts and if the parents are willing they buy all the stuff the kids wish for themselves as you can see there are always two ,0
6579, of the medal but as a responsible parent whom most hopefully are the kids dont even come close to the advertisements until theyre at an age where they understand everything in tv and know that it isnt always real what is shown there so ,0
6580, there is no need to shut down the advertisements directed to children because its in the parents interest to do their prarenting right,13
6581,when young children see things they canâ´t think about it in an abstractly way they take it as a true statement so it would be the same ,7
6582, they see a television advertising surely there have to be positive ,11
6583, that they learn early to decide what is right and what is only made for advertisings their parents could and ,7
6584, should help them by learning it all in all it is the excercise of parents to take care for their children commercial creator try to show prducts as good as possible it is like the zine at supermarkets at the end children are the best chance for advertising creator to sell new products on top of this no mother or father could say no ,0
6585, â´their children want to have something and look to them with their big blue eyes ,9
6586, you canâ´t say wheather it is true or fals to show television advertising to kids of course ,13
6587," you show ut it have to be the right advertising  which is good for they age the topic bring an other topic with it the question how long children from age  should sit in front of television television and expecially advertising show a picture of life children donâ´t know how itâ´s really is when they sitting all days the whole day on television they have no time to go outside they canâ´t explore the wourld and get own experiences 
to put it into a nutshell ",14
6588, that it is better to show children aged  as less as possible of television advertisings ,13
6589, it is okay to show children programmes or show in television but ,17
6590, thier is an advertising break they should go outside ,11
6591, that they can learn early in their lifes to make breaks and find out that their are a lot of ohter things to meet ,8
6592,nowadays there are a lot of choices on what you want to  watch at tv especially children love watching it but ,6
6593, the channels dont only show movies or documentaries more and more there is a lot of commercials and advertising between two programs i can say about myself that i know many advertising quotes from different companies and ,10
6594," theyre easy to remember 
young children may be more influenced by commercials than older people ",0
6595, the question is wether television advertising  should not be allowed ,15
6596, its a good idea not to show tv ads for children younger than five years or maybe even older eg until seven years most children like everything theyve seen at tv and want their parents to buy it for them but mostly ,14
6597, a month its broken or not interesting anymore and they want to have something new ,18
6598, this is just a waste of money the problem is ,23
6599, everybody has this special thing and only few kids not they feel sad or seperated from the others but ,9
6600," this is the strategy of the advertisement industry and they gain a lot of money with things like this 
if something should change ",11
6601, its important that the parents do a step and save their children from the mighty industry to put it in a nutshell ,12
6602, there is no chance to forbid tv advertisings because of human rights relating to expression of opinion,15
6603,"this essay deals with the following statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

young children from the ages of  are not as much able to think in a logic way as older children teenager or grown ups are they just started understanding the world by learning how to talk walk eat and think so it is a matter ",13
6604," that they are not able to find the difference between the world they can see with their own eyes and the world they can see through the television tablets mobile phones or other electric devices
for someone who just started to see things clearly everything must be real so the people in the television must be as real as the people arround them
television advertisements want to make us feel as if we truly needed their product 
to cause such a feeling is esier the more the person who watches the advertisement believes what he or she sees
if a commercial can make young children believe that the happy girl they can see in the television is ",10
6605, happy because her mother bought her that new lego toy they will ,20
6606, ask their mother to buy them such a toy ,20
6607," they could be as happy as the girl they saw in the advertisement

so the way commercials make their use of a childs natural naivity is a pro ",2
6608," for forbiting television advertising towards them 

but what if a young child never saw a television advertisement what if the little girl who wanted that lego toy ",13
6609, badly had never felt the sadness ,18
6610," she bought it and the world did not suddenly change into a perfect place 

how can a child learn to take care of itself and not to believe everything they are told if you never let them be disappointed 
though a little child will go through some disappointments ",20
6611, it sees that even the nice lady in the commercial even the little girl in the television lied at them ,3
6612, they said that this lego toy would make their world a perfect place and ,20
6613," they bought it it actually didnâ´t 
but these experiences are important ",3
6614, later they will have learned not to believe everything and to think themselves ,7
6615,television advertising is a medium that can be used to manipulate people for example if a product is presented as a speial deal ,10
6616," you get 2 for the price of 1 a lot of people will buy this a simple explenation for this is that people think that they make a good deal and buy lots of it just to save money in reality the company selling the products is just profiting of the whole situation and the people buying the things are loosing their money

now the problem with children is that they dont have a lot of experience and are there for more manipulative
if a girl sees a commercial for pink fluffy unicorn that is sprinkled in glitter and covered in light rays ",2
6617, the kid feels attracted to it or if a boy sees the new rc speed car he will ask his parents to buy it for him the parents loose more and more control over what their children are watching ,20
6618, the rapid technology enhancements children learn earlier and faster than ever ,8
6619, to use electronic devices and may ,23
6620," find a way to use dads creditcard to buy things online these payments often arent refunded and therefor a problem for the family

the rude part of the whole thing are the companies producing these ads they are looking for children which beg their parents for a new toy and if a todler accidentally buys something of the internet that costs much the companies simply dont care because the only thing they see is profit

my general oppinion is that companies ",2
6621, should be able to do ads specifically for children but its not okay to just gain from their misshappenings,16
6622,"two young kids are sitting on the couch and watching tv the mother of the children is cooking meal in the kitchen 
one ",1
6623," later the kids are running into the kitchen and shouting â´mum mum mum please can we have the new fantastic robot who can clean our rooms and brushes our teeths

when we talk about television advertising we think at boring and wasted time between our great movie or series but in reality television advertising is a psyche manupulation especially for young children who trust mostly everything and everyone 

a study is saying that people connect ",14
6624, with coca cola only the things like santa claus or the cola truck and this only because of the cola advertising everywhere this makes clear that ,11
6625," we do not know advertising has a huge influence of everyone

especially young children who trust only at the best seeing the advertising and will trust it they think that everything the advertising is saying is true 
they do not have the education to see the wrong ",11
6626," of the advertising like the most of the people 

there is something good at the television advertising the ",10
6627, thing is that the children learn from their parents that they do not can trust everything the ,7
6628," the advertising would say the truth it would be a nice way to tell their parents what they would like to have to birthday or what they wish from santa claus

television advertising is good for factorys and unternehmer to sell their products etc it is a important part of the economy of the world

",0
6629," television advertising do not need to be not allowed verboten but maybe some rules for it would be better like saying the truth
when television advertising  because of their level and education than ",15
6630," all the other television advertising need to be verboten because in every age are stupid people who trust the advertising no matter how silly they are
and the young children have lessly theit parents who will bring them on the right way 

the time is ",15
6631,"when it comes to advertising a lot of companies are very creative especially the ones that are  those usually sell toys clothes or food which has fun looking logos and mascots nowadays a lot of children from the age  are being at home left with their nannies or simply dont get enough of distraction or playtime with their parents 
an evident soloution for them is television television is very popular among youger children they have their favorite tvshows or cartoons and they have their favorite characters right there on the screen but most of the time advertisements are running and they are ",0
6632," very convincing and seducing for the youngers 
those advertisements have everything in them what a child could dream of first and foremost we have the product that is tried to be selled lets take a simple toy for an example now this toy is now presented by a child or a group their age so already now our kid will feel a connection 
secondly the way it is presented is the main catcher the toy seems to be the reason for all that fun on the screen for all the kids laughing and jumping around having a good time alltogether we will find a lot of bright and vivid colors in the ad fun music playing in the background anything a child could wish for all those placed and intended tricks receive a positive ressonance from the young audience 
finally it shouldnt be very surprising if your child is going crazy over a toy in the store personally i feel like this shouldnt be that big of a problem ",0
6633, the kids themselves are anyways not able to purchase anything alone without the parents the parents ,9
6634," are left to be a bit strict and say no to their childrens wishes 
and eventually if the child gets a toy he saw on tv it will make him appreciate it even more knowing that it is a more special kind of toy",20
6635,should be not allowed are very strong words in my opinion its impossible to prohibit television advertising for children its in the responsibility from the parents and its the same with much other things the parents wants to shelter the children from every bad things sometimes ,13
6636, advertising is bad also here the parents decides how much they want to shelter their children but at some ,16
6637," of age the parents couldnt shelter the children from television advertising so it doesnt matter what the parent do no its matter very hard because its diffrent for the children if they see in the aged three everything in the advertising or with eleven so at the end the parents have to asked themselves what it good for my child
now i wrote much about parents and their children but whats with a child which see every television advertising at the aged from two ",14
6638, children learnd from everything something so they would learn ,8
6639, the language from the advertising also,11
6640,in my opinion its impossible to save young children from advertising ,16
6641, if television advertising for young children should not be allowed they will see this advertising somewhere else this days you see advertising everywhere you go if you go in a supermarket with your children you will see advertising every step you go or if you go to the cinema ,13
6642, the film starts there will be advertising its not possible to ignore it because you see it everywhere and you ,10
6643, get influenced by it and ,18
6644, with the statement that advertising for children should not be allowed but ,13
6645, its impossible to do that on the other ,18
6646, that children have to learn that they cant get everything what they see in the advertisingwith adults it works the same way we see something in the advertising and we want to buy it we get influenced by it because the advertising is made for catching us its the same with children they see advertising which is made for them with ,2
6647, plays or computer games and ,1
6648, they want their parents to buy it but there is the ,9
6649," i mentioned they have to learn to get not influenced by the advertising that much and dont want to get everything they see the adults had to learn or have to learn the same
so ",2
6650, advertising is not good for nobody because you get influenced by it the children and ,11
6651, the adults but its impossiple to not allow it because advertising is everywhere you go and ,16
6652, in the internet and at the television ,10
6653,"television advertising direced toward young childrenaged  should not be allowed

on one ",13
6654, very young and have to play in the garden or at the playground they are at the age of  and ,24
6655, this isnt a age where they have to make television advertisingthe children are too young to make a decision and ,16
6656, they parents ahve to make the descion for them but maybe the children dont want to do this they cant say that because they are too youngif the children are always in the televison advertsing they cant find friends and cant play with children in there age maybe they will become popular and thats to early for this age because ,24
6657, they will never have a normal life because they always in the television also i think that children in this age dont have to work because maybe ,24
6658," they were older they are angry with their parents why they have allowed the television advertising

on the other ",24
6659," with the statement because its the desicion of the parents and if they said my child can do this its okay but i think the televison directors have to talk with the parents and have to say them what thze problems are also the children can only make 2 hours televison advertising because they must have enough time to spend a normal life and to go in the kindergarden or something like that
the ",13
6660," the children become popular isnâ´t good for example the daughter of kim kardishian is popular tooand shes always in the newspapersmagazines and in the televison but the reason why shes there is because her parents are famous she will always have a life where everyone know who she is she canâ´t do something against this

",7
6661, the best decision would be that televison advertising should not be allowed in this young age because the children can say something against this they should make their own desicion ,13
6662, if they want they can ,19
6663, make something in the television advertising they can live as normal children and can play with children in their age and can make things want children make in this age,24
6664,advertising s children of all ages should completly not be allowed children dont have the mindset of beeing capable to judge for themselfs and are just influenced by everything they see so its crutial that we can regulate what children can see and what they shouldent be abel to see ,13
6665, for the parents because if their children saw something they would want on the televison they would go to their parents and ask them to buy them the shown item this can be difficult to handle for yunger parents and parents who dont know how to handle a toddler who wants something ,2
6666," badly that he begenas to scream without a reason and parents who arent as rich than others 
it would ",9
6667, diminish the advertising time an the television who ,10
6668," is just rubbish and is the reason i stopped watching television maybe channels would be more attractive to people because they have no advertising at all 
toddlers ",14
6669, are too small and too naive to comprehend anything that is going on but ,3
6670, its something flashy and colorful they will want it but children who are a little bit older who comprhend already a litle bit of the whole concept of television that you can see moving images they could maybe already understand that they cant have it just like this and they are more influencable of all thos advertisinigs the reason is they cant have any of this bit they want it very badly,0
6671,"its definitely okay to have advertising  in television 
on one ",15
6672," its something clever made by the industries they want to attract children as soon as possible to get caught by there advertisements 
but ",0
6673, children get caught by multimedia anyway i know quite a lot children in the age of 3 years whose birthday present is an ipad ,24
6674, they can play games on it but ,1
6675," i find it even more irresponsable to leave his child alone with an ipad than letting him or her watch a spot about barbie dolls in the televison
most of the children in our times dont play with playmobile lego or dolls anymore ",20
6676, i dont guess that advertisements about toys will influence them badly i ,0
6677," think that its a good thing to show the other possiblities about playing so that they can see there is even more than electronical stuff to spend time with
for sure its another periode of time were living in and its mostly based on multimedia but is that a reason for keeping children away from real toys i dont guess ",20
6678," 
for that reason a dont ",19
6679, with the statement above because ,21
6680, that there are even more dangerous things than advertisments for children its just a reminder of the real things children should actually play with and ,8
6681, these things arenâ´t computers ipads mobile phones or anything like that for sure these advertisements are presented in multimedia ,11
6682, okay to let children watch some tv than letting them explore the whole internet by the use of those already named things ,17
6683,a big problem in our social life is television advertising many politicians critc that television advertising manipulate the children to buy something they have watched in the tv ,14
6684," with the statement for the following reasons

a main ",21
6685, is that the children do not want to buy new toys because they do not know which toys exist they are not able to ask their parents which new toys the store sales furthermore the television advertising tries to manipulate the children with the new toys and the shining colours the makers always invent new statements to buy something nowadays the children are not able to see the advertising because they see it everywhere you cant intend your child to watch tv when you are a child you just have to watch the cartoons but today this is very difficult ,2
6686, every cartoon follows some television advertising therefore ,10
6687," many children watch the advertising a other adventage is that it isnt very nice to use the children that the parents buy something 

on the other ",2
6688, the children could learn some new words in a advertising they use many useful english words at ,0
6689, they see how the world is which toys exist what they can do with them it is a good measure to rise up our economie when the children in other coutntrys watch them ,6
6690," you could expand your issues

in conclusion ",21
6691, it should not be allowed to direct toward young childrens the children should be able to watch tv without advertising,13
6692,in todays word in our society everybody is in front of a screen every day even young children in television there is even adversiting that is  these young children in this essay ,17
6693," talk about whether this should be allowed or not by mentionning manipulation the responsibility of parents and people producing these advertisings

firstly ",16
6694, that it is not ethic to try to manipulate little children they cannot even think for themselves and ,7
6695," it should not be allowed

to avoid this manipulation the kids parents should not let their children watch these advertisings it is the job of the parents to look ",16
6696," their  years old children so actually the advertising should be allowed because the parends shouls simply have control over how much advertising their child is watching and if it is not too much it is not that big of a deal

finally it is the job of certain people to produce the advertisings their goal is to get the children to want what they are advertising about and there is nothing wrong about this how could they ",13
6697, make the children want the toys they want to sell so this is ,20
6698," why advertisings  should remain allowed

to sum up there is something wrong about manipulate little kids but ",16
6699, their parents should be able to control how much advertising is seen by their children and people trying to sell children toys should be able to get to the children by television advertising ,13
6700, that it should stay allowed,21
6701,first we have to take a look on the positive ,21
6702," of television advertisements if a channel shows more advertisements they get more money and if they have more money that can easily result in a  better product if the product of the channel is better the ratings grow bigger and they can take more money for advertisements and they can expand or something like that 
so ",10
6703, of all it is quite good for the television channel but thats the only positive ,10
6704, that i can see at all ,18
6705, that young children cant guess which pictures in the television programm are realistic and which are certainly not and ,6
6706, if the product which is shown in the commercial is even good for them and gets them something ,0
6707, or if it is just a waste of money or time also they get a wish that maybe ,3
6708," theire parents want to cant fullfill or maybe gets them into financial trouble because the problem is that little children cant handle and dont know the worth that money has 
 they follow the advertisement because it speaks directly to them and they dont know that everybody only wants the best for them also it gets more difficult for the parents or other people to raise the children because they got certain wishes that are shown in the tv
but ",2
6709," of them all is that small children are moved and pushed to become consumers and spend their or their parents money on products they have no idea of
",2
6710, that it is wrong to say that this type of tv should be forbidden at all ,15
6711, it has to be taken more liberal and parents shouldnt let their kids watch tv and advertisements at that young age ,13
6712, that is far more difficult to look up if they really do but it is the better way ,19
6713, say that i dislike this kind of entertainment or tv programm,6
6714,nowadays almost every household owns a television and everyone likes watching television moreover television has become such a big part of our life that many families even eat whilst watchig television so should little children be protected from advertising there are some good reasons to forbid television advertising s children children are easier manipulated by advertising than adults for they dont realise that advertising tries to manipulate them also recent surveys show that advertising sometimes misleads into perceiving fastfood and alike as something thats somehow healthy or at least not very unhealthy that ,14
6715, has desastrous effects like raising the already high obesity rate of todays population you might argue that even with advertising towards young children forbidden theres ,13
6716, lots of bad influences on tv every show has times ,6
6717, parents wish taht it wouldnt portray things as good ,6
6718, theyre quite bad for you and its ,4
6719, tv that gives you wrong impressions ,10
6720, normal advertising where products are often praised as healthy like fruit yoghurt that more than often doesnt even contains fruit but ,11
6721, some chemicl flavor plus loads of sugar so is it necessary or helpful to ban advertising for children on tv it might be because in many childrens lifes television plays a big role but trusting the parents to parent their child seems to be the better method especially ,14
6722, its bad for little children anyways to spend their entire days in fron of a tv,17
6723,television advertising always was a controversial theme even more ,15
6724," directed at small children is it okay for companies to aim at children as young as   with their advertisement
the ",16
6725, to be raised on the pro ,18
6726, is that it depends on the product advertised childfriendly toys ,20
6727, puppets shouldnt be a problem also it is probably safe to say that the advertisement is less directed to the child itself but more to the parents ,16
6728," they are the ones to buy it and a two yearsold child probably wont even understand what they say in the advertisement
to be said against that is that ",2
6729, it sure depends on the product advertised it ,11
6730, depends on the way the product is advertised there ,11
6731, are some childunfriendly ways to show your product on television also the ,6
6732, about the advertisement more being directed at the parents isnt completely waterproof a child that sees something it wants on television  and just visually seeing it is enough there  can to a large extend take an impact on its parents ,13
6733, deciding wether or not to buy it also just generally children at such a young age just shouldnt already be confronted with potentially manipulating advertisement but ,2
6734," again one could argue that it is up to the parents to keep their children away from the tv if they want to prevent that
to my own opinion im generally against too much advertising on tv which is why i stay away from it as much as i can therefore i say yes advertising  should be illegal at least very manipulating advertisement or manipulating advertisement ",15
6735, that the parents should keep their children away from the tv why can there even be something that you have to protect your child from in television ,17
6736, 10pm  or on supposedly childfriendly programs in my opinion that just doesnt fit into a modern society,1
6737,the question is if it shouldnâ´t be allowed to show advertising  in television i ,15
6738, with that but there are ,19
6739," statements for pro and contra in every argumentation

people who say that it shouldnâ´t be allowed always mention that this is a trick used by producers to lure the children young children are often naive and listen to things they hear in television they are easily impressed by commercials with the result that they want to buy toys or other things shown there often the parents donâ´t allow it what makes the children scream and cry if they are disappointed that destroys the bond between parents and children furthermore it is possible that they see the advertising ",14
6740, at a friends house or somewhere else and today there is ,18
6741," the internet a problem where children are able to see everything

as already said children want to buy the things they see in the advertising and do a lot to get them if parents allow that ",2
6742," long discussions they are obviously the ones who gave up which makes it their fault that they paid money for useless things parents know that this things are usually very expensive and useless but for parents itâ´s their duty to teach and inform their children

finally you can say that there are ",9
6743, for and against advertising like this which makes it harder to decide but ,11
6744, stay with my opinion from the ,21
6745,if we look at it from a companies ,23
6746, of view they want to sell a product for children aged between two and five ,0
6747, they want their product to be known ,23
6748, they do advertising if the advertising is ,11
6749,  the children it may have a bigger selling effect because if you explain it in an easy way child sees it child likes it child wants it children are easy to manipulate because they are ,2
6750," kind of naive

where as if you create an advertising of a product for children but the advertising is  their parents its much more difficult to convince the parents to buy this product for their children because the parents are adults and they often have to see a reason behind the things they buy so the advertising would have to include way more information and sense

if we look at it from a parents ponit of view maybe they dont want their children to see those advertising because afterwards they would have to hear all day long that their child talking about it
the parents would maybe like to have the advertising  them because like that they get the information they want and they can afterwards tell their child about it

but if we now think of the ",0
6751, that it should not be allowed ,21
6752, it is forbidden to even create an advertising  children ,16
6753, thats to intense because the child wont take any harm of the advertising so ,16
6754, it should be allowed because if a child watches tv advertising is a huge part of it and maybe the advertising which is ,13
6755, created for them is the only interesting thing,19
6756,television advertising for young children should not be allowed or should it ,13
6757, it should because in this age you can influence children very easily sure for the market and the economy thats a great thing but from ,12
6758," of view its cruel to use the natural believe in good things children have for getting more money
big shops try to influence children with loud sonds flashy lights and exited voices ",2
6759, they really want to have this new toy chocolate or whatever is in the advertising because it seems to be ,20
6760," much fun on television thats not fair because children this young often cant think in a logical way about the products they just see how amazing its claimed to be and they want it the people who are selling this products get rich that way but the familys if the children often lose a lot of money because most of the time these products are not cheap
children are not old enough and they often dont know enough to tell the difference between good and bad the flashy lights on tv impress them ",2
6761," they think the things they see have to be good 

i know im repeating what i just said all the time but thats just because i dont know a lot this topic i thought you want to test my english knowledge and not my ",3
6762," of view on tv advertising i expected questions like where do you get your knowledege from or how often do you use to speak english 
im not trying to be disrespectful here this is just me talking writing a little bit of english for you to know i can speak this language ",11
6763," i never really thought about television advertising 
should i talk a little bit about where i get my knowledge from i know i should not but ive ",10
6764, i watch a lot of english videos an youtube most of the videos i watch are about guitars or cars because those are the things i love and im interested in im a guitarist myself ,18
6765," i like to gain my skills on youtube youtubers like music is win or simon smith are really good for this case 
and i talk to english people on the internet a lot ",18
6766,somebody says that television advertising which is  between two and five years old should not be allowed but it is really ,13
6767," bad

a toys advertising is possible they can show their parents want they for christmas or for their birthday the young children will ",0
6768, learn something from the advertising like how to use the toys a advertising is ,0
6769," good between a cartoon for a break

but the televison advertising isnt a good thing for young children children shouldnt watch television with this agethey can be addicted to tv later and will not play anymore with the dolls and toys they ",6
6770, will not concentrate what is going on ,18
6771," their only staring in the television
the problem is ",1
6772, that televisions damage the eyes from the children because they are ,17
6773, very young and their eyes are ,24
6774," growing up the children should not be victims for the advertising market the children are to young to know that the elder poeple use their low knowledge for their success 
they ",16
6775," use advertising like this to influence the children to make their parents buy these products

",0
6776, with this following statement because i see that the young children are vicitims from elder people who want only power over the children those advertising can influence their mind and how they will think and act later maybe the advertising is furious and scary i ,16
6777, think that a young child doesnt need a advertising for chose his toys or dolls,16
6778, that television advertising toward young children should be allowed young children want everything that looks fun girls want everything that is pink and boys probably everthing with cars or dinosaurs and ,13
6779, they get it they play with it one time and ,3
6780, never use it again its just money making for the big companies its like ,23
6781, you go into a supermarket all the sweet stuff is in the lower shelfs where small children can see it and they want it but ,2
6782, what for a difference does it make if you see television advertising ,10
6783," your five or fifteen if you think its cool and your birthday is near you are probably going to get it 
",18
6784," the parents should be asked if television advertising should not be allowed cause i dont look tely anyway
little children shouldnt be watching television at all its not healthy and they will not learn all the important stuff they will need in life they should go playing with there friends outside that would be much healthier for them and for nature 
but ",14
6785," children watch tely they are usually quite their parents have some free or at least quite time to chill out a little i mean our parents are doing a major job with use as their children and they are not getting paid for it they actually have to pay for nearly everything their children do the parents have to pay in some way

okay back to the topic television advertising  i dont have ",14
6786, that there is a really good one for it not out of sight of the parents the companies that pay for the advertising they have ,0
6787, for it i mean they somehow have to make money and children are the most expensive thing one can have because unless they die ,9
6788," their parents they are there all the time you cant just get rid of them well you can but you shouldnt somebody the children the prison will never forgive you 

my closing word the parents have to decide what is best for their chidren they are their responsebility",19
6789,the present statement represents a difficult and discussed topic as there are various opinions concerning the use of electronic devices by children it does ,8
6790," the use of mobiles and computers many companies misuse their influence regarding the minds of young children trying to appeal directly to the young audience the following essay deals with this problem and tries to give answers whether directing towards young children between two and five years in tvadvertisement should be allowed or not

in my opinion it is undoubtelly to say that influencing children in tv advertisement is much easier than convincing adults children are expecting the tv to tell the truth therefore advertising could have bad influences on the childrens minds consequently it should be forbidden to abuse the weakness of those young children by trying to make them willing to get a product 

on the other ",14
6791," it is up to the childrens parents to forbid their sons and daughters watching television advertising they are responsible for them and should not let them watch advertising hence it is a matter of education whether the children are able to be manipulated or not the parents have to protect their children in every situation and not every bad influences can be forbidden

the ",14
6792," defending the prohibition of this topic is that the advertising companies have got a duty concerning moral it is not fair trying to appeal to kids as it is proved that they can be manipulated easily in order to not let this become reality a forbid of advertising towards young children should be compulsary

to sum up it is undoubtelly to say that moral ",16
6793, against permitting it on the other ,21
6794, the parents are responsible for their children in nearly every situation of life i ,9
6795, think that this kind of advertising is unfortunately never going to be forbidden however companies should not abuse their force of manipulating young children,16
6796, aigainst advertising would be that children just have no idea about what they really need and what they just want to have at this young age they see happy kids playing with the newest barbie in the advertising ,0
6797, and want their parents to buy it they just get influenced by advertising too easy it could ,2
6798, be that the parents of children have not got enough money to buy their children what they want so ,9
6799," children see something in the advertising that they want to have the parents would have to explain them why they are unable to buy it to make them happy espacially if all the others playing around with it in the kindergarden a child would be unable to understand such things in such a young age
but in the other ",2
6800," give attention that their children do not watch the advertising in the tv or even do not let them watch tv anyway to be sure there is no problem with that
also the parents can see what they might buy their children and can decide what is good and bad for them
so ",14
6801, advertising for young children is not really a big problem because there are enough possibilities for the parents to make sure that they do not get influenced by that ,16
6802,first the children gets early in contact with the consumersociety if they watching advertising which shows a products like playstuff ,2
6803," theyre learning early how to deal with this kind of advertising
but on the other site they cant really decide which of the products is good for them or not that is part of the parents work
also the cant deal with spending and holding money ",2
6804," they always want to have everything they like and this is what the companys aiming for
but advertising dont have to presenting products olny it can help the parents to show the children whats wrong like nonviolence advertising
the ",2
6805, that children cant deal with money and that they cant buy themselves anything makes the children ,9
6806," thay see al lot of product ads a irational feeling of how to deal with money
so the parents have to decide which stuff is good for the children which not ",2
6807," they have to fight vocaly with their children cause they want to get all but someone in this case it is the parents have to teach them right consumerthinking 
also the most of the time products of the advertising arent that usefull for children in this age in most of the cases its just stuff to play but it isnt important at all the ads on childrenchannel in tv are only showing this kind of products ",2
6808," at the end of the day the parents have to pay for it
at the end u can say that the advertising itself isnt the problem the problem is how children gets in contact with the consumersociety",16
6809,watching tv makes people stupid this common saying may contain some truth especially television advertising bring people up to buy strange products as media shop shows us every daychildren in the age of  may not understand statements from television ,10
6810, there are some dangers which might explained why television advertising should not be allowed  however a child could ,14
6811," be the door to sell different material things

on the one ",18
6812, television advertising is good to intrduce new products to a person and for kids aged  it is optimal to buy toys that are used by the kidsit might prevents to buy things they are not interested in with television advertising they can easily decide what they can use or not on the other ,0
6813," children cannot decide what they need in my opinion children want everything they could have and a few parents buy them because of their love all things they want therefore it is the door to sell toys because the parents want the best for her kids

another ",20
6814, against telivison advertising is that a child have to learn to read and with waching tv they only sit on the couch and see some pictures according to a current survey television makes really stupid this act is not good for the education and their health too in contrast to this ,14
6815, of view we have to realize that it included ,21
6816," a sense of music to understand a few television advertises and they have mor imagination and creativity

in conclusion the television advertising  should not be allowed ",10
6817," that the children do not need many toys or other material things to be happy there are a lot of other possibilities not to sit in front of the tv and to create the free time  
 ",8
6818,"television is a multimedia thing and is in all countries very popular and all childs use television advertising all day but is this good oder bad 
on the one ",14
6819," it is good because the childs can learn early to comunicated with other people in the world and understand how possible it is to use television advertising at the day otherwise it is good because you can learn how easy all things can be for example how easy it is to write a text on the internet or how cool it is to look things on the television and can lay in your bed
on the other ",17
6820," it is bad because it is too eary with a age  the childs are childs and must be playing in the garden or somebody else but not use television advertising therefore the childs want too early to go on the television everyday otherwise for the childs umfeld is it not good because you do not have many real friends
",4
6821, that the childs from age  should not be allowed to use television everyday because it is too early and not in all things good for the child all in all i can say that is it not allowed ,17
6822, is it not okay that ,19
6823, many parents allowed the childs to use television ,17
6824,"the latest dolls pets with fluffy fur and much more things children love are shown in advertisings on tv but is it really smart and ethical correct to direct television towards young kids
on the one ",14
6825, one has to admit that it is the producers right to present their articles and television commercials are one of the most effective ways to do that therefore it would be such a ,10
6826," to forbid this kind of advertisement
on the other ",11
6827, the way of presenting is very manipulative and even makes grownups buy things they have seen on tv and children are even faster attracted to things and easy to lure into something therefore seen from the parents ,2
6828, of view it can be nerve wrecking to always have to discuss the need of something their children saw on tv which ,17
6829," can lead to a bad realtion between children and parents furthermore kids should not be forced into this kind of thinking at such a young age advertisings they see could lead to the attitude of wanting more and never getting enough
in conclusion it is not responsible to allow television advertising  but ",14
6830, forbidding those commercials completely you could just direct them towards the parents by that the producers ,13
6831,"my essay will tell you about my opinion abot television advertising  aged  shold be allowed
",15
6832," this topic is very difficult because it always depends on the tvshow or film they watch and the time children are spending on watching tv
on the one handit can never be good for the future ",17
6833," a child siting in front of the television all day long if they are siting there the whole day it will be very bad for them because they have to learn eg social interaction in the age of  children have to lern speaking drawing and many other things 
it is ",17
6834," a poor statement for those parents who are leaving them allone in front of the tv children in this age have to speak with there parents for learning to speck correctly 
in my opinion reading books by themself or outreading by their parents could be much better for children because they can create a story on there one head
on the other ",17
6835, eg some walt disney movies can be very important for children,6
6836," watching them they are learning some important ethical rules this ethical rules are very important for children to know for there whole life if parents are not abled to tell theire children this rules by life they have to learn it in another way 
all in all my opinion is children watching television can be okay if they arent sitting there all day long maybe a half to one hour and a half hour will be okay but this depends on the child if the tv is always there ",17
6837, the parents the child couldnt become a social person ,9
6838, for the children outreading a book by the parents the grandmother or anyone else will be very much better even if they can not read by there own the children will imagine the story in there head and will paint pictures on there own this is very good for there creativity and if we never learn to be creative what is the difference between us and our pets at home or any other animal ,8
6839,people have to earn money and how should people get to know something without advertisements not ,11
6840, theyre necessary young children cant defend theirself from getting affected and they can get influenced by television advertising and not everything is good for them if people take the service of letting their children watch tv and not have to pay attention to them they have to pay the price for it with children asking to get the stuff from the advertisements young children shouldnt get intouch with comertionals that early because they cant understand that this is manipulative its a good selling stragety because parents will buy the articls for the children ,14
6841," the keep quite and stop asking for it 
",3
6842, with this statement because if people take the luxury of letting their children watch a lot television awith this young age the parents have to give something back and in this case its the advertisements because ,14
6843, they have very big longlasting consequenses ,19
6844, its not realy unheathy for them ,4
6845, its mostly just annoying for their parents but on my ,24
6846, of view its most od the time their own fault ,19
6847,firstly one can say that children are even influenced by their friends in kindergarden ,7
6848, if everyone of your mates has a special toy ,20
6849, you would like to have it ,18
6850, for example my kind of generation loved pokemon and ,6
6851, trading with cards was acually very common so it does not matter ,23
6852," they are influences anywhere 
 however i believe children do not even understand everything which is brought to them in advertisements because their brains are not developed in a way like it is ",0
6853," an adult brain 
 furthermore espacially young children tend to become addicted faster than exampally teenagers in my oppinion it is not helpful for  aged to watch television that long because their minds can not progress all the different impressions 
 espacially for children it is essencial to experience nature ",17
6854, than just looking at screens because if this generation loses the interst for nature and the amity to animals they ,17
6855," they are grown up
 we are all living in a world which lost the care of nature because making profit and wealth became more important pastly at least we should care for the future of our following generations because there is no reason of taking them all their opportunities by just living our life 
 to put it in a nutshell i believe that advertisements for young aged children are not helpful and ",16
6856, should not be allowed because they are too influencial and it is better for young children to grow up without a lot of technical supply ,12
6857," them becoming adults really fast these days 
",24
6858,many people have a tv at home and watch tv nearly every day but is watching tv good experts doubt this and say that ,17
6859," television advertising towards young children in the age of  years old should be prohibited 
young children are influenced by what they see ",13
6860, they are young and act like that its not good  that those children watch tv that early if those advertsments show some  bad habits those children might learn those and do them later in the life for example if violent videogames would be shown to small children those children might have ,14
6861, some time an agressive character or if ,21
6862," unhealthy food and sweets like cookies and candys were shown to those children they might be influenced by that and start eating unhealthy food way too early 
but ",7
6863, those chidren might find something nice on the tv and start doing it for example a hobby like sports or something like that if  good advertising is shown on tv it wont be bad it isnt that there is only bad stuff on tv there are many good things aswell children who watch tv will learn good new stuff and do it ,14
6864," prohibiting the advertising is a bad idea
in my opinion it depends on the advertising if there are nice and good things shown it is okay but if there are bad things shown ",15
6865, violance or smoking its not good young children learn what they see the parents should be carefull of what they permit their children to see and what not to if the advertising would be prohibited many people would be mad and would be against it especially the television programmes ,14
6866, they earn a lot of money through advertising in my opinion prohibiting advertising on tv is a too immense step and makes no sense i would ,15
6867, just overwatch the advertising better and try not to show stuff those children shouldnt see ,16
6868," for and against allowing advertisment for young children aged 
not allowing young children to watch advertisings in tv is really hard for the television concerns this concern live from advertisments ",13
6869, they need them if they could not show every ad they want the could get bankcrot and ,11
6870," in the long run that will kill the television 
on the other ",10
6871, it is not good for young children to be influend by advertisments in young age in this age childrens try to learn from thinks around them if this thing is advertisment it could have a not ,0
6872," good effect on them
my opinion is that partens should watch out what they childrens look in tv 
































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































",17
6873,"is television advertised  children useful

children are known to learn the fastest that is necessary because they have to learn a lot to survive so as you may assume childhood is the easiest age to influence so the question is if advertising toward children should be allowed or not
children are easy to influence ",14
6874, television advertising could manipulate their growing a lot advertising is a way to sell products and young children are not really capable of making good decisions ,2
6875," their parents should decide for them but with specific advertising the children get to know products they probably want to have like toys  and their minds get used to buying and consuming this would mean that later on we would have a society of consuments which would be great for economy but bad for the environment because of the high amount of co2 and trash 
on the other ",0
6876, the children would have products they like and ,2
6877, they would be happier they would create groups of interest and socialize because they would be sharing the same good advertising could help children to create an opinion and maybe to learn how to discuss ,0
6878," if they would have to convince their parents to buy a toy
but does more stuff equal more happiness the children would have ",20
6879, much stuff they would not use that would be a waste of material and money and that all for a short moment of happiness the children should be able to socialize without needing an object that has been possible for ,20
6880," many years why should it be different today 
in my opinion advertising is better for the factories than it is for us non less for young children as i was younger i used to have many toys and i did not play with all of them but i have to admit that there are some useful toys that my parents and i boughtlike lego but i do not remember seeing them in television ",14
6881, that television advertising  should not be allowed because it influences them to much in my ,13
6882, of view that would really create a society which is concentrated towards buying and consuming and that would harm the environment people would buy much more stuff that they do not need than they already do the only group that would really benefit from it would be the factories and similar,23
6883,when i was a young little boy i used to watch television at home i had my series which i liked and enjoyed watching them but ,6
6884, an episode there often came a short period of adverts i hated the adverts because on my television channel they used to be very boring and not entertaining after some time i realised that a few of them have a persuasive way of interacting to me what happens ,11
6885," a young child gets into this propaganda

firstly the adverts ",0
6886," can be a kind of propaganda so the problem is now that young children can be convinced pretty easily because their minds are a little bit naive nevertheless the adverts can claim something that is not true or they really could implement some lies in addition the children could believe those things and start to desire products which they dont really need or they only know and need now because the advert told them this 

secondly television advertising is able to change reality in the mind of childrens they start to believe things that can not be true and never will be true moreover this fake reality is ",14
6887," connected with a specific product which the producer shows to the ones who are watching for example the thesis of redbull of giving wings to the one who is drinking their product 

my ",23
6888, contains the thought that adverts ,11
6889, can be dangerous for children in a diffrent way maybe the kids are forced to see sexuality and the use of drugs this can have bad ,4
6890," for the future or their lifestyle its possible that they are even shocked and frightened by the adverts maybe they cant handle the advert

in a summary ",11
6891, the television advertising  the propaganda can contain lies reality could turn into a fake one and in adverts there can be things a young child should not see,14
6892,"in the following text i will comment the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed                                     
first i give you some ",15
6893, with this statement most of the children aged  will watch tv everyday ,17
6894, it does not matter if they are watching advertising made for them or not furthermore it is even better that they have advertising for them ,10
6895," watching some durex advertising or something because that might hurt their brains more than the new winnie pooh bear or something else
otherwise it is not really positive to show the children that much television because they should do something outside and not watching tv the whole time so the children allready watch that much tv that they should not ",17
6896, have some advertising which might addict them to buy something or saying their parents that they need to have this ,0
6897, or something like this so it should not be the aim of the parents to let their children watch tv the whole day and if there is advertising not directed to them they will have not that much interesst to watch tv ,13
6898," they do not watch that much tv automaticly
to put it in a nutshell i think that there are pretty much opinions for the advertising directed  and today it might be usual that young children watch tv not like twenty years ago ",14
6899, everyone want to go out and play football or something and ,18
6900, it is propably not the best idea to connect the advertising  because they should not get addicted from tv that fast they should ,10
6901, have the chance to have a nice growing up without that much tv and playing outside or something ,1

i bims 1 bored dude lol",1
6903,itâ´s an important theme nowadays and ,21
6904," i would like to talk about the statement television advertising  should be not allowed 
",15
6905, with the statement because television isnâ´t good for children with these ages my brothers are 8 and 13 and today i see this problems there are ,17
6906," for this statement but the most children canâ´t live without the television they watch television very very often and the advertising  them isnâ´t good
they pass their time inside the house in front of the tv very often and donâ´t want to do important things like doing homework or playing outside with friends 
and they begin with 2 years to play with the smartphones of the parents play videogames with the brothers or sisters or they look tv and ",17
6907," my brother cant live without it now and his marks in school arenâ´t good
after that in television arenâ´t true storys in television are cartoons with fantasy characters and for those young children i think itâ´s hard to understand whatâ´s real or unreal
the parents should stop to place the children infront of the tv with watching tv in this age the children strike their plans for future
maybe the series with logical thinking or explaining is good for learning for example dora is an english speaking fantasy girl and she teaches english to the children but many series arent good because the characters are figting in a war and ",17
6908, many series are drastic and the children could think that war or fighting is good and many children nowadays are playing with swars or plastic knifes and want to kill their friends ,6
6909," bad results
and a last ",18
6910," 12 am exist series for children from 2 to 5 and this isnâ´t a possible time to watch tv because they are in kindergarden or primary school
so they have to watch the brutal series in the afternoon and i already told that this series arenâ´t good and should not be allowed
summarized i think some series should be forbidden for this youngaged children and the parents have the exercise to look for what they children do with the tv or ",17
6911," in the internet too 
if that do not happen the children are starting to watch tv with 1 year and this would not have a good end 
",17
6912,"first and foremost this essay is about advertising 
first there is no big problem with advertisment for young children if they are for them if the advertisment is about toys or learning it is okay ",16
6913, is connected with their age there should not be advertisements about alcohol or some thing like that but ,16
6914, young children are easy to manipulate ,7
6915," the companiese use this to sell more products which is really bad 
although advertisement has some freedom at tv there should be a rule against advertising  because not all of them understand what is said or ment in this advertisment in such a young age 
in conclusion for companies which sell toys or candy it is a great opportunity to sell more but i believe it is wrong if you do this ",16
6916, it is against our moral these days i can not support such advertising and ,11
6917, i said in the biginning there is no big problem there is ,21
6918, a problem you can not forbid every single advertisement because somehow the channel need some money but i suppose the advertisement shown to children in this young age should be more about how they can be creativ and that learning can be fun something like this can at least help the children ,14
6919, they grow up as long as the advertisement helps the children in their future i believe it is okay to direct them toward young children  ,16
6920,the world has changed in the last couple of years with the inventions of digital technology people started more and more to consume entertainment at home in front of their screens first those programs ,6
6921, on television were only for grownups but this has certainly changed first ,6
6922, children under ten in the last few years companies discovered that parents that dont know how to entertain their children just let them watch tv for every age there is ,17
6923," advertising in television to gain money but is this legit for children under five years

first of all for creating tv shows and films production is very expensive if people want their children being able to watch tv for their age companies have to gain money to produce it advertising is the only way to gain money from showing their productions on tv adults wont watch those shows only their small children will ",14
6924, its logic that ads will ,11
6925," address children
on the other ",8
6926," its way to early for children to spend time in front of a tv screen they get manipulated and in this age they cant know whats right or wrong for companies its easy to trim those children to buy their products by pretending this to be the best product on the market
also those companies do not care what is good or what is bad for small children they only focus on what gives them the highest profit for example kinder schokolade is a product almost every child likes but its very unhealthy and it has a lot of sugar in it

for me it is clear that advertising for small children should not be allowed because children cant differentiate between wrong and right i am shocked that parents just put their children in front of a tv screen and dont really care about them companies just make use of this disability of parents what i ",2
6927, there is much money around in this market section in a few years this could lead to a big problem because teenagers ,23
6928, wont know the real world and how to survive in it,24
6929," write about whether television advertising  should be allowed or not
first of all the children get used to seeing advertisements at a very young age ",13
6930," such advertising is allowed this is introducing them to a society that is all about consuming things which are probably not even necessary 
so what if these commercials are shown to innocent children who are not able to think about the pros and cons of buying a certain product the children are manipulated by advertisements
but adults are too additionally they are actually able to buy advertised things so is advertising  adults even worse 
to sum it up ",16
6931, that advertisements manipulate everyone but that is not necessarily a bad thing because it is a huge part of economy and ,11
6932, the childrens parents are the ones who buy their kids the toys they should be responsible for the advertisements the child sees ,16
6933," if the parents do not want their child to watch certain advertising they have to switch off the tv themselves the law should not be blamed fo that 
",13
6934, that television advertising should not even being allowed directed to adults ,13
6935, it is a critical thing because of the ,21
6936, that there are people with problems like lack of money or lack of money because of an illness where you want to buy more and more ,23
6937, you do not have the money for it even if the advertisement is directed to children in the age of  it can be possible that there are adults who want to buy it for their children because they think it is ,2
6938," for them and it is proofed to make them happy but the problem is that like i mentioned there are adults who do not have the money and it leads them into money problems
otherwise ",9
6939, it is mostly acceptable that some advertising is directed to children in this age ,16
6940, in christamas or easter time it is easier for the parents to choose the presents for their children ,9
6941," they see some toys in advertisements and it is presented for them what you can do with it also the parents can watch the advertisement too and they can give their statement if it is good or bad for their child or children in this case the advertising takes away the parents job of finding the right present because the children find their wish in television
but ",0
6942, it should be mentioned that there are ,19
6943, adults who can not handle with money children are known ,9
6944, that they can not handle with money because they mostly spent every single piece on something they would like to have right away and ,3
6945, they save their money for a specific toy that they saw on television it does not mean that they learn the right dealing with money it is right that it is a good start to save the money for something specific but ,20
6946, it is not good that they do not really learn to spend their money right away ,3
6947," they have the abilities to 
eventhough every kind of advertising on television is important for the state and companies to get money it is ",10
6948, a bad thing for people who can not deal with money ,23
6949, for children in a young age like  it is a good way of teaching children to save money but not the spending all in all ,8
6950, that it should not be completly forbidden but maybe it should be used less and not that directly to the children,12
6951," explain why children of the age between  may watch television advertising and how fast they could be addicted to them
in my opinion children of the age  may watch television advertising because it influences the children not that much in most cases the children do not understand the meaning of the advertisment they only see a toy which they want and say i want this ",14
6952, much mum can u buy it ,18
6953, it goes all that long but sertent spots are not created for children this age if the parents controlle that their children do not watch this kind of advertising it is not bad to let them watch television another ,14
6954, is that advertisment could be bad ,11
6955, because it is controlled by the product which is presenting sertant products awake the feelings of addiction and childs this age can not handle this addiction some adults ,4
6956," not the television production desinged the advertisment very colorfull to get the attention of the children and the children react to this very easilie to stop this addiction might be very hard annoying and difficult because if a child save sertant advertisment it could not be delited 
all in all ",14
6957, is harmless to childs without any problems but some spots are not that good for children if their parents protect them for this kind of addicting advertisment they might be save in this age children should not watch that much television   ,14
6958, with the statement because children aged 2 to 5 should not even watch tv but go outside and play they might be influenced by the advertisements in a bad way it is just money making by the advertisers,13
6959,young children are easy to influence these kids are not capable of making there own opinion businesses can easily take ,7
6960, they can make an advert on toys and bring it on tv the little ones want those toys now and parents have to buy them i really dont think that there are benefits ,20
6961, television adverts are just made for the younger ones they cant buy things themself ,10
6962, parents would haveto buy all those things and honestly which parents buy everything they see on tv so the adverts should be  the parents they are the ones with the money i guess parents are responsible for their children and should make enough rules ,2
6963, that the kids dont get everything they see on television or the parents make rules on the limited use of the tv in this way the advert shouldt have a big influence on these young kids it would ,13
6964, be a really good lesson for them they learn that they cant have everything they see so im not really against the use of these adverts for young children because the parents are the buyers companys should make the adverts ,16
6965, parent and childern because in the ends its the decision of the parents what their kids get and which things arent good enough for them ,9
6966, parents nowdays are very picky which toys are good enough for their kids toys should have a learneffect on children and parents wont buy the ,20
6967, thing they see on television so ,6
6968, its useless to make adverts just for children the adverts should impress the parents and should show them the benefits of the advertised object but companys may see that a bit different than me,16
6969,"we all see it on television every single day advertising often directed at young children or teenagers but should advertising towards children between the age of  be allowed or should it be banned from tv
first of all ",13
6970," it is great that children can see products they might like on tv it is easier for them to find new toys which could help them develope special skills or just provide fun for examples they see some kind of kids music instrument on tv this instrument might awaken their love for music and it will have a good impact on the rest of their life and childhood
however it is way easier to influence children than to influence their parents after all this advertisments are a way for mostly big companys to sell their products it is often found that children get excited just because the advertising for a toy or for sweets is good it is ",14
6971, clear that most of the time the children dont pay for the advertised things they see on television so there should not be advertising towards young children because they can not buy the product anyways these advertisings are just an easier way to get the parents to buy something for their small child the better it is advertised the more the child talks to their parents about it ,13
6972," that they maybe buy the product 
knowing that it is ",3
6973," a lot easier to sell products with a low quality since the children do  not care or know about quality you could basically sell them anything with a good advertising strategy for example a toy they only have for two days which than breaks into two
to conclude i have to say yes i ",2
6974, that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed because it is just an easy way for companys to sell a product ,13
6975," tell you if it is right that television advertising  should not be allowed
at ",15
6976," give good reasons for the statement and later against the statement
young children could be addicted to the television because it is a good entertainment for their also they chould see another films which they should not allowed to watch if the parents do not care about this it is difficult to show the young kids in his later time the right direction
but it is good that ",17
6977," young children are allowed to watch tv because these are a important sources for kids where they can learn and comprehend the tv is more than one film the kids have the choice to watch what they want in this age
surely there are silly films too because you can say in slang these films make the kids silly it isnt really exactly this but you can bring kids with films in a different way and thats let them make bad things
that is why parents should care about what their kids are watching if they did everything is okay and it is  even a succes for the young children
i ",17
6978, that kids in this age  are very easy to manipulate by everything makes it very hard to discuss about if advertising should be shown to kids in this age ,16
6979," advertising should be allowed to be shown to kids in this age

first of all as i already said kids in this age are easy to manipulate which makes kids just a tool for the companies to get the money from the parents the children see things in the tv and start crying about how bad they want to own this toy on the other ",14
6980, its good to show that there are oppurtunities in which the parents could invest not every advertising which is shown on the tv towards children  years old is manipulative and some are maybe helpful or may cause a better influence on the child but in generel the companies dont seem to care at all what people buy or how healthy and good for kids it is all they see is the money they make by showing tv advertising towards kids this age most of those advertisings are just really colorful and full of sounds and jingles which stuck in the heads of children i dont really think it may cause damage for kids to watch those kind of advertisings but im not truly of the opinion that its helping in any way too i remember ,14
6981, i was child i always wanted the big toys to be mine no matter how expensive they were and i knew i never had to pay for them in any way because i knew my parents would get maybe get me them most of the time i didnt get them but sometimes it really helped and they got me those toys i wanted and all of this just because i saw loud and colorful advertisings which showed toys or other stuff which wasnt that good as expected in real life ,20
6982, sometimes i was even a little bit disappointed by the toys i got ,20
6983, the advertisings mostly just come up with new stuff every year eg for christmas every year the same 2 moths ,11
6984," christmas time starts they keep showing advertisings towards children in the age of  and basically its the same toy they were showing 4 years ago just a little bit different 
basically there is no real problem with showing advertising to children of this age but i just dont seem to like it somehow because ",16
6985, its a trap which snaps every year again and its ,18
6986," about the christmas time is itno its about the whole year everyday there are hours of advertising and hours of the shown advertisinge towards kids children who are allowed to watch eg 2 hours of tv a day always come across advertising like theres no real chance to get around it 

in conclusion i can say that i dont thinks tv advertising should be shown towards kids of this age but ",14
6987, it doesnt matter at all because there will always be advertising which is shown towards children and there will always be other ways ,16
6988, they shouldnt be allowed to present advertising for kids in the age of ,16
6989,"should television advertising directed  be banned
on the one ",15
6990, it is good for the industries to present their products in all ages it will stay in the brain and ,2
6991," things for older people are known years later if this is banned they does not sell much as possible to pay the workers
but young children can not control their brain as much as possible to know what is good and what is needed so they are easy to quote as a buyer
but they can not buy it because they are too young so they asks their parents to bring it the problem is that parents have  an other seeing to this because they see the real function wich is not much as good as the one from the advertisement so they stay strong and does not buy it or they have not the money to make their child happy so the children gets angry and hates their parents for the ",2
6992," time this happends only because of the advertisement many advertisements can inspirate and the parents can build their one game with the children others can buy it if they want so everybody can do what he wants but many games are too complex to create by their own or the advertisement shows an animated film that doe not complain with the real one so it looks like a very nice game but it is not 
to put it in a nutshell television advertisements for children are often not good for the familys but all kinds of children adversising can not be banned because of the industries wich does not can stay without their advertisement so the parents have to handle it with the right words and ore make their children happy with a present",2
6993,"television advertising belongs to our daily life everytime we are watching our favourite show it gets interrupted by various commercials about new hair products or the newest car we could buy in those commercials the target groups are mostly adults between the age of 1860 but what about advertising  should it be allowed

the probably most obvious ",15
6994, for advertising toward young children would be that companies that sell products for children in that age could directly promote their products to their target group and with that hopefully have an increase in their revenue from a child ,0
6995," of view it can be interessting for them to see what new toys and other items are new on the market and with that it would be easier for parents to know what kind of product their child likes 

however what speaks strongly against advertising toward young children is that they would already be influenced in buying products at such a young age at the same time young children do not have the ability ",0
6996, to realize how commericals influences them in addition from a psychologial ,11
6997," of view we do not know how advertising can affect a childs way of thinking furthermore some parents might not have the financial ability to buy the newest toys for their children 

in conclusion ",0
6998, that adversting  should not be allowed children should not already be influenced by advertising at such a young age they should be able to enjoy watching television without interruption,13
6999,in the course of this study i was asked about my opinion on the statement that advertisements on television tailored towards children between the ages of two and five should not be allowed ,13
7000, form an opinion at the end of this essay ,21
7001, companies with a demographic between the ages of two and five should be allowed to advertise to those children ,16
7002, those are the people they want to sell their products to telivision is the perfect medium for this because of channels specifically made ,10
7003, age group and the ability to produce ,24
7004," audio and video
on the other ",18
7005, children that age are very easy to manipulate making this practise morally questionable ,7
7006," the children can not see through obvious marketing ploys at that age
also the children are not the ones spending money  it is the parents and ",2
7007," as i said the children will fall for advertisements much easier the companies are basically just exploiting an easy way to get peoples money instead of marketing to the harder to convince parents directly they market to them through a proxy  their children
to conclude i have to say that ",2
7008, with the statement that tv advertisements directed to children should be disallowed the children simply can not make informed descisions on potential purchases ,13
7009, and can be tricked to easily of course ,3
7010, the parents descision but once the child wants something the parent will likely try to appease it by making the purchase ,9
7011, if the child is that young ,24
7012," talk about the question if television advertising  should not be allowed

on the one ",15
7013," it is very important for the success of firms to have advertisment on tv because you can reach the most people it is clear that they need advertisment for younger people too because there are a lot of products for younger people 
also it is very important because there are tv shows for children and it makes no scence to show products for older people in the advertisment between the shows no one will pay for older people advertisment between younger people tv shows
 on the other ",0
7014, it is not good because it is easy to impress younger people and ,4
7015, they want to have what the saw in tv the manipulate the young children because they can not understand that this is only advertisment maybe the product is nonscences but in the advertisment it looks very good and maybe funny ,2
7016," it is something to play with

all in all ",18
7017," that advertisment for young children should be allowed because without the advertisment for young children there can not be tv shows for them also you do not have to let your children watch the advertisment

",13
7018, one the biggest branches related to advertising but what an impact do these advertisings have on childern all advertisings  children are commercials ,0
7019, we have such commercials is because it works children seeing a spot about a new game or toy and they go completly crazy about it the child starts to want this one toy and every time it sees the commercial again their want for it gets bigger but i ,0
7020, prefer that children see these commercial ,16
7021, the commercials beeing on tv on midnight where does this leads towards as i said the children sticks toward the thought that without this toy it is not happy and that leads us towards the ,20
7022, were we all know it parents and their children standing at the shoppingmall and the parents try to explain to the kid why it cannot have this toy but the kid is not able to understand why the only thing it realises is that it cannot have this toy the kid starts screaming crying and throwing things around in the store ,20
7023," the reason why this quote makes sense children that are really into something but their parents do not want it to happen are mostly going completly crazy
in my opinion we are not really able to prevent that there are these commercials directedtoward children there are many tvchannels that are making ",7
7024, much money out of these advertisings but i dont really think that thesetelevision adveretisings  should not e allowed if you really want to do something against it as a parent you should better sell your television because there will be this situationof you standing in the shopping mall andyou dont know what you should do about your screaming child,14
7025,while john is watching toggo his favorite tv programme his mother enters the room she starts to get angry what are you doing i told you not to watch toggo its ,6
7026," much advertising im really getting tired about all this advertising for childrenchocolate and toy stuff it annoys me and i dont wnat you to see it she turns the tv off and tells john to wash his hands for lunch suddendly john starts to cry what mummy but thats my favourite serie i wanna see how max goes for e swim with the dolphin and can we buy some chocolate i have seen a advertissment for a very good looking chocolate egg allday johns mum discuss with john she hates to see how her son get manipullated by all those advertissments for chlidren many people arent happy with it
advertissments ments for children are really good for buisness tells mister lancelot a from the toys house its much easier to sell ware ",16
7027, children ask their parents if they can get something as ,9
7028, parents would buy it for them to bring it home ones a year its ,9
7029, for children even tv shows everything for them and its ,6
7030, for adults lancelot is happy with his concept and he would never cancel it how i understand soon but there are ,19
7031, many advertiser contra advertissments towards that young childrenin ,16
7032, place they are parents and young adults they dont understand how some people can missbrauchen children for their buisiness they say children need a free live without someone who tells the what is good or bad or in or out and their time playing out got much shorter ,7
7033, they need more time to watch tv because every serie goes longer beause of the advertisment breaks somehow ,10
7034," it destroys their free childhood thells us sandra m a mother from south caroline 
finally i can say i understand all these mothers ",12
7035, it makes sense that they see all these advertissments they can go to the toy shops theyselfs and choose the toys they like they can go to the supermarket and can ask their mum themselves if they could buy the cholclate but they could live free ,20
7036,"sometimes young children watch television because they like episodes which are specially made for children however the television advertising is a very big problem because the advertising isnt always directed  
often advertisings are about internet websites supermarkets or about something which arent allowed for young kidsthis could have negative effects on the children for example they watch an advertising about alcohol or cigarettes children maybe want to try it because they dont know what it is and that it  is very bad for them its ",14
7037, dangerous if there is an advertising about internet websites if they visit this sites they could buy something ,11
7038," they dont want to or go to illegal websites because they dont know what they are doing not everything which you can find on the internet is nice 
on the other ",3
7039," it could be logical to make advertisings specially for young children the advertisings could informate children about kipnepper or bad people what they have to do and how they find help if they meet such a person this must be done in a way children understand they should not get scared 

",16
7040, with the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed because ,15
7041, i came up to the conclusion that it would be good to find an option ,18
7042, the parents dont have to care about advertisings their child watches ,2
7043, that young children grow up with advertisments advertisments are everywhere and you cant controll it it doesnt matter if television advertising is allowed or not children dont only see these in television they ,13
7044, see advertisments on the street or in the newspaper it is everywhere you have to see the ,18
7045, that it is  negative in the way that young children dont only see the advertisment for games for their age it is ,16
7046, possible that they see an advertisment for daiting apps or something like this this musnt be because they are too young ,24
7047, but what can you do against this nothing because 50 of television is advertisment it ,10
7048," influences the children negativly because they see the fantastic things and they want to have it however they dont know that everything only seems to be perfect in an advertisment it isnt the truth they are talking about in it and that is a big problem 
the television channels today are seperated into channels for children and channels for adults and mostly there isnt much advertisment on the channels for the children but the danger is that children can always switch between the channels and they can ",14
7049, watch channels they are too young for but it cant be a ,1
7050," to completly not allow television advertisments 
it ",15
7051," depends on their parents how much they controll the channels their young children are watching 
all in all ",17
7052, that you cant controll advertisments ,11
7053, its okay if it is allowed it is the task of the parents to controll the consum of television in their childrens life you can manage it on your own which and how much advertisment your child is watching  ,17
7054,"pillows toys and clothes in pink and light blue a tipical television advertising in this case its obvious that the advertising isnt  adults or teens but toward young children there are fervid discussions on this topic and if it should be forbidden
have you ever seen a young child aged  in a supermarket buying things all by itself no me neither you know why this is ",16
7055, because they are with their parents all the time i do ,9
7056, understand that a child shouldnt be influenced and manipulated at such a young age and that is the case with advertising in my opinion advertising may be  but it is the decision of their parents if things are bought or not and ,16
7057, what products are bought and used therefore ,23
7058, that advertisings directed only toward young children even exists the opinion of parents mostly young adults matters to companies trying to sell their product furthermore young children at this age mainly dont spend their freetime infront of the television but outdoors playing even if they sometimes watch television the chanels for children are already without any advertising moreover its easy to attract a childs attention because of their young age they have hardly any experiences and ,16
7059, everything they see ist something new even if they get attracted by an advertising ,11
7060," that their excitement will last its more likely that they forget about products theyve seen and find something new to think about and to wish for 
finally you can say that i see no sense in or need for abolishing television advertising direkted toward young children ",0
7061,as i dont have any children and dont remember my childhood very clearly i dont remember my behaviour against television advertising and ,14
7062, im not able to answer this question from a childs ,8
7063," of view but from a teenagers one 
there are some ",21
7064, against television advertising directed towarts young children ,13
7065, that young people under the age of five dont know the ,7
7066, of television advertising the marketing and advertising branche has the aim to gane lots of consumers by presenting a product as attractive as possible many people believe what they are told and buy the product we are a consumer soceity and if theres a chanche to buy a product which is attractive and cheap we buy it ,10
7067," this is a big problem of our soceity  we believe everything without asking ourselves if we really need this product
many adults know that what we are told isnt always true children dont they just want to buy the new toy and dont understand that everything costs money and nothing is for free today 
but ",3
7068, many adults dont know the ,24
7069, and the goal of advertising ,11
7070," they buy many things too for example if theres a new smartphone dropped many people will want to buy this smartphone because its new they do already have a smartplone but they are told that the latest one  was better and they believe it 
so the advertising is like a which circle if we believe ones what the producer tells us well always believe it ",11
7071, television advertising is only a problem for young children ,14
7072, for teenagers and adults but what should we do shouldnt we just say that all television advertising shouldnt be allowed ,15
7073," we couldnt dont do that without advertising an enterprise woldnt gane any consumers at all and it would run out of money 
to conclude we can say that advertising is a todays proplem but ",11
7074, for children but for the whole soceity we cant do anything against advertising but we can change our behaviour and start to think if we really want to buy everything we dont need ,15
7075,advertising has always been such an important thing to make people buy their products or follow their business television advertsising is ,10
7076, thing for a business to get new customers but in this case we have a little dilemma because it is ,23
7077," that there are adverts which direct children aged  and here we have to ask us if it is essential to make television advertising for young children are they mature enough to think about adverts or do they just watch an advert an ask their parents to buy them this product

firstly young children cant have an useful opinion towards adverts because they dont have any idea of the real life they are just there enjoying their childhood and living their life secondly they do not really understand everything they say in the advertises and ",13
7078, they cant decide if a product is good or not it could be that a child watches an advert and just sees all these happy children with these toys and ,2
7079, they really want to have the toy too but ,20
7080," the product isnt good for a childrens grown but they cant know thaat because of their lack of knowledge and lack of experience

on the other ",4
7081, all of the television adverts are nowadays ,11
7082, important because of all the new technology children nowadays grow up with all these electronical devices and they might watch tv everyday an advert for children is not just an advert it is ,0
7083, an inspiration for a child and could make a child dream of something a child doesnt want to watch tv if in the pause it has just adverts for adults an advert could ,0
7084," be a good distraction 

to sum it up it is important to say that cutting of television advertising toward young children wouldnt change a big thing children would always see some adverts ",14
7085, in a journal or somewhere else in my opinion it is essential nowadays to have adverts for young children ,16
7086, to have a little switch to the other adverts,11
7087,if you watch tv you see lots of advertises on channels like super rtl ,11
7088," are mostly advertises for young children the question is if advertises which directly advertise  espacially in age  should be forbidden

the problem of those advertises are that things are shown better than they are in reality small children who dont know about that see those advertises and want to have everything that looks interesting ",16
7089, it isnt in reality for example if a little boy sees an advertise of a new playmobil ship which looks very interesting this boy wants to have this playmobil ship it is much easier to impress a little child than to impress an adult because the older you are the more you know about life and who you get influenced by advertises ,2
7090, companies use a lot of tricks to impress people because they want the people to buy trhier products on one ,23
7091, this can be very annoying for his parents on the other ,9
7092, parents can decide on their own what they buy for their children  parents can ,9
7093," tell their children that they should not believe everything they see and that things arent as good as they are shown in advertises nother reason why those advertises should not be forbidden is that nearly every type of advertise is allowed also advertises of sex toys on pages like amorelie are allowed and this advertises are in tv in a time every child can qatch tv sex toys advertises or alcohol advertises should be forbidden in times children can watch tv

",13
7094, those advertises should not be forbidden advertises can influence children very easily but small children aged  are not able to buy everything they want their parents earn the money of which they buy everything as a ,16
7095, decide what they buy for their children i would more think about forbidding other types of advertises ,16
7096,today more and more children sit in front of a tv screen already at a very young age it is clear that children ,17
7097, the advertisments inbetween what is the danger of having ads directed to those young children and should we go ,16
7098," to bann those children oriented ads

firstly it is importatn to state that five year olds watching those ads might get influened in the sense that they see a new toy and beg their parents to buy them exactly this toy on its ",16
7099," birthday said child might even get the toy 

on the contrary i have to admit that i am not too sure about this influence on children below the age of five two years olds are not old enough to get truly influenced by advertising such a young child might not even realise that the toy in the ad is available in stores and it could ask their parents for it

furthermore are those ads for children in almost all cases for toys and the want for new toys comes ",20
7100, from the tv for example a child is at a friends house and they play with dolls and the friend just got a really pretty new doll the child is most likely to go home that day and ask its parents for the same doll the effect is the same maybe even bigger than the one of television advertising we cannot and should not forbit playing with other children only because of peer presure ,0
7101," can we forbit those ads

i am concludingg that we should not bann the ads in childrens programm ",16
7102, for now there is no real danger for it we should ,4
7103, keep an eye on those ads and if there shows to be an actual threat from them ,11
7104, we have to bann them the real problem with this is not the ads but that even two year olds already watch tv ,14
7105, it is highly problematic that some children sit in front of a screen all day and lack social contact ,24
7106, maybe we should reduse watching tv for children to one hour a day or even less that way there would ,17
7107," be less ads which might or might not influence children
",16
7108,advertisement is something we all know as we are confronted with it everywhere on the streets on your computer on your mobile phone and ,11
7109," on however with the statement that advertisements is only manipulation can we allow advertisement that is s young children

if children watch advertisements and they actually like the product that is advertised chances are high that they will keep watching television as they are keen on watching other products being advertised aswell if they are constantly confronted with something they like they wonâ´t stop watching it causing them to be addicted to television  which is bad for a young child that should grow it ",14
7110, is really manipulative as children wonâ´t play with friends or study but only watch television and those advertisements children will be keen on having the products represented in the advertisement and complain about not having these products if their parents wonâ´t buy them of course you can say that parents shouldnâ´t allow their children who are that young to watch television ,14
7111, children donâ´t necessarily need to watch television directly to be confronted with advertisements because they could ,14
7112, their parents watching them if they happen to just randomly go to the kitchen and on their way they see their parents watching television in the living room they could see the advertisement causing the same effect as watching it directly there is ,14
7113, that parents wonâ´t allow their children to be have those products as they wonâ´t buy them however children can be very stubborn and always complain until they get what they want they whole witch cycle where they constantly watch advertisements doesnâ´t make this any easier because children are ,2
7114, much more confronted with the television at some ,10
7115," parents just canâ´t withstand the constant complains causing them to give up and and buying the products which are advertised

to conclude television advertising should not be allowed for young children because they are manipulated resulting into them constantly wanting to watch television and complaining to their parents if they dontâ´t buy them the products television advertising should only be s the people who arenâ´t as manipulative as young children and already know how to resist temptation",14
7116,everybody gets influenced by advertises espacially in the television advertises can trick people to buy the product ,11
7117," the dont really need it so most of the young children gets affected and are influenced by these tricks
 there are lots of ",12
7118, against the television advertising toward young children young children can recognize tricks of the producers ,14
7119, all they want is to buy the product due to the ,3
7120," that the children want to have these product the parents are affected too 
the children want it and they dont know if the parents have the necessary money but there is a positive ",2
7121, too there are some products which has to be bought by the parents ,9
7122," the clothes so the parents have to be informed about the latest products for their children it means that the consumers have to knoe which products are for their children and where you can buy it 
another negative ",23
7123, is that the children might think if they see the advertisments they dont have good parents who buy them just boring stuff when they see the latest playmobil modell the only thought they have is i want it but the ,2
7124," playmobil modell will be released in 2 weeks and the they want this so for the parents its don even possible to buy all things for their children
my opinion is that the television advertising should be in the evening or in the late afternoon ",0
7125, the parents see this advertises and the children dont get influenced ,2
7126, the children can get new products but they dont want the latest of everything,2
7127,"should televison advertising  at the age of  should really be permitted 

there are pearents who dont want their children not to watch television they say that there are ",14
7128, programnms on televison which are teaching their children something new furthermore watching televion is a good opportunity for children to learn a new language whos family have migrantal background and ,6
7129," dont speak the language at home their children have to speak in kindergarten or in elemantary school 

but there are more ",8
7130, for a permittion beside the ,18
7131, that watching television is bad for the childrens health because of radioactivity and ,17
7132, for their eyes children who watch to much televisio per day will get isolated of society one day because they learn to just be alone watching televison and not talking to anyone except dora they will get less and less communicative which will be bad for their future ,17
7133," we all have to communicate with each other to be successfull in life like once a famous poet said   no man is an island of his own
moreover there are much more effective healthy and communnicative ways for children to learn a new language and imrpove their speaking skills than watching television meeting with other children ",8
7134, who are native is the most easiest way for a child to learn a new language not only they would learn the vocabulary which is necessary for their daily life but they ,8
7135," would learn to interagate with others and become part of society 

so ",8
7136, television advertising  should not be allowed ,15
7137, which say that it should not be permmitted can be easily ,4
7138,the main objective of advertisments is to influence the viewer to buy certain products advertisements are always directed at certain groups of people in the breaks of an action movie ,11
7139, the ads are directed at mature audiences on kids channels the ads are directed at kids the problem with that ,16
7140, is that young kids are easier to influence than teenagers or adults advertisements for toys ,2
7141, speak to children really well because they are very important to them they spend every day playing with toys they bind with them linking certain emotions to them when they see ads of new toys it is only natural that they want them because the ads are desinged to influence them often times ,20
7142," the ads display a false image of the product
a hotwheel car jumping through a flaming ring of fire ",11
7143, comming out of an awesome looping ,18
7144," unbeliveable for a young boy that they want to see it recreate it just like a giant dollhouse with lifelike animated barbiedolls talking to each other is for a young girl but these images are not real and create a false image in the head of children tricking them into wanting the toys even more 
there are laws against false advertisement for products targeting other age groups to prevent excactly that to stop getting people tricked by these ads
it doesnt make any sense why something like this does not exist for children who are way easier to influence another problem with tv ads is that children watch more tv than adults their parents just let them watch tv for a few hours ",0
7145," that they can enjoy some silence they often times dont even realise that their own kids get influenced right at home on their own couch 
another ",7
7146," that maybe should get taken into consideration is that these televison advertisements might force a certain role model onto the children 
if a young boy only sees boys play with cars he ",14
7147, wants to play with them and if he only sees girls play with babydolls ,20
7148, he doesnt really care about them but ,19
7149," that children should choose their toys free from any influences if tv ads for children really get banned the toy manufacturers loose their main advertisement platform it will be hard for them to find a new way in wich to reach

all in all ",13
7150, that advertising directed a t young children should be banned it creates a false image and influences them to much,13
7151,"television advertising is and are programs and shows for little kids which are ment to teach the kids specific topics

television advertising is for families where the parents dont are willing or are not abel to spend time with their kids and practise with them so these programs help the kids to learn to speak and ",10
7152, on however kids must learn from their parents or other humans if a normal education is wanted the tv or a computer are not as good as humans for kids furthermore such programs are far from perfect and often show a different ,17
7153, of view on the world than in real life a good example would be a viedeo where animals are explained on soft figures these figures all have the same tall and sometimes a different color than the real animals furthermore the kids ,6
7154, develop a relationship to such programs videos or the computer and not to the humans this could result in real social problems ,6
7155, the kid grows upthe kids ,8
7156," they watch hear and somehow feel their parents or other humans speak this is just given with television advertising

to sum it up i definietly think that television advertising is not good for the kids and should not be allowed if the parents have probolems with time for their kids they should look for help in institutions and should not use the tv or the computer for their kids",14
7157,the use of technological devices is a main issue in our current life also the television determines our lifestyle so it is understanding that ,10
7158," the advertising contains to the television a field where a big group of people can be directed some opponents of this development warn of the influence of children and claim that television advertising  should not be allowed
of course it is understanding that some experts see a problem in an influence of the childrens because young children often do not have a critical opinion towards the advertising and are going to be fascinated by every product and every advertising
added to that experts fear that the contact with television advertising could lead to a worse education because of the easy language and wrong funny meant ",14
7159," children could assume to be reality to sum up children might not be able to develop a right behaviour towards television advertising
on the other ",14
7160," which come to a different conclusion 
in the opinion of the supporters it is really important to start having contact with our technological devices in young years they claim that the child using the devices like television would have it easier to understand other more complex technological devices what is even more the children who take use of television advertising would develop a better behaviour towards the television including not beeing anxious about it 
in connection to this ",17
7161, lots of people state that the forbidden is the most interesting so if you forbide using television it will be more and more interesting for young children ,17
7162," that you have an opponent effekt
one last ",18
7163, to make which should not be forgotten in this contexts is the intention of the advertising s young children with this strategy concerns want to increase their quote of selling young children serve to be a way to increase selling which might be ,0
7164, for allowing this advertising the main ,11
7165, not to allow it the moral ,21
7166, stands on the top of all other ,18
7167,"
to sum up you can say that our technological development ",21
7168," includes the use of television but anyway the right treatment concerning to television advertising is of paramount importance
in my opinion it is wrong to deal with a direct television advertising towards young children because they believe easily in many things and are used as a way to sell products as far as i am concerned ",14
7169, this is an unmoral behaviour,3
7170,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed 
this is a very contoversal statement which was already uttered by many politicians 
in the followings lines you would find an opinion on this statement
firstly you must say that every person no matter who or which age is confronted with advertising in everyday life
either the advertising in newspapers or the advertising on the street you are not able to stop the contact with any kind of advertising itâ´s a very difficult issue for example why should be advertsing for people at the age of six  allowed itâ´s proofed that children of that age are able to keep the external information they get from parents or somebody else in  mind 
in my opinion itâ´s a ",13
7171, that advertisings have the task to influence the public opinion for higher sells in the economy ,11
7172, why should that not be allowed because the kids get informed by their friends about new toys or something like that ,12
7173," for me itâ´s difficult to set a frame of the age for allowed advertising
to come to a conclusion i would ",16
7174," with this statement because you can not hide advertising 
if parents are against this they should be able to forbid to much television ",13
7175," 

thank you for reading my essay about this exiting statement",21
7176,the statement is quite controversal many young children watch tv all day and their thoughts are pretty easy to influence because of that the cool new toys or whatever they see in the commercial breaks is all they want this forces parents to likely unapproachable things ,7
7177, their 5 year old son wants the newest hoverboard for 400 on the other ,20
7178," you could say that these children wont buy the articles anyway and itâ´s more for the parents who need to collect ideas what toys their kid wants for christmas 
",20
7179, these commercials are quite important ,11
7180, for the companies that sell toys but how these commercials look is wrong in my opinion they are brainwashing the children you hear the name of the toy like three to five times with trippy music in the background and euphorical children who overact in their roles but it needs to be said that these ads are ,0
7181, they cant influence the buyer of the product directly because the adults who would buy the articles do not watch kids tv normally when you notice your kids being influenced by television too much you maybe just have to switch the device off and go play outside with your child in order to make these commercials less controversial one should overthink exactly what they show there and not adress it directly to children this young ,14
7182, they should be forbidden completely but their appearance and what they show there in which way definitely needs to be changed,12
7183, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed television always has advertisings there will not be any program on television which hasnâ´t any advertisings in there also young children can watch this they can see new toys or shows they want to watch ,15
7184, it can be useful especially in the time ,23
7185, christmas or the birthday parents can listen to their children and they can say ,8
7186, the parents can buy this as a present by the way you donâ´t have to pay much money to watch television thatâ´s because of the advertisings you see on television companys buy time ,6
7187, they can show their new products or anything else they pay the money to the television transmitter and that is how the transmitter earns money ,10
7188, they can sell their shows much cheaper to us probably a lot of the parents will say that their children are not allowed to watch advertisings and that they should be banned out of kids tv but if these parents donâ´t want their kids to watch this they shouldnâ´t let their kids watch tv at all instead of watching tv they should go out on a playground with their kids ,14
7189, they must not see this advertisings if they donâ´t want this and want to let their kids ,12
7190, watching tv they shouldnâ´t complain about it because the advertisings in the kids channels are not bad for them they are always nice and friendly designed ,14
7191, the kids often even donâ´t recognize that this is an advertising   ,16
7192,were are living in a decade where television advertising is the main income of a channel but sometines those advertisings are ,10
7193, made for young children the state which ,8
7194," write today is about the topic if television advertising  should be allowed or not 

the ",15
7195, is that with the television advertising the children always wants to have more and they love to act like the child in the television a good example is the advertising of the brand geox with showing the children their shoes in a kind of cartoon the children become influenced by the advertisement and ,0
7196," they go out shopping with their parents the only wish they have is to buy some pair of geox shoes because your foot can breath in there

on the contrary of the ",3
7197, the children learn a lot about their own body retaking the ,8
7198," example is the advertising of geox the children learn that the whole body breathes and that the body cant survive for a long time by inhaling oxygen only from the lungs

the ",8
7199, of this topic is that if a brand invests a lot of money in television advertising the product shown in the television will cost ,10
7200, a lot and a lot of parents cannot affort to buy the specific product but the parents wants to make the child happy and they buy the product ,2
7201," they cant afford it this leads that the parents have much more debts than they normally have

resuming of all the ",9
7202, i prefer that television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed because those kind of advertising act at the children like a brainwash this brainwash leads to the ,13
7203, in which the parents could loose the control of the children because they get ,12
7204, much influenced by the television advertising and ,10
7205, there is a high risiko of bullism at the kindergarten if a child doesnt wear a pair of shoes which cant breath the only one ,7
7206," for stopping this brainwash is to not allow the children to watch television for a long time 

",17
7207, much on tvs today the publicity is exploding even tough in the tv theres lot of manipulation which is made threw television advertising from time to time the publicity for children is getting much more ,14
7208, every child is watching tv and is ,17
7209, allowed to do this so the television producers take their chance and manipulate the young children which are impressed by this publicity they believe in their true ,12
7210," 
on one site there is television advertising for children which is useful and full of interesting informations these informations could support the childhood and could take a good influence on their behaviour 
on the other site there is a lot of bullshit in tv so the thing is that the young children believes instantly in these curious opinions thats the main problem when a young child sees something dangerous in tv ",14
7211, the most of them want to try it these things should be forbidden the influence which these things can take is ,4
7212, i was five i wasnt allowed to watch normal tv advertising or series i just watched things for children ,6
7213, that could be a good ,18
7214," because on these chanels there is no television advertising or manipulation or whatever
",10
7215, its difficult to forbid the tvproducers to make publicity for the children even ,12
7216, its forbidden they would do it ,19
7217, they could they dont care about whats forbidden and whats actually not but we can prohibit that theres no advertisement on the channels for children  ,13
7218,in our sociaty advertising is a very normal thing to do people are used to it and often adjust their behaviour of watching to the advertising breaks for example many people go to the tiolet ,10
7219, there is a break because of advertising they donâ´t think of the real function of advertising the function is to influence the viewer and make him remember special products also if you know about that function it ,10
7220," works so what about the children
 the children donâ´t know about the function and are exrtemely easy to influence this way companies could be able to make children buy things and influence the way they use their money which is a questionable thing to do nowadays children are watching tv increasingly often because their parents need to work maybe ",2
7221, is making the advertising adressed to children even worse because the parents often donâ´t watch their children ,16
7222, they are sitting in front of the tv actually you can compair it to the internet there is a lot of advertising inviting the children to click on and see whether there might be something intresting for them the tv is not as extreme as the net because it canâ´t collect information about a single person and adjust the ads to what the person is interested in but the advertising on tv is closer to life because often they are made of short spots that you do watch ,6
7223," showing pictures like the net does it 
actually iâ´d say that the responibility to teach the children a good use of money is at the parents but to their defense they canâ´t always fly above their children and watch them all day long they have to work too 
thatâ´s why ",9
7224, that it should be illegal to direct advertising to children ,13
7225, if they are between two and five because it doesnâ´t only make them buy things it ,24
7226, influences the developement of their brain in a bad way for that tv is not a good thing to do at all but the advertising leaves traces in their heads i guess everyone learned some tv spots by heart one time which is exactly the purpose of advertising but ,14
7227," this purpose is no good for children at all
this is why i would support making it illegal to direct tv spots to children",14
7228,everybody sees advertising on the busstation in the train or in the tv advertising is the most boring part in the whole tv but advertising toward young children is the worst advertising small kids who see this advertising  want this product advertised in the advertising in the very ,16
7229, years of a child the kids learn from seeing what is in there world aroud so they see the advertising and this product stays in their head advertising in television is a very bad instrument to get costumers but the shows and the producers have to do this because their money comes from the advertising just ,0
7230," they can stay on scene with teir shows new ideas could just be made in reality because of advertising advertising is a bad thing for all of the people they see this advertising
but ",10
7231," i see this question i must ask myself what is wrong with parents who let watch their children television for me it is not clear why someone should do this children in this age should go outside with their parents and whatch the nature or go to the zoo when you watch television you can not learn anything in this age also the advertising to this group of age is very agressiv children in this age have to speak with their parents or with others around they should not wach television and of cause not advertising
to come to a conclusion advertising towards small children should be abolished but ",17
7232, it have to be forbidden that parents let their children watch television on a age of ,17
7233,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed 
that is the oppinionon of many worried parents desperatly trying to raise their child to the perfect young adult they always dreamt of it would be but what are they really that afraid of 

they proclaim that cruel comanies from all over the globe try to ivade the brains of their children and spark the firely desire to posess the advertised product the tv spots are immature unrealistic and ",14
7234," harmful to the childrens mentality 
that or and many other similar ",4
7235," of view is probably what drives the most worried parents but why

from the economic ",9
7236," of view for the tv station is is necessary to air advertisement to finance their shows and even the station itself also for teh companies producing products for children it is important for their success not to  the parents but the children who eventually will actually use it 

but lets be honest none of the ",14
7237," above really matter the problem it self doesnt matter 
first of all it is the parents themself who allow their children to watch tv knowing well there is going to be tv spots trying to sell something to their kids but thats only one part a lot of times i see parents just letting theri kids sit in front of the television ",17
7238," actually spending time with them 

",1
7239, it is kind of stupid accuse companies of airing inappropriate tv spots ,15
7240, you can just turn of the tv or forbid the children to watch tv and there lies the problem the problem is not thst there are tv spots for children but that parents just let their children watch tv,14
7241,the discussion about advertising towards young children is a pretty controverse one some people say it should be prohibited to stop the influence on children others say that the companies selling toys for kids should have the opportunity to advertise their products ,16
7242," these kind of advertises should be allowed 

of course critics could think that these advertises would influence children in a bad way and i totally ",16
7243, children could get a wrong view on things like morality if they see advertisings of gun toys eg but ,2
7244, in cases like this parents have the obligation to protect and educate their children ,12
7245, their children wont be influenced this much and ,9
7246," that most parents are reliable by communicating the morality basics to their children

additional the parents ",7
7247, decides what the child gets so parents can ,9
7248, control what their child get ,9
7249, the child watching these advertises and ,0
7250," the children learn that they wont get anything they see in tv and the presents they get get more special

on the other ",8
7251," children could get angry if they do not get what they want but in this case the education relies on the parents and the major parts of the parents know that and we can not prohibit advertising because of a small group of parents who do not know how to raise their children

the good thing about children not getting what they want is the increasing of creativity children who want something really bad but who do not get what they want will build it by theirselfs or just imagines having it this will increase the creativity of the children

to conclude i dont think that this kind of advertising does really hurt anyone if the children are raised in a right way they wont be influenced in a bad way too much by these advertises but here we have to rely on the parents doing their job ",16
7252," explain my opinion to the statement that young children in the age of  should not direct toward television advertising

",14
7253," its absolutely ok for young children to be in television advertisments if its ok for the parents and if the children have fun through it 
on the other ",14
7254, it can be a problem if the child is afraid or has no fun in this case ,4
7255," its better to do this not
the child should ",12
7256, do just easy things in the advertisement if it wants to do it like just laughing or playing directing belongs not to this things ,11
7257, that complicated things can be not good for the child when the child is too young it has in the most cases no opinion about what it wants or what it doesnt want ,7
7258," the parents should decide whats the best for their child 
a situation where ",9
7259, that its absolutely not ok to let a child be in advertisements is ,13
7260, the parents do it just for the money they let the child work for their own money and thats false they should do it ,9
7261," it makes fun for the child and the money can be wasted in a teddy bear or something like this for the child
furthermore its not good to do it with a very joung child when this child is older its maybe embarassing for it to be as a baby in advertisement 
a ",20
7262, whrere every parent should be careful is what kind of advertisement it is they should informate themself about the organisation what they do and if they are good and famous or not really good the money which they would earn is ,16
7263," importent and can say a lot about the advertisement

to conclude ",11
7264," its always the situation which is important to decide if an advertisement is the right thing for the child or not 
the child should do it just ",16
7265, it really wants it and ,18
7266, its old enough and physically good enough to play in it the child should ,24
7267, do just easy things and no directing,18
7268,i am convinced that television advertising should not be s young children for moral reasons but there should not be law against it because i assess this kind of advertising is not effective enough to be made it is quite easy to influence young children between the age of  but ,14
7269, of all those children are not able to buy stuff they are too young to have an influence large enough on their parents second those children are not involved in the buying process their parents do not consider them as reasonable enough to make a choice for themselves and often they are not even taken into the shop finaly i assume that the children do not watch enough tv to be strongly influenced the majority of children watching tv are way older ,2
7270," six to ten years old 
on the other ",24
7271, it is moraly unacceptable to influence children advertisement in this part  of the could strongly influence their developement c,16
7272, in aour modern society is the media there are many different possibilities to use it and ,10
7273," many different ways to think about it 
a topic which is discused by many is the influence of television and internet on young children it is often questioned if ",17
7274," young children should be allowed to watch tv or use the internet this often

first of all it is important to make a distance between normal stuff on tv an series which are made ",17
7275, for young children some parents thnk that those shows arenâ´t good for their children because it is just some dump content or unimportant ,6
7276," 
but others think it is good for children to wach tv because they can learn things for their life or they get someone to look up to except their parents
it is important to included that there are ",17
7277," different kinds of shows for children some are made directly for teaching and others are just made for entertainment 
some critics say that parents should use the childhood and even the early childhood of their children to do something as a family for example to play outside or visit a zoo but the tv is not good for children because they would learn from nonexisting characters what life is about
others say that it is a good posibility for parents who have to work alot because they can keep an eye on their children but they have the time for their job too
to take a look at the topic from another position the television is good for young children because it is another way to teach them how to speak or how to name different things 
when children wch tv they have got the chance to talk to their friends about it and maybe their parents can use it to introduce them into the daily life

to summerize it is anyway a topic which will be discussed alot in the future because there are many positive ",17
7278," against it 
in my opinion it is good that there are shows for children but they shouldnâ´t watch them if they are to young and they ",12
7279, shouldnâ´t watch tv too often ,17
7280, that could effect an addiction but i donâ´t think tv shows for young children should be banned in generally,17
7281," with the following statement television advertising  aged  shold be not allowed because the parents of the children can do what they wanted to do
 but i ",13
7282, think that the parent would have a timeperiod in which the children can watch tv maybe 1 hour a day this is important because lots of joung children dont know what to do in their free time for example if a children always watch tv and the parents are not able to play with the child it dont know what to do in freetime ,17
7283, to this a child who dont watch tv every day or not ,17
7284, mutch is often more kreativ and dont need others to play with him another negativ ,19
7285, ist that their are sometimes tv shows wich are not realistic or just nothing for childs at the age of  but the parents let the kids watch this although watching tv is a way to give the childs something to do ,17
7286, the parents work or do other things but for a long time it istnt the right way to support the children ,9
7287," to this statement but on the otherhand you know taht it is dont realistic 
if the television time can be limited children can whatch tv ",17
7288, the parents are not there but it ,9
7289, mutch that the kids dont have time for themselves but of cousre that isnt very realistic too because you cant see if the parents are wanted to do these rools and if not you cant say you have to pay ,9
7290,nowadays children watch more television than ever it is easy for parents to just let their children sit infront of the tv where they can watch their favorite shows sometimes educational sometimes not during this time parents can do housework or prepare things without having to provide entertainment for their children but children do ,17
7291," the advertising inbetween often they are coloful and full of joy showing children having fun with friends should children really be already exposed to consuming and buying goods at such a young age

my ",2
7292, would be that if the young children see the right advertisment they could improve their lifestyle when a child sees an advertisment for a fun thing to do outside lets say a trampoline and the parents ,0
7293, to buy it the child will automatically spend more time outside furthermore you could argue that if healthy foods are put into an advertisment the children will see it and recognize it the ,0
7294," time they go shopping with their parents and will convince them to buy it

but showing children advertisments at a young age can ",2
7295, help them to be prepared for ,8
7296, they are older and the world will be full of dangerous advertisments if a child already realises at a young age that advertisments often show exagerated or fake things it will be less difficult for them to realise late which kind of advertisments are dangerous if you never see advertisments at a young age how will you recognize that even ,16
7297," the advetisments for cigarettes say it is a good thing it really is not 

on the other ",4
7298, children are very manipulative at that age the brands which do these advetisments know this and try to put themselves in the best light if they let the children think that they will be a superhero or that there are some special gifts inside the advertised good they will want to own it and what do you do as a parent in the supermarket ,2
7299, your child sits down infront of the brand cereals with the special bowl inside from the latest disney movie and starts to cry the parents give in and buy their children the good ,9
7300," they do not approve of it and there is the same nonbrand good for a lot less 



in my opinion you cannot forbid the televison advertisments which are s children brands will always find a way to show their advertisments and does it really make a difference if children see advertisments s them or their parents ",14
7301, a task of parenthood to let your children realise if things are bad or not and what should influence you i ,8
7302, saw advertisments as a young child and ,11
7303, i can say that nowadays they do not affect me because my parents showed me that you do not need to have the brand cereals ,4
7304," they have the newest disney figure inside 
",20
7305,"in todays live we often see advertisments which are s us or your group but to direct advertisments toward young children doesnt make sence at all in the age  children should be playing outside they shouldnt watch tv but if they watch tv there shouldnt be any television advertising which is directed towards young children 
television advertising which is dircteted to somebody ",16
7306,  is very dangerous often those children really want that what is shown in the advertisment  ,4
7307, thats the reason of an advertisment  but young childrens live shouldnt be inluenced by television advertising the influence of other advertising ,14
7308," supermarketadvertising is high at all
so in generell television advertising should be allowed but if television is s young children it should be illegal 
as i already said the influence of television advertising towards young children is too high that it should be allowed     ",14
7309, against advertising directly towards young children is that theyre way to easy to influence and they cant judge like an adult person can if they need to have the advertised product or not that means if a young children sees an advertisement they are more likely to feel forced to buy that certain product than an adult in contrast to that there are ,16
7310, that support the television advertising s young children ,14
7311, the companys who produce product for children aged  want to sell their products ,2
7312, they advertise like any other company and if a children is aged  the parents should decide if the children should get the product or not also the parents can decide if the children should watch tv or not ,2
7313, its all about the parents another ,9
7314, is that the children in most cases cant buy the products anyway because they dont have any money ,2
7315, they have to ask their parents if they can get the product or not and if the parents say no the children maybe learns that it cant always have everything it wants to have if advertising directly towards those young children would be allowed many adults would probably ,2
7316, lose their job because tv stations that are for children are most likely to play advertisements that are for kids ,14
7317," if they would be forbidden the tv stations cant play advertisements that are for their viewers anymore which would mean that some companys would really lose much money  
in my opinion the tv advertising s young children shouldt be forbidden because of the ",13
7318, above also as i mentioned ,21
7319, parents should watch over their children if they watch tv and not give them all they see in the advertisements ,17
7320, this is really about the parents also ,9
7321, not allowing these kind of advertisements is some kind of censorship,15
7322,"save the future of our children

people these days cannot live without electronic machinines almost in evey household theres more than one computer and tv the children grow up with a televiosion which is on the whole day but television advertising  should definetly not be alllowd 
one reason is watching television the whole day makes you stupid you are not using your brain anymore and you lose important skills the brain cannot develop anymore they are only focused on watching and their brain has no work anymore in this stage of age its absolutly important to learn things listening speaking physicaly and psychology things only if the parents support creativity etc the children can grow up to an intelligent adult
not every show in the television is made for children but theyre watching it sometimes the televionsion shows things which are definetly not good for the psychologycal developtment the tv shows us movies full of violence wars or horror and in this way they can scare the kids scaring ",17
7323, caring is always not a god ,21
7324," growing up
relationships get lost because of watching too much tv a lot of parents arent interested in spending time with their kids they are always buisy have work to do or just not in the mood for playing with their children instead of caring about their kids they let them watching tv all the time and this is definetly not the idea of having children
the problem today is that many parents have no creativity anymore and because of that the tv is on during the whole day but this can have negative influences on the young children we should forbit television advertising  just to save their future",17
7325, children between two and five years shouldnt watch much television if they watch like one film a day which lasts about one hour they mostly cant see any adverstising so ,17
7326," it depends on the parents if the advertiser can influence the children

i just see one positve thing about television advertising that children probably learn to speak and say their opinion if they see things they want to buy in the television 
but there are way more negative things about it the worst thing is that children inbetween this age believe nearly everything so the advertiser can say what they want to and every child thinks its true so if they would say you can now buy a brandnew dragon which can fly do all the household chores and is as big as a real one every child between this age would want to buy it ",14
7327, this is really stressful for the parents the children will cry at home and want to buy this dragon and theyll get angry if you say them that the advertiser dont tell the thruth another ,2
7328," is that televison advertising can help people to turn into shopping addicts

in general ",10
7329, that television advertising isnt good for people from all ages but ,13
7330, for little children its a really dumb idea you can influence them ,12
7331, easily and children get stupid with this thoughts that the television tells always the truth,17
7332,since the technology developed in the past years it is nearly normal that every child watches tv or play with mobile phones tablet computers or laptops of their parents or already their own devices a good ,17
7333," about television is that there is a control what children are doing and what they watch on the world wide web you can never now which page your child just visit and what the content of this page is that should not mean that television is good for kids and that they should be allowed to watch it as long and as often as they want
the biggest problem with adverising s young children is that they can be manipulated really fast for example if your child watches an advertisment for a toy and on tv is is presented with chilren playing with it your child maybe really wants to have this toy ",17
7334, because in the advertisment the children all looked ,16
7335," happy 
allowing the direct advertising could effect that the products the advertisment is for are already seen by the kids and not by their parents ",16
7336," the childen can choose on their own if they like the toy or not if just the parents get to know this advertisment and think that this could be good for their children the children could not like it and are manipulated by their parents if they introduce the toy to them and tell what the good things are about it
but controverse to that ",2
7337, just namedit is important that young children mostly watch tv to see the ,17
7338," story of their favorite children series they do not want to the story to be interrupted because of some advertisments they want to know what will happen with the people and animals in the show
to come to a conclusion i defenetly ",6
7339, with the named statement childhood should be playing outside with friends and do what children like to do and if they watch a children story for half an our a day on tv they should be allwoed to do that and not be interrupted by things their parents should buy to help the capitalism to rise,8
7340,"in the modern age it is hard to to not be affected by any sort of advertising
in form of television ads companies try to make their products more popular or better known ",10
7341," by having national wide tv ad they can find new buyers of their product very easily
on the other ",11
7342," young kids aged  shouldnt be confronted with monipulising ads because children often believe in the things they are told they can be tricked into wanting everything that is advertised on tv
television advertising helps a company to increase their profit and this ",14
7343, means that it important for the national economy for example the german politicians that made the abwrackprã¤mie in 2009 help a car company to get up ,23
7344, the crisis in 2008 and to make this very important event well known in the public the car company made tv adsthis ,10
7345, didnt affect the children but it ,4
7346," shows the importance of television advertising 
children could be tricked by ads into thinking that they have to have one special toy to be cool television ads ",0
7347, often build stereotyps that are very damaging ,3
7348, for children when they see on tv that only girls play with barbie or that only boys can dress up as a pirate they often start to adapt these stereotypes themselves without even realising it and this doesnt only affect them ,7
7349, the people and kids around them if they start to believe in these prejudices in kindergarten age they will propably ,7
7350," they are in their teens or an adult
",24
7351, with the statement that television advertising s young children should not be allowed because ,13
7352, that the companies have to get their products to the people somehow but i ,23
7353, they make an ad for a new toy they should show a bit diversity and let boys play with a doll or girls with sword the last thing is that i believe that kids that young should not watch tv at all,6
7354,as more and more content is brought to our television ,10
7355," the last century 
children frequently watch tv already in a young age this circumstance is used by private channels to  address their advertisement ",17
7356, is why the channels do ,10
7357," if they should be allowed to
with the ads tlevision gains a lot of money ",15
7358," the more advertisement the better ads for children usually contain  toys or the latest series or films to watch when the children see those ads they make their parents buy them these toys and are willing to watch even more tv like this the enterprises and the channels gain a lot of money
but what about the children why should advertisement be bad for them
they are influenced already at age  to buy anything they see and have no real relation to the product they want to have as they dont think about it like they would do in a shop
in addition to that they will watch even more tvwhich is according to several studies bad for the childs mental development as it does not have a sense for fantasy or thinking itself 
in my opinion advertisement towards children should not be allowed as they are being influenced by it and dont learn about a toys value in the ads there are many adjectives like fantastic awesome or brandnew that tell the child that the product was almost perfect ",14
7359," that the child does not choose its toys by its own preferences but by the way it was promoted
another big issue is the way that toys are promoted today almost every brand has toys for boys and girls thereby the boys products are blue or black and the girls pink and white in the ads there are ",20
7360," always only girls playing together or boys but there seem to be no more toys for bothb to play with like that the children are already confronted with gender stereotypes that are neither right nor have a place in our modern society 
 as a conclusion i can say that ads for children only have bad influences on them and should not be allowed as they transport the wrong ideals and stop the children of thinking themselves",16
7361," give my opinion about the statement if television advertising  aged  should not be allowed 
first ",15
7362," with this statement because in my opionion televisison advertising manipulates the young children
in my opinion television advertising is only useful to show the interests of the young children
but young children are not able to know what is right or what is wrong and they ",14
7363, do not know what is good and what is bad and in the way the producer of the television advertising do not present the products in a reality way so the producer of the television advertising use this traits to catch the interest of the young children ,14
7364, that the young children want to have the products which are present in the television advertising furthermore this shows that the producer of the television advertising just want to sell their products and ,14
7365," the use the young children
to conclude ",7
7366, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed ,15
7367,"it is a controversial topic if television advertising  should be allowed or not 

of course the industry wants to make as much money with their products as possible but should they use children too reach their goal 
on the one ",14
7368, it is important for buisness to use advertises to make their products popular and they have to be directed to the group the product is about but ,11
7369," a child likes a product from an advertisement it has not the money to buy it 
furthermore are children  very easy to influence and it is unfair to use this 
in addition to this children are not able to decide what is good for them and what not if there is ",2
7370," a television advertisement about sweets which could damage the teeth of children no child would care about it if they look yummy and buy them anyway

in conclusion ",13
7371," that it should not be allowed to use television advertising  because they can be influenced to easy what is against the moral 
 ",15
7372, with the statements from the parents they think all the things that they hear is all right and correct we can connect this with the advertising sometimes a television advertisment is colourful with music and some other brilliant ,2
7373," which the children loves so they want to do the same things like the other children in the television but they dont know what advertising mean so the children have another perspective of the television his advertisings and here meanings sometimes the parents need the children for living the dream that they couldnt many children are to young for decide alone but often the childrens lean a lot from advertisings maybe they learn new words in different languages or they learn how to do something 

in my opinion the television advertising  shoud be allowed but it have to be a good combitation of learning what the advertising mean
",14
7374,"today politics debate about tevevision advertising  aged  should be allowed or not so the main question we have to answer is if this question will help and push the process of learning in the following main part iâ´m going to discuss about that important question

the main ",13
7375, of this debate include the question what is meant with television we would say a programm which helps the progress of learning with the kids and parents combined a process of learning ,17
7376, about the parents and other non fictive persons ,9
7377, with a virtuall help in some steps of learning it might carry the process on the other ,18
7378, you have the problem of the virtuall world the children will have problems to combine ,24
7379," worlds also there is the problem of helthness television might increase illnes in futhure 

all in all thatâ´s the main problem of advertising televison dircected toward young children they might learn easier and better but i donâ´t want to play with the future of my children ",17
7380, itâ´s not profe that it makes ill in future ,4
7381, it might be profed it will be advertising but in the moment ,11
7382, there we have the non profed responsibility of a better learning process and noone will take this opportunity,21
7383,first i have to say that its an interesting question its a new problem that we dont know for a long time because its a new century with the televisions smartphones and other electronic gadgetsalso the companys which make advertising are growing very quickly below ,10
7384, write about some pro and contra ,21
7385," give a statement

its mean because the kids cant handle whith these advertisings and the arent able to know the value of money thats an ",2
7386, people say who want to forbid the advertisings they say that the childrens are very small and the cant protect from the advertising also they say its not fair for the mother because ,16
7387," the kids see something in the television they really want it and thats for the mother a hard time

now the people who think its television advertising for these kids is correct they say that the mother can say no and ",2
7388, she once said no the kids know that so the mother has to be very strict the ,9
7389," that its no problem anymore and these young kids dont have to watch television that often they better play outise with other kids then the prolem is solved

at the end my opinion ",17
7390, that its the responsibility of the mother and that she can handl it also the kids should better play outise because they met other kids and its more fun for them so the televison advertising should be allowed,13
7391, with this statement with diverent reasons the children in this age are not enough old to decide if the advertising is good for them or if the producer of the advertising only wants to make profit they now that the children could influence their parnts quite much if the children see such a advertising they would ,16
7392, ask their grandparents to buy them products which they saw in the television ,1
7393, with the technology we have today children are more and more able to watch television and often they do it without their parents in cause of that they have no one who takes care about them and who looks that they do not often look such television advertising ,17
7394, normaly the children do not even realice how many toys actualy exist and ,20
7395, they dont want to have it but the nature of childhood is if we want ore not that they always want to have what they see in television advertising the toys look sometimes much more realistic than they actualy are the children are going to think that they have only stupid toys and there would be many better ones in cause of that the children give everyhing to become new toys and ,20
7396, they have new ones they want to get an other one cause there are again new advertising with bether toys on this way the childre are going to get trained to buy everything what they see in a television advertising if they grow up they will not come away from this they always want to have the best and the newest things from time to time the humanity is going to get more and more influenced it starts as we see in this example in joung years ,20
7397,"the statement if advertising for young children should be not allowed in television is a very controversely discussed topic 
at ",13
7398, it is important to know what adcvertisements does with children of course they suggest them to buy special food or toys although this could be mentioned as a part of the economic engine of esociety it could cause problems kids cant critizise the habit of wanting something that was well advertised but is not very practical or good at all they would believe without questioning what this advertisement says about this special thing and ,0
7399," they would need the advertised toy and a few parents would buy it to make their kids happy and quiet again maybe there are people saying that the influential part of advertising is not very important kids get used to it very fast and the special channels for children would earn enough money to survive but does this kind of ignoring the problem solve the problem

not in any way short it should not be allowed to show advertisements in channels only for children although these channels need money to work too it should not be earned with advertisements because the children could not think critically enough about it 
the kids cant understand whats the secret of advertising they cant see the lies in the fog of blinking and shining colours their brain is simply not developed enough to question what they are seeing and that is ",0
7400,for the statement television advertising s young children aged  should not be allowedwhich is ,13
7401, an important one to discuss can be found ,21
7402, against this statement is that the children can learn from the television ,17
7403," watching because they see what to do it ist a type of leraning they see something and they can copy it and try it on theire own 
but children are ",24
7404," able to learn without televison but from theire parents and other people
maybe children in the age of two or three are not able to understand what goes on on television ",17
7405," you do not need it 
another ",18
7406," for this statement could be that children get used to early to it and maybe later always use it 

i more ",24
7407, with this statement of course you can say television advertising is a part of our society but ,15
7408, it is not right in the age of  because ,21
7409, it is not right that they could get used to it ,19
7410, early learning from real people the children have arround them they is ,8
7411, from televison it is easier if the parents help the children to learn new things because they actually now how the children is reacting ,6
7412,television advertising  age  should not be allowed is an often discussed statement in this time bacause the media with television computer and smartphones is more present ,15
7413, it is to say that the tv programm nowadays isnâ´t really made for children in that age the programm ,6
7414," age is the same as for older children and in most families they just watch tv with there parents and they donâ´t like to watch childreens programm in this case they see things they arenâ´t supposed to see 
an other ",24
7415," is that if they start to watch a lot tv in this age they always want to watch tv an donâ´t go outside or go play with friend later they just communicate over the computer and smartphone they donâ´t learn the thinks they should 
also a really important ",17
7416," is that there health system isâ´t going to work well because they just sit inside at the coach or the bed to watch some kind of stuppid program 

in my oppinion the television adversising  schould not be allowed they donâ´t have a childhood with the tv they donâ´t learn to play they get stupid because they just know the world in the tv and not the real one on the outside they donâ´t learn to live ",17
7417,the statement television advertising  should not be allowed is a thing which is often discussed in the media today more and more parents allow their children to watch tv every day in the morning and ,15
7418," in the evening often the whole day but the question which we should think about is if that is good for the health and the brain quality of our children
children which are looking tv every day have a more bad concentration than kids which are not looking tv the whole day because the tvkids donâ´t know how to give tasks to themself and how to not going to be boring ",17
7419, their room children which are not looking tv the whole day or not ,17
7420, often know how to play with themself and they have a better concentration because they can play with things longer without beeing boring ,8
7421, to say is that the kids which are looking tv every day have a bad fantasy because their own fantasy is not very supported by looking tv ,17
7422, in tv everything is how the executer wrote it and the children donâ´t have the chance to change something in the history or to create new characters so their creativity has a limit but children which are not looking tv the whole day have a much better creativity because ,17
7423," they play they can imagine everything and there is no limit like in the tv 
the most important ",6
7424, is that parents which decided to make children shoud take care of them and ,9
7425," itâ´s not to make the tv to the animateur of the children when you decided to have kids you have to take always care of them for the rest of your life and try to make them happy in every situation of their life
at the end i can say that children are a big responsibility and that it should be clear that you canâ´t give them away ",17
7426, theyâ´re getting on your nerves or if something donâ´t happens like you want it to happen ,3
7427, tv advertising  should not be allowed because there are ,15
7428, many things you can do with them and which are making your childen more happy than just sitting towards the tv and looking on it,1
7429,humor and sarcasm are often used in advertises sometimes they are even polarising and controversial the problem is that young children dont have the ability to understand the hidden messages of humor and sarcasm ,2
7430, so they will believe almost everything that is said and are easily influenced ,7
7431, because they barely know the world they are in and there a lot of impulses they have to evaluate the companies who produce ,3
7432, toys for children and advertise themselves on television are aware of this weakness and use it for their ,2
7433," for example they try to raise the interest of young children with bright colours adventures and happy childrens faces
on the other ",0
7434, a child cant buy anything on his own ,9
7435," the parents will always have the last word and its there responsibility to watch over their children in our society there will always be advertisements and everyone will be confrontated by it so the children could already get used to it in their young ages
in advertisements often a perfect world is presentated to convince the customer to buy the products of the companies children could understand this perspective wrong and think that the real life is presented this can cause various problems with their mindset and how they think the world works

all in all televison advertisements have a huge influence on children aged  and can influence them a lot so there should be a resct

",14
7436,"          nearly ervery social group watvhes television but one loves it more than any other young children from the age  this is why brands started to develop advertisments specificcly for these kids in the following its gonig to be discussed wether or not these advertisments should be allowed or not

an ",14
7437, for the advertisments is that the products are for children in that age only and seen by an adult they dont make any sense for example if a parent sees a toy advertisment he doesnt think my son or daughter would love to play with this but that the advertisment is too loud or the product has too bright colours only ,16
7438, a member of the target group watches television and sees the advertisment the need for the product can really develop and the kid can ask and get on the nerves of hiher parents ,0
7439," make them buy it 

you can tell a kid in the age between two and five nearly anything and they will believe it thats is why these commercials are really dangerous children in this age are ",2
7440, for exapmle a little boy heres this fire truck is the must have toy for a boy everything else is boring and he cant be a real manly firefighter he will live the ,20
7441, few years with the thought that he never really experienced real joy ,18
7442," playing and he never can be a grown man just because his parents wouldnt buy or just didnt have the money to buy this one toy

in conclusion i can ",20
7443," say that these advertisments for young children aged  should not be allowed because children in this age cant understand the reason behind them and are way too much influented by them



                ",16
7444,oftentimes you can observe advertisements on tv or in magazines catering to children of a ,0
7445, young age range these advertisements try to indoctrinize children into believing they need these products ,2
7446, expensive barbie dolls branded clothing and ,20
7447," of this madness
children are generally easily influenced by the actions or statements of others and ",7
7448, tend to be overly impressed ,3
7449, they see the new barbie doll advertisement with its sparkling and bright colors ,20
7450," it can trigger outright obsessions with the advertised product of course children are incapable of buying these items themselves but they do have the ability to coax their parents who only wish for the best for their children and want to see them happy into spending money on things they maybe cannot afford or which they simply do not need
such commercialization of young children is immoral ",2
7451, they lack the rational judgment of an adult or teenage person you could almost call this entire structure exploitation because the companies are taking ,2
7452, of the young innocent and unexperienced minds of children ,8
7453, that the means of advertising used by the corporations themselves are more often than not flawed marketing practically lives off of overstatements false depictions or portrayals etc ,11
7454, it can shed a good light on the product to sell it regardless of the deception that is taking place because of that it can be damaging for children being exposed to these illusions made by the companies eg unrealistic beauty standards in the aforementioned commercials for dolls and many more as children are tempted to try to imitate the behavior shown in these advertisements ,2
7455," it is with everything else they see
therefore ",3
7456, that advertisements should not explicitly target very young age groups ranging  years ,13
7457, this can cause mental harm ,4
7458, too high expectancies of oneself and monetary damage to the children or the parents of a child,9
7459,the topic if telivision advertising  should not be allowed is in the modern age of technic important and because of the ,15
7460," that young children are more and more likely to watch television including advertisement its imortant to think about this topic the main question is how high is the impact of advertisement on little children and should advertising directly towards them be forbidden

starting of with an ",13
7461, for the topic the question is if young children are influenced by advertisement in the television and ,14
7462, that young children are mentally not as good as older children and do not critizise or questioning things they see in the television its likely that they will be influenced by advertising a lot after watching an advertisements younger children could be highly influenced ,0
7463," with advertisement of a candyfactory and now they do not think critic about candy anymore
but ",23
7464, children aged between two and five can not buy themselves things or are able to do their own decisions there are always their parents which should teach their children that candy isnt good for their theeth or that always having the newest stuff isnt important in life that is the job of the parents ,2
7465," they should take care of their children and teach them how to think about advertisement and avoid an impact on the behavour of their children
but taking a closer look on this ",16
7466, you can easily see if the parents do a bad job at teaching their children their kids get quickly influenced by advertisement ,0
7467, from advertisement s them little children quickly believe what they see and watching advertisements which are saying you need to buy our new product ,2
7468," you will be uncool or if you dont buy our newest stuff other kids wont like to play with you will quickly have a high impact on these kids at least the half of the kids will start thinking the same so maybe they will starting interacting like in the advertisements always ask their parents to buy the newest stuff or stop playing with kids in their age which do not have these new things

all in all the topic if television advertising  should not be allowed is difficult to anwer but on my opinion i think these kinds of advertising shouldnt be allowed the main reason is the on my oppinion too high impact on the little children which could lead to social problems ",14
7469,"advertising in ourdays is the main financial resources for television companies therefor they have a great interest in showing as many advertising as possible as you probably have once noticed there is a huge diversity of publiciy shown s all kinds of telepublic but should it be legal to direct specificly andverstising towars little cildren

in the one ",15
7470, there is to be said that little children have a great impact on their parents ,7
7471, they realy want something they saw somewhere parents often buy the product they are in a way manipulated by their children it is ,2
7472," unfair tu push the children to manipulate their parents for buying an article seen in an advertisement

in the other ",2
7473, the responsability of the parents towards the education of their child sofar it is the responsability of parents to watch as theit children dont get everything they want this has to be one main ,8
7474," in education ourdays exactly because of the increasing number of advertising s children
second an advertisement isnt an obligation to buy an article aigain here it has to be your concious decision as parent to buy or not to buy this article it is no case the fault of an advertisement if parents buy their children everything they desire it is a question of education and responsability of the parents

finaly i ",2
7475, with the statement advertising is in my oppinion a very important feature of our economy and ,11
7476, a new product is released that is in your oppinion more useful than the older one ,23
7477, it is the task of the aducation by the parents and the state to inform the children or adult consumers about advertisement an there aim ,0
7478, it isnt a shocking one s children isnt an issue,12
7479,my question is can a 5 years old child understand what an advertising is or how they get information about that since the 20 century the world has been changing in many ways in electric scientist politics and more im ,0
7480, that many young children use mobilephones television or other electric stuff on the other ,8
7481," the advertising has been grewing up and many stors or factories are depending on advertising 
if it had a law that children in aged  not be allowed to watch advertising the television would change in the programm in the ",14
7482," people who works by the television wouldnt send advertisement because they cant control which guy are watching tv
an other problem is young children cant understand what a meaning by an advertisement excactly is if they wanted to buy something because they saw this in the tv the parents could decided to buy it or not children cant buy something allone and normally they dont have the money for this
but one problem has advertising advertisement about leisure activities like diving or swimming in a river or something other dangerous is for a young child a new experience to do this children want always to learn new things im afraid that many accidents like this in the world has passed
in the end i can say im ",14
7483, with a law because many people depending with advertisement and parents have a jop to look at their children what they do in one ,12
7484, could change the tvprogramm channels for children is that a good idea i thing advertising makes not sense their this programm should be only for learn new experience and to show they what passes in the world,14
7485,advertising is a huge deal on tv on the radio or in the cinema children ,0
7486, young children who watch a lot of tv are mentally not as strong as adults because of that they can be even more influenced by ads that are  them also ads are mostly made in a happy positive way ,14
7487, that children dont see the problems of a product ,2
7488," bad quality or high prices

on the other ",23
7489, companies need to make advertising to get the attention of the children and sell their toys not only would it be hard to control the ads but ,16
7490, decide if something is  children or not kids aged  can hardly buy something on their own ,9
7491," the parents have control over it at this time 2017 the influence by other media espcially smartphones affects the young boys and girls even more 

to be fair they shouldnt watch as much tv anyway but go outside and play with friends there is enough advertising ",17
7492," be overwhelmed by ads that are  them 

in the end adverising cant be controlled as easy ",11
7493, it doesnt make sense to forbid advertising toward young children,16
7494,nearly everybody of us has a television at home at watches tv on it some of us do it more often some of us less but what about little children should they be advertised with television especially mothers with young kids are dealing and struggling with those questions there are different opinions on it but ,17
7495, am i going to give some ,18
7496," and my own opinion this topic 

having a little child isnt always easy not just because they cost mutch and need help with many things they ",9
7497, nearly always need attention they always need someone to look for and play with them ,24
7498, they get bored and start to do stuff theyre not allowed to and they better shouldnt do just put them infront of the tv and letting them watch kidsprogram seems like a welcome possibility to occupy them and get some time for yourself to do some work cleaning the house making dinner whatever and i swear the little will be pleased they will be pleased for a ,24
7499, but in generall is watching tv nothing that really occupies little kids theyre not used to sit the whole time staring at something which might be funny for a little ,17
7500," some time they will start to get bored again but if theyre not they get used to watch tv they might like it and start to want it more often and that is where the main problem begins
little children should experience the world to get to know more to ecucate themself in a playful way they should maybe play with friends in the garden to experience the nature they should bake cakes in their own little face kitchen to get fun in doing things for the houshold or they should take care of their little babydool to feel responsible for something and have something to deal and play with children cant just sit infront of the tv the whole day
of course its nothing bad with it letting them watch tv maybe half an hour aday just to let them maybe watch a serie they like by doing that the children get used to our media world to our advertised world in which tecnology gets more and more important but they shouldnt sit infront of the tv for too long they should play and experience the world 

so ",17
7501, bad to let young children watch tv but it defenitely shouldnt be to long to mutch its more important that they have fun and enjoy their lifes by experience by themself and not by watching other doing it on the tv ,17
7502," with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed 
children aged  havent got their own opinion ",13
7503, like this they are forced to do something they probably dont actually want to do after all they are pushed into publicity and like this they are in great danger think of all the celebrities which always have to be guarded because they have ,3
7504, think that they cant life a normal life like this if they would go to school other children would envy them and they wouldnt want to spend any time with them on the other ,24
7505," like this they probably are going to have a clear future but as i sayed its probably not their wish to life a live like this
an other ",19
7506, why this statement could be wrong in my eyes is that these children are maybe creating their personality very fast but i ,7
7507, think that they could have lots of problems in their future because of that so it can be positive and negative ,19
7508, if you love yourself too much because you are too selfcentered nobody will like you ,18
7509, depend on what the advert is about if its ,11
7510, its not such a big deal to me but it could ,19
7511, be about something where the children are naked i mean ,6
7512, they are children and they cant complain like i already sayed but that would somehow be pornocrafic to me for some reason anyone has invented clothes even for small children or an other example is that it could be an advert about a exersice for children in their freetime and it could be dangerous to produce the advert so youre just risking the life of very small children to make an advert whichs duration will be about twenty seconds ,16
7513, to me is the one i mentioned in the ,18
7514, that children which can barely walk or talk are forced to do something which is probably going to change their lifes and which they probably totaly ,7
7515," with they are robed by their parents which allow something like this and by the people which have ideas like that these people rob the childrens childhood to me
",12
7516,"the statement i will write about now is that television advertising  children under five years old should not be allowed
against this statement is the ",13
7517," that the young children are learning the language with this ads they are interacting with the television which may be positive for there development 
another ",0
7518, is that the kids may be entertained they maybe have fun ,8
7519," somebody in the television speaks directly with them
in addition ",10
7520, in the advertising the children are not influenced very much because the brain does not remember very much ,0
7521, children can be influenced very easy much easier ,7
7522," adults that can be negative for the development of the children
the ",7
7523," is that children do not need advertising because the adults buy all things anyway
also the people in ads sometimes do things that children should not do or they say things children should not say examples are maybe illegal or dangerous things to do or very unpolite words to say
another ",16
7524," agreeing with the satement is that in ads often topics are mentioned wich are not good topics with a bad influence on the child that are topics that are only for adults like alcohol or sex
all these negative ",16
7525," have a negative influenece on the child and his development

after all these ",7
7526, it is important to protect the cildren from the media in their early years it is more important that a child has a positive development with ,12
7527, that are important in the later life ,8
7528, that the advertising makers are ,11
7529, good that they can influence the children very negative and that would not be good so ,12
7530," advertising  in the televison should be forbidden
",15
7531,television advertising is often critizised ,10
7532," if it comes to children and their media consume thats why many people think it shouldnt be allowed but is it really necessary to permit television advertising directed  toward young children
          for the factories it is much easier to let children think they need ",13
7533," they already have one than to let adults think they need something new because adults know what television advertising want to reach and they have a better feeling about money
          additionally children should ",0
7534, have a chance to know whats new on the market ,23
7535," for their birthday or for christmas

on the other ",9
7536, it is a problem that young children are ,7
7537," easy to manipulate the factories use it to make more money and let them think the toys they already have arent good enough
           the children want everything that seems cool to them and if they cant have it because its ",20
7538," too expensive they are disappointed so the factories take this risk only to sell more toys
            another ",20
7539," is that the children cant be happy with the toys they already have because they saw all the new things on tv and want to have them and only want to play with them that makes the children unhappy and they cant appreciate their toys the factories send a wrong message to them

in my opinion television advertising  shouldnt be allowed because there are ",14
7540, many reasons against it the most important thing ,4
7541, is that the factories only want to sell more things and dont think about the children and how it affects their happiness,9
7542,"in the following essay iâ´m going to discuss if televiosion advertising  should be allowed or not
against this statement is the ",15
7543," that televison advertisment could influence the children on from a very young age it would be more difficult for the partens to control the developemnet of their own children it could interrupt or cause problems in the education of children because they start to want things that are advertised but which maybe donâ´t fulfill the wishes of the parents 
in favour of this statement is the ",14
7544, that it isnâ´t proofed that the influence is strong enough to effect the childrens development ,7
7545," the parents just have to be careful enough that their children dindâ´t go crazy in their later life 
furthermore the economic effections on stopping televison advertising toward young children could be drastic it would interrupt the whole freedom of advertising products and with this the marketing companies would lost an oppurtunity to promote their products which can led to lower sellingnumbers 
all in all television advertising  will stay a controversial topic because there a many reasons for and against in my opinion it should be allowed because itâ´s a theme every single parent has to deal with on their own and decide what is best for the development of their child the reason which led me to this opinion is mostly effected by the ",14
7546, of the companies who sell products and whom would have taken away an opportunity to promote their products,23
7547,"the question if young children should not be allowed to watch tv is not that easy to answer there are a lot of pros and cons
at ",17
7548, young people are much more easy to influence than adults ,7
7549, they may think that everything told on tv is real on the other ,6
7550, children are often very interested in things they donâ´t know and they can ,8
7551," watching tv and thatâ´s quite a good chance 
but in this young age itâ´s not neccessary to watch tv there are ",1
7552, many things they can do to learn and know whatâ´s going on in the world but sometimes itâ´s just nice for the parentes to have a break and most of the childen like to watch tv and ,1
7553," the adults can do what they like and donâ´t alway have to do something with their children
the last ",12
7554, is that there arenâ´t only nice and unscary movies on tv ,6
7555," childs can be scared or shocked by what they see
at least i think itâ´s okay ",12
7556, children watch tv but the parentes have to check what and how long they watch there should be a limit which every family can discuss on their own ,17
7557, the children know that they arenâ´t able to sit in front of the tv the hole day ,17
7558, that it is important for the process of growing up and the individuality of everyone to go out meet people make friends and ,8

the television advertising leads young person in the age of two up to five not to buy these objects from the advertising but for the teens it could be an problem the teens can looking for themselves and the young children between two and five have to be controlled by their parents in my opinion if the young children are controlled by their parents the television advertising could be allowed",2

7577, i get this i was ,18
7578, television advertising should be allowed,15
7579, that television advertising for kids isnt a good thing because they have to watch tv to get this information when the childrens are too young they shouldnt watch too much tv or look at other displays because that hurts the eyes ,13

often informs the advertisment about things which are not comparable with the real ",16

on the other ",6

7583," the kid saw something interesting on tv the parents can buy it and dont have to go in a store that makes it easier for the parents and the kid has something to play with
but another ",20
7584," is that advertisments are only between two shows on tv when a kid can watched tv it saw automaticly the advertisments aswell
when you dont want that your young child didnt see an advertisment on tv you shoudnt allow him to watch tv they are ",14

the only positive ",0

in a nutshell ",2
7592, advertising toward young children is pretty bad in one ,16
7593, they get influenced by big companys and the parents often feel forced to make their child happy but ,7

on the other ",1
7612," advertising espacially advertising made for young children gives inspiration and more fantasy they get to know about things theyll never found in nature they get to know how something works and its easer to understand it

7630, it is the problem of the parents ,9

so ",12
7632, i thing that it sould be allowwed to creat advertises especelly for young children but the childen should be more informed about advertises because only this halps againat the problems that comes with it,16
7633,"

since decades the tv is an important part of the modern sociaty it provides information and entertainment in one but ",10
7634," a few years the television for young children  aged  became popular and with it the advertising  them this text will discuss wether this advertising should be allowed or not
the major problem with the advertising to children is their strong longing for their objective ",14
7635," adults the companies make use of that and try to reach the easier target group once  children saw something they want they have to get it but can not judge how long it will be used and if its worth the price
on the other ",2
7636, the children have to learn these abilities sooner or later and ,7
7637, young their parents have the final word in the matter ,9
7638, the television advertising  should not be banned but limited instead children spend their time watching the whole day in the ,13
7639, place in the end the parents have to decide if they want to let their young ones adverts because they have to deal with the ,16
7640,"

 so the only harm the adverts do is make some watchers sad another problem ",11
7641," is their increasing time in front of the tv most of the people watching tv are annoyed buy the television advertising but not children they are interested in them and that supports their time spent to watching
are not supposed to",17
7642,"advertisments take a long time span in the modern tv often the adverts are personalised for the watchers for example on the childentelevisionprogram there are shown adverts for games and toys but hasnt got this a bad influence espacially on the little children who are easy to manipulate
well the economy wins a lot of money because of those little children that force their parents to buy them this specific toy or that specific game this is good for the economy of the whole world and means success
they ",14
7643," know what they want a child that watches advertisments would always know what it could want as a birthday present
and maybe an advetisment break would have the effect that those children would switch off the tv and they would go outside because theyre bored of the long advertbreaks
but this would only mean for a very few number of children the children that ",0
7644," watching would always want to buy the things that are shown to them this could summon up fight in the familys and would influence the relationship between the parents and their children 
in addition these children espacially from age  are in their learning process the adverts would teach them that they are what they have they would know that wealth is everything because you would be able to buy much more to improve your pride and dignity this would mean that they wouldnt know that family and friends are much more important and that they wont ever be happy without them with the believe that wealth is everything they would work all their lives and would always want more they wouldnt ever be able to be happy and satisfied
so ",14
7645, advertisment shouldnt be shown  that much it would influence them a lot and escpacially ,11
7646, they are that young it could have huge effects on them and their whole lifes they could be much more happier if they wouldnt watch that much television,17

television advertising toward joung children has postive and negative sites
on the one ",14
7648, many children are not allowed to watch tv at such a young age ,17
7649, the ads would probably not even reach them but ,11
7650, the children who watch television at that age are not able to go shopping alone or to buy toys etc on the internet by seeing advertisements for those things on tv it would be easier for them to find out about the stuff they could get also the childrens parents would see those advertisements and could buy ,0
7651, books or toys for their children young kids dont have money or a bank account they cant buy what they want on their own their parent or older siblings are the ones who do it for them ,9
7652, the advertisements doesnt have to reach the children but what ,0

7654, effects children should use their time to meet their friends and go on a playground they should go outside and have fun by not by sitting on the sofa to watch tv all day on my opinion advertisement toward children aged between  should be allowed because their parents would ,16

7659, many people watch tv but like that many young children are prone to advertising ,14
7660," this creates a discussion should advertisement  young chilren be allowed

it should be allowed because the companies which is specialised in the production of child products have to advertise their products and direct them to their group of costumers yes obviously the children wont buy anything but their parents will it can be that children will take interst in their offers and if they want it why shouldnt they have it

secondly ",16
7661, they arent interested in their products it ,3
7662, wont harm them to develop some interest in the specific things if they dont do it ,24

but ",24

7665," it could develop a childs view of world with time it will obviously change but a nautral change is of upmost importance or else theyll become confused

not forget they develop the idea of marketing and exploiation of people for the accumalation of wealth for themselves they will develop unhealthy ways of thinking and wont try to share their stuff with others but try to sell it

7675," many of the commercials try to subconsciously teach the kids exactly that 
these are all the possible ",0
7676, that i could think of on the other ,18
7677," many reasons as to why television advertising should not be directed at all toward young children
for one children of this age are not supposed to be watching much television in the ",14
7678, it wouldnt actually be very useful to direct advertisments at them but if they do a major problem would be the pressure they were under ,11
7679, feel accepted older kids do have these issues ,24
7680, but children between two and five are ,24
7681, in such an extreme learning phase of their life that this manipulation would affect them way to easily apart from that it shouldnt be a concern of young children to be a functioning part of our society ,7
7682," this society is not anywhere near perfect anyways
for me the major reason why i ",21
7683, with the statement is because children of this age are ,7
7684, of all easy to be manipulated into thinking they need to buy the things advertised ,11
7685, be cool and accepted and ,18
7686, because they should be exploring the world with their own eyes by that i mean going outside having a lot of family time meeting up with friends and not sitting in front of the tv if they do want to buy something new they could simply go to a store ,24
7687," watching advertisements and expanding their wish list with every new advertisment
in conclusion i very much ",11
7688," they will be manipulated by media later in their life anyway it is important to at least have a healthy basis in life a time in which the childrens happiness didnt depend on media and being cool 
therefore ",17
7689, no television advertisement should be  children of the age ,13
7690,"nowdays we are getting completly stuffed with adverst no day pases without us getting influenced to buy a new decetn prduct like this the firmen creat new needs in us there is even advertising s young children aged  but insnt this a immoralic behaoiver can people really try to influence little kids

firt things ",2
7691," i have to make clear that every big firma wants to make buisness to get  money
 this is the ",23
7692," of our capitalistic system so we should not critizize them it is only right to promotea product you have invested a big amount of thime in even if it is  they cant buy themselves anything anywys so the parents are responsable to manage their kids and show them what they need and what they dont if their kids want something they saw at a tv commercial they have to show them the real velure of this  promoted thing

but in the oppoite i have to mention that like this kids are teached a wrong sytem of values in their life espacilly in this young age the kids get used to this kind of behaviour quit fast and they keep it for their lifetime a complety other ",2
7693, that is worth to mention is the stess for the parents that this comercials create pleas immagine the following situation your little 4 year old boy just saw the recent tv commercial for a fidget spinner and it gets fascineated by this things you hear it day ,2
7694, day that he wants to have this thing parents get annoyed and kids get sad some parents cant stand tjis feeling so what are they going to do corecct they will buy it at this ,20
7695, we get back to the ,18
7696," i already mentã®oned kid getverwã¶hnt and learn a wrong system of values

as a conclusion i can say that firmen should be allowed to adverstise products for young children but only for thigs this kids really need so it hould be forbidden to create new useless needs in young children because they are influenced really fast but ",2
7697," it all comes down to the parents they have the most influence on their kids even if this adverts are allowed in the future the parents have the might to teach their kids the real values in life 




























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































lol",16
7698,"should television adverstising  be allowed this is a difficult qustions and a controversial topic

on the one ",15
7699, the direct adverstising is a possibility that children can decide on their own if they would like to have the advertised product or not ,2
7700, the cildren aged 2 to 5 do not understand the function and the system of adverstising some people might say they learn it ,7
7701, they grew up with advertising  them and can handle it better and earlier but i think the young children would like to have every product they see on tv this can causes big conflicts with their parents because they can not and often dont want to buy everything their child want to have ,2
7702," toys or sweets
 
of course there exist ",20
7703, a lot of good products for young cildren but they do not figure the right ones outthe parents of young children know what their kids really need thats why ,2
7704, with the statement that the advertising  children aged  should not be allowed because it influences the kids too strong and they can not handle it because of their age,13
7705,"nowadays watching tv is a common thing advertisements effect all of us sometimes we dont even realise what effect advertisements have on our actions and mind for example we tend to buy products we know and having seen them in an advertisement once we automatically think we know it
most adults are aware of the effects advertising has on us but it comes to a problem ",10
7706," advertisement is shown  they get effected by advertisements extremely indirectly as they do not know the intentions of it and sometimes dont even understand the content which sometimes isnt appropriate for children at this age
on the one ",14
7707, that televison advertising  should not be allowed ,15
7708," that theres no way to set a law for this the government cant control if there is any young child watching tv at a specific time and therewith cant control if any child is watching the advertisement it isnt supposed to watch
in our society we would have to stop all kinds of television advertising to make sure young children dont get affected so ",13
7709, its up to the parents to make sure their children only get to watch what is appropriate for them ,17
7710,everthing what a little children sees he or she wants to have the question is is it right to show ,12
7711, with the statement above it should not be allowed to show a television advertising  because children can not buy the toys themselves because they does not earn money they are dependent to their parents who earn the money in contrast to that the children ,13
7712, need their toys and they should decide themselves which toy they want to have on one ,20
7713, colours and sounds are everthing what children want to hear and see and these things lead the children to their decision following everthing with colours and a nice sound many children want to have they do not think about the question if the toy is useful thus the toy they want to have is usually useless but ,20
7714, the children have the right to have an own opinion for example they should decide if sounds and colours are what they want to have and if they only want to have colours and nice sounds they should get the toys which they see in the television ,20
7715," if they are useless finally you have to mention that children do not bear responsibility they are not old enough aged  they can not render an own decision they are not responsible enough to buy their own things for that part of their life they have their parents who have to decide it and althoug if they want to have an own opinion they can go with their parents together into a shop and buy their toys there

to come to a conclusion i ",20
7716, statement that it should not be allowed to show a television advertising  but only to their parents,13
7717,with the advance in modern technology and it being normal that every household owns at least one tv there come many problems parents face ,17
7718, raising their children how old should they be ,24
7719, they start watching television will watching tv make my child dumb how will the ads on tv affect my child in this essay ,17
7720," discuss the pros and cons of advertising on tv for children

everyone knows those moments ",13
7721, right at the most interesting part of a movie suddenly theres a break those annoying times ,18
7722, one ad follows another and there just doesnt seem to be an end to it but thats not all there is to advertising the whole ,11
7723, of ads is to convince people if not even manipulate them into thinking they need a certain product for adults this might not always be ,16
7724, affective as with children adults have a certain amount of self discipline and an understanding of money whereas children will see something thy like and not think any ,9
7725, so if a child sees an ad for a toy on the disney channel it is most likely going to go whine at thier parent to get them this toy so arent advertisment companies using young children to make more profit off their parents isnt this unfair some my ,2
7726, but others might see it differently the situation of a child wanting something from their parents already existed long ,9
7727," the tv just think of all the crying children you see in supermarkets throwing a tantrum just to get that pack of biscuits they like so some people might say that televison ads cant be blamed for parents not disciplining their children

a problem might be that if a child grows up already influenced by ads on television they will grow up thinking that its normal to see something on tv and ",14
7728, going out to buy it so the process of learning how to spend money wisely is much more difficult ,23
7729," if their parents never take the initiative toteach them properly something to consider is that children dont just get confronted with ads on tv everywhere in the streets in the supermarket even through friends children get influenced into wanting to buy products then again its the parents responsability to discipline their child and not rely on society to do that job for them 

all in all i believe that television ads should not be banned for children because it can help them understand how to spend money more wisely and it can increase their self discipline by being experiencing what it is like to not always be able to get what they wantthis ",14
7730, parents take responsibility and show their children how to do this,9
7731,the question if television advertisment should be directed  or not can be seen in different ways on the one ,15
7732, children can tell or show their parents what they think they will like and what they will not like ,8
7733, maybe the parents save a bit of money it ,9
7734, is the parents choice if they let their children sit in front of a televison or not ,17
7735, they decide if it is acceptable to let their child watch the advertisment on the televison on the other ,17
7736, people in advertisments sometimes do impossible things which ,11
7737, would cause injuries but as children do not know that they could copy the people in the advertisment and could hurt themself it can ,16
7738, influence their social life if some children are not allowed to watch televison or less than others and they do not see an advertisment about a product but everyone else does and gets it they could get excluded by the others furthermore it can influence a childrens life in a bad way ,14
7739, as they cannot see the dangerous things inside the products the advertisment is about if they watch televison alone and the add comes up and ,11
7740, later they go with their parents grocery shopping they will not understand if their parents do not want to buy the stuff because inside is something dangerous if the parents let the child have the product they saw on televison and the parents do not check what inside the product is they could eat or touch toxicated things,2
7741,"the statement that television advertising should not be allowed for young children is not right i think 
on the one ",13
7742, it is right that children have to play in the garden or in their rooms or anywhere else but ,12
7743," they are watching tv
 you can use television advertising for new languages ",10
7744, from aged  the children learn very fast it is easier to learn something in this age exspecially languages so the children in germany could watch english filmsour community is very national today ,8
7745," people speak languages exspecially english for jobs for traveling and many other things 
 further more television advertising shows many situations and there are many special canals for children ",8
7746, it is easier to understand watching tv is ,17
7747, watching tv it is a way of learning the children see pictures and maybe someone explain it ,6
7748," part of learning in a easy way 
 nevertheless ",8
7749, the children are watching to much tv many parents sit their children in front of it ,17
7750, they have free time and this is ,3
7751," important that children are going outside and that they are meeting friends and play games and that they have fantasy because this is the best part of our life to be a child 
children have to espect the reality and not the fake world in the tv they have to experience their life and they have to live the real life of a child another ",6
7752," is that their are many situations in tv which are not really good for children they show horrible things and the children get fear
in my opion television advertising should be aloud but the parents have to watch out which canals the child is watching so it is no problem and is more a help for children exspecially ",14
7753, they watch tv in a other language        ,6
7754,in our modern society we often watch television especialy kids like watching it ,17
7755," going outside and play with other children they watch programms  them for more fun in watching it but because many kids now dont go out should television advertising  be allowed

first of all we are a digitalized society computers mobile phones and televisions are parts of that society young children should be introduced in using those technologies as early as possible ",14
7756, they get older they wont have any problems in using it thats the reason why television advertising  is a good idea such an advertising makes it funnier for children to learn something about digital thecnologies and often those programms ,24
7757," teach them in counting and social habits as sharing and the importance of friendships
second parents have a short break ",8
7758," their children are watching those programms 

on the other ",1
7759, television advertising  children makes the kids stay at home and watch television they are sitting in front of the display often alone and learn something about friendship ,0
7760, going outside and actually make friends not to talk about the importance of fresh air and moving they dont have ,1
7761," they act like this

all in all television advertising  has its importance because it can teach the children in some stuff and parents have a short break ",14
7762, their children are watching tv but there shouldnt be to many programms like this so children ,1
7763, have time to go out and have fun,18
7764,imagine you were younger remember your childhood ,18
7765," you were in the age between two and five you probably watched tv and the advertisements very often but should the advertising directed  be forbidden

     the advertisemnt is very important to show the children which sweets or games are modern and where you can get them due to that  ",16
7766," it is much easier to find a new present for their birthday or for other children for example if the children watch a haribo advertisment on tv they are interested in the new product and the parents going to buy it

       another positive ",2
7767," of the adverstising is that the kids think more about the different products which they could buy after they watch some different ads they easily know which products they like the most and which ones not the advertisemnt could help the children to built their own opinion about the products and compare it to other ones  

    on the one ",0
7768, the tv advertising helps the children to find new products and they can play with them together with friends ,0
7769," the young children are influenced by the advertising in a negative way    
        
for exemple they watch a commercial about a new barbie and they just think about that barbie and not about other products the influence of the advertising is very onesided and the young children do not know much about other products they are fixed on one product
  the ",0
7770," is that a young child thinks that heshe has to have the product and if the childe does not get the product it could be less cool
 
                  in my opinion the advertising directed  should not be allowed ",16
7771, that it influences their opinion in a negative way they are just fixed on one product and cannot think about ohter possibilities of the product the advertising manipulates the children and they are victimes of the big companies which make a lot of money with the          ,2
7772," with this statement it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward young children 

this could be really bad for their development if children at the age between two and five get involved with television advertising they could become really materialistic and no one would like to have a child which only cares about materialistic stuff a child shouldnt care about such things at all

it would be a problem for the parents aswell because their children would start to want everything whats in the television advertising they have always to say no and this could affect their relationship really bad for exemple if a young child gets everything it wants because the parents never say no the child will become really bad as it gets everything it wants the child has no strict rules or something like that
on the other ",13
7773," there will be parents which wont allow their children to buy anything this children will always see the television advertising and knowi never get that from my parents this children will start to lie sooner because they want to have at least something cool or to do cool things 

but the television advertising isnt the general problem the real problem is that young children shouldnt watch television ",14
7774, often they should play outside an meet their friends to play soccer or catch and hide they should run around ,1
7775, sitting alone at home in front of the television so if the producers make advertising  it isnt completly their fault because parents have to look ,1
7776," their children so they should be able to control with which influences their children get in touch

i come to the conclusion that eventough its really bad for the development and behaviour for children to watch television advertising which were  them its not the entire fault from the producers and the television industry because if there werent that much children which are watching television the big companies havent had the idea of directing television advertising toward such young children so you could say ",14
7777," totally with the statement that it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward young children but if there wasnt such a big amount of children which are watching television there wouldnt exist television advertising toward them

",13
7778,"of course it has to be said that buisness is and will always be buisness a marketing strategy is not being guided by what is right nor by any moral standarts one may have but solely on what works but as the question isnt if ads are being s children or not nor if it works or not the question is if it should be allowed children are proven to be more submissive and more easily influenced than adults if you dont believe that just look at how vulgar words are being learned by children just by hearing adults say them 
advertising in television isnt really a problem if you have raised your child properly and are financially stable if you have not raised your child properly it could be a problem but just a mediocre problem it just tends to be really annoying for the parents the child sees a toy it wants on tv and hell breaks lose the cry and beg until they get what the want because the mother or the father will eventually give in ",14
7779," get them to shut up
the real problem is if you are financially unstable might be working more than one job and ",19
7780, dont have that much time for your kids you put them infront of the tv as it just is convenient and if you get home ,1
7781, a double shift you are in pickle ,18
7782, you give in because you are tired ,18
7783, cant buy the toy because of financial reasons and dissappoint your kid or make debt or you endure their nagging all three are ,20
7784," bad options for the kid or for you 
although having stated only reason for why it should be banned i am of the opinion that it shouldnt be the right thing to do would be to boycott coorperations which use this technique as we shouldnt be forced to do something by the government but by society",12
7785,televisionadvertisments are more and more directed to children that are younger and younger but sholud advertisments for young childs really be aloud ,14
7786," paragraphs 

young children watch a lot of cartoons and other series targeted at them ",6
7787, by putting advertismentss befor and ,11
7788, this kind of series could help promote toys and other thing also the ads would not come up ,11
7789, some ation movies and would not annoy older people whre else ,6
7790, on television the kids see the advertisments nowhere ,14
7791, this is perfect plus the simplistic language could ,21
7792," they might hear other words they are not used to hear in normal circumstances

advertisments for smaller children should be prohibited because it is unessecary and they do not understand the most of it any way if small children see to many advertisments the could be tricked into thinking the world is full of toys and other good stuff but really it is not they might harass their parents because the want all the things they saw on televission but the parents probaly are already at the limit of their strenth and in most case the probably do not have all the money to buy everything the avertisments for young children should go over the parents because they know best any way what is good for their kids and what not

",14
7793, if you do not abuse your position as an older and broadcast advertisment that are reasonable and in reasonable amount it is totally correct to make avertisments for young children aged  but ,16
7794, you have to thinks about them and their parents to not overflow them with false impressions,7
7795," with the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed for the following reasons 

first of all it is very easy to influence young children because they can not prove if a statement is true or false they just ",13
7796, with these people and do not think on their own for example ,3
7797, there is an advertising for coke the children think it is great and they want their parents to buy it ,0
7798," it is bad for them because of the sugar and the caffeine 
furthermore todays young children sit in front of the tv an enormous long time and ",4
7799, there is a lot of advertising even on the prgramms for young people they spend much more time watching tv than playing outside ore studying for school for example ,1
7800," they want to watch a tv series of thirty minutes it takes about fourtyfive minutes only because of the advertising

on the other ",10
7801," there are helpful advertisings too sometimes you can see a show with information about internetsites to study maths or a new language this is very useful for their future in school or later for university

in summary ",8
7802, television advertising for young children should not be allowed because ,13
7803, they should make their own experiences with all the mentioned issues in the advertisings and they should spend much more time of their childhood outside to move and build social contacts ,24
7804, argumentate for and against the statement if television advertising  aged  should not be allowed at the end ,15
7805," show my own opinion for this statement

on one ",21
7806, children aged  normally dont watch television the are some senders like super rtl or kika in german free tv which is ,17
7807," for children but you can normally see films and series for children aged six or seven in cause of that there isnt a high rate of danger for children watching tv
but ",17
7808, a danger is that younger children will watch more and more often tv ,17
7809, they see in the televison advertising ,10
7810, a trailer for films and series ,6
7811," to watch these films and will sit more often in front of the tv  
but if television advertising for young children is not allowed children could be ",14
7812," made for boys like fights crimes and more 
in addition to that you can see wissensreiche advertising and information children can learn from it they can ",6
7813," be prepared with its new knowledge for school and the normal life 

in my opinion  television advertising should be allowed ",15
7814, that the advertising you can find ,11
7815, in german tv is very altersgerecht and not agressive you can let your child watching tv without having any bad thoughts there are ,17
7816, children of younger age could be prepared for primary school ,8
7817,the amount of tvadvertising increased throughout the last years and ,10
7818," increases even channels for children are full of advertisement for toys and other products for toddlers 
should these advertisements  very young children be prohibited
due to the digital age and modern family structures young children tend to spend a lot of time watching television when i was young ",14
7819, i was usually allowed to watch television at the weekend only whereas nowadays my younger brother can watch his favourite tvshow every day this negative trend should not be encouraged by advertisements for childrten aged  furthermore young toddlers are too easy to manipulate and take the advertisementpromises for granted as they are not ,14
7820," able to question the credibility of advertisements 
on the other ",11
7821, there are many companies selling only products for young children like playmobile they must be allowed to advertise for their products ,16
7822, they would have a great ,19
7823," other companies 
moreover advertisinng agencies should be able to decide on the target group of their advertisment it is simply not acceptable to deprive them of their freedom of choice
in my opinion television advertising  must not be forbidden because every company has to sell their products ",15
7824, appropriate to advertise for products on tvchannels which are popular among children ,14
7825,when you watch television one thing you notice more and more is television advertising  there are advertisments for barbie or other puppets ,10
7826," as advertisments for computer games 
now i wondered if this is a bad thing and if this should be allowed or not 

on one ",11
7827, this is advertisments are great because they give children ideas for what they want to have for their ,0
7828," much easier for parents or other relatives to get the presents for the children if they can give them detailed information that they got from an advertisment
its ",0
7829, a great thing for the advertisment industry because they can spread the news about their new toys faster than they could ,20
7830," whn there were only posters 
and if parents really dont want their children to see those advertisments in television they can ",14
7831," forbid their young children to watch television completety  


but ",17
7832, the children might watch television ,17
7833, theyre at their friends home without their parents knowing and ,24
7834, see those advertisments the only way to prevent that to happen would be that the parents forbid their children to go and meet their friends but parents cant do that because that would not be good for the child ,12
7835," 
and children seeing those advertisments can be really dangerous because young children are easy to confince that they really need something and that might be a real problem for families that dont have enough money to afford all those new toys and computer games the children might become really upset ",16
7836, they dont get or have what they see in television all the time and some will envy those who get all the new toys from the advertisments others who cant aford them might be bullied in kindergarten or ,20
7837," they play with other children 
it could ",24
7838, happen that a child that doesnt own ,9
7839," the newest barbie cant play with its friends anymore because all the other kids have these super new technical barbies that can speak and dance 
this child will feel really isolated and depressed

all in all ",20
7840, that those advertisments schould not be allowed and i ,11
7841, think that children of the age of  shouldnt even be allowed to watch television at all or only sometimes i ,17
7842, dont like the idea that they are already influenced by advertisments ,11
7843,nowadays many advertisements are directed to children in the age of  years but should this marketing strategie be allowed or is it to be seen critically in the following essay ,16
7844," controversially discuss the topic and give my opinion

the fist thing that came ",21
7845, i read about this kind of advertisement was how can that be effective normally at that age parents purchase everithing their children need they know and decide what to buy not their children and ,0
7846, they would listen to them the least could express their wishes on what to buy from which brand precisely the most critical ,23
7847, about the whole topic is ,21
7848," that children  years are very easy to take influence on although in that time they probably wonâ´t buy any of the products which are advertised they might remeber the brand and make their parents buy it later on that way the early advertisement would have an effect 

i ",0
7849, donâ´t think that advertisement directet towards young children should not be allowed because ,16
7850, the parents have to decide on what to buy in addition there are multiple advertisements directet to any group of people with the direct goal to manipulate them and make them buy different things they are allowed too ,2
7851,"should television advertising directed  not be allowed 
kids are wonderful especially ",13
7852," they are at the age  they see and learn new things all day and it is a blessing to be able to watch that
and parents are playing a big role in this learning process 

now imagine the kids are watching tv and they are trying to understand all these advertisements they would asked questions like what is he doing there or why is he doing this or that or what does this or that mean which is normal for kids
but wouldnt it be beautiful to see the children noticing and learning all these things by themself because in the television not everything is good there are ",24
7853," bad things in advertisements which i dont want my kid to learn from the tv

i mean dont get me wrong advertisements are not usually bad  they are actually pretty good often in times people are always searching for new ideas of getting the attention of the whole world which is pretty impressive on my opinion i just think that there are better ways for young children to understand life and get used to everything it is just way better to play in the garden and enjoy the nature ",14
7854,in my humble opininon television advertising  should not be allowed in ,15
7855, the children in the age of  shouldnt watch tv at all it is ,17
7856, quiet ineffective to direct television advertising toward the young children because the aim of advertising is to sell their products but in the age of  you dont even realise what is going on in this advertisement and it doesnt affect you to buy this stuff television advertising can ,14
7857, be dangerous for the children many advertisements have plenty of things which could affect the children by showing violence ,16
7858, in the childhood watching tv without parents is dangerous the parents should allow the children to watch specific programms on specific times this way doesnt have to watch advertisements at all the television advertisements for pampers are ,17
7859," made for the parents than for the children themselves but i dont see the purpose why the adults should buy this product because they saw it in a television advertisement to sum it up the parents are responsible for their children not the advertisement company thats why it is not necessary to forbid the television advertising  








chuchichã¤schtli",2
7860,"in my opinion television advertising  children should not be allowed first of all children in this age are more llikely to believe everything therefore advertisments with talking animals would spreed a wrong reality in the heads of young children 

on the other ",14
7861, television advertisments can pay the childs attention to thing they interested in but never heard of it ,0
7862, for example if they watch an advertisment about the heide park in germany they might be totally excited to go there ,3
7863," they plan a family trip and have a lot of fun and a great experience so in this case the family that did not know about the heide park would have missed an awesome family day if the child would not have seen the advertising on the television

but this excitments could be used by companies instead of wishing the best for the children they use the advertisments to manipulate them and to make a high financial gain the companies tell them that their product is needed to bhe happy
 
all in all ",0
7864, advertisments to children should not ,16
7865," write about the statement if television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
first of all ",15
7866," young children maybe do not know what they are wishing for christmas or their birthday if they watch tv they can get an idea of what they want
on the other ",20
7867, television advertising  young childen can have such a massive impact on them in those young years you do not know what you actually want every day children discover something and learn something new so if the television tells them to like that or do this is has a such a big effect on them because they do not know ,14
7868, what the main things in the world are the television may teach them a not appropriate language and espacially ,17
7869," their brain is improving it can have a bad influence on them 
furthermore children  do not know what they are even watching you do not understand the concept of television at all at such a young age they might get in the situation where they don not know what is reality and what is imagination
the worst case it can get to is that the children only want to watch tv because it is ",17
7870," new and interesting for them in these young ages you should not just sit in front of the tv and watch this stuff all day long you sould go outside and play with your friends and get to know the real world

",6
7871," television advertising directed young children should not be allowed
as a child with the age  you should get to know the real world you should get to see what you can do in this world you definitly should not sit in front of the television and maybe even get used to an not appropriate language

",14
7872,many young children watch tv on a daily basis mostly they do ,17
7873," watch series for the right age that leads to them watching television advertising 
of courseadvertising is not bad ",6
7874, but it could lead to ,19
7875, within the family for example because the children want their parents to buy a new toy that they saw in the tv the parents could easily get annoyed if their kid always asks for new thiongs to try and as all of us know advertising often does not promote the truth that is another negative ,2
7876," because we the consumers tend to believe anything that is told on tv and we spend a lot of money because we want our kids to be happy and we want them to have a childhood that is worth to be remembered
also many advertisements are not useful and distract children from learning things that are important they may try what is shown and get hurt

on the other ",14
7877," it does not really matter if they watch it they easily get used to it and get inspirde to try new things at a young age and that is not bad at all 
they do not even pay attention to what is shown and often get distracted 
and ",17
7878," that the parents should be able to control what their children are watching they should dicide what is good for their kid and what is not

to sum it up i am of the opinion that it does not matter if a child watches televisdion advertising or not",13
7879,in our television are advertisments every time between series or just in a break between them but who should be directed only adults and teenager or ,10
7880, watch tv but not the very young ones if parents allow their kid to watch tv they ,1
7881, have to know what they will see not only which program  ,19
7882," what they see inbetween  that means things like advertisments young children shouldnt
 watch tv often but if they do  they can ",17
7883, see what they see in toy shops or other shops advertisments show games and toys in a special light  that means in the best way but parents have to control what kids get and why the children ,20
7884, see the advertisments by visiting a friend who has got this amazing toy ,20
7885, it depends on the parents if they tell the kid what is real and what is fakesome kids ,24
7886, can see what they could wish for christmas or their birthdays ,3
7887, you dont have to go to a shop and stay there for hours because your kid can watch tv and all the toys and games in there that can be useful for the development of the kid ,20
7888, it learns from a young age what media does there are ,6
7889, programs with no advertisment at all ,11
7890," if you dont want to forbide the television you could install only these programs

but ",6
7891, about advertisment to yound kids a lot of kids havent got ,0
7892, watch tv when they see these advertisments they want some toys like other kids but they know or get to know that they havent got the money that could make them feel bad and not good enough ,20
7893, is that they dont know what is real about this advertisments and what is not maybe they think the playmobil firemen can really walk but in real they have to move them by ,2
7894, cant know what is useful and what is not that could make them want things they dont need and maybe they get them but ,3
7895, they are disappointed because they thought it would look or be different if the children are allowed to watch tv the programs should be useful ,17
7896," a school cartoon which helps them to learn maths or something but it should not be unuseful by showing a lot of things they will never get

",6
7897, advertisments  shouldnt be alloweed because you can go in a shop and see which toy you like and ,16
7898, your kid knows what it is in real life and can think about wanting it or not    ,20
7899,"in the following text i will write an essey about the influence of advertising television 
at this time the ",10
7900, of the 21st century a lot of people ,3
7901," young people and children are watching tv and get automaticly much information about whats modern at the momentwhat seems to be nice to own etc 
depending on what program you use the most you get best advertisment fitting your interests
young children are usually whatching programs fitting their age ",0
7902," they might get shown creative activities modern toys and because of that they can get impressions of how to be creative furthermore they are learning to become carefully and learn about the possible risks if they are discussing this with their parents
the problem which could come up is that children at this age are believing many things they hear and see and dont know about these risks what would become a problem if they dont talk about it with their parents eg 
today its easy to get acces to the intenet and their were already problems internationally known of children buying things or games on the intenet not knowing they cost money

in my opinion it shouldnt be allowed influencing children on porpuse with advertisment beacause of the reason i talked about above and the ",0
7903, that children shouldnt spend that much time infront of the tv sometimes just waiting a long time for their tv show bacause advertisment is on screen,13
7904,"mom im bored what can i do  i dont know why dont you go watch some tv

this is a conversation between a mother and her child which is quite normal these days it is easy having children sitting on the sofa watching tv all day and not doing any noise you do not have to worry that your children get lost ",1
7905, they are in your living room ,1
7906, playing outside you do not have to play with them yourself ,1
7907, they can watch easily tv and why not i mean it is perfect ,17
7908," your children are not bored neither annoying neither communicate with friends or doing some sportsexactly 
children cannot make friends with anybody if they are just sitting on a sofa all day long and ",1
7909, they have friends and they are watching tv together they do not learn social contact they do not learn how to do a conversation furthermore ,24
7910, children do not move much ,24
7911, they are young they often get really unconcentrated ,24
7912, they could have problems of paying attention at school moreover children could get health problems by watching tv all day long it is not just that it is not good for their eyes it is the ,17
7913, that they can get really fat ,4
7914, they are eating without moving and doing some sports and being fat is really really unhealthy and ,19
7915," dangerous for children being bullied at school 

because of all those ",4
7916, it would be a good idea to permit television being directed to children under five years nobody wants their children to get unconcentrated students or lonely and normally if people get children they ,17
7917, want to spend some time with them right i would even say that children under ten should not watch tv because it is that bad but most important is ,17
7918, that they do not get used to that consum of media that early so that they could have enough time to get smart sporty and healthy humans which is definetly not possible ,24
7919,in todays life advertisements are everywhere on the tv in the streets or even at railway stations because our children watch more and more tv than earlier the companies produces more and more ,10
7920," advertisements for children the text try to give a answer on the question hould this be allowed or not

one reason to support this idea is that the advertisings could have a bad impact on the children for example ",16
7921, they see a ad for chocolate and want to buy them that could ,3
7922, be a reson that kids are more overwighted nowadays in some cases the could that the children eat more sweets another ,8
7923, is that they tend to do what they see that could end that the children watch a lot of tv ,17
7924," go outside and move

on the other ",18
7925, it can be a good thing ,21
7926, the advertisings are good made they could teach the children to be polite go with a smile through your life and ,16
7927, on in the end the parents of the children can ,9
7928," decide whether the children can watch tv the children  

",17
7929,"in the following the statement television advertising  young childre age  should not be allowed will be discussed 
first of all one could support the statement by saying that the advertisement could influence or even manipulate children at such a young age young children are not aware of the influence that advertisement might have on them and they do not understand that some advertisement is unrealistic and creates a wrong picture of some situations for example there are advertisements in which a girl talks to a cow that produces yoghurt advertisements like that might make children of a very young age believe that they will have the ability to talk to cows once they ate the yoghurt they will be unhappy to realize that they will not have that ability
on the other ",14
7930, one could say that there is no problem in advertisement  yound children because children cannot be prevented from advertisement anyways even if advertising  would be prohibited they would most likely see advertisement  older children or adults this could cause problems because the advertisement could be unappropriate for a young child if they are about controversial toppics the influence that this could have on children can be much ,16
7931," the influence of advertising  them
therefore i believe that children should ",16
7932, be introduced to advertisement that is appropriate for their age ,16
7933, they have time to realize that the advertisement is meant to influence them and can learn to cope with the effects that advertisements have on them as a responsible parent one could ,16
7934, talk to your children about television advertising and its impacts ,14
7935,television advertising directed to children aged  years is a theme which is important in our century many kids watch tv sometimes with older brother ore sisters ,14
7936, some children get an television for them selfes this is not the problem but ,17
7937," they watch tv automatically advertisions are directed to them like toy advertistions ore advertisions for a new holiday park 

what is good on the advertisions is that they could give the kids new inspiration for wishes ore things they would like to do also they can take a short break from watching tv to go in to the bathroom to make themselfes ready for sleeping ore they can loose their will to watch tv ",17
7938," there is always a short break in between there series ore film 

advertising is allowed ",10
7939," children know what it is and what the will from the producers is but children  are maybe to small to get the right message which the advertise produces it can be completely incorrect in understanding ore the children get to know things which the shouldnt parents have no influence which advertise their kids see and which not 

for example a kid wich is two years old sees an advertise which is directed to children who are aged five the smaller kid thinks about the advertise and maybe it was an holiday park were kids under five are not allowed in this case the message is wrong for the two year old kid but it has seen it already this is one example how the children can missunderstood the messages which these advertise produce

in my opinion advertising directed to kids aged  should be not allowed there are to many things in the world which the can explore themselfes they dont need advertises ",16
7940, every series they watch especially because they mostly did not watch ,3
7941, much television that they see advertisions mostly they watch one series ore film and ,10
7942, the film is over the parents turn off the tv and ,1
7943, they did not watch the advertise which starts in normal case right ,11
7944,the question if television advertising towards young children should be allowed or not is not easy to be answered ,13
7945, the opinion of society towards this topic is divided on the one ,21
7946, it could really help children with developing their character it is often said that children should be able to develope own wishes thoughts preferences and hobbys without being told by their parents what to do and what to like or not this developement of character structures should start at young age and ,8
7947, enfants cant just go outside and explore everything that is possible television advertisements can be a perfect way to show them their opportunities but ,0
7948, its said that television is the place where everything is possible and everything can be shown it can show the real world television advertisement often is unreal shows things more perfect than they are doesnt matter if were talking about toys food or outdoor activitys the technical industry uses many programs and tricks to make things look different from what they really are from time to time the modern advertising became more unrealistic and the problem is that young children often are not able to understand the difference between advertising and reality thats why the modern things which are advertised are ,10
7949, a problem violent games and toys beautyproducts which are giving an unrealistic picture of beauty and many other things are taking over the toy market and show children an unrealistic picture of the world and living in it sure children can be inspired with wishes and preferences by advertisements but these days its usual that television advertisements are ,2
7950, telling children what to like not to show them what is possible ,7
7951, is not bad for children ,4
7952, its really made for them but ,19
7953, im watching tv and an advertisement includes violence an unrealistic representation of beauty or other things children should not be confrontated with id prefer my children to do other things to get inspired,14
7954, they watch a movie or a serie on tv at home and every fifteen minutes there is some advertising on older people these ads doesnt have a big impact but if young children aged  watch these ads do the ads have an impact on them in the following text ,0
7955," analyse the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed 
on one ",15
7956, many ads concern things that a little child should not see ,16
7957," things with harm or sexual content the children at this age are easy to influence and they are in a learning process all the time so if they see something they copy it because they think everything what they see is the right thing to do
but ",7
7958, most of the ads are harmless and about shampoo or travelling children aged  normally dont watch channels concerning advertising ,16
7959," it would be not necessary to forbid advertising on these channels
",15
7960, be allowed because the kids often only watch kika which doesnt concern advertising in my oponion parents have to decide by themselves if they let their kids whatch tv or advertising or not ,14
7961, children at this age would better play outside with other kids than watching tv inside the house but thats to decide by the parents,17
7962," i sit infront of the tv at home there are these ads which are obviously made for children

to this there are many positive but ",17
7963, of an ad it is to sell something but to sell something to a child is not really fair because a child of the mentioned age  is not really able to make decisions in wether he would spend an amount of money for something or not the professionals behind these ads have to know this ,16
7964," they are using kids in an unfair way to make money an adult wouldnt spend

despite of this there are few positive things about it ",2
7965, the kids would see some things their parents wouldnt show or even buy them the kids are a little bit more independent from their parents they can choose the toys they like themselves and not the ones their parents like them to play with but there is the ,20
7966, kids change their minds very fast ,7
7967, if they had money they would buy just everything they like what is quite much so obviously as a parent you cant just buy anything your child would like to have which would make your child unhappy what would make you angry and ,9
7968, reason for not being necessary is that ,21
7969, you take your child to a shopping mall they can see all those things ,20
7970, choose a few and the  parents would ,9
7971," know what their child likes 
in my very own oppinion these ads are quite unnecessary and using the kids ability to not consider seriously wether something is usefull and a funny toy or just stupid and they are trying to set the kids up against their parents if the kid would like to have something but the parents wouldnt let them maybe the advertising people just didnt consider but it could easily happen",0
7972,a big part of todays television is advertisement after every ten minutes the show you love stopps and a good looking woman appears to try to sell you a shampoo thatll make your hair grow smoother we are adults and we know that sometimes advertisement lie and try to manipulate you to buy articles you dont need but what about children ,2
7973," the ones  is it ethical to make advertisements toward them

children are easily fascinated advertisements can take ",16
7974, of that to manipulate a child into wanting the advertised article if we put it this way they are taking ,16
7975, of helpless beings to make money ,23
7976, is that the advertisers could crush the hopes of a young chld ,11
7977," to buy the article the child was tricked into wanting the advertisers play with the feeling of a young child abuse them mentally in a way

small children are easily impressed but they are equally easily turned off by something its not like they like everything that they see in that sense you ",16
7978," have to have the right idea for a toy to impress the children addionally if you have invented a toy that makes children happy is it really ethically wrong to try to get these toys to them by advertising if the toy makes the child happy and the parents are willing to buy it wont that make everyone happy the child is happy because it got the toy the parents are happy because the child is happy and the advertiser is happy because he did his job right 
another ",20
7979, is that parents are not powerless they ,9
7980," have influence on their child and could talk the child out of it

in my opinion it is not wrong to advertise toward young children ",16
7981, children who are two years old cant even react to the manipulation from advertisements because theyre too young they just like it or not and we are the same we ,16
7982, like something or not and if we do like the concept of something it wouldnt matter if there was manipulation well ,21
7983, buy it even if the kids were tricked would it really matter the goal of everyone would ,20
7984, be achieved right the child would ,8
7985, hapiness and would not become a wrong and bad happiness ,21
7986,today many children watch the television and ,17
7987, they often see advertisements the majority of these advertisements is directed to older people ,11
7988, to their parents but there are ,7
7989," advertisements directed  too but should that be allowed 
first of all there is always television advertising nearly on every channel and for everyone at any time so why shouldnt the be advertisements for young children too
a problem could be that toddlers can be easier influenced by the advertisements than older people because they understand less and often take everything for real this ",14
7990," could be used in a bad way 
but ",21
7991, children at a young age usually dont have the ability to purchase anything anyway ,9
7992," it appears as if  the advertisements children see in have no effects but children could try to influence their parents to buy them things 
although this could be parents have to control what their children watch and they are responsable for their children 
moreover children often dont understand the avertisements directed to older people and it would be nicer for them to have advertisements directed to them too 
furthermore it isnt that easy to say if an advertisement is really directed to children who are  years old and them forbid them there are many grey zones and it would lead to more work and costs to control the television advertising 
in my opinion advertisements arent that dangerous to watch for children and im not concerned that children are badly influenced by what they see on the television moreover ",14
7993, it is better if there is television advertising that they understand than only for older people all in one ,11
7994," that television advertising should not be allowed 
",15
7995,"essay advertising

consumers become younger and younger theres no child that goes with his family into the shopping mall and only want some chocolat the want the longest praline in the world or  the chocolat with the goo milk inside should we protect our children against the kind of manipulation in the following essay ",16
7996, discuss if it would be good or not ,21
7997," television advertising  shuld not be allowed

first of all you have to think about for who the ad really is for the young children speaking only  a few words or for there parents to know what kind of toys the sholud buy for there child and if the parents cant withstand this advertisement its another proplem but the kids themself have no money no chance to get into the mall without there parents ",15
7998," it should be the task for the parents to teach there children what to buy and how to manage money
never the less the ads has a bit of influence to the children and the may want things the parents cant buy them this could end in a bad situation for the parents and the child too

all in all ",16
7999, ads are an important part of our lifes because they manipulate us in different ways and it s the parents exercise to show the children that not all of the advertisement are good for the consumer ,0
8000, the younger they learn that the better is it for them and ,24
8001, ad with 10 years and want to buy this without any kind of mã¤ãÿigung,18
8002,advertisement is a very large segment of our industry it shows the big aim of all trade making money but within which borders is this ,11
8003," ethically acceptable how far are is one allowed to go to sell our products can one target children

i say no television advertising s young children should not be allowed it should not be allowed because it means attaking the weakest part of our society for selfish means it is a missuse of our psychological understanding of childrens minds of course one could say that seen this way the advertisement targetting adults is nothing else but a missuse of psycological human understanding but adults generally are rational responsibly living and have had some life experience ",14
8004, the consciousnes of small children is only developed to a small size ,8
8005, they dont have any life experience they are not able to be responsible for themselves to understand what it actually means to buy something they are not ,3
8006," critical thinkers

therefor the parents should be in charge of what a child needs and what should be bought and directing all this advertising towards the children only makes it more difficult for the parents to raise the rational critical thinkers we all want to be with in our society",2
8007,"nobody really likes advertisements but if the question comes up if they should be directed  aswell the societys opinions start to split up into two groups 
first young children are humans aswell as adults and ",16
8008, are getting manipulated by advertisemants but until the age of five years it is definitively the parents fault if they buy things for their children which were seen in advertisements in our modern society there is manipulation everywhere ,2
8009," it would be awkward if the children to an age of five were the only ones not getting involved into the system of the modern life
on the other ",12
8010, it would probably be better to take children out of the system until they are five years old because they are not ,12
8011, certain of a division into poor and rich that much because nobody is really investing money to get expensive clother from special designers or toys from special stores so there wouldnâ´t be such a division in poor and rich in zhe ,23
8012," years of a childhood and poor people would get involved into society a lot easier
on the other ",9
8013, aiming on convincing young children of their own products ,2
8014, a whole marked would be forced to get a lot smaller furthermore the children do not really get informed about the amount of toys and clothes ,20
8015," they probably would not know what to buy
but another thing to mention is that it is not really necessary to manipulate young children because until the age of five there is not that amount of time they spend at media and if it is possible to protect them they could develop themselves a lot easier because they donâ´t have to worry about not having the best and most expensive toys and clothes until the age of five itâ´s mostly the parents part to buy sweets clothes and toys ",9
8016," it wouldnâ´t matter that much
last but not least the parents of those children are watching tv aswell and ",17
8017, it would just remain more of a mental problem because the parents are ,9
8018," buying things that are shown in advertisements than things that were never shown

to put it in a nutshell i am convinced that it should not be forbidden to make tv advertising  because until the age of five it is the parents job to buy things for their children and care about it",14
8019,"in the following i will comment on the question if television advertisement  should be allowed

",15
8020," against advertisement towards youngh children

first of all it is very easy to manipulate the opinion of a child in that age the advertisment could manipulate them and interfere with their raising kids a these ages dont know what advertismend is an could easely think that everything in the advertisement is true ",16
8021," they get the produkt they are sad that it is not as good as in the advertisement
also kids should not get familiar with big companies to soon our world is all about companies and names these days and we should not raise our children in a way that supports this
children could ",2
8022," form grops and exclude those that cant afford or dont like the toys in the advertisement

on the other ",20
8023, kids should learn to live with advertisement they should learn to know ,16
8024," the advertisment is honest or just a polished version of the produkt
advertisement can ",11
8025," be a good way to inform kids and parents about the new produkts on the market an maybe help them save some time at the store
the television chanels only show advertisment because they pay them money ",0
8026," that they can funktion as a companie so if advertisement would get 
vorbidden there would be little to no tv channels for kids because they are not profitable
advertisement is ",13
8027," gut for the economy thanks to advertisment hundreds of people have a job starting at the janitors of the tv companies all the way to the people who advertise their produkt and the poeple who disigne the ad 

in conclusion i think that advertisement  is ok and nessesary for the tv channels to exist even if the ads could interfere with the childs raising i think the pros just outweigh the cons",14
8028,first of all the television is one of the tegnology thigs that children want to jouse but if this is good or bad that ist the questen we are tacking today television gets more poplar and everyone whants to have it ore ather thigs like handys and computer to do the same things ore ather stuff kids films and other games are the moste uesed  think and the children get in a conversation withe the television the eys geting bad and they need glasses but the comunication gets better and better and worlds from the undersee and the univorse what perents only can show with books living animels and flying fishes are interisting ,17
8029," just imagen it the imadgening of children can help them later   

i think that children from aged  should not be allowed to sit in frond of the television for more ",17
8030, two houers a day it is not goot to sit the moste of there live at the television and did not see the word the bauteful of the naitger and there freedom in the world the aktivitis and all they can do exept of sitting in frond of the television and just starring at the screen  ,17
8031,having not watched television in a long time i just recently turned on the tv and sat down for a ,6
8032,"
but i was not able to concentrate on the program as i saw a television advertisement which was obviously s young children
a question came ",6
8033," 
should television advertisement s young children be forbidden

first of all the biggest benefit of advertising thing for children aged  is that is helps these young people to develop new interests as they probably do not know everything they can do andor play with
for example if a child has never even heard of lego it may get to know it by watching advertisements created for chilfren of its age
secondly parents often do not know what their child wants or wants to try
they could find out what their child finds interesting by letting it watch said advertisements
howeversuch young children do not really understand advertising and its way of influencing your opinion ",14
8034," they are very easy to catch by an advertisement that was created with these children in mind
additionally  advertising s children aged  probably influences the way that these undeveloped minds develop it makes them gettin gto know the world of consum very early in their lifes which is not good
on top of that many children are easy to convince to change their opinion towards something as their minds are not as far developed as those of older people
this can be seen by parents who want their child to do a certian action and all they have to do to get the child to doing thisis telling it that this action is fun good etc
older people may be more resistant to advertising but children of young ages are not as much

concluding i can say that advertisements ",16
8035," are okay and fun to watch but advertisements s children aged  should be forbidden or restricted by law as it influences them too much

",16
8036," discuss the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

while many people say that companies have to direct advertising toward children ",13
8037, the companies can make more money on the other ,23
8038," are many parents who are defenitly against this technique of advertising 

many children are watching more and more tv and ",14
8039," they are perfect for advertisment in the tv they see a new superhero action figure and please their parents to buy it thats a good technique by the companies to make money 
another ",20
8040," could be that the children grow up with these advertising and learn how they have to handle them 

but ",2
8041, theres the opinion to not allow companies to direct tv advertising toward young children because theyre too young to know how to handle this children shouldnt watch their most loved tv series ,13
8042, watch many minutes long advertisments in the pauses thats what many parents think and me too the young children should go outside and play with their friends on the playground ,1
8043," than watching tv the whole day

i personaly think that it shouldnt be allowed to direct tv adverstiment toward young children because of the already mentioned ",13
8044, and because it can damage their way of thinking in advertisments everythingeverybody is ,11
8045," happy colorful and lovely to each other like its not real life its another world which isnt good for the children because their not old enough to see whats real and whats unreal
",8
8046,television advertising for children is a very controversial topic in the following ,13
8047," comment on the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

whilst some people might say that companies need to advertise their products to make more revenue it really shouldnt be allowed to advertise products for young children this has a few reasons which im now going to elaborate first of all childs dont have as much experience as older people for example children could think that if the boy in the chocolate advertisement does have perfectly white teeth chocolate wouldnt harm their teeth ",13
8048, this could lead to serious problems because the child may eat more chocolate than appropriate second of all small children are much more easily influencable than older children it is the same reason why children arent allowed to vote if theyre under 18 or in some cases 16 children dont know whats good for them and what not and advertising can give them a false idea of sweets ,12
8049, while parents could tell them that it isnt healthy to eat sweets every day advertising might tell them things like this ,2
8050," the company can sell their product more often these are just few examples of cases where television advertising would have a negative impact on children of that age

concluding it should be forbidden to advertise for young children",14
8051,you can look at this statement in a lot of different ways firstly lets look at why these commercials shouldnt be allowed many children in that age dont understand the principal of buying something the cant quite grasp ,14
8052, that they cant get everthing for free secondly children can be manipulated quite easily they belive almost everything ,7
8053," it comes on tv or an adult tells it to them
now we will look at why these commercials should be allowed at the end of the day its not the child that buys the toy its their parent it is the responsibility of the parent not to buy the child every single toy that comes up on the tv screen if the parent doesnt buy everything in the ",2
8054, place the child will learn and will not always beg for more and ,8
8055, children can be manipulated very easily but ,7
8056, can adults look at all commercial for womens undergarment ,11
8057," victorias secret just by putting beautiful women in your underwear and putting them on huge billboards millions of women drag their husband to your shops to spend a lot of money this shows it is even worse with adults
in my opinion childrens commercial should be allowed because its responsbility of the parents and they are as naive as their children    ",16
8058,"some people have the opinion that television advertising for young children shouldnt be allowed 
maybe they are right young children have to learn about the real world it wont be good for them to take in front of a television and learn with it if this happens children will only know about a virtuell world they wouldnt know much about real things in worst case young children learn only similuar things so in future there wont be personal charakters
young children has to talk with their parents its the exercise by mother and father to learn with the child they have to give them informations about life and important skills like speaking and walking ",14
8059," who and how will look up to this new rule nobody is allowed to check up the privat life by a young famaly you cant controll people at there privat house for advertising the television by young people and parents are old enough to decide on their own whats the best for their child only on this way we have different people with differents skills at the world
in my opinion is the statemant wrong the parents should be allowed to decide about their children not everything at the television is wrong and bad people can learn lots of important things there maybe in future children learn with television speaking ",12
8060, for children with parents who comes not out of the country it is a good selution so the young children can learn the languge correct and people who dont want the televison advertising have not use it,6
8061,advertising nowadays is something really important the economy to a huge part would not function without advertising a big part of the  moneymaking egame are the kids because if they see something they want to have it immeadiatly it doesnt matter in whichway as a birthday present as a christmas present from the their grandparents or even from their own pocket money so ,0
8062, the children from the age  are a huge target in the economythat leads to the reason that the economy would never want  the advertisment to be bainedon the other ,16
8063, the mothers dont have it easy with the advertisments because the children would become spoiled if they got everything they saw and wanted so ,2
8064, they would not lettheirchildren see  the advertisments it would lead to not letting them watch television in the ,13
8065, place what would bother and harm the tv channels which are specialy made for kids in two diffrent waysfor example none of the children would watch tekevision ,17
8066, they would haveless viewers which would lead to less companies that are ready to pay their channal forrunning their advertisment ,10
8067, that everything should have a balance ,21
8068," that everything can work whilethe other is working
like the kids should not watch that much television and desire for everything they see but chose one thing that they like meanwhile the chaannels for kids should not show many diffrent kinds od advertiesment ina break between to shows they should alwasy show the same three advertiesments one for boysone for girls and another one for food lastly the thing companies could do is not bring out",13
8069,"iâ´ll discuss in the folling essay the statement â´â´television advertising  aged to to five should not ne allowedâ´â´
first of all you have ",13
8070," say that nerarly everone of us watched television in young age it was like the highlight of the day if you could watch in the evening your favorite disneyfilm 
furthermore children learning a language easier on television for example many immigrants in germany let their children watch televsion ",17
8071," the immgrant kidâ´s are leraning the corect pronunciacion

but television isnâ´t the only way to learn a language and a bad excuse for letting children watch televison for many hours

fact is ",17
8072," you watching televison you are not doing something just by hearing a lenguage without practesing speaking you are far away from actually correct speacking
television advertising is the only way to gernerate money for the filmtelevision studios ",10
8073," why should be everyone able to show advertising and earn many accept the moviemaker for children 
in conclsuon advertising is really important for the televesion studios and they can not not use them if you donâ´t want that you child is watching the fucking advertising turn off the televesion and play with your in the garden or whatever
i can relate d


 ",14
8074,the statement television advertising  age  should not be allowed is understandable but ,15
8075," a little bit too extrem and unrealistic
young people and kids are really easy to influence by informationce from the outcome they will believe everything what they see and hear ",7
8076," believe everything what is said in television advertinsing this could be a big problem because its familiar that statements in advertising arent true or just a part of it is
if children see this they believethat the advertising is true and this could be lead to a problematic world sight or wrong believs
but ",14
8077," its not the task of the government to solve this problem and forbit special advertising 
its the task of the parents of the young children to protect them from information that arent good for them or what they just cant understand ",13
8078," which is a problem with the statement above is the actual usage in the reality
how can the governemnt or the television program know if there are kids in front of the tv or not and how should they filter their advertising of course an advertising for choclate or other sweets is problematic because children shouldnt be attached to want and eat this stuff but its not quiet dangerous
and ",13
8079, the company who want to sell ,23
8080," the sweets could have a problem with this rule
for them kids are a really important part of their selling kids see the funny and colorful advertising and now they run to their parents to tell the about these sweets it gets bought
its ",2
8081, problemtic that the stament is only about tv advertising kids in the age of five often have the ,14
8082," contact with ipads and the internet there the advertising cant be regulated so where is the sense of regulating the advertising in the television but not in the internet or in the radio
in my opinion advertising should be getting proved everywhere and for every age also teenagers are easy to influence and people who didnt have this contact with the lies of the advertising arent protected 
but there is the ",15
8083," problem forbit the advertising of sweets because of the sugar forbit the advertising of cocacola and redbull because of the coffeine
forbit the advertising of meat because the animals get slaughtered with an unhuman cruelty forbit the advertising of hair shampoo because youtr hair will never look like it ",15
8084," you are gonna use it daily
how it seemes its not possible to protect our society and exspecially our children from advertising and the following lies
so conclusioned it have to be said that the statement above is not practicable useful and the only way to reach the goal of the author of this stament is to tell and explain the tricks of the advertiser to the children
so there should be an advertising in the television where young mothers and fathers and teachers are lead to talk to their children
",13
8085,advertising s children has always been a controversial theme in the last couple of years the age of the children advertiser try to get to is dropping more and more the main reason for thar being that young children are getting more access to digital devices since the goel of a lot of people is to earn money they try to find any way possible to do ,16
8086," and the market for small children is fresh and new 
but a lot of people are against the advertising towards young children the mainargument is that they are too young to understand what the advertiser actually do to them they just see a new toy and ",2
8087, they want it because they are ,3
8088," young they are easy to manipulate they are unconsious of most their actions thats why most people find ist morally unexceptable to do that small children dont know what they are doing
but ",7
8089, very smal and have no money or any other way to actually buy anything they dont earn any money ,9
8090," the only way to actually buy something would be through their parents if their parents dont want to buy something they dont have to 
so i ",9
8091, find it morally bad to do advertising towards small children but at the end it is ,16
8092, in the hands of their parents if they actually fall for a advertisement,16
8093, the problem insnt the advertising its the television ,10
8094, kids aged  arent interested in advertising they do not think about stuff like that they more are looking at stuff of their age kids are looking channels in wich mostly no advertising ist showed talking of german television channles so they are only interested in their series and make mind of their topic i ,14
8095, think that most of the advertising kids arent able to understand they would ask thier parents or just forget stuff like that so advertising shouldnt be a big problem for kids of a younger age maybe it become a problem because they just look at it and think that everything that is said must be true and correct they do not question it or something like that they arent able to make their own mind about if the advertising is good or bad like adults or older person do but as i said thats not the problem of the advertising its the problem of the television ,14
8096," if kids aged  were not allowed to use the television by their parents the chance that they look at advertising that could have a bad influence on them is not given 
so my opionion is that the problem isint the adverising its more the television ",14
8097, also series are advertising but just in an other way so if parents wouldnt allow young children to use the television allone this problem could be stopped they would not get the chance to look at something that could be bad for them because the parents would stop that and without their parents they couldnt use the television ,14
8098,telivision advertising is the one wich reaches out to a big number of peopleno matter in what age now a days nearly everyone who ca afford it uses television but should this kind of advertisement wich even reaches out to kids around the age of five be allowed for them  and do i ,14
8099," with the statementtelivision advertising   aged   ahould not be allowed
on the one ",15
8100, the normal advertisement should be accesable to everyone if its fitting for people under eighteen years of agethats because advertisements can be a kind of information wich could be important for some people another ,16
8101," is that its not right to not allow those people who make the advertisement for their shop or business or whatever to bring their advertisement to every tvchannel they want
on the other ",15
8102, the informatin that is given in an advertisement is not always proofed ,11
8103, wrong informations could be spread to young people who maybe arent able to form opinionthe ,7
8104," for kids wich is going out from those advertisements is that kids are mostly really fast impressed or overwhelmed by thongs shown there
all in all i ",0
8105,in germany there are two different main tv channels for children kika and superrtl on these channels children can watch typical series like ,6
8106, barbie or das sandmã¤nnchen but there is ,18
8107, a big differnece between this ,21
8108," channels on superrtl you have tv advertising and on kika you havent
and now there is the question for parents ",10
8109, for the politics should this advertising ,11
8110, for young children aged  should be allowed or even not ande ,12
8111, is kika a better channel for children ,6
8112, there are the big tv companies which are wanting to get the most money as even possible and ,10
8113," there are parents who are thinking that this advertising could be very dangerous for their children
in my childhood my parents only allowed kika in the short time my sister and i were allowed to watch tv when we get older maybe ",16
8114, the age of eight or nine we ,24
8115, could watch superrtl in my opinion this was a very good ,18
8116, for the problem with those two children channels ,6
8117, for young children it isnt a good idea to let them watch tv advertising because in the age of maybe four ore five you cant difrenciate between advertising and the reality and parents maybe could have the problem of children which want all toys which were shown on tv buit this problem you could ,14
8118," have with older ones
and ",18
8119, they can start to watch superrtl ,1
8120," but only with the support of their parents it is very important that the parents explain the meaning and the sense of advertising then it is possible that children can grow in an responsible way concerning tv and tv advertising
but it is ",14
8121, very important that the time children are allowed to watch tv is reduced to the smallest as possible in my opinion children should play outside in the garden or in the nature with friends and should not watch tv the whole day or play games on a smartphone ,17
8122, it is very important the the society keeps an eye on the education of children and takes care that tv laptop and smartphones get an even smaller role in allday live than they actually have and ,17
8123, you havent got the problem with advertising in tv,10
8124,nowadays millions of children are watching television every day as ,17
8125, the advertisement is sometimes  children of every age but should that be allowed ,16
8126,"

firstly children aged  can easily be manipulated by television advertising when they watch advertisements in which other kids are playing with exciting toys and having fun they wish to posses these toys too but in reality children are not in need of them and they get furious ",2
8127," their parents do not allow the buy 

furthermore little children do not understand what television advertising want to say them so it is not necessary to advertise products only for young children it is absolutley useless the most part of young children have not money to buy stuff for themeselves their parents decide what they are in need of and the television advertising shows mostly needless products

it would be much more effective to direct advertisements to children which have already reached the age of eight in this age children are ripe to make the difference between manipulation and needful things 

in conclusion i do not understand why it is necessary to direct television adverstising toward young children the advertisments should include older children teenagers and adults but definetly not younger people than six instead of watching tv young children should play together with their parents ",14
8128,televison advertising  age  should be not allowed this sentense is an very important ,15
8129," in our life because more and more younger children are allowed to directed for an advertising 

i tink that the childern are too young and the parents want that and not the child most of the parents want that their child gets a better life with no money problems or something like that thats why ",16
8130, many parents sell their children ,9
8131, the children stands in front of the camera the children can not dicide on their own want the want to do ,24
8132, many children dont want to be in front of the camera and play for an advertising everyone who watche tv see te children and everyone has an own opinion on that and ,14
8133, the children gets older everyone know who their are and maybe the dont what that some children can get bullied in school and ,7
8134," the children has no better life 

but ",9
8135, the children want to do that because the have fun with that to play for an advertising in tv is an great experience for them and almost the girls like it because they maybe get dresses like a princess and i think every lilttle girl likes a dress lika a princess when the parents are allowed it that their child can be a perosn in a advertising and everybody see it in germany it is okay but i think some parents dont want that because everyone sees your child on screen and everybody has an opinion to that it can be good but it can be ,0
8136," worse for the child and the parents 

but ",4
8137, with the statemant  television advertising toward young children aged  should be not allowed because of the futre from the child it can be ,13
8138, worse and i think every celebritie person know how to feel wehn everybody has an own opinion on that want you do worse and good lika i said the children can not dicide on their own what to do and maybe the dont want to be a happy child in front of the camera ,12
8139, it ois one of the important thing in life that you are free to dicide on yourself what do you want to do and wan dont clearly no child aged two yeras can not dicide on their own because they dont know whats right is and wats wrong because they lived on two years so the parents should be dicide wrong and thats why i think it shoukd be not allowed and its forbit ten year old children can be in front of a camera for an advertising on tv ,12
8140,"it is usual today that many companies try to place their advertisement in the tv exspecially in shows for children there are many advertisement spots in the break but should the advertisement  should be allowed

first of all you have to think about the ",15
8141," that we are dealing with children there are some things which are different about advertisement for kids or for adults you can influence kids more than adults with tv spots if they see a toy in an advertisement break they ll want to buy it 

on the other ",0
8142," itâ´s the right of a company to have advertisement for children in tv shows there isnâ´t any law which says that advertisement for children isnâ´t allowed if you are a toy company and you want to sell a product it will be the easiest way to make a advertisement spot in a tv show 

people who are pro advertisement come with the ",16
8143, that if children watch adverdisement in the tv and they see a product which they are really liking they will have to ask their parents ,2
8144," they can buy the product

but the con advertisement for children people doubt this ",2
8145," because they say if children see something inj tv they really want they will steal some money or take their own and buy this product anyway without any permisson of their parents

all in all the parents play an important roll they have to overwatch what their children watch in the tv and in the tv breaks and they have to control that the children wonâ´t buy anything without their permisson and if some parents are against tv advertisement they order their children to switch off the tv in the break

",14
8146,if you wachted tv or go in the internet you will usually find advertising really fast our modern technology industries get much money with advertising so they bring advertising for every age out ,0
8147, for young children but should this be allowed fact is that young children always want something which is presented for them and dont even think about ,20
8148, the quality or about the question did they really need it for the insdusty is this a possitive ,23
8149, but for the children it isnt especially in the young age childs must learn that they cant have every thing they wanted and advertising  dont really help in that learning process another ,16
8150, is that the children if they get most of the toys or something like this which is presented in the advertising they will play with this and forgot to go outside meeting friends or do hobbies and this age is really important for the livingprocess in this age children should learn to communicate with other children and learn to work or play as a team all of that is very important â´for surviving in the modern society so ,24
8151, that avertising  should not be allowed becaurse of the missed learning process in this age if they dont go outside and dont learn how they should communicate with other people,12
8152,television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is this statement true we can remember the situation ,15
8153, we where young kids and our parents allowed us to watch tv as everyone knows if you are watching tv their is ,17
8154, much television advertising that is driving us crazy even ,10
8155, a short time but this was not the same thing ,18
8156, we were young because all these twelevision advertising influus us we wanted to have everything the new barbie the mini car and the singing pink teddy so we often had an ,20
8157," with our parents because they thought that we already had enough things to play with also hopefully childreen are not allowed to spend much time with watching tv and it is not cool if they want to watch the new a
episode of barbie but most of the time they have to watch a stupid but for christmas very inspiring television advertising on the other ",17
8158, maybe kids can learn to handle money if they are confronted with television advertising they can understand that they can not own everything make decissons what they really need and work for there gifts santa is not coming to you this year if you are not a good kid ,9
8159," go and tidy up your room thanks mum
so ",18
8160, with the statement at the top childreen who are only  years old should not watch television advertising they are getting to much inspired by them and it gets to expersive for the parents they are to young to handle it ,13
8161, that there should be no more television advertising on the childreen channels at all ,13
8162,there are reasons behind those advertisements in todays society there are a lot of small children who grow up with the use of computers and television while watching all the advertisements for adults they get bored ,0
8163, producers wanted to find something to keep these kids motivated to watch tv furthermore are there many children with older sibling ,6
8164, they want to be just like them ,3
8165, by shopping an item they saw in an advertisement through these advertisements these kids can build their own ,0
8166," of view on different things

but there is an other ",21
8167, aswell by bringing small children in contact with television advertisements these kids will form such a strong mind that they ,0
8168, laugh about other children if they dont have the newest doll or the newest shirt this can ,20
8169," lead to bullying as soon as the kids get older 
after having seen these advertisements these kids wont be able to form their own mind on what they like and what they dont like they think because they saw this object in an advertisement it ",0
8170," has to be the best with advertisements precisely s these kids they will have even more reasons on why to watch television advertising something for children young aged will make it very hard for parents to explain to their children why they cant have everything they want these kids will want to have everything they have seen on tv and think that it is normal to have this particular object

i ",0
8171, think those kind of tv advertisements should not be allowed because they take away the chance to form their own mind from these young kids in my opinion are these advertisements meant to be good but ,14
8172, they only cause problems by showing these kids the newest toys these kids ,20
8173, will want to have those toys even tough they just got an older edition of this exact toy a few months ago ,20
8174, without the advertisement this kids would be happy with their older edition of the toy these kids are too young to be able to decide what they really want and what they just want because they saw it in an advertisement with all the reasons mentioned above ,20
8175, these kind of tv advertisements arent good at all for those young children,16
8176,television is very popular in our generation and in every house you find one or more for many families its a possibility to give their children something to do but children cant learn to do something alone und ,17
8177, they arent interested in plays for their age ,24
8178, children aged  should not be allowed to watch tv because it isnt good for a right education and their own development in our society everything is used with media and you need it to live many parents make the mistake ,17
8179, with their children they grow up with the same media problem and learn in young age how to use it another ,17
8180, is what you see on the tv a few years ago you had the possibility to watch series which are ,6
8181, for young aged children nowadays you have the modern serien with guns and sexual things it isnt save to watch tv to five years and ,17
8182, parents never really know if its right what their children watch we have many adults who havent work sit at home an do nothing they sit the whole day at home and watch tv adults as parents are like an idol for the children and show with their lifestyle whats right and whats wrong when young aged children to have the possibility to watch tv you could imagine in which familiy the child grow up the ,17
8183, years for their future life and in this time you have the best possibilities to teach them in age from zero to five and ,24
8184, they forget nothing what they have done so ,3
8185, its the best way to give them something to do if you havent enough time for your childre but the baddest way in the future of the children and not very ethical for the education  for chiildren aged  it should not be allowed and the years ,12
8186, only a very short time and very strict,18
8187,"should television advertising  be forbidden 
my ",15
8188, question is who and how should that be controlled  like turning the tv off ,1
8189, advertising comes  only watching a programm for children without any advertising  or just beeing able to watch a certain time of the day where no advertising at all is playing  it just makes absolutly no sense isnt the better question if such young children should be allowed to watch televison at all not every advertising in genereal is bad and true story not every serie or film playing in the television is bad but if parents let their children watch television ,14
8190, there will be advertising and that it not a problem because why should it be  almost everywhere is advertising in the supermarket on the childrens toys in every shop they go all they see are colofull adveritses even on the street are big plakate there is no problem with that at all for sure children want to have things that are advertised in the television and that can be stressfull and expensive for the parents but ,14
8191, they let their children watch tv ,1
8192, it is their problem and if there wouldnt be any advertising in television ,10
8193, children would see other things they want in a shop at a friends house on the street and ,9
8194," on you cant protect a child from what they are going to see or what they are going to want
so no television advertising  younger children should not be forbidden because it is normal in our period of time


advice for parents which are saying that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed let your children play outside ",14
8195, you didn have to deal with such questions,18
8196, discuss the question if television advertising  should be allowed or not this is a topic many people disuss and it is not easy to say if it should be allowed or not there are many ,15
8197," that have to be discussed to make a decision about it
one ",21
8198, to allow the television advertising s young children is that these children feel part of the society ,13
8199, it could be that children do not feel involved on the other ,24
8200, it could be kind of manipulation to direct television advertising towards children there are too young to deside on their own if an advertising or the product in it is good or not that could be ,16
8201, for television advertising s children maybe they could learn to deside on their own with this advertising for sure it would be better ,14
8202," parents could help their children in another way to learn how to make decisions 
another ",9
8203, for showing advertising directly to kids is that it could be boring for children ,16
8204," they see advertising for adults only 
there are more ",16
8205, to show advertising to children directly but the only real good ,0
8206, is that it could be to boring for children to only watch advertisments for adults but anyway ,16
8207, to this statement because iâ´m sure there are way more better activities for children  than to watch television and the advertisments,17
8208,i dont care if young kids see the advcertisments on tv they have parents to care for them if the parents dont do theire job right its their fault if theier kids want some toys they saw in a tv commercial the advertisment industrie ,14
8209, has to make money and we live in a luxury world where everyone just wants to consume and think about himself crying about the ,23
8210, that many children are about to be roboters in the future is really funny because i think we should change our whole society and ,12
8211, a bit stuff on tv i hate to sit here in this room with all the ,1
8212, called students who are slaves of our society and are about to have a monotone life that cotains good abitur uni good job find a family and die no way that ,3
8213, fit in this boring society of robotic humans who click their computer like their life is conected to it if you read my text until this ,18
8214, i hope you understand what my ,18
8215," is allthough im only 17 years old go outisde and travel the world eat healthy and stop sitting in front of your computer all day and lose all your energy to live because all we need is love 
now to the part that will make you happy advertisments can influence kids in positive and negative ",0
8216, it would definitly be a idea to stop advertisments for toys like guns or other bad stuff that could bring kids a wrong idea of life and that hurting peolple is wrong to be honest i ,13
8217, have no idea what to tell you through this text all i have to say is that all we need is to chill and spread some love ,18
8218, do not have enough words ,18
8219, now im just filling up my text that it looks like i have written enough ,18
8220, yeah blah blah blah i have no idea what to write to be continued or nor no one knows,18
8221,television advertising deirected towards children is a theme often discussed by various groups of people there are ,14
8222, for and against it and it isnt easy to decide wether it should be allowed or not in this essay ,21
8223," weigh up the reasons to forbid and the reasons to allow television advertiing s young children

first of all if the selled product is an object invented for children why shouldnt the advertising be s the children today the television is one of the easiest ways to communicate with people and to reach out to them because a lot of young children watch television on a regular basis why not use the opportunity and show them what products meant for them are on the market
an argument against the ",13
8224," stated above is that the children dont have to pay for the products them self and they dont know how to deal with money when they see something they like on television theyre probably going to ask their parents to buy it for families with higher incomes this isnt a huge problem but parents who cant afford these toys or books or whatever is being selled are going to disappoint their children because they cannot understand why they cant get it 
beside that  children are very manipulative and get excited easily they cant decide wheter they need the product or not because theyre blinded by the advertisment and its promises if some childrens parents can afford the products and some cant there is going to be rivalry and jealousy because of the promises of the advertising that this product is the best and if you have it youre better ",2
8225, again there are a lot of ways how parents who dont want their children to see the advertising can prevent them from watching it like telling them to do something else like brushing their teeth or clearing up their room or  just mute the television ,14
8226," advertising is played like this everyone can decide wheter they allow advertising in their home or not



i ",11
8227, think that advertising s young children should be allowed because now a days where else can you reach ot to children as easy as on television and i dont think it harms children in any way added to this i think its the parents decision if they want their children to watch advertising or not,14
8228,"today there are television advertisings for everything  everyone but is it really a good idea to show advertisings that are 

children shouldnt be manipulated
you could say that if there are products for children like toys ",14
8229," it should be them who see it today every product is advertised to have a chance on the market and it would be no use if those advertisings would be  adults who at least the most of them arent interested in toys for children
but the problem is that children dont understand what an advertising is they cant distinguish between what they really need and what they are just told that they need a child believes the big and wise adult who tells it with a big smile on his face to show that he cares for the child that its absolutely necessary to buy this product children are easy to manipulate  but manipulating is a bad thing

its quite unfair toward parents to speculate that they will buy their children everything they want
maybe there are some parents who always get stressed as soon as their child has its birthday because they dont know at all what gift they should buy so if the child sometimes is watching television it knows exactly what presents it wants there wouldnt be any need of looking at all the gift catalogs or going in gift shops which honestly isnt that funny with a child who wants every ",2
8230," thing it sees
but its ",18
8231, a manipulative thinking that parents will buy exactly the things their children want people who make these advertisings speculate that the children will tell their parents ,2
8232, often what they want until the parents will just buy it ,9
8233, the child stops complaining also a child should be able to be happy for every present it gets  and not just for the toys it sees at television advertisings it can be quite fun to go with children to gift and toy shops and ,20
8234," parents dont have the time for it or just dont like it they will think alot about what to buy their children and dont want to just have to buy the toys from television which are mostly quite unnecessary to make their child happy

my opinion is that there shouldnt be television advertisings toward children there are enough other influences in this world which arent always good a child should learn to have its own opinion to know what it really  wants or needs and not what everyone else thinks is cool or what the television says is funny different interests are important  a child should learn to be itself and not like the child in the advertising",14
8235,"many people say television advertising  shouldnt be allowed anymore but why does it need to be stopped or does it even
on the one ",15
8236, advertisement  is very helpful it isnt helpful for the children but for their parents the parents are often watching way more television than their children and they are the ones who buy the products shown in the advertising they get attention on new and better products for their child and if they buy it the child hopefully will be happy ,0
8237," joyful parents
on the other ",9
8238, the children get this kind of wanting everything thats new or seems to be better they get integrated in our world of consume far too young children in that age cant decide wether something they want is useful or wether they need it or not they only see it on television where the products are shown as perfect negative ,2
8239," of the product like becoming less creative are left out and the child only sees the good things the child becomes a consumer in an age it doesnt even know how to care about itself
i myself think that television advertising  isnt something you have to stop children in that age just shouldnt be allowed to watch that much television that this thinking of needing everythink can take place in their brains in my opinion it is in the parents might to let advertising not be a problem but something that informates and is interesting for themselves",14
8240,theres a big discussion about television advertising toward young children and whether it should be allowed or not ,13
8241," text im going to discuss this

for the television production its important to get money with advertisment because its often the only source of money they ",10
8242," need this money for the porduction of programms for children if they make advertisment for adults or teenagers during the programm for childrens they wouldnt get that much money by the companies that want to advertis their products and it wouldnt be interesting for the children 

this leads to the question what the television producters should show ",14
8243, the advertisment they can leave the advertisment out but ,11
8244," they dont get any money so as you can see they dont really have an opportunity to leave the advertisment out because without money they cant produce good television programms for children

but everyone knows that young children dont earn their own money so ",14
8245, they see something they really want the pranets have to pay another ,3
8246, is that children are easily to impress for example they see a doll in the television and its the only doll they want is has to be this doll and ,7
8247," that doll they see a school of plamobil with a gym and a music class and the children forget the doll and only want that school

as a conclusion i can say that its a difficult situation on the one ",8
8248, there are the television companies who need the money of the advertisment and ,10
8249, there the families who got porblems ,19
8250, the companies shouldnt make any advertisment for children who are that young they should make it for children who are older than five   ,16
8251,in todays society advertising in television and the internet or media ,10
8252, things to do for big companies and ,23
8253, has huge influences in society ,21
8254," on younger people while young people in schools mostly experience adversting through the internet and smartphones children from the age of  do through television parents do now fear that the influence of advertisements will have consequenses and want the government to ban advertisments towards younger children

an ",13
8255, for the ban of this adevertising is that the influence on children will be a lot lower the ,4
8256, is that through advertising societies idea of the perfect human is being pictured for example ,11
8257, little girls see barbies or any of these skinny blonde white dolls with perfect clothes and flawless makeup on tv they dont just want to buy the doll they ,20
8258, want to be like the doll its kind of their idol it makes them think that everyone expects them to look exactly like this which puts a lot of pressure on them at such a young age this kind of advertisment is wrong to show to younger people because they cant think ,20
8259," adults and dont know that being perfect doesnt make sense

otherwise companies cant not advertise for some products because it is for ",2
8260, adults and children sweets and soda or food ,8
8261, would be a good example the government cant ban companies from advertising chocolate because adults like it ,13
8262," as children 

to conclude television advertising cant be banned because companies obviously need to make money somehow an idea for a ",13
8263, would be to simply show less and chosen advertisment the wrong kind of advertising wont have any influence on children anymore and companies will ,13
8264, make money off of them or their parents also parents should have an eye on which programmes their children watch and ,9
8265,if television advertising for young children should or shouldnâ´t be allowed ,13
8266," text

first of all you have to say that the only persons who can decide if their children are allowed to watch tv are the parents other people can think and talk about it but can not forbid it and ",17
8267, this isnâ´t nessecary at all when the children want to watch series why not what dangerous can happen a tv can not attack you or do anything by its own you can decide wether itâ´s turn on or off its just important that the series fits to the age of the child they shouldâ´t watch scary horror movies or agressive action videos and they shouldnâ´t watch tv the whole day the younger generation today should know how to play and use their fantasy like in former times too ,17
8268," they havenâ´t had the chance to use any technology 
but ",19
8269, again that it isnâ´t my task to decide what children shouldnâ´t or shouldnâ´t do and nobodyelse should do ,12
8270, when the parents of a child think television doesnâ´t hurt itâ´s as right as to say televisoin isnâ´t good for my child you can see this by your own have you watched tv ,17
8271, you were younger i have and i am not terrribly gone wrong i have built with my sister a new house for our imagined friends in the morning and later i have watched my favourite series biene maja and now i am writing this essay in english so i am the best example that television isnâ´t a machine for making you stupid itâ´s just a good way for relaxing and have some fun in your freetime but please donâ´t go over the top donâ´t put your child in front of the tv ,17
8272, you donâ´t know what you as a parent can play with it or let it does what it wants after some time maybe 30 minutes or maybe two hours turn off the screen everything should be enjoyed in pieces you shouldnâ´t eat the whole day you shouldnâ´t do sport the whole day and you shouldnâ´t watch tv the whole day just from time to time if you want to,1
8273,the given statement â´ television advertising aged  should not be allowed â´ is ,15
8274," is that itâ´s way better to not put children around the mentioned age infront of a television because they easily get addicted to the series but itâ´s way more importent for them to explore the real world around them sure the shown series and movies are extra for children but the children should go outside and play with their friends siblings or familiy members if they always sit infront of the television just because parents thinkn itâ´s  good for them the children could miss the an important part of there childhood so if the television advertising directly  wouldnâ´t be allowed there wouldnâ´t be an excuse for the children to not exlore their surroundings
on the other ",17
8275, made for children around this age ,8
8276, it should be easy to understand and ,18
8277, give them new things to dry for example are there lots of series like â´art attack â´which are about making new stuff with paper drawings toys and etc by themselves that is a pretty good opportunity for children to be creative and try lots of new stuff there is ,24
8278, a type of series like â´doraâ´ which is about learning english for children in an easily to understand way which is sometimes very good ,6
8279," 
although television for children has good ",6
8280," because itâ´s sometimes an excuse for parents to not spend time with their children because they have other things to do sure it is way easier to put the child in front of the television if it wants to hear a story than searching for a book to read because it sometimes takes lots of time to find the right story the kid is okay with but that isntâ´t good because reading a book together brings parents and children closer together
finally i can say that i am ",17
8281, against the television advertising directed toword young children although it has positive ,13
8282, like entertainment if there is nothing to do itâ´s just to often used as an excuse for parents to not give attention to their children children should go outside and explore they should learn and try new things ,8
8283, sitting infront of a screen and watching a few colorful cartoon figures jumping around and telling stories sure sometimes it helps the creativity of children and sometimes there are series which are good for children but the main part is just not ,6
8284, sometimes a little tv is okay but just not too much because ,17
8285," the children just miss the things they could do outside with their friends




























",24
8286,"television advertising plays a big role in our life every day we see these 
children in young ages often watch these television advertisings because there parents dont want to spend time with their kids for them the television is a cheap babysitter
",14
8287, these television advertisings shouldnt be allowed  aged  becauase they see them every day and know them better than some other and more important things my cousin ,13
8288, often watch television because his parents work at home all day and he stress them and they cant do their work hes able to sing more television advertisments than songs for children his favorite advertisment is washmachines lives longer with calgon or carglass fixs carglass changes ,1
8289, its not that good for their childhood ,4
8290, theyre know these slogans and are able to sing them children shouldnt watch television all day they should be outside and get dirty this is a reason why more children gets allergic to some things because they didnt had any contacts with it in their childhood in my opinion parents shouldnt be allowed to get kids ,2
8291," they dont have any time for them
but ",19
8292, its not a realistic thing to not allow television advertisings because you cant control if there is a child or an adult watching television the only thing you could change is the television advertising at the children canals like kika or super rtl i ,14
8293, know some kids who just watch televisin advertisings they dont like television shows,17
8294,television is getting more and more involved in the worldâ´s daily life and ,10
8295," are advertisments at the moment we are right now you barely can watch anything on tv without getting interrupted by them especially advertisments  have a big influece to them which isnâ´t the best thing for those children in the following there will be a discussion if they sould be forbidden

first the companies want to make the children buy there products the children sit in front of the tv and ",14
8296, they see an awesome advertisment spot about that one super cool toy and ,20
8297, they decide they really really want to have that they go ask their parents and try to get them to buy that toy ,20
8298," the parents go and buy that toy that is what the companies want to achieve and if there would only be one companie it woulndâ´t really be a problem now if there would only be one spot it could be tolerated but sadly this happens like 19 times in one break because of that the children want to have every toy and the parents end up being under a lot of stress
second the only thing the companies want is money they donâ´t care about giving the children a wrong ideal of beauty or telling them that they are only cool if they have that one special toy the children are just being used as the people who buy the companiesâ´ stuff and maybe not even seen as human beings who donâ´t know much about the world and itâ´s people ",20
8299, the children are just an unexperienced source of money and the companies use that to get the most profit they can with that ,2
8300," of view the companies manipulate the children into buying their stuff


",2
8301, it should definitely be forbidden to direct advertisments to children of young age the companies simply use the young age of the children to tell them theyâ´re product is the best and give them fals ideals ,16
8302," i see no harm in products which are aimed at smaller children being advertised 
for example a family which is already making plans on what to buy for their newborn or young child will atleast get a new idea or direction for what product would be best suited for their child ",16
8303, it be food clothes or toys especially young mothers may not be entirely informed and secure on whether or not they are making the right the decisions ,9
8304," it comes to saciating her childs needs
so on the note of advertising a product ",0
8305," it may not convince the viewer to buy the specific product in question i can atleast appreciate that the advertisement gave the viewer another reminder of thinking about the products they might be buying for their children
but ",0
8306, it would always be advised to get information from other mediasources ,10
8307, advertisements on television are often times just short pretty and very staged for the sake of mass appeal for a massive audience ,10
8308," specifically targeted towards parents the advertisements are played for everyone

the others sources i mentioned should be a doctor with knowledge on nutrition and health for small children and ",16
8309," see whether or not cosumers of the product which the parents are interested in are satisfied with or not
the internet is ",0
8310," you need advice from other parents who have already made mistakes or who know exactly how to answer your question and can give insightful advice on how to deal with the problem you might be having or the difficult decision you have to make

and that would already be all of which i have to comment on or have come up with",9
8311,in our time the advertisement ,11
8312, on tv is mostly s certain interest groups while watching a action movie with lots of explosions and stunts the advertisement which is placed in the breaks of the movie you will get ,10
8313, mostly advertisement for products that men need but ,11
8314, young children should not be pulled into this ,12
8315," and it should not be allowed to direct advertisement toward this group of people

yes this would be an injury of the economic freedom for companies which would than be less competitive in the world market also this could start a chain reaction and more and more criteria would be introduced into the tvadvertising sector also not all advertisements present a bad good there can certainly be an advert for a product that is useful for a child and can help it in everyday life

but to be honest there are hardly people that get excited ",13
8316, the movie or tvshow that they are watching gets interrupted by an advertisement break sometimes there is this funny or well made advert but ,10
8317," they are plain boring and tell you something that is only half the truth teens and adults easily realise the false advertisement and see the intentions of the companies but the young children they do not they can easily be influenced and one could even say that they get brainwashed into a consumption cultur because the idea of always having to have the best and newest product gets planted in their head from a young age 

to sum up ",2
8318, children should not be adressed in advertisement because they are too young to distinguish between lie and truth,16
8319,"an often discussed issue in our society is if the television advertising toward young children from the age of  years should be allowed or not 

one reason against this is that young children could get manipulated of this advertising and just do not understand what the producer is saying to them the children are just watching television and the there comes advertising from a fantastic toy in which often children are used because the producers just show them that every child wants that but do not say the toy will get broken just right ",13
8320," you let it fall for only one time so they are lying to the children too 
another ",7
8321, why it should not be allowed to make advertising directly toward young children is that ,13
8322," parents say this fantastic toy is not very fantastic at all it could give some discussions between parents and their children just because the advertising lied to them and they did not understand it this is never a good thing because families should be happy together and no one should want to destroy their happiness just to sell a plastic figure 
the last ",20
8323," against is that the producers uses young children to reach other young children which can be very bad for these children because they get selled for making advertising and have to work in a very young age just to make their parents rich and happy and the producers too
the only ",13
8324, why it should be allowed to make television advertising directly for young children is that this wont be sexual or aggressive sometimes they watch a movie for children and ,13
8325," that there is advertising for sex toys or hungry children in africa which is not the right one for children in the age of  years so this advertising for toysetc is exspecially made for children which has to mean that in this arent pictures or something else that children should not see

all in all ",16
8326, that advertising for young children is not a very good thing because i cant understand why someone is just lying to sweet children for getting money from their parents or uses children in the same age for this and make them ,16
8327, working for my money children should be just children and not manipulated by advertising ,16
8328, they should go outside and talk to their friends or playing games with them without using electronical toys or something like that ,1
8329, sitting inside and playing with plastic alone ,1
8330,watching television is a common thing to do to in your spare time nowadays through all the generations parents of young children often use it to enetratin their children to have a little time to themselves but televison contains a big part of advertisments between the different programs are these adâ´s really good ,14
8331," those that are created for young children is it good that they are legal

obviously young children are very responding to advertisments that are created for their age and therefor the selling concerns earn a certain amount of money just because children canâ´t stop asking their parents for the toy they desire to have 
adâ´s can ",16
8332," it comes to ideas about what to buy for the child as a present

but are advertisments really good for a childâ´s developement the children learn that they can get everything they want and they find role models in the actors of advertisments now it depends on the content of said ad wether the child is develloping in a positive or in a negativ way to clarify things it must be said that advertisments created for young children are often constructed very easy and are questionable from the sight of an adult or a teenager or anybody who left the stage of development where everything that the older kids do is fantastic and canâ´t be anything but absolutly cool 

in my opinion you shouldnâ´t forbid adâ´s for children completly because they are too important selling machines in the economics but what is definetly possible is to make laws around them ",0
8333, that somehwow the too extreme forms of advertising towards children with questionable content would be avoided,13
8334,it has often been discussed wether or not television advertising towards children aged  should be allowed or not personally ,13
8335," it should not for the following reasons

first of all a child of  years is not ",12
8336," able to understand marketing strategies and make informed decisions on wether to buy a product or not therefore advertising something towards them exploits their childish innosense for profit instead products should be advertised to their parents who are responsible for making informed decisions for their children and protect them until they are able to do it themselves

furthermore a child of that age would probably want to own anything they see on television and lots of annoyed parents would probably give in just to have peace however this kind of peace is only going to last until the child wants to own something else this kind of procedure teaches children a craving for material possession from a very young age ",2
8337, as a mentality of buying something just to throw it away some time soon these are values that have already lead to great problems in the world ,23
8338, huge piles of waste on land ,18
8339, as in the ocean i believe we should not instill the same values that have caused ,21
8340, much destruction to our planet already ,19
8341," generations again but instead teach them to make a change 

therefore ",8
8342, it is unethical to advertise something to children who do not know any better ,16
8343," and exploit them their parents and our planet for profit
",12
8344," analys the following statement  television advertising  young cildren  aged   should not be allowed

so i would start with an positiv ",13
8345," for  the statement that not all advertising in television are comfortable for the age of young children maybe they see something which scared them very much or something like this
an ",13
8346, against the statement is that childrens see all the beautiful toys in television an parents see what there child like and what the child wish there self  for birrthday or christmas and the parents can buy it ,20
8347," the toy is allowed for the age of the child
but ",20
8348, for the statement that this toys the children seen in the television and wish them self for birthday ,20
8349, it can get cery uncontrolled because the child dont see only one toy but ,20
8350," many toys and they want at the end every toy from the television which is not the key

at the end ",20
8351, say that television advertising  should not be allowed ,15
8352, half to the statement because ,21
8353, say that it is good ,18
8354, kids see what is goinig on with new toys and to be up to date in the age of four or five but under this age i thing that the chidren dont really know what this is and what is good ,20
8355, are toys not everything for these young childrenso it have positiv and neagtiv ,20
8356, but at the end i asked my self should it be allowed for children in the age from zero to three to watch televison  this is another question which is very criticaly to look at this,17
8357," explain why
first are there series and movies on television which shouldnt be allowed for young children because maybe in the serie someone died or kill a person this could be really dangerous for the psych of a child 
second are there movies or series with no background story or sense in this age ",6
8358, they should whatch something where they can learn ,8
8359," a language or names of things movies like barbie are just for making money and not healthy for the brain
on the other ",6
8360, is television something what you cant hold back from your child maybe the kid whatch movies with their friends or ,17
8361," whatching a movie is okay if they can learn something maybe a movie with an ethical question easy to understand for children its important that they dont  whatch movies which make them dumb or are reclame for toys or food
in conclusion ",6
8362, television is okay if they can learn something or they whatch something which dont make them dumb or are unhealthy for the brain and its important too that they dont whatch to much on a day maybe just 30 minutes or one hour that should be enough but in the age from one to three i would not allowed my children to whatch television they should grow up with the knowledge there are other interesting things not just something like television or a smart phone ,17
8363,"the question if television have not to be allowed  is diskussed from many people
a big problem is the lenguage from many tvshows for example teletabis have a very bad lenguage because the characters talk like little children they just start to talk so if many young children see this tvshow to often they donâ´t get a better lenguage 
on the other ",17
8364," there are many tvshows where the kids lern new tings for example dora in the german television she teach children in english on a way that everybody can understand this so young children heard this language in young years of their life and maby they learn faster if they get it in a school lesson
children have to learn many things about our nature they have to learn what can hurts ",8
8365, it is a big problem that many children and teenagers donâ´t go outside they sit in front of the computer or the television to often but inside they donâ´t can learn how to climb on a tree young children need a social life and itâ´s impossible to have a social if theyâ´re always inside the house or the flat and ,24
8366," not in front of the television
itâ´s a ",1
8367," that the internet will be more important in our future young children could learn how to use electronic things with help from the television they will be confrontet with technic very fast and every genartion get faster an cell phone or something else the television could help to teach young children in technic

on my mind every adult have to choise for him or her self i know it could get problems if it not be allowed and other young children watch every day television because itâ´s a crazy atwenture to see for the ",17
8368," times unknown people or unknown animals in the television 
i would allowed my young children to watch television because everybody do it today and ",17
8369, itâ´s more easier for my child to learn this thing ,8
8370," it is young but itâ´s have to be a rule how long the child watch television
",17
8371,television advertising directed  is a complicated theme some people say that the children are influenced in a wronge way and the advertising isnt good for them other opinions are that the children dont watch television anyway because it make them stupid others say that isnt bad for them because they dont understand what they watch on the tv so what is better for them  ,14
8372, it isnt good that young children watch tv because they are in a age where you have to play with other kids or play in the nature added to that adults and older children ,17
8373, get influence by the television advertisment but ,10
8374, a children watch tv the advertisment isnt the bad thing they get influence so ,14
8375, you try to make the tv more helpful for the children you must change something by the series or film the watch the series and films are most of the time some stupid stories without a moral or senes in it you ,6
8376," have the advertisment everywhere in citys so cant you go outside anymore because your children can maybe get influence
i wouldnt say ",16
8377," it is the job of the parents that the children see not the advertisment they should see the important things 
in the end ",16
8378," that television advertising isnt the best one for our children but you cant change something and you must help your children that they see the other things in the world
",14
8379,"
do you know the saturday evenings ",18
8380, you watch a film for the whole family and suddenly there is an advertisement directed to your younger brothers or sisters and ,6
8381, theyll cry all the time mum i want this dad can you buy me this and ,9
8382, you are in the city with them they recognize the things from the adverisements and cry again should television advertising  not be allowed anymore ,10
8383, against a prohibition of tv advertisement  an ,15
8384," for a prohibition

we live in a liberal country everyone has the right to tell what he thinks switzerland is ",21
8385," economically really liberal because of this many enterprises want to sell their products here when we regulate everything its not good for economy
when you wouldnt allow advertisement for young children any more because they could be influenced you shouldnt allow television advertising for old people because they could be influenced ",23
8386, on you would have to prohibit nearly every form of advertisement ,15
8387," you do this

but there are many ",18
8388, for a prohibition of this form of advertisement you could influence little children really easiliy because they cant think really critically at this age you just have to tell them in this advertisements enough times that your product is really cool and ,16
8389, they want to buy it ,3
8390," its like indoctrination and you shouldnt indoctrinate this little children 
its a wellcalculated advertising business they direct their advertisement toward a certain age of children in the statistics they can find out for which age a tvshow is produced an ",14
8391," produce their advertisement for exactly the same age of children 
and ",16
8392," much money from hardworking parents is spent for things that the children dont really like things they only want to buy because of the adverisement and which is propably not good for them 

finally i think you have to prohibit this form of advertisement because its a really strong and wellcalculated indoctrination of young children which dont have the possibility to think critically and dont know how this money is earned which the want to spend on things they only want because of the advertisement",13
8393,"should television advertising  be allowed

is it ok to show advertising in televison which is directed  do these young children know what advertising is and are they able to judge if the object in the advertising is somthing good or if it is a product they can not use 

in every televison advertising the things the company wants to sell looks ",14
8394," cool and useful lego airplanes seem to fly and action heroes figures are able to walk the advertising does not show the the products how they are in real life

young children cant say if the need these things or not the advertising shows how cool these things are and the young people are automaticly attracted to these things and want to buy them when i was young i wasnt able to make the difference between usefull stuff and unusefull shit ",0
8395, its not fair because the young people think of everything in tv  oh look at this cool airplane ,17
8396," have on of these please can i have one 

but ",18
8397, some usefull advertising for young children if the advertising shows websites and online learning platforms which are only designed for young children ,16
8398," its absolutly ok to make advertising directed  its a good thing for young children to play easy games on websites like kika or superrtl these websites are specially designed for children the children cant do any faults or dangerous things on these sites
and the children can learn pretty much from the games or the learning tasks the children can learn to use the internet on a save way

",16
8399, toy advertising directed  is not a good thing but advertising for websites and learning platforms which are save ist   ,16
8400,"should advertising in the television be allowed for young children or not
advertising for young children should be allowed because itâ´s the excercise of the parents how often and how long a  year old children should watch tv if this advertisments are especialy for the children like advertisments about new dolls ore playmobil tractors there is no ",14
8401," why the children shouldnâ´t see this of course the kids want to have these stuff later but even this is the decision of the parents if the children will get this or not but there are even things that are not very good for young children but often the advertisment on the children chanals are not bad for them 
if you let the kids alone with the tv and they can change the chanal that is not good because maybe they get some advertisment from the new horror movie or stuff like this itâ´s a pitty that you canâ´t watch tv without advertisment but ",14
8402, the children watch series on super rtl or kika and ,6
8403," on there is not much advertisment and only between the different series 
in my opinion television advertising  is okay because as the parent you have to decide ",14
8404, the children can look a film or there favourite series when especialy the very young children donâ´t look too much tv and advertisment itâ´s okay but ,6
8405, they even play in the garden or with theire brothers or sisters ,1
8406,"
television advertising is a big topic nowadays you cant watch tv without loads of spots about products you schould buy even kids get involved in this kind of manipulation so there is the question if this should be allowed and what ",14
8407," could be the result of it
young people always are more manipulative than adults often they dont realize what is fake and what is real and that is the thing the advertising companies use for their sucsessthey show the kids a fake world with everything they dream about so the kids get manipulated and they wanrt to have all the bveautiful things they see in the televison especially very young children are in volved in this problem they cant judge the situation and dont see the real reasons and the conmpanies behind the great and fantastic advertisingworld
you could say that this is a problem of the parents because they have to look ",14
8408, the young children and should decide what they see and what they dont see but  how can you protect your kid from all this advertisment its nearlly everywhere and sometimes ,16
8409," very hidden
in my opinion it shouldnt be allowed to make advertisment in tv for young kids
in todays society it is all about having things and wear clothes with the right brands
kids learn this behaviour nearly sinse theyve been born and this shouzld be stopped kids have to grow up with the kown of the right values and advertising in tv desstroys that   
 
",13
8410,"this text is about the line  television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

first its important to ask if the children in these ages really understand the advertisment they see the product and  maybe want to have it if they like it probably the children will claim to their parents weeks and weeks that they want to have the thing shown in the advertisment but maybe they dont 
advertising is more a thing for the parents ",13
8411, they have to decide if they want to buy the product or not so if they are able to spend the money the product costs or not  so the question isnt really if children in these ages should watch these advertisments its more important if its necessary that the children watch it ,16
8412," they dont really notice
what speeks for the advertising is that the children get motivated to concentrate on one thing ",0
8413, maybe the concentration of them gets better another ,19
8414," is that they see the new things  children in their ages can play with 
a negative ",24
8415," is as i said that the children maybe claim at their parents that they want to have the product even if the parents dont have the money to buy it so they will maybe argue with their children 
",2
8416, that advertisment is like everywhere in the streets shops newspapers or just the child in the kindergarten which has the product so it doesnt really matter if there is advertising in the tv or not,11
8417,"today there are many television programs which are directed  but shouldnt we asked ourselves if these programs influence the life of the young children and shouldnt be allowed
on the one handside there are programs which can be good for young children because they wanted them to think and to learn about new things for example in my childhood i often watched a television program where other children made experiments and i learnd about new things which i told to my family and my friends ",17
8418, these programs are important for young children because they can ,8
8419, do these things at home and show it to their friends and families and they are proud about theirselves ,9
8420," made these experiments
but on the other handside there are ",18
8421, television programs which arent important for young children the children cant learn from them and the programs only shows bullshit and ,17
8422, want to do these things because they think it is cool and they can be proud about theirselves ,3
8423, they can make these things too but ,23
8424," the parents get angry and they have to tell their children that these things which they have watched in televison arent good and that they arent allowed to do them
all in one ",6
8425, that television programs where the young children can learn from are very important because they have to think about new things but the television programs which only shows stupid things shouldnt be allowed because the children want to do these things too because they think they are cool and thats not good,17
8426," that television advertising could influence children very much and often not in a good way

especially in the age of  children learn from their environement and believe in everything what they see and hear you can tell them something about magic or animals which can speak and they believe you because they dont know it better they dont have other experiences or can check something in the internet or in books they just trust you and the television industry knows how to use this so television advertising isnt good for children because you cant controll what your child is looking at another thing is that parents are under pressure if their child can see to much of television advertising today every family will be the best and happiest ",14
8427," the children should have everything if the child see a new doll or a new car they want it and the parents will buy it

but ",9
8428," it could be very difficult and complicate to do television without television advertising just for children often the channels are financed by some companies or factorys which pay the channel for showing their products as an effect some of the channels couldnt maybe exist 

in the end its a question of the moral what is more important the future of the children or the surviving of the channels i know this question isnt really fair but ",14
8429, television advertising and thats the reason why ,10
8430,"doues television advertising  should not be allowed

what is the right way to educate children
some people have a clear opinion on this topic they told that children should go out and see the nature they should do sport and that they need a lot of fresh air other families do not have time to get out with the children because they have to work a lot so the kids stay at home and ",14
8431, they told that they do not like to get out because it is boring there or the weather is not good the parents let them watch tv because ,1
8432, they are silent all the time and they sometimes learn ,24
8433, something it is clear that it is easy for the parents to let them watch tv because like that they do not have to look ,17
8434, that there will be more and more children who will look at tv because everything is getting digital this was ,6
8435," find out by the advertismentbusines so they try to get the money and if they find a new group of costumers it is better for them but is it dangerous for the children
maybe they can see the new things to buy and they always want something new and do not need the stuff they had ",2
8436," so they could get really nobel and selfish 
on the other ",19
8437," they maybe learn early that the advertisment is something to look at critcal because there are different strathegies to manipulate the people so if the kids learn it early they wont tap into a hole later

my personal opinion is that children should not watch tv a lot ",14
8438, they do not get in touch with all this advertisment when they are outside they can see the nature and the real life ,3
8439, that it is not possible to make a permission on it because they will always find a space in the law so if parents do not like that the kids can see this advertisments they should not let them watch tv,13
8440,"nowadays many children spend hours in front of electronic devices and the worst part of it they get animated by advertising and pictures back in time the kids were playing football outside and today you can find them playing football in the living room their eyes fixed on a screen 

fist we should ",17
8441, out the medical part spend to much time in front of the television can lead to overweight and socail isolation that has an effect to the physical and psychical life children in their young ages shouldnt have any contact with electronic devices that are showing us pictures and impressions because eyes that are that young arent able to capture all of them and the brain has not been ready ,17
8442," to identify this rapidly chanching moments

however if children below the age of five get in contact with advertising ",0
8443," produced for them they make the parent to buy this stuff that appeared in the television the problematic is that familiys who have not that much money and  buy this things to make their children happy often get in struggle with dealing way more important things like paying bills for school and medicine 

on the other ",2
8444, we always get in connact with advertising ,11
8445," we are going to the supermarket or just for a walk on the strees children see pictures that are producet to animate adults to buy something and if their seeing advertising anyway why should they see advertisig  them 

in my opinion it sould not be allowd to produce advertising ",16
8446, for children under the age of five because they are not able to identify that impressions and it is nearly impossible for them to handle with all this pictures this advertisings in the television leads to a social isolation of the child and exactly in that young ages it is important to have connections to other children and familys and if they can not grow up with that knowlege how to threat and talk to other people it can have fatal influences for their entire life,14
8447,yes advertising towards young people should be forbidden in this age kids believe everything someone older than them says they should not be told that everything that looks good in advertisings is good in real life our life is all about consuming even the youngest people are drilled to get the best toy this is ok ,16
8448, it is something out of a good quality like pokemon cards but if you advertise this 200 gramm plastic thingything and everyone is buying it you are a serious problem in this society we can not live towards consumption this was one ,23
8449, is far more primitive nor mother nor father want to have the stress caused of a little kid wanting really bad this new toy out of the tvadvert whoever lets this stress happen to parents on this earth had eather no siblings or was rich ,20
8450, ever have kids my kids will watch kika where there is no advertising going on i dont want to have kids who are always wanting something new if it is out of good quality ,6
8451, sure but these toys will never be advertised in this kind of television to wrap it up advertising directed towars young people is not that what i want for our world ,20
8452,"advertising is all about the content these days and it is false to ban all of them because most of it is harmless 

first of all children shouldnt be allowed to look to much tv anyway they should do some activities ",14
8453," meet friends or go play outside
parents have to pay attention and take care of their children they could watch tv together and if some strange advert comes up the parents should be there
to explain whats going on in this advert so its a question of how the parents raise the children the adverts doesnt have to be taken out and the other important thing is here what content it is in the adverts it could affect the children a little bit perhaps to buy some games or something but that isnt a reason to ban an advert because theyre an important part of the oeconomics that wouldnt be very rentable to ban it when its toward young children it wont be very dangerous they wont ruin their future or harm them in an other way i ",14
8454," to ban advert  because it wouldnt hurt them the most important reason why i am disagreeing with this is because that would be just to make  small problem not even a problem into something big that would just be unecessary action to do because it doesnt affect them much we have to concentrate on real problem for me it just to overprotective

on th",15
8455,a lot of people think that young children age  should not be in contact with television in the following text i want to show why i ,17
8456," that young children should play with other real children and not with people in the television they should be in a direct contact with children in their age to grow old together they need to learn things together they should not just watch how things are going but learning it by themselves or together with other kids in their age 
in my opinion they ",8
8457," need to learn that you can have fun without electronics for example they need to learn that even with just a few stones you can play a cool game
i ",24
8458, think that it is really important later that you have  best friends ,18
8459," they were young children these relationships are often really strong and important in ones life and last their whole life if these strong relationships dont exist people could have problems to find friends later in their lifes because they never needed to
but i ",8
8460, think that these children are going to be in contact with these social medias anyways ,12
8461, it doesnt really matter at which ,18
8462," in their life it will happen in our modern world which is full with electronics its nearly impossible to not be in contact with things like the television 
in the end i ",17
8463, think that it is okay to let young children watch television if it is not too much they should not watch television the whole day but ,17
8464, it is not that bad if they are watching television one hour per week,17
8465,theres only one reason for a company to produce an advertisement for their new toy it works it may be annoying for everybody else but theres a whole line of work occupied with selling their products including toys and its inhumane to rid them of their occupation frankly why is it such a bad idea for toddlers to watch adverts anyway the only thing prohibiting it would accomplish is a whole bunch of young children watching adverts directed at older kids and adults as they stumble in the room ,16
8466," someone elses watching tv and whos to say this wouldnt be a worse influence

to start with there are many and more people working with the concept of selling as many toys  as possible and their livelyhood depends on this if you close one market you have to open another or risk to flood the job market with more people it can possibly support in protecting toddlers from influence which may or may not be bad you would certainly destroy much more 
this leads me to my ",2
8467, bad of course its stressfull for parents ,4
8468," their child starts crying and whining about wanting this new plane but isnt this a parental problem you have to teach a kid constraint and other things it cant just get anything it wants a problem which only concerns young parents shouldnt be the reason to shut down a whole market
since adverts are everywhere you look it whould be very difficoult for young children to never see them and if theyre going to see a lot of them anyway why not have some of them directed to them it would certainly distract them from advertisements which may not be all that child friendly

you cant shelter a child from everything if you bring it up sheltered and protected each ",2
8469, of the day it will one day stub his toe horribly on reality in this sense it would be nonsensical to prohibite something other lifes depend on if someone has a problem with advertisement directed at young children they should ,13
8470, concern themselves with the values their kid learns and whats really important in life,9
8471,when i am alone at home with my little sister aged four she always wants to watch televison normally i like that too but there is ,6
8472," much advertising which makes her sometimes fear so i often ask myself should it not be allowed that television advertising is  

an ",15
8473, of watching advertising televison is that these children can learn something from the advertising but it is not ,14
8474, good for them if they watch tv the whole day they should spend more time with their friends and play together an other positiv thing is that the parents can have some free time ,1
8475," the child is watching a movie but in these chase it is not useful if the child watchs television advertising a lot of people say that young people get stupid because of the television 
an other ",6
8476," is that young people dont learn to spend any time together and have fun without a television they should play a game in the garden or do something else an other negativ thing is that the children see things they dont know anything about it and thats not good for their evelopment

",17
8477, its really important that young children dont watch too much television when i was young we didnt have a television and i played a lot with my friends and neighbours the parents should look by themselves whats good for their children and what not ,17
8478," it would be too complecated to itroduce these 
 ",19
8479,my answer to the question if ,21
8480," with the statement televison advertising  should not be allowed is a no 
although i see that it depends on the object of advertising ",15
8481, that general advertisement should be  children because children are children they are young and some things they cant and they wont ever understand for example would they immediately be sad or disappointed if their parents told them they couldnt afford that automatic play car that are always shown in between their favourite cartoon disney show children cant think rationally enough ,16
8482," to see beyond their own desires 
in my opinion it is wrong to manipulate children into wanting things they may not even be able to afford just for making good money i see that there is theoretically speaking nothing wrong with directing advertisement toward children because in the adult world it happens all the time because that is how economics work but in reality children arent in that state of thinking ",2
8483, their only thought in their head will be oh i want that cool robot figure and not oh i wonder if mum could afford that ,20
8484, wait patiently for christmas season and ask if i may get it children that want something but cant get it are a true piece of work its hard ,20
8485, to picture a happy all flowers and rainbows family if the child every week asks for a new cool toy because it is apperently the thing to get ,20
8486, youre a five year old many children often cry for something they want let it be chocolate let it be a toy but i believe that  if advertised directly to the children themselves  it would be much worse espacially if those things are sold as unique and of brand which not would make them more expensive but the kids would ,20
8487, grow up to only want brandy things anymore,18
8488,"in my opinion advertising  shouldnâ´t be allowed 
those children are in a too young age to built up their own opinion and watching advertising could influence their brain and their way of thinking a lot advertising with the wrong content and images could ",14
8489, influence their later opinion and behaviour ,7
8490, theyâ´re grownn up beacause they listened to those advertising ,2
8491, they were younger promoting more and more wrong ideals and norms advertising has ,10
8492," have a lot impact on the youth
in regard to this advertising for young children may not contain wrong ideals and norms because the content for young children would be more simple and just full of things that are funny and enjoyable 
further more you could say that all those advertisings are always proved ",16
8493, that they should be save for young children to watch but ,12
8494, there could always be some hidden images that the children ,24
8495," get to know
the question is just can we trust the people who design those advertisings can we trust society as itâ´s known society puts ",11
8496, many wrong ideals and norms in the world ,21
8497, that everybody thinks he has to follow those ideals and norms so many grown up people are influenced by those images promoted in advertisings that we should think about how much influence advertising than can have ,11
8498, on young children they are growing up developing an opinion and get ,7
8499," much influenced by those promoted images 
as result advertising for young children shouldnâ´t be allowed they could get guided wrong and grow up with wrong images society has given them especially in this young age they should develop their own opinion with things they experience by their own  
",16
8500,television advertising may have some good and bad effects depending on your ,10
8501," of view it can beneficiate the viewers and the company advertising their product or it can cause some damage to the viewers 
whenever young children are being directly spoken to through advertising they immediately believe every thing that is being said without giving it a ",14
8502, are always very well advertised sometimes it can even be a little bit exaggerated a very good example can be barbies advertisiment on tv the kids probably see a very nice adverstisement with a good story of this one barbie having a pool party with other friends in this very cool pool for a not ,0
8503, run to their parents to tell them about the nice barbies and the pool that has just been advertised for a good price the parents ,24
8504," believe their kids and once they get to the place to buy their daughter or maybe even their son these toys they get disappointed because the advertisement was for the pool without the barbies and the kids misunderstood this
another downside is the ",20
8505, that kids may feel a pression to have that exact same product they saw on tv or on a magazine whenever they see some of their friends getting it they insist their parents to get it for them sometimes the parents cant afford it television advertising can ,2
8506, be somehow upsetting for the kids because of the ,12
8507," that you see it again and again and again
it has a very good ",18
8508," that way kids know what they want for their birthday or christmas which makes it easier for the parents to buy something because they already have an idea the company advertising the product makes profit and the children and parents are happy 
if the kids learn the dontbelieveeverythingyouseeontv lesson it can make them more observative they wont just pay more attention to what its actually being said and advertised on tv ",2
8509," in other different situations so television advertising can sometimes be educative
to conclude i dont know if i should ",15
8510, with the statement because of ,21
8511, the up and downsides but i dont really think that parents or young children actually have something against it i know i dont and i dont know anyone who does ,4
8512, children can get influenced negatively from the advertisement ,16
8513, from advertisements which shows the ideal of women or men advertisements which are constructed with a hidden message ,11
8514, can be dangerous for the child for example it is a hidden sexistic message and the child would not even notice that because at its age it does not no what sexism is but ,4
8515, the child grows up it could be possible that it can get a tendence to support sexism of course this is a extreme version of influence it ,7
8516," can be bad words in the advertisements the child hears them and automatically save them
that could influence their future life

on the other ",16
8517," televion advertisements are just a very small part in the childrens daily life more important are the surrounding people like the parents it is more important that they let the child grow up without wrong opinions or a specific creed furthermore it is the choice of the parents if their child watchs television because at the end it is their choice what they want to allow and what to forbid and they choose how to raise their child up and it is not the choice of any other person 
also it would be difficult to forbid the television advertising towards young children because you can not monitor what parents let their children watch and if there would not be any advertisments between the tv shows the tv channels have to fill a lot of more plot

my opinion on this statement is that there are several advertisements on televion which young children should not see because it could have influence on their furture life and opinion and these advertisements should not allowed but it is the choice of the parents what they let their child watch ",14
8518,"television advertising 

in racent years the amount of advertising young shildren greaw enormously
the reason for this is the big influances of television advetising
some people think it will be good to stop televison advertising towards young children
if there is a lot of advertising for young children they will watch a lot of television
the brain of young children isnt that smart ",14
8519,"if there is an advertisingthe children wants to have everything for their home themselvesthis will lead to a big problem for their parents
not only this is the problem of advertising towards young children on televioson televison it selve is a big problem for young childrenthe eyes of young children can be damaged because of several things
the big companies are not interessted on thhis informations they only see the money owned by the children parents
if there is a company who directed advertising two years old they will realise that the advertising is more annoying than usefulbecause the children are to young to understand something

from my opinion i completely ",14
8520, with this statementi do think telesion advertising towards young people should not be allowed too its just very unusfull for bouth ,13
8521," the companies and the young childrenlast but not least 
everybody should do what they want to do 
",12
8522,children nowadays are able to watch television as much as they want ,17
8523, they will eventually see many commercials s older people ,10
8524, talk about the use of such tactics and their manipulative substance afterwards ,21
8525, be talking about the ethical ,21
8526, showing children advertises s them can be really profitable for companies which ,0
8527, sell clothes or toys children at that age will not be able to withstand their desire to have it meaning that their parents will have to buy it unless they want their children to cry all day long it is a really smart move for companies to do ,9
8528, children lose interest in things quite fast they will not stick around with the idea of having the things shown in the advertises for a long period of time ,2
8529," companies need to make really smart and appealing advertises for the children to really want it 

secondly advertises are made to manipulate people into buying things or believing things that they would not do ",2
8530, that it is pretty hard to manipulate adults it is ,7
8531, young ones under the age of ten are very vulnerable against manipulation that is the reason companies can make a huge profit out of this ,2
8532, that it is very ethical to do advertising  ,11
8533, no one can stop it because from a legal ,19
8534, of view it is totally fine as i said ,18
8535, young children are extremly vulnerable against manipulation and taking ,7
8536," does not seem right to me it may be helpful for companies to do some advertises for young children but it is not really fair not for their parents nor for the children themselves

to conclude ",16
8537, that television advertising  should not be allowed i believe that there are way more ethical ways for a company to make advertises than directing them towards young children which can not see that they are being tricked,13
8538,in modern times media is an important pillar of our society and available nearly everywhere and to everyone thus companies realised the opportunities using modern media for their advertising and product placement in every kind of technology many companies and firms ,10
8539," rely on the big amount of young children or potentional consuments for their advertising who are easy to manipulate and easily convinced by a remarkable advertising 
this leads to the question if television advertising which is available to nearly every child in the western world and in every age should be allowed legally

there are several ",14
8540, that support the idea of banning television advertising for young children ,13
8541," keep them protected from being manipulated
companies know that small children whose parents are stressed and more or less careless in modern times have a big influence on their parents and their shopping so ",2
8542," mama or papa leave the house they often let their child sitting in front of the tv letting it watch his favourite show
by using this kind of knowledge companies try every kind of advertising beneath the seriesprogrammes or in the shows themselves ",6
8543, convince the children that this product is neccessary for their ,2
8544, tell their parents their new favourite product and wonâ´t stop begging for it until itâ´s in their hands kids are used as an indirect way to force their parents to buy companies products and are ,2
8545," intentionally manipulated compared to modern regulation and law standards these methods could be called a child abuse as kids mental unstabilities are abused willingly in hope to gain the most profitable advertising methos 
with this ",16
8546, in mind everyone would be interested in stopping this kind of manipulative and abusing advertising ,11
8547," if it could reach their own child

but t
",19
8548,television advertising has become quite normal to us ,10
8549, we watch it on every chanel but is it the good for our children children are easy to influence ,17
8550," in a young age and the adds are trying to use this influence for their own good selling their things

with advertisings children find out what all there is to get and it might be a help for the parent knowing what the own childs wish is for christmas eastern or the childs birthday on the other ",2
8551," at that age the parents probably know better what is good for their children and most of the things shown on tv arent 

a two year old most likely cant really judge if a game or any other advertised thing is clever to buy ",20
8552, the child will get hisher parents to buy it and maybe ,20
8553, it will be laying in the corner of the room ot even the trash can that would be thrown out money but maybe the child would ,9
8554," learn to see what is behind the great looking add a good thing or something for the trash

",18
8555, with the statement that advertisment of this kind shouldnt be allowed because it is not for the good of the child but just for the money filled pockets of the industry also ,13
8556, that parents are the ones who know best what is for their children ,7
8557, at the childrens age of and not some stranger doing the advertising   ,16
8558,nowdays television advertising is very popular and common the main question about it is if it should be not allowed toward young children this statement will be discusse ,14
8559,"

firstly television advertising is dangerous for little children the are getting a wrong image ",14
8560," the see a toy which looks very awesome and high quality but in real it is like plastic

moreover childrens want more toy and have more whises for birthday when they see something very cool in television the want that and they ask their parents allnthe time to get it ",20
8561, the parents get annoyed and they might want to see the child happy ,24
8562," the buy them the stoff

a positive ",3
8563," is that the economies increase with television advertising they make a lot of money because the children see what it is to have thistoy and it shows them the fun and plessure and they want the parents to buy these things

secondly they do not waste ",10
8564, much paper the economies do not use any paper to make television advertising ,10
8565," it is better for the environment they do not waste as much as they would do with flyers

in conclusion i ",23
8566, with the following statement because of the ,21
8567," that advertising increases our economie

",11
8568,if a small child watches televison often it gets to know advertisement some of it is directed to them advertisement ,14
8569," for young children is often discussed controversy what are the main pros and cons

children need and want other things than adults so it is legitime to advertise for products for kids as ",2
8570," plays moreover children might feel an unfairness if theres no advertisement  their age however they cant cope with such thing as advertisement on contrary to adults children cant select between good and bad influences and they arent as critish as older people may be so if they see a product in an advertisement they believe that its great as the advertisement want them to think the people who produce these spots know this exactely and abuse the children in this sense

in general children shouldnt be watching television too often because they only become dumb with what they see advertisement adds a quite big impact to this

to sum up ",14
8571, that advertisement  only has a bad influence on them advertisement is never good but for young children it is even worse ,16
8572,there are many children who often watch tv shows in the evening or ,17
8573, younger children who even watch during the day their parents might be working and do not have time for them or they just want to enjoy their liberate time ,1
8574, a workday but is television really a supportive way to entertain the children especially nowadays ,17
8575, many advertising traps it is worth to discuss this habit of the children because it might has negative influences but now what are ,0
8576," about television advertisings and why shouldshouldnt they be allowed
first of all advertising is a huge business and if i wasnt allowed there were many people who didnt have any jobs additionally it is always a fiancial support for the tv channel and they can use this money to produce important shows and last but not least are the tv adds ",15
8577," very inspirational for young children for playing and they get great ideas there
but there are ",8
8578, the need to buy these things which are in tv ,10
8579, they are not needed in their househols secondly it can increase the aggression of these kids ,12
8580," they see plastic weapons and similar stuff so they start to think that war is something they should apchiate
and as a last negative ",3
8581," we could mention that all these things just support the production of plastic garbage and thats bad for our climate
in conclusion i can say that the negative ",23
8582, are more important than the negatives but evidentially i can ,21
8583, understand the reasons why the industry is supporting these adds ,23
8584, it would be very difficult to ban them from the televison business,15
8585,television advertising is very manipulative thats a ,10
8586, with there pretty people and sneaky music as ,19
8587, text they get into your head and almost force you to buy their product and the problem is its everywhere in television on posters at the street so it is impossiple to avoid them the only way to not get manipulated is to question it look through it but not everybody is able to escape it and ,11
8588," they get blinded by all the pretty and pricy things

as said its hard to look behinde the manipulative trick of the advertising company and its even harder for children than young kids have an inocennt sould and mind they are not able to question the things they see children believe what adults say because they dont know it better in that case its very easy for the television advertising to manipulated little children and to get into their heads 
imagine a little girl is watching her favorite tv show adoring the animated figure her hereo but as the show is over an advertising of a doll showes up of course the adverstising claims that this doll is the best and prettiest and that every girl in the wolrd needs it so the little girl jumps onto her feet runs to her mommey and asks her deperatly to buy her this doll but ",2
8589, the mother refuses to buy the toy the child gets mad and sad television advertising has ,20
8590," much effect on the feeling on young children and the bank account of the parents

to look at it from the otherside in some ",4
8591, advertising can be even more dangerousfor adults because different from children grownups have a credit card  luckly children dont have the ability to buy all the pretty things they see on television ,14
8592," they would get into lot of debts
and sometimes the young childrens mind doesnt understand what the people in the tv wants to say ",17
8593," their nsimple and naiv minde would safed them form the manipulative advertising

summing up ",11
8594, that televisio advertising  you children shoulnt be allowed its okay to watch here and ,13
8595, a funny show for children on tv maybe they than even leran from it but ,6
8596," kids shoul be spending more time on playing on the playgroud with their friend than sitting on the couch watching manipulative advertising
because ",0
8597, even adults get tricked by the advertising companyhow can children be safe from it,16
8598,"my broter is ten years old like his friends he likes to watch television and does is quite every afternoon of course as  we are living in the same appartment i hear and see what he is watching i have notices that much of the tv program are advertising and often i hear him saying mom come and look how cool is that can i get this
you just have to see one time the advertising they are showing kids and you could not deny thaht telvision advertising arev it is more than obvious concerns know ",14
8599, and what to show on wich channel as children are watching channels specifically for kids concerns are using this ,6
8600," or even better the young childtem to sell their products

should it be forbidden to direct television advertising toward young children aged  
advertising serves to convince people to buy the product ",13
8601, what is not right by showing adverts even to younger people ,16
8602," we should forbid it because the concerns just want to sell their toys they arent evil 
if a mother or father has a problem with his  child watching those advertising he sould not let him watch it or explain him seriously whats the ",13
8603, all our lifes we will have to face advertising not ,11
8604," a kid 
i understand the problem with kids who are showed advertising they are easier to persuade and afterwards the parents have to be the bad people who are not buying him the toys but as i already said if parents are having troubles with advertising the shouldnt allow their kids to watch television
if we go ",0
8605," we have to say that the whole tv program has a strong influence on us and our brains parents who have problems with the influence of advertising should face the real problem namely the whole entertainment program for kids and teenager it is normal that we belive mostly what we watch 

i thnk showing advertising yound children is the smallest problem the parents just dont like it because they have to discuss with there children and be the bad ones who dont buy the toys

",14
8606,argumets why television advertising  should be allowed is on one ,15
8607, that the parents have an overview of the stuff they could buy for their children if the children see the advertisments and like the toy the parents know what the ,0
8608," birthday present could be 
on the other ",18
8609, its good for the company that sells the toys or clothes for young children because the mentality of adults is to make kids happy by giving them what they want the television advertising is the best most efficient one if you are an adult with small children because ,0
8610, you are at home and you have things to do you turn on the television ,1
8611," the kids arent bored the companies can profit from this and dont hurt no one

television advertising  shouldnt be allowed because they influence the childhood children should make their own experiences by playing and being outside with those advertisments they just want to have what the kids in the television have because they seem happy with it
technology shouldnt be part of a childs daily life by showing this advertisments more kids start to watch tv
kids are influenced by those things and annoy their parents because they want the what other kids have therefore parents have to deal with kids being influenced by technology that isnt made for them

my opinion is that it shouldnt be allowed because it changes the childhood and the childrens lifestyle children should live the nature and not the technology like nowadays ",14
8612,"my name is raven van wood part i
once upon a time not too long ago there was a girl i was that girl let me tell you the story how i met my best friend

8613, day i was supposed to leave town to go to college i was very excited and i couldnt hide it to go to college ,18

after my friends left i packed all my stuff my parents helped me doing that i saw it in their eyes that they were sad burt whenever i told them not to be sad they replied that they werent sad but very excided ",18

8618, the sun had risen she came into my room with a plate full of pancakes and a big jar of nutella i wondered it they would have any nutella at the college after breakfast it was already 8 am and it was time ,18
8619," to leave i hugged my mom and my dad goodbye and stepped outside my mom wanted to wait with me for the bus but i told her not to embarass me infront of my new classmates
i waited and waited and waited and ",18
8620, a long time the bus ,18
8621, arrived maybe it was only five miutes that i waited but it felt like an hour i got into the bus and it was huge and there was only one seat left ,18
8622, to a little boy i sat right ,18
8623, to him and asked what his name was he wasnt very talkative but he vas very nice his name was bruce after seven hours of busdriving we ,18
8624," arrived to our destination whitmorecollege it was a huge place there were about 12 buildings one bigger than the other one i just stood there and stared at the place i never saw a school that big i always went to a little school in my hometown it had just about 200 stuents but here there probably were about 2000 students if not more 
a very nice girl called emily showed me to my room i didnt have any roommate but i was kind of happy about it my mother always told me stories about her annoying rommate and how she would have loved it to have a room by herself 
the ",18
8625, class i had to attend was the following morning ,18
8626, i had the whole evening to look around and unpack my stuff it took me about an hour to unpack everything ,18
8627, had an hour left until i was supposed to go to dinner i asked emily if she could give me a plan of the school ground and show me a bit around she showed me the main building it was a very old and elegant building it reminded me a lot of the church in my hometown ,18
8628,just about everyone has once seen parents with a young child in a supermarket and noticed the inevitable ,9
8629," of this while the parents are putting all their groceries on the conveyor belt the child is bored and uses that time to beg the parents for the strategically placed sweets and if it tries enough chances are the parents or the parent will just give up and buy it because of this there are people trying to ban tv advertising s younger children in an effort to reduce that begging and make parentslives just a little bit easier but does this make sense or will the advertisements effects be shortlived and negligible
firstly some people think that this just cant work because advertisements s chilren aged  is too hard to define what guidelines would advertisements have to follow would this be abused by companies to ban their competitors ads and how could is be measured and quantified towards what ages a product or ad is directed 
and ",14
8630, there is the problem that a ban on certain ads would give companies competitors in different countries a significant ,15
8631," by improving their performance relative to the companies that have to follow the regulations this would ultimately be bad for the whole economy of the country
and last but not least the effects of the ads would be shortlived as the attention of the child shifts toards other things ",16
8632, the children dont watch tv immediately ,1
8633," leaving to a supermarket the effect will be negligible
but if you look closely at the antibanning ",4
8634, a significant selfcontradiction is noticeable the ,21
8635, talking about companies without ads being at a serious ,11
8636, seem to suggest that these ads are important for sales and ,11
8637, their effect is big but inthe last ,21
8638, it is claimed that the effects will be small and not noticeable this suggests that the ,4
8639, could not be true and that the effectis ,21
8640," small that no one would notice the difference they make
and ",19
8641, if the effects are actually that big why dont we make parenting ,4
8642," with younger children a bit easier and reduce the amount of begging for sweets or whatever catches the childs fancy 
in conclusion because young parents already have a hard enough job ",9
8643, society should really help the people who form our future a bit and ban tv ads for children it is even in everyones own interests to have less children begging for something loudly and annoyingly by keeping companies from making ads that add to that sort of behavior,13
8644, this statement has a good ,21
8645, in my opinion kids shouldnt even be watching television at that age but if they have to do ,17
8646," anyways at least there shouldnt be any advertising made and screened for them
lets start with what kind of commercials there are for kids right now i have two of theme quite present the ",14
8647, one is for kinder chocolate the ,18
8648," its a good thing to give your kid chocolate from time to time chocolate makes happy tastes good and contains more iron than spinach does but in the commercials you see on tv they often make it seem as if the only thing that will make the child happy is chocolate and not even normal chocolat oh no that would be to boring the chocolate the kids see on screen contains toys has fancy names like kinder pingui children will make the link to penguin and they are showed as the one and only thing you should recive as a snack during the break
theres this add right now where the kid walkes amelessly around the house the mom comes and gives it a chocolate bar it teaches out children that eating healthy isnt normal and that if you are hungry you should just eat chocolate dont know what to do eat chocolate and in those products there are often some ingrediants that arent really healthy in addition it creates an unhealthy relationship between children and food if you have to direct foodcommercials to minors at least do it with healthy things like fruits
now id like to change the topic to toys approximately 90 of the commercials we have on kids tv are about toys a child that watches tv reguallarly will every two weeks see the new furreal friend a new lego set or the new unicorns and what do i know but a child from about 3 years wont be able to make a difference between i need this and i want this itll just see the happy faces of the kids on screen and thinksi want that too it makes our kids unsattisfied with what they have only seeing that new cool stuff the kid on tv got and wants it too

for children its really hard ",2
8649, to make a differenc between the things that are real and the once that arent even as adults we sometimes struggle with it so how should a kid decide what is important and what isnt in the world that we created,8
8650,"in the following essay im gonna write about advertising  

wellthe ",11
8651," controverse topic i want to write about is television for kids aged 25 
in my opinion kids shouldnt even sit in front of a television untill they are approximately 8 years old especially in this age they have to learn a lot of other important stuff of their parents or siblings so they can learn what really matters in life
unfortunately many parents put their kids in front of a television ",17
8652, they are doing other stuff what is more parents kids in this age should have time for them games like memory or puzzles are important for the brain and the development of them its ,24
8653," very useful for primary school
so i think kids prefer an afternoon on a playing field than in front of a tv

another thing is that ad in television is mostly not made for kids in this age they recognize it but they cant really understand it 



so  ",0
8654, dont let kids aged 25 watching tv,17
8655, with this statement i absolutly see no reason why advertising for young people shouldnt be allowed but i see the discussting ,16
8656, because in this age of evolution you can manipulate children ,7
8657, of this is the developpers of the television advertising go directly to the feelings and emotions of the children the target is they want to manipulate them that the children go to the parents and they say like i want this teddybear i want it please buy me one but ,0
8658, the advertising shouldnt be cancered because it is the case of the parents what they buy or not the parents ,16
8659," should control the using of the television for the child because advisement isnt the most dangerous thing in the tv 

but ",17
8660, i stay by my opinion i ,21
8661, with the statement the best ,21
8662, is the parents should control it and you never can say this advise is for children and this not where is the frontier between them i ,12
8663," dont know where and the managers of the tv channels have got the same problem 

so as a overview i can see some ",10
8664, for the statement but i dont see the better ones mabye i can show a exemple of my life when i was younger i always wanted an action man i wanted spiderman batman and my favorite one superman in the tv there exist a advise for action man and i loved this adversing show but my parents never gave one to me,18
8665,being parents can be very stressful they need to do the household and ,9
8666," they need to care for their children now a days thanks to the new technology its possible to put the children in front of the television and get their work done as the children are watching cartoons there are always advertisements now the government ask themselves if television advertising  should be allowed or not

the purpose of watching television is to teach the children all the morals in life and to teach them the important vocabulary to speak the language another purpose is to entertain the children advertising  would be the total opposite children want the stuff they see and wont live in peace they start to rely on materialistic stuffs they want to buy everything that had been showed and think that only having these stuffs can make them happy like the kids in the advertisement always act


",17
8667,social media grows these days everyone has a cell phone a computer or a television many young kids come home from school and watch television the whole afternoon there are funny cartoons for children ,6
8668, a lot of bad things not ment for children eyes and from time to time there comes a advertise for a unnecessary product the kids see this product ,2
8669, a toy they see how cool it is and what you can do with it and ,20
8670, they want to have it so they go to the parents and beg until the parents allow them to buy it then the kid plays with it maybe for some days and ,20
8671," theyll forget the new toy 
",20
8672, that the parents shouldnt allow to watch television more than twice a week the kids can do ,13
8673, many other things i used to go outside play with friends or do homework ,1
8674, i was young we never had a television and i am happy about that the young kids shouldnt see the horrible movies on television im not against television advertising  ,17
8675, the parents have to resist and say no ,9
8676, the kid wants to buy the products which was presented in the advertise in my opinion kids shouldnt spend the time in front of the television ,0
8677, it can be allowed to make advertising toward young children there is advertising everywhere ,16
8678,first of all it could be a problem if the children dont watch television in todays society its sure quite impossible but some parents do ,17
8679," have a quite conservative mind and dont want their children to watch television 
secondly children can be manipulated very easily so if they see an advert which is ",14
8680," an exaggeration of the actual product the children will scream and shout until they get this probably very expensive product
on the other ",2
8681," its a quite good idea for kids to see all the new products they could learn with like this the producers dont have to wait until a miracle happens and the kids or their parents will see the toy in the shop 
also it could be a good way to teach the kids that they can never have everything they want sure for this the parents have to be quite strict but if they are like this im sure the child will grow up an adult which has a lot of selfesteem
last but not least todays children have ",20
8682, many difficulties to accept a no so many parents would do and buy everything for their kids and like this the child wants the parents to buy everything they see in the television even if they will play just one time with this toy because ,20
8683," they already want another one
in conclusion i can say that ",19
8684, television advertising s young childrenfor me the best ,14
8685, against these kind of adverts is that the children can be manipulated this easily grown up know this ,16
8686," they do this kind of advertising and because of that it shouldnt be allowed
",11
8687,"one reason for not allowing advertising directed to small children is that children shouldnt be influenced by advertising already in such a young age when they grow up they will understand what advertising is about but a twoyears old cant even understand the meaning of a televison advertising and they dont realize that in advertising are made promisses that arent true at that age they cant decide what they need or what they dont need
one more reason against allowing advertising for young children is that a child doesnt understand how much a toy from an advertising costs but ",13
8688, they will want to have it so the parents are under a big pressure and they almost have to buy the toys from the advertising that means that advertising for young children doesnt only disturb children ,20
8689," their parents
one reason for allowing advertising for small children is that the adults ",16
8690," why shouldnt children the adults and the children should be treatened the same way
the ",12
8691," reason for allowing advertising for young children is that if there was no advertising for the children they would have to watch the advertising for adults but children maybe dont understand what the advertising is about and they could be shocked by the content so it is better to let the children watch advertising directed to children than to let them watch advertising for adults
my opinion on this topic is that advertising directed to children shouldnt be allowed because ",16
8692," children shouldnt get influenced by advertising the industry shouldnt say the children which toys are cool or popular the children should have the right to dont be influenced by the main stream 
",13
8693,in order to be able to answer this question we have to differentiate two different kinds of advertising for young childrenthere are ads that are advertising products for young children but the target group are the parentsfor example pampers are for young children but the targent group of papers are the parents and not the childrenand ,16
8694, there are ads whose targent group are the children ,16
8695, that says that ads for children are totally ok is that ,16
8696, there is an ad whose target group is the young children its ,16
8697, the parents buying the product ,9
8698," because children  years old normally dont have money
an ",9
8699, that says ads for childeren shouldnt be allowed is that the ads give pressure to the parents because their child is talking about this cool new hotwheels car the whole day until the parents buy itso ,13
8700, parents being under pressure to buy certain products for their children ,2
8701," satify the needs of their child
another ",9
8702, that says ads are ok is that children are confronted with ads all the time on the way to school on the way to the soccer training in the internet and ,16
8703," it wont make any difference because children are confronted with ads anyways
one ",16
8704, that says ads for children arent ok is that ads have a huge influence on peolpe ,13
8705, in the early stages of life that means that if the ad is about sextoys for children in kindergarden this is ,16
8706," not a good influence for the children

in my opinion ads for childfren are totally ok because children are confronted with ads anyway in everyday life ",16
8707," they are used to it and because of that its not a problem at all
",19
8708,we all know the way commercial tv makes revenue  the name already says it namely through commercials shown during commercial breaks that might even last severaly minutes the advertisement is often optimized for the target audience of the tv station if the viewership are adults we get ads for adult products like cars ,10
8709, programmes that are specifically made for the young audience eg cartoon network their viewers are often little children and ,6
8710, only advertisement optimized for this target group would make sense one may ask ,11
8711," if this is good or not or if it even should be forbidden
its obvious that the broadcasting corporation must make money in one way or another if they dont generate revenue they wont survive for long the only way that a tv station can really make money is by commercials or product placement if one would forbid them to do ",15
8712," they will have to shut down in the forseeable future
a downside of ads targeted at such young people is that the children might ",16
8713, easily influenced after seeing an ad for the newest toy they are likely to want said toy from their parents not only can this result in high costs for the parents ,2
8714, in tears from the children ,9
8715," they dont get what they want
creating a desire in somebody through tv isnt only restricted to children the same happes with adults all the time if you would forbid commercial indoctrination by tv for children shouldnt you do the same for adults what difference does it make ",17
8716," of the day 
the way many commercals work is that they try to convince people why their product is extraordinary often they want to make us believe that without their product one cant be happy anymore and that without it your life will be less good this is very likely to give the young vieweship a wrong image about the world for example one can only have a nice skiing holiday ",11
8717, going to a resort with the latest and greatest activities for children kids often dont understand the concept of money and wont understand ,9
8718," the parents tell them that something like that is really expensive and not really doable theyll get sad if their wishes wont be fullfilled 
in some way you cant just blame the television networks for all this its ",9
8719," the parents who should take responsebility and avoid that their children are being exposed to ads that the parents dont want them to see to some extend the ones being in charge of them should make sure that what is being seen by them isnt harmful in any way or another
i ",13
8720, the parents and the television networks should take responsebility for what is being broadcastet during commercial breaks in my opinion most commercials that clearly appear as a commercial are fine the only thing i can see being problematic are product placements the kids wont notice that its a paid ad and ,14
8721, might be influenced more easily if i had a say in what is transmitted i would make sure that the products advertised are ,4
8722, childfriendly and reasonable i wouldnt want products to be shown that would come at a high cost for the parents or ones that arent suitable for childreno of any age,0
8723, that children aged two shouldnt even be allowed to watch television ,12
8724, much that they could be influenced by the advertisment but ,11
8725, its the parents task to be aware of the danger which comes from ads in television so they should decide whether their child is allowed to watch television ,14
8726, it is impossible to ban ads from tv because the chanels earn ,15
8727, much money from them of course there is the danger that young children can be easely influenced from tv advertisement and could have a wrong opinion of something but in the world there are many other things that could have a bad influence on a child so now my opinion ist that the parents have to deal the same with tv advertisements than with other threats for their child they must prevent their child from being influenced they can tell their child whats wrong or just invented in the advertisements or they can watch less tv ,14
8728, for not baning tv ads is that there are a number of kidschanels where there are less or none advertisement on the other ,13
8729, one can say that every kid is different ,24
8730," every kid may be influenced more easely or less easely maybe there should be a minimum age for watching tv at all

in general ",17
8731," its important that the parents look carefully what their children are watching and that they teach them how to handel the advertisement
  ",16
8732," comment on the statement that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

to begin with you have to understand that advertising is always a way of manipulating someone to buy watch or do something this is very dangerous ",15
8733, for young children because it is changing their opinion and ,12
8734, their behaviour towards special things it is ,3
8735, dangerous because they have not learnt at that age to reflect advertising and basically everything you are seeing in a critical way at the same time you have to admit that some adults who are not highly educated ,24
8736, have not learnt to reflect on everything they see therefore advertising for these adults should ,3
8737," be prohibited but as soon as you start reflecting you are going to recognise that nearly every product is not as good as it was shown in the advertising terefore advertising would not work anymore 
if parents allow their children to sit in front of the tv these children are ",13
8738, by the television program for example my family has not had a tv until i was fifteen and a half years old i grew up without watching tv and ,6
8739, that this did any harm to me everything that is shown on tv is having an impact on the children watching so they are ,17
8740, by the normal tv shows or series they are watching in my opinion it the danger of advertising directed  depends on the ,14
8741, if they are watching tv alone or if they are watching together with their parents if their parents are at their ,1
8742, think that advertising should be prohibited their parents could explain everything to them and could make them understand the advertising to my mind it is much more dangerous if these children watch tv on their own personally ,14
8743," that this should not be allowed children between  should not watch tv a lot and they should definitely not sit alone in front of the tv

finally you can say that television advertising is obviously negative and should not be allowed but ",13
8744, it is much more important that young children should not be allowed to watch tv alone,17
8745,"should it be allowed that television advertisings are exactly made for young children
",13
8746, for and against it for example you could say that it should be permittet because the children are too young two  five years old to decide if the products in the advertisings are necessary for them or just nice but not important they ,13
8747, don not know which of these products are good for them if they like them the kids want to have them and they do not care if they are maybe bad for their helph like computer games which make the kids sit a long time in the front of their computer ,24
8748, going outside or like candies which make them eating too much sugar the television advertisings ,4
8749, uses that little children can be exited about things very fast so ,8
8750, they watch six advertisings every day they will maybe like the half of them and want to have all those products adults sometimes think longer about what they could buy but children just want to have things ,2
8751," they schould not watch advertisings which are  kids
but there are ",16
8752, children just should not watch tv ,17
8753, many advertisings and the parents have ,9
8754," the right to permitt buying the products becauce they decide what they buy and what not
",23
8755,television advertising has got a lot of influence on our society it gives us needs or wishes we should have and ,10
8756," more than three quarter of the population owns a television we cannot deny the big range of influence one single advertising can have on us 

especially young children can be easily manipulated ",14
8757," telvision advertising  should not be allowed

to start with television advertising gives the children very straight ideals about how they have to be advertising dictates gender roles it shows exactly what a girl needs and what she doesnt and ",15
8758," the other way around for boys
and children under the age of five are more manipulative than anything at the age they are looking for idols people to follow and they should find those idols in real live not in faked television scenes

secondly to make advertising for young children is a very mean thing to do since its not the children themselves who will spend the money on the product but their parents or some other adult advertising makes children wish for things they didnt even know they existed it creates needs that arent there its just a trick to sell things more easily beacause children can quite annoying and persistent if tehy want something and ",2
8759," parents give in

to finish id say that television has a bigger influence on our lives gender roles and needs than it should have and by not allowing television advertising  we could minimalize this influence quite a little bit 

but ",14
8760, about us or more the parents of the children to regulate what they want them to see or dont ,12
8761, they are the one who give them the permission to even watch television,1
8762, with the statement watching tv in young age probably gets to a habit for the later life watching a lot of television is not helpful for the education of young people ,17
8763, because the media has a too big influence on the people ,19
8764, for very young people in age of  by watching tv very often the media presented by television is a very influencing form of giving information which is not always ,17
8765," intended to educate young people  more there are a lot of commercials which manipulate the children and use their naivity for capital a young human being in age of  should learn to understand their environment by their own and not by consuming what is told and shown on the television everything one consumes consumes oneself

even ",14
8766, watching television in young age can be a risk for the people espeiaclly the young we all have to learn how to use a tv because it clearly is an important ,17
8767, in our society by not allowing young people to watch television they will never know how to watch it with conscience they might begin to watch tv ,17
8768," the parents can not forbit it anymore and the use of mass media with conscience can not be served

in my opinion young children in age of  should be allowed to watch tv but for 15 to 20 minutes maximum because ",17
8769, they know it is a part of the society ,3
8770, something parallel of the reality  ,18
8771, it does not give the young the picture of the reality and they can discover their environment and the world on their own with playing outside making friends going to kindergarten etc so ,24
8772, with the idea of television and ,6
8773, other forms of media like smartphones tablets youtube etc is not ideal for the growing of young people in age of  but not forbiting it because it is ,17
8774," discuss if television advertising  should be allowed or not
in general ",15
8775, it is a very normal thing that firm and concernes make adverts to inform people about new products they need it to have a successfull firma but the negative ,11
8776, of these adverts is the ,11
8777," that they often do not tell the truth about a firma or his products they just should convince the people to buy this product or to support this concernes
",23
8778, older people like adults or children from 15 years and up can reflect the liing and the truth on these adverts ,16
8779," that they do not buy things without thinking on their own if the price is fitting and the products are as good and usefull as they are presented in the adverts
against this young children  years can not think about these positive and negative ",2
8780," that it is a very easy thing to have some influence on them especially the television is a medium wich young children like very much they spent a lot of time in front of it and think that everything on this screen must be the truth an a very good thing
furthermore the ",17
8781, few years in the life of a human are the ones in which they learn the most things and in which it decides who they are going to be and what they like and what not that is the reason why firms ,8
8782,"the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is a very controversy but actual theme
i definitely think it should not be allowed to show little children advertisements firstly because they see it often enough in public or here it on the radio secondly because advertisement on television is ",13
8783," much more deep and figurative because of the possibility of filming picture mmaterial special affects connected with sound lightning colouring and camera movings 
these huge ammount of information and pictures in such a short time is too much for little childrens brains and could lead to headache or other physical and even psychical problems 
another thing is how you could seperate advertisement for grown ups and for children nobody knows which television programms children watch and nobody knows during wich time of the day so it would be dramatic if a little child sees advertising for or against war beer or cigarrets like i said earlier children going to see these things soon enough ",6
8784, they should not be confronted with this in an even more accurate way on television ,19
8785,"
advertising often leads to depressions or selfharming anxiety or eating disorders for many boys and girls aged ten to more or less open endaccording to several studies people start to compare themself or their life with others actually they compare with advertisement whichdefinitely does not show real life and is always faked in many ",0
8786, but advertising seems to be real ,11
8787," people dont see how unusual and unnatural it is 
this is a never ending circle because people will always find new things to compare with new trends are going to show up advertising will change and companies produce new ones fitting to the newest trends
bacuse of that it is important to safe children from these wrong pictures and impressions about how life is which they get from advertising it is more important to show and teach them the real things that matter in life or even little ",2
8788, what a strawberry is and how it real and natural taste is the children of today are getting ,18
8789, fast old and behave or have to behave like teenagers or grown ups that it is very important to let them be little children ,24
8790,"television advertising is not a new phenomen in our modern technical world no matter where we are and go there will be an advertise following us it might be in a town on a big promotion board in the window of shops or it simply appears on our smartphones but what happens with the new generation that already grows up with such things
young children  are highly affectable they copy the behavior of people around them all the time if it is the way we talk how we treat people or simply our gestures they will adapt to it this means that advertising  might end really bad depending on what advertise it is imagine young girls not even six ",14
8791, already get told what they should wear and how they should look to count as pretty it sets up a picture of how life should be ,3
8792," letting children try it out themselves by going out and discover new things in nature or with friends
on the other ",8
8793," advertising towards children might not be too bad you could use it to show them how important a good school degree is or that sport is good for your health 
however advertising affects without us actually realizing it can we let that happen to our children can we just let them slowly be brainwashed by our economy no we cant 
in my opinion advertising is far too present in our modern lifestyles it affects us ",16
8794, strongly and not a lot seem to know or care about it ,21
8795," our children should be protected against television advertising

",13
8796,in my opinion the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is right there are many different arguements supporting ,15
8797," some against my opinion 
one could say it is nice for the children to have adverts made for them but considering that advertising is very influencial it does not seem to be a positive ",0
8798, for it is known that young children can be influenced very easily for they do not have developed an own opinion ,7
8799, young children would get bored if there was not advertising fitting their age on the other ,16
8800, parents will think they can leave their child in front of the tv even better because it will be busy watching tv and would not annoy during the advertising break ,14
8801, it seems wrong to me to make parents let their child watch televison without feeling bad about it because children that young should not weatch tv which other people think ,17
8802," that is why there are only few children watching tv and because of that it is not nessicary to make special adverts directed to them
furthermore it does not really make sense because children can not buy anything on their own and advertising  children will not make their parents want to buy the product 

to make my ",14
8803, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed first because mostly older people watch tv ,15
8804, there is no need to make adverts for young children and ,16
8805, because it would only make parents think it is okay to let their baby watch tv ,17
8806, there is even advertising for them ,18
8807, influences every human beeing in a different way so should advertising toward young children be allowed first of all there are many ,16
8808, in my opinion children are very manipulative and easy to impress per example if children see toys in the television they run to their parents ,7
8809," get the toy
another reason why it should be forbidden is because they have ",20
8810," of their childhoods which makes it difficult to learn how to deal with money in addition young people have to build their own opinion and should not be influenced by huge enterprises

but ",9
8811, with the statement in our world full of globalization it is nearly impossible to prevent even young kids from advertising per example if you walk through a city you will find in every corner an advertisment moreover it is important to teach everyone how to deal with such a great amount of offers and sometimes ,16
8812, lies behind the advertisment but i have to say there are not just bad ,11
8813, about advertising they can be inspiring and bring up benefits for the little ones some toys teach children more about language or maths per example ,20
8814," they are funny to use 

in conclusion ",21
8815, with the statement because in our society every human beeing gets confronted with advertising anyways,11
8816, with the following statement the ,21
8817, that children are way too easy to manipulate makes television advertising dangerous todays kids cant build their own opinion about a product or service for many parents this can become a serious problem their child has seen an advertising and they have to teach them that they cant have anything they want and that they need to learn what things are really important in life otherwise they have to spend a lot of money for every kind of toys kids are quite easy to fascinate and a commercial television advertising can let their eyes glow ,14
8818," advertising should only be s people who can afford these articles on their own little children are the wrong group
in another way parents of todays century should know the danger of the internet and television sitting in front of a tvscreen shouldnt be the most regarded acitivity of the day its important that kids spend their time outside playing and creating their own little thoughts its easy to say that television advertising on channels like kika or superrtl should be forbidden but every single mother or father can deicide on their own how their child should see life and how they grow up television advertising is a good money source and ",13
8819," everyone wants to keep this luctrative business going children have always been used to raise money they are easily impressed they believe nearly everything and and they cant differntiate that good but it isnt the fault of all the marketing agents its only in the hands of the parents

",2
8820, say that i have never felt bad about advertising it always fascinated me and it was enough to ,11
8821,"directed television advertising we all know it and it is often making the target group think that the advertised object is the best and they shuld buy it but should children aged  really getting influenced by that
television advertising which is pointing at young children is trying to inflict an young childrens mind to the ",14
8822," at which they believe without questioning what they see trying to inflict a children which may not be able to difference between advertisements and the truth is questionable but who should decide wheater this is an advertisement directed to children at the age  or to children aged between six and eight a law to illegallice television advertisements to children aged  could lead to missunderstandings of advertisings and conflicts between the law and advetisers
but isnt the real question wheater children aged  should watch television anyway
anyways ",14
8823, that directed television advertising at young children should be highly restricted ,13
8824, it is in the freedom of a television advertiser to make advertisements directed to children,13
8825,television advertising  is for some parents a problem the kids become angry and sad if they dont get what they want this get on the nerves of the most parents its a shame that even the young children in our world are used to get the big money they say mostly exact these parents arent just a little bit better ,14
8826, these people who made the advertisments why do they let the kids watch television alone if it really is a big problem for them  they should be sitting ,14
8827, to their kid and watch with them some other people say it has some ,1
8828," the children learn that they cant have everything they see something that is important in their future life the people that never learned this are often the people who couldnt handle even with their own money if they see something in the advertisment or any where else that they like  for them it has to be bought
that means that there are two ",2
8829, the children could have a problem with the parents because it thinks that they never get what they want when the parents never speak to them and tell them what the problem is it coud end in a bad relationship between them but ,9
8830," they learn something that is really important in our life today they dont always get everything
in my opinion this problem isnt that bad the most of the parents think their child just learns bad things if theyre alone they arent able to learn the right things sometimes thats right but even ",8
8831, its not that grave the parents forget that children can forget some things really fast on the ,24
8832, day theyve already forgotten the problems of yesterday but the adults who are responsible for these children should learn from this if they cant handle to not always give what they see and want they shouldnt let the kid watch television all the time,24
8833,"television advertising  is commonly used in todays culture some people are against it and some say it is very important

at the ",15
8834," i have to say that in most of the advertisements for kids there are plots with morals in it for example to share your cereals with others or to work together 
moreover they teach them how to differenciate a real product from the product in the television surely disapointment will be involved and its exhausting for the parents to calm their children but it can really help to give them a prospective for the real life
not to forget is the ",0
8835," that the producers of the tvadvertising and of the products themselves earn a lot of money because children believe everything they see 

on the other ",2
8836," be seen as a bad thing children are being manipulated and dont know what a product can be like in reality 
also they are often being taught that if you buy and own a specific product like a shoe ",2
8837," you will be cool and can get along with everthing and everyone
furthermore the parents can have a really hard time convincing the young children not to buy something ",9
8838," they have seen it on television and think it would be cool to have it every minute theres another advertisement with a toy or a product they want to have and that can undoubtedly be very stressing for a mother or a father

although there are more ",20
8839, speaking for television advertisements for young children the ,16
8840, that they manipulate those little kids just to make big money overweighs ,2
8841,advertisement twoards children of a young age can be considered a good marketing strategy children tend to be more naive and can ,0
8842," be easily convinced by almost any type of media that is presented to them if the marketing sektor can make use of these easy cusomers they are garanteed a higher sales revenue although children seldomly have their wn money to spend they can quite easily persuade parents and relatives into buying specific things for them this strategy is more affective than advertising products for the children to the older generations because there will always be a doubt about the product itself and if the children would really be happy with the specific new item 
on the other ",0
8843, i can be considered practically inhumane to use a childs mind to sell a poduct to their parents since the todlers dont have the necessary knowledge to judge things fairly they are eaily tricked into wanting things that migt not be in their interest or are simply useless at hte same time stress can be created in the houshold because of capricious behavior from the children that are led to believe they need a specific new thing the resultscan be tantrums and very unconfortable situations for all people involved it is an unfair marketing strategy and takes ,2
8844," of the childish mind 
i believe that rules should be made against advertisement targeted at children under a specific age",16
8845,"children in the age of  are nowadays often exposed to advertisment from different sources one of them being the television
the following short essay will state some pros and cons about this topic

even if the statement disapproves advertisment towards young children ",14
8846,"
in this century one is constistandly surounded by adds ",21
8847, its important to get used to it as soon as possible if young children learn that they shouldnt listen to the exaggoration which adds often include they will be more resistant towards adds and the influence of media as a whole ,14
8848, they grow up they learn that nothing is as it seems in television and begin to criticaly think over the whole situation and ,6
8849, decide if they eg want to buy the new bike which is displayed in the new add or ,3
8850," stick with an older more trustworthy exemplar

the negativ ",18
8851, is that if the young children dont learn that adds arent always saying 100 the truth they are exposed to all those hidden traps and influences if they see their favourite cartoon character smoking in an add they want to try it ,2
8852, and if an add shows them which role a boy should take in life and which roles girl should take through the toys those children will be pushed towards a stereotypical lifestyle without ever being able to lean themselves what they want to be and want they want to do ,7
8853,"when i was a child i often watched tv there was often advertising for children of my age and i loved to watch the advertising for me it was very intresting to see the new toys and games but is it good for the developement of a child to see alll the time new toys and things 

the advertising is extra made for children ",14
8854, the actors use expressions whichchildren use in this age ,24
8855, that they everything understand the pctures are made for the kids eyes and ,12
8856," every every episode there is at least one advertising video

first ",11
8857, it is cool for the kids to see new toys and games in the television but ,17
8858, i was a young child i always wanted new toys and i never stopped asking my parent to get them in my opinion it can be very embarassing for the parents if the child never stops asking for a new toy so at least the parents buy them the toy and  the child is happy but some days later the child sees something new in the television and asks his parents one more time to buy this thing the parents dont want to tell the children off for asking ,20
8859," they buy the new thing so it is a never ending thing

advertising is for the seller a very good possibilty to show the kids the new toys beacause the kids have to watch the advertising more or less without advertising it is very difficult to present the new games and toys


in my opinion it is normal that there is some advertising for adults and for children maybe it woud be possible to show less advertising because sometimes it is getting on my nervs ",0
8860, there are 30 minutes of a tv show and ,6
8861," 10 minutes of advertising but without advertising watching tv would not be the same
",10
8862,"adverts are something everyone knows most of the time it is annoying and unpleasant television advertising is common mostly the film stops at the best moment just to show the faked picture of a woman with wonderful long eyelashes or other nonsense is ist necessary to bother our little kids with this

it is a ",14
8863, that advertising is a good way to sell products on television there are ,10
8864, many people who watch all these adverts ,11
8865, it is likely somebody is affected by them and buys the product it may be annoying sometimes but ,23
8866," adverts we are able to watch many things for free the advertisers are the sponsors and with their money the tv programm is financed the same goes for the programs for children 
children the young age of  often do not even understand the adverts and most of the parents do not buy random stuff for their kids just because it showed up on television one time 
but it is a ",14
8867, that people are affected by adverts ,11
8868," they do not realize it children are even easier affected they react to colours and shiny things very easily so it is possible that the children take some of the stuff they see in adverts and remeber it like that this can be dangerous depending on what the advert is about
also it might be a problem that children want to have everything that is advertised so they bother their parents to buy them stuff they do not even need and they do not understand what ist is exactly ",2
8869," they just stick with it 

in my opinion we should carefully teach our childrens and let them explore new things on television and sometimes just let them have fun we should not bother them with adverts and only show them unecessary stuff just to get money it is important that we let our children grow up without too much influence from the outside they should explore life for themselves

it is actual topic if television advertising  should be allowed or not
nowerdays the television is a more and more important thing to younger people andso ",15
8871," theadvertising 
there are a lot of advertisings directed  because if a product ist interessting for young people the chance is very high that they would buy it if you fix the youth he will grew up as a consuming society this are the best sights for a good working economychildren at the age of  do not know that you have to work for the money and ",0
8872," they say without thinking that they want you to buy the produt because they liked the advertising
on the other ",11
8873," you have to see that children at the age of  should not sit in front of the television the should play outside with friends or if the weather is bad they should draw or something like that because if they just watch television and see the advertising they may will never see the reality they start to want things because they see them in the advertising they may loose the connection to the now and the reality and at this age you are not able to decide what you realy want or need
in conclusion i have to say that ",17
8874, it is up to the parents they should look for their children and should find a balance it is their responsibility and you ,9
8875," have to see that he company of the advertised product just does his work so if you as a parent think that advertising directed to younger children at the age  should not be allowed you have to change your own habit you have to save your children from the advertising because it ist not up to the others it is your child and you have to be responsible for it

8876,between todays tv shows lots of all kind of advertising spots play and this ,10
8877, on channels that are for toddlers and children that are ,6
8878," made for this age group should that be allowed or not 
firtsly what would a channel do if he hadnt any commercials to play less people would buy stuff and less money would be earned he couldnt pay all the tv shows that are on and we would soon not have  a lot of tv entertainment for our children left in addition to that the advertisments lead to a littke break ",14
8879, a tv show where the kids can play get themselves some food or maybe in more rare cases decide to stop watching tv they would sit the whole day in front of the screen because mickey mouse plays non stop and why would you even want to do something different ,6
8880," commercials annoy them and maybe get them to turn off the tv 
on the other ",10
8881, that come with tv spots for example the kids get confronted with ,6
8882, many advertisements that want them to buy their stuff that our generation will slip into a state of a non stop consume they will always want more and more this new barbie that new play station that cant be healthy in the long term they ,2
8883, take the childhood from them lots of todays kids dont play with they teddy bears anymore or go out to build a sandcastle instead a lot of new media comes to the market which includes ,24
8884, all kinds of gaming systems kids will be more and more consumed by these machines and that doesnt bring a lot of benefits for them they would ,24
8885, play outside at the fresh air ,1
8886," staring on their ipads the whole day through
in conclusion theres probably not much to do about these commercials they need to be played ",10
8887, the channels will be broke soon but its ,10
8888, not that helpful for our children to grow up ,12
8889," they advertise lots of digital things to play with 
in my opinion the ones that advertise such things should be banned from the kids television they can play commercials for puppets or the newest monster truck racing lane but not advertisements that destroy a beautiful childhood",14
8890,"since television was invented people are attrracted by it and pay attention to it brands and advertising companies use that to sell their things through television people are confronted with adverts all the time especially young children from age  are drawn into the consumer world very fast so should television advertising directed  be allowed

brands use young children to sell their products children from age  are a good targetas their are innocent and its easy to sell them something as long as the advertisement is held in bright colours with some pop music the children will pay attention to it children will see a new toy in television once and they will think about it all the time in the ",14

8892," sold to the parents grandparents aunts etc who are willing buy it in the best case someone will buy the desired toy and the advertisement fulfilled its purpose   

however children get drawn in to the consumer world very quickly even if it works for brands and advertising companies its morally not correct to use naive children just to earn money children get materialistic way too early 

in my opinion television advertising  should not be allowed ",0
8893, it is efficient for brands children shouldnt be confronted with materialistic thing and consumation in that young age  they should have other values ,2
8894,"advertisment television our society lives in a world of never ending stimulation caught in an addiction to distraction from their miserable every day life craving for forgetting the perpetual absence of the meaning of life and in such days we dare to ask whether television advertising targeting children should not be allowed

ironic and hypocritical how those people taking umbrage at those ads are the ones spending most of their time sitting in front of the tv trying to escape the clutches of meritocracy the spark of joy in their eyes ",14
8895, not they themselves are being excoriated but ,19
8896, the opposite great can happen once you accept the nothingness of your existance and turn your back to bigger things than the struggle of finding the meaning,21
8897,the question if television advertising  young childer should not be allowed is a often discussed thing advertising for young kids becomes more and more popular because the quantity of kids watching tv was never ,14
8898, is that kids are more interested in other things than gaming and cellphones ,24
8899, they watch advertising for kids they want to buy smartphones ,3
8900, toys if they watch advertising for adults ,20
8901, kids are there to explore the world and test everyhing out by themselves advertising for kids can ,0
8902," be a good thing if they sell books or intelligence games 

on the other ",23
8903, seen as money and profit the advertising lobby may take ,15
8904, of the kids and earn more money when kids want something they have seen on tv they ask their parents for money and as we all know kids are not silent until they have what they want this could be problem if some kids get everything they want from their parents out of the tv advertising and ,14
8905," loose their feeling for money this could cause a buying addiction in young years already 

in conclusion ",9
8906, and that we can not give up advertising for young kids,13
8907,"television advertising is a big part of a programm of a channel and the companies earn millions of dollars by showing advertisement to their customers but do not forget young children can watch that easily too so should it be allowed for children aged  to show advertisement to them

firstly such young people do not understand the whole system behind their television and how companies earn money by advertising their products the children watch the movie or small video clip and think that is a fantastic thing and they do not realize that this advertisement has nothing to do with reality companies advertise directly to children to sell their products in a big amount the parents have ",14
8908," the problem that their children wanted to have these things therefor the parents have to explain them that they do not get these things and maybe as you know this is a hard piece to do 

secondly advertisement is not good for the brains of young childrenthe young people have a false imagination of the world furthermore they have in their mind that all these products are amusing and a lot of fun but they are not only because the enterprises advertise their games or other devices ",2
8909," good and with a big strategy behind it does not mean that they are useful and funny to play with

on the other ",19
8910, every mother or father has to decide for himself if they want to let their children watch tv the girls and boys should better play outside with other friends or play a game with their siblings and do not spend the whole time in front of the screen social activities are one of ,17
8911," things in a life of a child and the best to grow up with

another ",8
8912, is that such a new rule is a lot of work so people have to spend hours to control the companies and ,23
8913," money is needed so is it useful to produce such a high amount of work only that children who spend their free time on the sofa are not attracted by television advertising

all things considered parents should take the part and decide for themselves if they want to let their children watch advertisement so everybody can decide for himself so ",14
8914," that it is useless to introduce such a new order it is hard to control and a lot of work of cause advertisement is not good for the children but for them it is overall better to spend the time outside and have a lot of fun with their friends 
",2
8915,today most of people have a television at home and ,10
8916, theire children too some of them waist a lot of time befor the television and ohters are using it very selten tv sends news with that we can learn things and know what happens in the world but it ,17
8917," produce a lot of stupid things but is tv somthing that is not good for children should we television advertising  aged  not allowe

at ",14
8918, television shows us what is happening in the world and it sends ,10
8919, documantations from witch we can profit for adults is this a nice thing because they can coming home late in the evening beeing powerless and ,9
8920, they can sit down and watching tv and see the newest informations but for children at age   is this not very important because they have probably no idea what this is about although it ,24
8921," could make children interessted at politics 

otherwise it ",12
8922, has programms in the tv witch is for childrens par example dora or 5 friends these programms help children to learn deducating in a small grade they help them to learn words and they make fun for the children but ,6
8923," children are sitting the howl day in front of the tv they cant learn how to practice things they are playing less with friends and dont going to know the real world

so ",24
8924, tv should not absolutly be not allowed because they can learn from the tv but it should be eingeschrenkt of 1 hour the day to ,17
8925," of view thia atatement is absolutly true and i dont see a way where its not true im positive that every single on of us has seen an advertisement on tv they absolutely loved and we all tried to convince our parents to buy it 

lets be honest people the stuff in advertisment just looks ",11
8926, good and if your a child you ,18
8927, believe everyone is good and that santa ,18
8928," exists and nobody is ever lying to be blunt no 17 boy plays with children toys theyre probably at home playing their video games but if a young bay sees someone whos older and in theri eyes cooler and they do awesome tricks like jumping over fences and stuff they want to do that to and every child wants to have the coolest toys and show it to their friends 

a friendly advice dont buy toys over the internet its almost all the time a fraud and your children will stop playing with it ",20
8929,"television advertising  young childeren aged  should not be allowed

in our society television playes a remarkable role in many peoples lifes by many people it is used for relaxation purposes to inform you about recent events around the globe or just out of boredom therefore advertisers have found it a very good place for their ads because many people of different countries culutural background intellectual standard and age can be reached with your ads if you confront yourself extensively with advertising you will seek to answer the question which age group you are most likely to reach and for which ones it doesnt make sense 

the advertisers should definitly be allowed to target young childeren ",14
8930," because the ads mostly consist of toys most of which are harmless maybe it gives them an inkling of what to wish for for their birthday or christmas the childeren ask their parents and they can decide to buy said toy or article if found usefull or apropriate 

i question the use of television advertising for young childeren because i doubt they are effective young childeren may be fast mulled over and excited by the item displayed and praised in the ad ",0
8931, the are not capable of purchasing it themselfes ads for  toys should be aimed at the parents who can ,20
8932," show their child what they find fit and present  it to them

childeren aged  are naiv and have no experience they will choose the toy or item they are most partial without thinking about the price or usefullness ",20
8933, its the parents or guardians task to give them what they need on the whole young childeren should not be watching a lot of television at such a young age their creativeness can be very limited and by playing in or outdoors they can develop a lot better   ,17
8934,advertising is one of the biggest industries todaywe use it on a daily basis and are confronted with it in almost every momentbut should our youngest children be under effect of these adsfirst we need to take a look on the general effect advertising has and why it existadvertising is the process in which a product is presented to a specific audience ,0
8935, they get to know of the existence of said product and are induced to buy itas you might assume adverts are almost never neutral and always biasso they seem to be something we dont wantbut keeping in mind that most companies direct their adverts at a speciefic audience we can say that most ads we see are directed at us in some way ,11
8936," the chance of the product being something we are actually interested in is incrisingly highit helps us find the stuff we needwant and maybe even on deciding quickly what exact product has which qualities and often which pricebut we need to keep in mind that we youme and most probably any other person who reads this are individuals who are already embetted in the economical system with a way of income and a general idea of necessities and luxus
the childrenaged  are not familiar with such an ideology and ",23
8937, cant be the one where these ads are directed toor can they as already mentioned advertising to these children does not make any sense for the companies who pay money to these adverts ,16
8938, they can not get money from them ,19
8939, why do they do itthey can not buy stuff themselves but they have parents who are more than willingly to make their kids happy if they want the new actionfigure they have just seen on tvthe question being now on wether this is good or bad could be answerered by saying that ,20
8940, not being particularly friendly or unshady the parents ,9
8941, have their own choice to buy the advertised product or notbut not everything is about money ,11
8942," need to take a look at the effect it has on the child
adverts are usualy very flashycatchy and designed to forfill a raised exspectation on the product and are suposed to speak to region of our brain that is responsiblr for excitment without us even noticing it but most adults or those becoming one have an idea of rational thinking to ask about and criticise the thing they show on the tv and ",0
8943, deciding for the kid the children are left with a thought of this flahsy product and that anything they see has to forfill this excitment they had on television becouse they never came in contact with the product on another level than that,2
8944,there are tv channels which are ,10
8945, have advertising in the following ,11
8946," discuss if television advertising  should be forbidden
first of all one can say that there are already some channels which have no advertising anymore ",15
8947," the kika channel in germany 
now ",18
8948, which is that the firms want to make money ,23
8949, they have to show their toys or stuff like that to the children ,20
8950," maybe nobody will buy it beacuse parents do not watch children tv shows 
secondly advertising causes no real harm the children wont get a psychological disease if they see advertising once in a ",14
8951," against the advertising 
firstly advertising is boring ",11
8952, for children which is not alawys bad because maybe ,4
8953," they switch the tv off and go playing outside
furthermore advertising influences the children in a certain direction much more than adults or adolescents the reason ",0
8954, is that children have no idea that advertising is made up by firms with actors ,0
8955, that it is a lie they only see happy children playing with a new toy and out of this reason they want to have it too most times theses things are unnessesary and quite expensive ,20
8956, the parents do not want to buy it this will make ,9
8957," as the parents 
if it is the case that the child gets what it wants it wont have fun with it foreverthe child will see a new advertising and desires a new item this could becomne a kind of circle
to conclude ",20
8958, advertisings for young children cause no real harm it should be not allowed because it bores the children and it causes an unhappy family situation beyond this i would admit that ,16
8959, watching tv is not good for children at all ,17
8960, playing with friends oder outside is a better alternative sometimes an ad might be appropriate but there cannot be ,1
8961, much of it or even hidden advertising in shows which children are not able to discover,14
8962,"the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is a difficult one 
big companys are saying that the young childs often have not their own money for free use it is usally in the hands of the parents ",13
8963, they can not buy anything showing in advertisment but why big toy companys are producing advertisment for millions of dollars s young childs  if there is not any benefit for them children espcially younger children often have their parents in their hands they can whishing anything and they are getting it so the young kids are not having the money and buying the products directly but they often get this trough their parents one can say that every other age class gets advertisment why young children aged  should not getting advertisment it is a simple answer these young kids are in the middle of the development  of their own personality favours and character ,0
8964," it should not be allowed to manipulate them with the advertisment
i am agreeing with the the statement mainly ",15
8965, because it is not okay to interfere with the development of the young childs they needing these development to become a teenager with no greater problems resulting of manipulation by the advertisment of the big toy companys ,20
8966,many people are watching television with their family or just to relax but there are ,1
8967," the series or the film you want to watch but advertisement too it plays a major role if you have advertisement for your product or not so it is obvious that many underaged children are watching this ads too but i think that it is not good to confront the children this young with the media and their powerful like mind controlling advertisement many children are influenced by the media for the rest of their lifes also the big enterprises who are giving money to the media who are showing the advertisements are selling most of the time unhealthy or dangerous products like fast food or handys by which the children are most likely to get addicted from
so ",14
8968, that parents need to watch their children and must not show their children the advertisements who is influencing the young childrens with a bad image of their products also good products  are mostly not run by big companies ,13
8969, you do not see often advertisement of products who are influencing the children in a good way so ,0
8970, parents need to watch their children ,12
8971," they are watching television so directed advertisement should not be allowed for young children but parents can prevent its ny controlling what the children are watching

by erwin smith",16
8972, inherits that televison advertising ditrected towards children aged  should not be allowed in the following i am going to discuss whether i ,13
8973," with the previous statement
first of all it is to be said that children at the mentioned age are not able to purchase something on their own meaning that they on their own do not state a purchasingforce this ",9
8974, makes it seemingly obvious that it is no good idea reffering to the specific companies sake to waste ,23
8975, influence persons which are not even able to buy something on their own but do not give in such an easy way and think about it a bit more if you do that you are going to get to the conclusion that yes they cannot purchase something on their own but obviously they are able to influence their parents or ,9
8976, persons in buying something for them saying that the advertising follows the sole plan to influence the young children which should again manipulate their parents ,16
8977, in buying something for them in my opinion this alone is sufficient to make one come up with a thought the thought that companies like that which actually do something as malicious as influencing children who are likely not even able to state what they really want and just come up with the ,2
8978, best thing to have are truly evil comes right to ones mind ,18
8979, in addition to that it proved to be true that some kind od advertisements are able to truly influence and damage the children ,13
8980, for example there has been an advertisement in the early ninetees which stated a product that was presented to the audience until this it seems to be fairly normal but what what follows is truly malicious the whole time the spot was set in motion there has been some kind of ultrahigh frequency tone which was not hearable for the human ear but unfortunately it affected our brain and made us want to purchase that product there is probability that young children have something like that too something that triggers something in them probably damages them and makes them influencing their parents ,2
8981," buy something for them

i ",1
8982, believe that it is even for the companies not purpose fulfilling if they try to influence such young people because they simply do not state a purchasingforce on their own and need to depend on another factor if they want to sell their products if the companies would just make advertisement for people who could really buy somethingthey would not need to worry about another factor,2
8983,the statement that the advertising  is nowadays a daily thing in every television soap or just a film are these television advertisings in the afternoon ,10
8984," children from a young age want to watch a film every fifteen minutes there are those
 

a positiv ",6
8985, of the permission is young children would not be sad ,12
8986, the parents say no to their imagination ,9
8987," to have these toys or puppies
furthermore there would be less frustration of the parents to ",20
8988," with their children

a negativ ",3
8989," to the statement is some shops can not afford to lose the generation of the age 
moreover it is the parents fault ",9
8990," they have the mentality of buying all the wishes from television from their children 


in my opinion ",3
8991, it must be allowed because some companies only become famous because of the commercial so i ,15
8992, with the statement parents are not obligated to buy all these things ,9
8993, they have not a clear mind ,3
8994, they have to buy dumb things like a unreal dog eg ,3
8995,the question if television advertisement for children from the age of  should not be allowed seems a bit irelevenat to me because ,13
8996, of no child from the age of  should be allowed to watch tv on its own furthermore the advertisments usuallay is directing to the parents of those childs and these parents should have the needed competence to decide wether an advertisment is good or bad or ,13
8997, they would want their children to play with the advertised toy ,20
8998, for the statement is that children of that age are easily influenced by things like advertisments and ,7
8999, someone should test the advertisments for their safety and if they give some information which are not good for a child at that age but if the advertisment is good and the children want the advertised product they have to ask their parents anyway and ,16
9000, it is the problem of the parents because they let their kids watch television insteat of doing something useful like playing outside where they can learn something real and build their own character there even is a book in which the author describes dangerous things children should be allowed to do to learn about certain things like problem solving or they ccan learn about their borders of pain which to seems very important one example in that book was climbing a tree which teaches the childs important motoric skills i ,17
9001, think children of that age should only watch television with their parents and ,17
9002, only watch programms that have no bad effect on their social behavior ,6
9003, shows like baurer sucht frau which is a german television show also in todays society televison gets mor eand more unpopular because of an internetn broadcasting website called youtube where advertisment often can not even be recognized as what it is because of ,10
9004, called youtubers that dont mark their videos as advertisment videos these youtubers have a much bigger impact on young children and ,0
9005, should have harder guidelines so my answer to the question if television advertisment should be forbidden for young children is that it should have hard guidelines but ,13
9006, it is the parents fault if something influenced their children in the wrong way also i dont watch tv ,17
9007, i dont know how the todyas situation with advertisments is,11
9008,many researches have lately shown that children who are at a young age in contact with social media will be more intelligent and succesful in life in the following ,8
9009," discuss wethter television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not
this leads me to the ",13
9010, that children should get used to see all different ,8
9011, of social mediaof course they shold not watch tv all day but sometimes it could ,10
9012, help them improve their language and not hear the style of their parents language additionally children would be entertained the whole time because every 30 seconds or ,8
9013," there is something new going on
however it is not good for them because it could make them dumb if they only watch advertisments all day children should go outside play with friends and have fun children cannot be raised watching tv because they are getting lazy of it they probably do not want to do anything else anylonger moreover children tend to get grumpy if they do not get what they want and ",14
9014," watching tv they possibly do not want to do anything than watching tv

in my opinion i am very happy i did not grow up with watching tv and the advertsiments but going outside and seeing the nature ",1
9015, learn something because at that age you just kind of learn by doing and not watching i believe it should be prohibited for children at that age and parents should not let their children watch that often tv because it is not healthy for their growing brain and decreases their intelligence,17
9016,"its a difficult topicbecause people see it differently
on the one ",21
9017, it should be not allowedbecause television make the little young children stupid but ,17
9018," in the age  children dont realise what they become told by the people in the television for the children it is only unterhaltungsprogramm they see a lot of differently pictures on the tv and a lot of different colours 
another ",17
9019, is that television is not good for the eyes of the little kids television can make the sehstã¤rke badlier ,17
9020, that they need classes in a young age against the argument is that television sometimes had the influence of quieting ,17
9021, the little childrens are faster mã¼de or that they are ,8
9022, and relaxed some parents let their children watch televison because they are noises by their kids and ,1
9023," they need silence they let them watsch on the tv
furthermore sometimes give it serien in which they children can learn something like 123 wenn du richtig stehstsiehst du wie das licht angeht out of this serien children dont will become silly or stupid they learn something what they could need in their later life in their future in the school or someone else so many serien are interessted by children who they can learn something but sometimes children needs serien which are silly and stupid but funny or something
in my opinion is it okay that people watsch in the age  televisionbecause sometimes everyone needs silenceit musst not be every day long of hours but sometimes is it okayspecially by childrenwho have older siblings its hard to allowed them little one not to watch television for exsample my neighbour lukas is seven years old and his sister maira is three years old and ",17
9024, he watsch television she will too but ,1
9025," she didnt watched television because her parents not allowed than is the drama big because her older brother can watch television
but in the end parents musst decide that on themselves than all parents are different and all of them sees the topic differently",17
9026,watching television is quite normal in our modern world almost everybody does it and many love it but many people hate advertisements they destroy the whole scenerie of a good film we are watching an most likely show things we really do not need but ,10
9027," young kids watch tv these days and they get overrun with advertisements concipated just for them
the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is a really controverse topic which is often discussed 
this is a very difficult question if this should be allowed or ist should not and ",14
9028, some against it in the following text ,21
9029," discuss at least a few of them 
one ",21
9030," that is against the statement is that many companies would not sell any products for children they produce if they would not advertise it in the tv children in this age do not go into a shopping mall and buy their stuff at it they tell her parents what they want to have and most likely they see it on the tv the advertisements are one of the few ways for companies to sell their products 
an ",13
9031, that supports the these is that really young children are easy to manipulate and that might happen if they watch advertisements on the tv they do not have an own opinion and they witch it really fast an support everything that is shown to them especially ads that directly go towards the children is really dangerous in this case they can get manipulated ,16
9032, they could support things which are bad for themselves ,3
9033,"
another good example for the advertisements is that they could do the complete opposite of the ",11
9034, i just mentioned they could inform the children or teach them some things they need for the future the advertising would be used for a good cause ,0
9035," to say
tv advertising could cause many troubles if it is abused and it could force the young children to sit in front of the tv the whole day they would not do anything else another ",13
9036, is that some kids would be angry if they do not get the things they wanted to get this could be horrible for the parents who have to deal with the children ,9
9037," this
in my opinion the advertisements in tv should stop especially for young children this power is abused too often ",13
9038, with manipulating the children they get a totally wrong picture of the world and the other people and might be forced to sit in front of the tv the whole day just because of the advertisements they watched and ,7
9039, that count for advertisements in tv are far too small they could never get bigger than the ,10
9040,"one of the most sensitive things about young children is how easy it is to influence their personality and behaviour which can lead to them being exploited in several occasions for numerous reasons this is no different with television advertisement which is one of the biggest and easiest ways to access and influence countless children across the planet for economic reasons

first of all lets look at a i have to say ",14
9041, dark example regarding the extraordinarily low difficulty of influencing the behaviour of small children ,7
9042, their susceptibility to suggestion one of the most wellknown examples for this is found in dark humour which often makes jokes about children being lured by predators through candy trading cards etc which is not something that sprung off of fiction these things all originate from real life cases where pedophiles and kidnappers used these things as lures to make them trust them and follow their suggestions even ,3
9043, this example may seem disproportionate this is the exact same principle and ,21
9044, those are little children we are talking about there is no such thing as disproportionate for them ,12
9045," they do not have the life experience to differentiate the severity of influencing through advertisement and strangers

",11
9046, regarding the discontinuation of advertisement s young children as i have made abundantly clear in my example above young children are extremely easy to influence and are very susceptible to suggestions ,16
9047, their young age which makes advertisement s them something immoral for some people what i mean by that is that it is literally like taking candy from a baby only in this case the candy is the money of the childs parents they are just ,2
9048, easily influenced that companies do not even have to put that much effort into making successful advertisement ,11
9049, they can be exploited this easily and lead them into buying things that are ,3
9050, toys which work are presented through animations in advertisements which makes the children form an unrealistic image in their minds or advertisement for candy which can ,0
9051," snowball into the child having too much of it 

now ",4
9052, move on to the contra,18
9053, that could be made in the defence of advertisements s young children is that it does not strictly go against any laws and it is not necessarily damaging for the child the parents do not have to buy the toys their children see in the advertisements and it is ,16
9054, their responsibility to make sure their child has a healthy diet and dental care ,9
9055, those companies who produce the advertisements are not forcing anyone to do anything but ,11
9056, showing them what they could do apart from that one could ,8
9057, argue that it is a grey area wether it is immoral or not to make those advertisements ,11
9058, this is a question which is to be answered individually and ,21
9059," varies alot from individual to individual

so ",18
9060, these advertisements can be considered highly immoral due s susceptibility to suggestion and may snowball into bigger issues these issues severity depending on what the advertisement is actually for ,11
9061, something that is very individual and advertisements ,11
9062, only show what someone could do they do not actually force anyone to do anything it is ,12
9063, up the childs guardians to make the decision not the child itself,12
9064,the number of persons watching tv have raised in the last few years also children love it to watch television in the evening or in the afternoon ,17
9065, the televison programme there are many advertisings ,10
9066," for young children this leads me to the statement i read in an article that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

",13
9067, with these statement because advertisement has a huge impact on people but ,11
9068," on young children
they see a spot in the television and want ",17
9069, the newest nintendo ds because it has a game you can only play on this version of nintendo or for younger kids are things like little figures they can collect an share with their firends more important ,20
9070, dangerous they can brathe these little figures in and it can get stuck also are these figures full of chemicals who are not healthy for children neither ,20
9071, is that children could try to replay what they saw in the advertisement the new spiderman costume is in sale and in the ad the children wearing it can fly like spiderman and ,20
9072," the children get these costume it would try to do it like in the advertisemnt
there is ",20
9073, advertisemnt which is violent or have a positive ,11
9074," of view about violence and this is a message the children learn and keep in their minds

but ",7
9075, advertising for children until five years ,16
9076," all advertising should be controlled more or be forbidden young teens are very impactable in all kind of advertising or propaganda
all in all is watching television for children ",14
9077, teenanger not a perfect freetime acitvity they should go outside an play games with thier friends ,1
9078, they must go to upper school and have no longer time for playing games or freetime itself,24
9079,children aged  have to learn very much about live for example about their needs and how they had to react in diffrent situations one of this situation is the television advertising they had to diside whether they resist this advertising or not if not they had to ask their parents whether they could buy them this things and than it is by the parents if their child gets this thing for example the child watches tv his favourit series dragons or somthing and ,14
9080, it comes an advertising about a figur from this film whitch one can by in the supermarket after that the child goes to his mom and ask her to buy this figur so their is a secound opinion which knows more about the world and how it works but ,6
9081, the child starts annouing his mother she maby desids against her on opinion and than the advertising has the chance to manipulat the child with more and more new figurs of this series and the child wants them all but the mother do not want to buy them when this happens the child maby goes to the supermarket and buys tehem by itselfs but the child can not do that because its to young an other example is if the mother says yes but buys it with the money of the child than the child learns ,20
9082, it has enough money to buy the ,23
9083, figur that it can not have everything this child will grow up and knows how to spend its money without a helping ,9
9084, it would not buy evrthing what the advertising says instad of bthe other child who maby would in my opinion television advertising  children aged  should be allowed to teach the children how to act in this situations but the parents have to know how they had to react when a brefed mother or father is given it would work and television advetising should be allowed,16
9085,the discussion whether television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not became more and more important within the years one could say that it is nearly impossible to avoid advertising in the television and the only thing one could do is to quit watching tv but is it really necessary young people get easier influenced for the reason that they are in their learningphase ,14
9086, soak everything up that is told to them and reproduce it now if they watch too much tv it could have bad effects even on their later life some ads in the tv want their viewer ,17
9087, hard to buy their product that it sounds for a young child nearly as he or she has to do ,20
9088, strong that they want to consume a lot even ,3
9089," as a three yearold boy this experience in ones childhood can make a child easy influenceable by advertising in their later life and make them spend a lot of their money to things they do not even need
so ",2
9090," should nt be allowed towards young children because it has only bad effects on them
                                              the end



",12
9091,of cause there are many advertising in the television today but there are ,10
9092, the show them little children everyday because young children are not able to chose between many things and ,6
9093, they maybe want to have many games or something but maybe the parents do not have that much money to buy their children all the things from the advertising also there is a problem because not every advertising is for every children for every age or sex and in every advertising in the television are things to use inside a house or on the computer and ,0
9094, the children do not learn how to play with their fantasy or other kids outside in the nature also the ,24
9095, that in the advertising is shown with children have to play with barbies and which have to play with pirates is not good for kids but there is ,20
9096, that it is easy to talk young children in to something ,7
9097," they want to have something from the advertising from the television this is maybe negative fro the parents but positive for the industry because children are very good in talking to their parents that they want to have something from the television advertising so the parents maybe buy something from the advertising in stead of buying something with is not shown in the television 
in the christmas time of the year the advertising in the television show much more games for children and ",0
9098," the children watch television and the advertising and put the things from it on their sheat of paper for their wishes
of cause it is good for the industry ",0
9099," for the kids bacause the kids can choose their games and presents for their birthday and for the christmas time 
so young children learn how to choose their own things    ",20
9100,television advertising has a huge impact on our life ,10
9101, we all get influenced by it the following statement says that television advertising should be forbidden in case it is  so ,15
9102,we have the parents who want their children not to get in contact with advertising at least at this young age ,16
9103, advertising has a deep impact on our minds on the other ,11
9104," those who focus on producing toys 

from the parents ",20
9105, of view the only positive ,21
9106, is that the child knows better what kind of toys it wants on hisher birthday if it watches a lot of television commercials but the negative ,20
9107, are much more important and strong than the positive ones so ,21
9108, television advertising focused on little children mostly is based on saying the name of the product many times with a cool voice ,0
9109, bring it into the viewers mind this means that the toys your child wants to have are complete trash in most cases another ,20
9110, is that as a parent your child will get on your nerves every time you are in a mall with himher because heshe wants you to buy these toys an other ,20
9111," is that it generally is not good to let children which are these young watch that many television otherwise it will be a normal process and the kid will not be able to live without electronic devices 

on the companys ",17
9112, of view advertising s little children has the negative ,16
9113, that they have to produce special spots just for these group of people which costs a lot of money in most cases but ,23
9114," is that you can earn a lot of money because one can influence little children very easily this means with good advertising spots many children want to get your toys 

but actually producing advertisings for children aged  is ",0
9115, bad than good because it has important negative ,21
9116,"television advertising is ubiquitous whether for the newest cleaning supplies or cheap technical devices young kids have to experience these harmful influences aswell

toddlers brains arent ",14
9117, developed to think critically influencing kids to buy or wish for the toy  is harmful for this development advertisements give a wrong impression to kids which cant distinguish reality and  hoax ,20
9118," the lack of experience this is needed to even be able to think critically

companies use this lack of experience of kids to generate more sells toddlers are being tricked and used for the companys ",2
9119, companies that use this tactic are generally ,23
9120," those who dont value quality as high this leads the kids to want bad quality products to be bought for them for example i was tricked into wanting things i now regret having bought

the harmful effects result in a misinterpretation of advertisement later in life when a toddler always sees wrong things on tv this will transform ",2
9121, in believing wrong statement about reality advertisement towards kids should ,16
9122," be banned to be aired on television

",15
9123,"when i am swipping through the channels on a rainy saturday evening an see very small kids playing with toys in the advertisement on some junior channels i demand myself if it is good to let young children aged  see this things this leads me to the current topic of if television advertising for young children should be allowed at all 
first of all i like to mention that ",14
9124," children in the age  should not even be allowed to watch tv at all they have better things to do like playing with their friends or doing other kiddie stuff when they watch tv they might learn about the serious of life way to early 
second ",17
9125, that television advertising for those young kids is not a good idea because they cannot decide what they need and what not so there is a high risk that they want to have a lot of material things like the newest doll or car or whatever but they do not have money to buy it probably they do not even know what money is and why they need it maybe they ,2
9126," get trouble with their parent because it is hard for them to understand why they do not get everything they wish for with televison advertising gets the horizon of what to wish for bigger an bigger and the desire of beeing always up to date starts to early 
i do not thik there are any proper ",17
9127, to mention for the opposite ,21
9128, that the idustries make much more money on this way because most parents cannot say no to their children another difficulty is that even ,9
9129," they are allowed to watch tv when the advertisement for children is forbidden it possibly goes out to the parent directly

as a conclusure one can say that television advertising for kids  should not be allowed when the children start going to school they start comparing each other early enough and they do not need the material pressure from the televison sad but true ",14
9130, there is any way to stop it,18
9131,today people all around the world watch television its something we do frequently instead of playing in the garden todays children are watching more and more television they ,17
9132, watch tv shows or movies they ,1
9133," watch television advertising because its a main part of tv programms now theres the question  should television advertising  young childern be allowed or not

the reason why television advertising  shouldnt be allowed is that young children are easy to manipulate most of this kids believe everything what they get told so its very easy for firms to let the children believe that they want this product another reason against it is that children start to learn that such materialistic possessions are important because if they always see products in television they maybe start thinking thats what lifes all about 

the reason why television advertising  should be allowed is that they ",14
9134, as said in the negative ,21
9135, learn how to handle situations where they cant always havein this example products what they want they ,23
9136," maybe twenty times watching the tv advertise that they dont want this product anymore this could be positive for growing up because they learn how to deal situations in a world where products are everywhere advertised because sooner or later they need to learn that

in general i believe that television advertising  shouldnt be allowed its unfair against the children and the parents because the main reason why a firm wants to direct television advertising  is because they are easy to impress and that shouldnt be the case if the products which a firm sells good ",0
9137, they dont need to advertise it to children because the parents would buy it by themselves,2
9138,advertising for young children can be damaging to those because they tend to listen to their stars on the televison but ,14
9139, young children do not have the rights or money to buy those products in a shop or onlinethese children can easy be manipulated by the televsion ,2
9140, they need an older person to buy it for them parents do want there children to be happy and might buy those products but they are very expensive and just for the moment ,2
9141, later on the children grows up and does not need it anymore parents should decide themselfs if a young children really needs these products or if they just want if because the televison said it if the advertising is inaprobiate or not desinged for the young crowd it should not be allowed anyway because they can heavily inflict the mental state of the children and manipulate them to do wrong things or buy illegal productsgood advertising is rare but effective ,2
9142, they can produces well desinged products which makes the children happy or maybe is good for their evolution by learing certend things by using the product also the parents should not left the children to long alone on the television because they might lag the skill to interact with other children later on which got attention from there parents and learned how to interact or make friends from them a bit by watching them or listen to them childrens need those social interactions to grow up normally and should not be damaged by any electronical media like advertising in their early years also it could make the children addictet to certend advertising or television in the end i ,14
9143, the mental and social damage a television advertising is to big and problematic for young children without their own mind ,14
9144," they get less attention from parents or other real personâ´s do not interact with other children or get addicted to certend products 
",24
9145,in the tv there is advertising areound every 15 to 30 minutes the advertisment is about everyathing elektronics food sport and ,10
9146," much more but there is even advertisment for thing for children where they directly speek to the children to give them the feeling that they need it should this be allowed to manipulate children in this way

one the one ",12
9147, one could say why not it is just advertisment and if the parents do not want the chiildren to see it they could just stop the child the watch tv the parents are in the last ,17
9148, the person how have the responcibility for their children ,9
9149," the producer of this advertisment could argue in this way the parenrts can decide about what to watch and what not
but one the other ",10
9150, the parents try to watch advertisment there is ,14
9151," much advertisment that it is just not realistic to think that the child would not see any advertisment and iff this advertisment is directed to children and their wishes in can manipulate the children in a very good way because in an age of  children are not able to think about what they see in such a differentiaded way than an adult
so they are easier to manipulate what has the ",16
9152," that they whenever the see an advertisment  they willget the feeling to want it too
now one could argue that there are even channels espacially for young children where is no advertisment like kika what leeks us to the question where the young children should see this advertisment what is directed for them

all in all ",0
9153, that it is diffocult to forbid advertisment  but ,15
9154, that if children see this it can have negative ,7
9155, nevertheless i ask myself where the cildren should see this advertisment because if they watch tv which is made for their age on channels like kika than there is no advertisment consequently they coan just see it ,16
9156, they watch normal tv but ,1
9157, it is like this there is the question what has worse ,19
9158, the advertisment or the televsion they watch on this channels which is normally for higher aged personens so i come to the conclusion that i just think that television advertisment for young children is not good but the people how watch tv on channels for adults have other problems  ,14
9159, advertising towards young children which are between  years old should be forbidden to save all people who are over 15 years old from these annoying baby and young children products like pampers hipp playmobil and much more others also this would prevent children from wanting useless and overprized products like lego hotweels and barbie which are bad for them because ,16
9160, they annoy their parents to buy more of it which might start an addiction the environment because it is nearly completely made out of plastic and ,2
9161, they buy some things for their children or their children are getting mad also these things to play with are trown away ,3
9162, instead they should get something like an old gameboy which is hard to destroy cheap and ,20
9163, the children do not need anything else to play at commercials ,1
9164, hipp or pampers you could say that it is made for the parents ,9
9165, they know which products are best for their babychild but seriously if someone wants to know what really is good for their child he should google it ,2
9166," believing in an commercial product which is overprized 
",23
9167, that these commercials should be forbidden to save the teenagers from being annoyed by these advertisments because seriously these advertisements are pretty annoying ,13
9168, hotweels commercials the guy who speaks it does not really speak  he shouts his text ,11
9169," that the children think that it have to be good and that they need it to be happy
seeing all the ",7
9170, everyone should see it now,18
9171,almost in every television show are pauses with a lot of advertising ,10
9172, it is part of our daily life in the following ,21
9173," discuss wether telivision advertising  should be allowed or not

the ",15
9174, thing one can state is that young children at the age  are much more easy to influence tha older children or ,7
9175, to that the children want the things which are shown in the telivision advertising on the other ,0
9176, can be influenced by telivision advertising for example at shopping channels furthermore older people can ,10
9177, be easily influenced like i already stated with the help of shopping channels where they are animated to buy more things ,23
9178, buy it less expensive another ,18
9179, be influenced with the help of the contentr and the action in special childrenseries for example the children who wanted to cute his stmoach and to put a television only because it watched teh teletabbies thid is teh case because like i already said children at an age  are much easier to influence ,7
9180, at the aged of sixteen and ,18
9181, that television advertising  from the age of  should not be allowed because they can be to easily be influenced with this advertising but television advertising is not the only risk where young children can be influenced also the content of childrenseries can influence the children in a negativee way on the other ,13
9182, the risk to be influenced is ,21
9183, given for adults for example through shopping shows,0
9184,the sentence television advertising  aged  should be not allowed have people who ,15
9185, with maybe it is the right way for young children to grow up whithout tv because they have maybe a better childhood because they play more often in the nature and with other children as ,17
9186," they watched just tv 
on the other ",1
9187, children in this age watched maybe just one hour on the day tv when they play with other children in the afternoon and watch maybe just an hour ,17
9188," they have to sleep it is okay 
",19
9189, one hour to watch tv in this age is okay because i do not see a danger for the child to see an hour maybe spongebob barbie or other series for kids when they have fun to see this they are allowed to do this but children have to become fresh air and they have to go outside for a bit time people should not to be ,17
9190," streng with their little children 
okay i understand ",9
9191, parents say that their children should not to watch tv because they do not like the series they are watching or they think that they become stupid ,17
9192," they should show their children which one they will be allowed to watch 

so ",12
9193, with the sentence television advertising  aged  should not be allowed to,15
9194,since the existing of television video games computer and phones people have been discussing the amount and effects this kind of media has on ,10
9195," young children a lot of primarly older adults think children should not be allowed to watch television and it should be reduced to a minimum to do that it is discussed to ban any advertising of tv shows and movies which is s children 

one of the most mentioned reasons to ban this kind of advertisment is that the adults believe that children spend too much time infront of the television in their mind they believe that children only sit infront of the tv all day long not being outside and playing but in most cases that is not true andd ",14
9196, thing they forget is that the amount of tv that is watched should be atleast from the ages from two and five be dictated by the parents ,17
9197, these children are seeing these advertisments parents are or should be in control of the tv time of their children also these advertisments and ,13
9198, the movie oder televison show they are advertising towards the children are stories just like in books these children are going to identify themselves with the story or characters a big part of growing up and learning certain things like empathy one example could be that by watching maybe disney movies like lion king it is ,6
9199, a movie that makes them laugh but teaches them that not all children ,6
9200," parents or subconsciously teaches them about growing up and the difficulties that part of life brings and if you wouldtake away these advertisments and only direct them towards their partent the children can not decided what they want to watch taking away the decission what they want to learn because most advertisments show the gist of the lesson they trying to bring across also by doing that they would take away the lesson of deciding what the child believes interests them and measuring how well they would digest certain movies and themes 

certainly the way that movies and tv shows for children are advertised towards children should be controlled and it should be garanteed that it does not in anyway influence the children to do something dangerous or forbidden ",14
9201," an advertisment should say you should watch this movie no matter what your parents say it should just advertise the movie

all in all ",16
9202, that because the biggest problem of advertising movies and tv shows towards children is that society fears young children are not in control of the amount of tv they watch i peronally believe that at that age parents and society should teach their children the amount they should watch and what they watch to certain degree also parents need to be able to know how well their children react to certain movies and the length of their tv watching ,17
9203, how well their children can do it themself already  ,9
9204,all over the world will be discute about if television advertising shouldnt be allowed  in the age of  years this wonder a lot of old people that something like this can be asked because this theme just come to speak in the 21 th century  befor there arent any television and children never see an advertising in the age of  many parents work a long time and there children are alone at home  they have no controle about there children if they look television or not  the parents cant influence the computere advertising if there child is looking a film pherhaps you already know that in each film or serie come all 30 minutes an adverting where somthing will show on there best ,14
9205, this we cant change i strongly belive that the children in there young years dont have to see ,12
9206, much advertising because the economic take this chance to make a lot of money the children see ,0
9207, a sweet teddy or an tractor for play and ,20
9208, they will to buy this things  with television advertising they buy a lot of things they dont need in my opinion the television advertising should not be allowed ,15
9209, for childrens who are older than five years old than ,8
9210, children in this age dont realise that they wouldnt need this things they see in the advertising ,2
9211,television is in our society a big topic ,10
9212, every human use the telescreen in the evening to relax and to get entertained but should children aged two or five ,17
9213," use these advertisment 
on the one ",11
9214, it is easier for parents to controle there children in the public or at home ,12
9215, silence is needed the children are fascinated by the televisoin programms ,17
9216, the parents are able to relax and have some freetime ,1
9217," work without loud children noises who want attention 
furthermore children could learn somethink from the children programm which often try to teach the children counting or writing in an funny way accordingly they are able to have fun and get entertained ",8
9218, parents should try to have as much contact with there children as possible to reach a very deep relationship between them and there kids furthermore the parents had to support social contact with other children ,8
9219, the kids are able to learn and get comfortable with social rules an the right behavior an other negative ,8
9220, is that children would sit too much infont of the television an ,17
9221, will play less outside the movement which children does outside ,24
9222," as the creative which is used to invent new games to prevent to get bored are lost but the biggest and most worse problem and consequense of television programm for children is that the risk for an bad impact made by programm which ist only for older people coud made some deeply fearful impact on childrens behavior 
consecently televisoin for children is not good because of the negative consequenses for the moment it coudl make the parents life more easier but in the future it would have an negative impact on children the risk television brings withit are too high as we coudl ignore them accordingly ",17
9223, with the statement that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed this would prevent a lot of mistakes in the growing up process from children which are mostly caused sice parents does not know such informations  ,13
9224,in our todays society many young children watch television and most of the parents did not see any problems or complications in the later life of the children but is the television and ,17
9225," to that television advertising directed  good for their evolution and shoud it be allowed
in my opinion the children in the age of  get very much influence and ",14
9226, advertising via the television they get as much influence as possible futhermore the light of a television is very bad for the eyes and the brain and there could be problems in the future life of the children ,14
9227, watch tv the whole day on the one ,1
9228," the parents can put their childs infront of the television and they are happy because all of them are quiet
but one the other ",1
9229, is not it the job of parents to play with their kids and have fun with them a child should be a big dream and not a thing to get some money from the state you should love your child and you should love to take you time for just your child when the children get influenced by the advertising they always have a wish they want to play with and maybe ,9
9230, there is a very good markded toy the young people oftener want to play with bit ,20
9231," watching television 
in my opinion it should not be allowed to stream advertising in television  in the age of  because ",15
9232, young people get influenced very fast without doing something but it would be much easier to turn the television off go outside and ,17
9233, climb the trees than to discuss wheather it should be allowed to direct advertising towards young people or not,16
9234,"television is in our times normal but what is with the television advertising   
",10
9235, that television has its good and bad ,10
9236, but for younger children television is often a problem some childrens in that age are only watching television because they are used to it and their parents are not really interseted in doing something with them but the tv decides about how the child becomes and different shows and films make the children react differently children often are shocked by some shows or films ,17
9237, it is for their age they can not understand everything about it and have in the night bad dreams about what they saw the parents can not understand what is up to their child and a 2 year old child could not explain what the problem is some shows might be good to learn something like counting or the alphabet but some shows show a wrong world to the child they show something in which a little princess gets everything she wants or that monsters exist a children often could not make a difference between the reality and a fantasyworld often the kids are afraid of what they saw or they want to do the same as the people on their tv show but how to explain a child that what they saw was not real and that they should not believe in something like that sometimes it is impossible for the parents also you could often not control what your child watches on tv because you take a nap or do cleaning or ,6
9238, on a child should go out an play with its toys or paint or meet their friends like i did ,1
9239, i was at their age they should use their own fantasy and should ,24
9240, life the fantasy a producer of a film created parents should look what they watch on tv and decide if it is good for their kid or not parents should tell the children ,6
9241, they could watch something and ,1
9242," they should do something else they must show by themselves what is write and what is wrong and do not let the shows and films do things like that for them what the parents decide decides about the future of the childrens they should do that because they decide about the future of the children and what he or she will be like
so ",12
9243, you want that your child has a good childhood ,8
9244, control what your kid watches and decide if it is good for them or not and ,17
9245, let your child play most of the time and do not let them watch all the time television it is in your hands as their parents what your child will be like ,17
9246,"nowadays advertising in tv is one of the most efficient ways to generate attention towards a new product that you might want to sell especially if this new product is for little children because they are very inflenciable and you can easily convince them to buy a new toy just becuase it looks nice

i wonder why we should abolish directed advertisements toward young children because ",14
9247, that this is that much of a deal if you think about it at the end the parents need to decide if they want to buy their child a new toy or if they do not children cannot go out and buy it by themselves advertisements on tv channels that were specificly made for  year old children often use advertisement to educate our future generation and i ,2
9248," think that this is a good way to explain things to the young part of our society

on the other ",8
9249, tv addiction at this age is a serious problem young children tend to spend more and more time in front of the television in this day and age when i was younger i used to go outside and play football all day long but today this just does not seem to be the case children often spend the hole day watching tv and playing videogames and because advertisements promotes this new technologies ,17
9250, that it would not be a dumb idea to prohibit directed advertisement for these little children an other negative ,13
9251," is that if children see something they want on tv and they like it they will do whatever it takes to convince their parents to buy that new toy this is often somthing that ends badly

in conclusion ",2
9252, that this kind of advertising should not be allowed because it is a way of entertainig our little children ,13
9253, as a form of education via tv i used to love advertisements ,10
9254, christmas eve because they were very well done and i would know what i would ask santa claus to bring me that year,18
9255,nowadays television is a common thing everybody has one at home and you can literaly watch everything on it from disney movies to documentations but is television a good thing ,17
9256," for young children

in one ",8
9257, television can be very helpful ,6
9258, it comes to knowledge there are many programs whitch offer you a bucket full of new thing like documentatons about certain animals or just videos about climat change children at this young age learn very fast ,8
9259, its kinda a good thing to let them watch these things at the other ,1
9260, its good for them to see how the world looks and acts outside his country like what are the other personalies out there what diffrent kind of culture do we have so if you dont have the money or time to travel and to get to know other cultures than is television a good thing for young children its ,17
9261," way easier to understand throught television
furthermore there are ",6
9262," bilingual and learning programs would could help the children to make progress in learning and communication

at the other ",8
9263, televesion can increase your outgoing and social life because youd ,17
9264, sit infront of the tv ,1
9265, going out with friends and get to know knew peopleyou loose many friends it seems like your television is your friend furthermore is the communication between the children in bad situation because children dont need to talk to others face to face anymore they can do it throught television what leads to lonelyness and can ,17
9266, lead  to depressions in bad casesin ,4
9267, that watching television for a too long time a day can ,4
9268," lead to bad mannersbehaviours and agression towards the people around him

all in all there are some good ",4
9269, about television for young childrein my opinion there should be an age limit for children and ,17
9270," a time limit for how long they are allowed to watch because television has influence to your behaviours
",17
9271,it is difficult to answer these question because these advertisings are used to buy the product for example the television advertising of kinderschokolade which is a german chocolate is ,11
9272, directed by young children that has a ,6
9273, for the producer from these product because the other children see these child in the television and than they ,2
9274, want to have one so the parents have to buy some or another example in germany is a television advertising from hipp which is a company who produce foot for babies so the mothers who had born a child see these advertising and ,2
9275, the babies in the television look good and healthy they think it is ,4
9276, good for their own children but ,9
9277, you have to know that the parents go with their children to a casting because maybe they want to get famous or they need the money or what else so the children itselfs can not decide if they want to do these television advertising or not so they are too young to decide for themselfes also the young children maybe can not speak ,0
9278, good or walk or something like that but they have to do what the producers say that means the children maybe not know what they have to do so ,6
9279, with the statement that television advertising which are directed by young people should not be allowed ,13
9280, the children do not know what they are doing there ,24
9281, it should be allowed in an age where the children can decide for themselfes if they want to be an actor of it or not but it should be not allowed only to make money for the parents or to get them famous,12
9282,"television is a very discused topic becsause it is important for all ages in the sosiety in the past it was an importaned way on which the citizens could get information  about what happend in the world
 but is it important that children use this media in the age  years children learned the basics about how they can interact in the sosiety in ower countrie children in this age could get manipulated very easely and the parents can not control what they are watching in the television 
 also in television there are ",17
9283, much topics disscoused which are not good for the growing of this age like newes or crime series if the children learn how they can switch to another chanel they could watch news or horor movies an that is not very good for theyr growing but there is ,17
9284," because if they watch seires which they can learn somthing from it is a good thig
 my opinion is more like the ",8
9285, becuase i think it is better ,19
9286, the play outside or with theyr parents in the hopuse or arpartmened ,1
9287, they should go outside in the nature and learn it with own hands and boddy also if they are with the familie outside they lesrn how to interact with other children on a playground as example    ,24
9288,why should television advertising  be allowed or not in ,15
9289, this is not an easy question because in the development of children the age betwen two and five is important so they are influenced by everything they see in television most advertising is  adults and ,14
9290, completely unuseful for little childrens development i ,4
9291, dont think that advertising is good for children ,16
9292, the effect of the advertising for the enterprise is not ,11
9293, clear children in young age are dependent from their parents ,9
9294," the children have to ask their parents for the product they have seen in advertising since most stuff in children advertising are really stupid or useless things the parents are probably not going to buy things unless they think its good so its better to do the advertising toward adults anyway

on the other ",0
9295," think that it has no good effect on children watching television advertising its more or less prooved that there are much better and more intelligent things to do for children than watching tv for hours if children are used to advertising the enterprises can do even more and more advertising later because nobody reclaims it got normal

",14
9296, the advertising  should get forbidden that would not even get the enterprises in finacial debts they nearly dont make any advertising for children now fact is children can watch tv advertising early enough ,13
9297,"should television advertising not be allowed toward children aged 

well it really depends children in this age usally watch tv channels that are specificaly made for children in this age for sure these channels ",14
9298," have advertising breaks but this are advertising spots made for children so these children dont get offended in a sexual or violent way by the tvspots
if we look at the statement in this way do i ",13
9299," think that tv advertising doesnt have a negative affect on young children because of the tv advertising the have a little bit of a contrast between the series and programms tey watch tey lear something about new products and learn to love and want new toys after they have seen the tv spots the go to theyr parents and ask the if the get the new products they usually to the and in this way the tv spots have an positive affect on the economic of they country 

but what ",14
9300, support the statement i personaly think that tv isnt that good for children gernealy children in this age shouldnt be sitting on the couch in the livingroom and wath tv they should be outside on the playground they should be explorimg the world and playing with theyr friends but this ,17
9301, you can say that tv advertising is good for the world and bad for the children ,13
9302, its important that the world economic works because its this what makes our children growing up in a good area and ,23
9303, i say television advertising is good for our children and shoul be allowed,15
9304,"there is a rumore that young children will get stupid if they watch to much television advertising the question is is that true

young children are heavily effected by advertisments on the television if it comes to what kind of toy they want to have if they see a giant alien toy they want to have it so it is very important for companys to have this kind of connection  but maybe it is not that good for the childen maybe they will get stupid ",14
9305, this is only a rumore it is not official that advertisments damages your children ,16
9306, this rumore just came up because parents think that there kids are watching far to much tv if it is sure that television advertising leads to damage for our childrean ,14
9307, it should not be allowed but by know ,12
9308, this is no reason to not allowe advertising this is ,15
9309, because of personal reasons i have a friend who never had a tv ,1
9310, he could never watch any kind of advertisiment i had an tv ,10
9311, i watched advertisments all day long and i can not see any difference between use we ,11
9312, go to the same school and i even have better grades ,18
9313, him i know this is maybe mot the normal case but ,18
9314, advertising does not effect young childrean in any bad way some advertsiments may be to brutal for young children but ,16
9315," parents should have a look on what their kids are watching because only they know what is good for them in this age because every children is different

so ",17
9316, direct toward young childrean because ,7
9317," it does not effect young children in any bad way only if it is sure that young childrean are effected by advertisments in a bad way it should not be allowed

ps ",16
9318, this topic is not that good because we never had this kind of topic in any of our lessons and never thought about it in our free time because it does not affect use in any way ,21
9319, i do not have that many ,18
9320, maybe a topic about school would be much better,8
9321,the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is a statement which can everybody see different ,15
9322," there is never the right answer 
to be able to undersand the shows in television the children have to know many vocabularys and their meaning because if not the children cannot understand the show ",6
9323," there is no sence to watch it with the help of the shows  children can get new ideas to do with their friends and they can try new things because they saw it in the telivision 
but at the other ",6
9324," there are big dangers to let the young children watch television if they only sit infront of the television they cannot be cerative anymore because the television tells something they belive in it and do not discover anything for themself the day is only to watch television and they do not want to go outside anymore because they think it is boring outside but it isnt they only do not have the cretivity to discover interesting things outside 
if they only watch television they do not meet friends or other children ",17
9325, the relationship between other children is demaged what is a big problem for the future to play with other children in this young age is one of ,24
9326," things in their live because it is one part of your future the evolution of the children  entwicklung eines kindes could be stopped or not fulfilled because they cannot entwickeln themself only  sitting infront of the television

as conclusion my opinion is clear ",17
9327, many other possibilitys to waste the time in the childhood and not watch television it is very important to learn how to be social or how dicover something or to fight with other kids it is all a part of the evolution of children an if this evolution is damaged because of the television the future can ,17
9328, be damaged because they do not know practical things in live they only know who is the aunt of the best friend of the mainfigure in their favourite television show what is not very important to know in live,3
9329,the advertising in the television is often directed because they are manipulatable but many people think that ,10
9330, for young children this should not be allowed for the companies it is a big ,12
9331, to make advertising toward young people because they often watch television and they want to have everything they see in the television although the children have not much money the parents of them would do everything for their children to make them happy ,0
9332, that means that they would buy it the children could ,9
9333, remember the things from the television ,6
9334, they are in a supermarket or something like this and ,19
9335, they want their parents to buy it too however this could be callad manipulating the companies use the behaviour of young people to sell more of their products another ,2
9336, is that children of that age are not really able to think of what they see they do not know anything about it and older people would say that they do not need but young children are manipulatable and can not re think their decisions with that method the companies ,2
9337," that other people buy something and spend their money just because of the manipulating advertising toward other people 
to put it into a nutshell ",11
9338, that this kind of advertising should not be allowed because young children do not know what is good for them and you can easy manipulate them    ,13
9339,"in our generation even the smallest ones are looking televison in their freetime and are seeing the ads of all the nice dolls and toys and want to have them too but is it correct to influence the childreen which are only  years old with advertising  them or should it be not allowed

if youre going in a toy store you can see thousands of different dolls games or other toys and it is impossible to choose one of those thousands for a present for your child and if you are going with your child in a store they want to have everything and they arent able to choose too but if the childreen see one special toy in an ad they only want to have this one thing and it is much easier for the parents to find a present if the childreen are knowing exactly what their childreen want to have

but ",14
9340, young childreen are very easy to influence with ads and if they only see those nice things in an ad it is all what they want and they arent having an own oppinion ,16
9341, the ads in televisons are influencing the growment of the childreen in a negative ,14
9342," in this world we are living is it very important to have an opinion wich is really yours

another ",21
9343, is that young childreen arent always able to understand the difference between reallitty and fiction and it is possible that ,7
9344, they are always looking tv they will use the connection to the real world and they will stop reading books going outside and playing with friends they are happy ,1
9345, they are seeing the unicorn dancing in a tv ad and ,3
9346," they are asking themselves wehre to find them outside because they arent able to know that unicorns arent real 

all in all ",3
9347, television advertising  young childreen should not be allowed because they have to build their own oppinion and it could be dangerous if their are loosing the connection to the real world,13
9348,"the topic is about television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
that is a interesting question for parents if they allowed their kids to watch tv
because there are pro und contra ",13
9349," but more contras
the good thing is that the kids see something interesting maybe
but the ",8
9350," against that is that they could see too much mad thinks or rubbish
maybe they see a advertise and now they want to have it a new barbie or a car from cars they are young and would not understand it
in the advertise are showing new episodes they want to see them but they are not allowed from the parents or the age fsk
it is possible that they do not understand allthing again because they are too young

or the parents do not care about that and the kids are watching the whole day tv and the advertising that would not good for the child because in this age the kids grow up and remeber that

",17
9351, that it should be not allowed because of the ,21
9352, and the health of the kids ,4
9353,"should television advertisments for young children be allowed

when you are watching tv with your little five year old children silbling or cousin you probebly might have heart them saycan i have that that is a common question in for children in this age because the advertisments on a tv channel made for children are perfectly desinged to make them want the advertised product based on the ",14
9354," that it is way easier to make an advertisement for childern because they are not that experienced many adults want those to be banned

one reason ",16
9355, is that the children could get persuaded by those advertisements and by things they usually did not need or even want just because they looked ,0
9356," cool in the television when that happens they are kind of forced to buy something from their own money and do not even get happier from it

but the advertisement industry ",10
9357, which is that the parents just should watch their children better ,12
9358, that they are not allowed to just simply buy everything they want but have to ask their parents ,9
9359," that would solve thee problem that children are not expierenced enough to know what they really want or what the advertisement tells them they want

another good reason to let them be allowed is that children only learn to handle advertisements ",16
9360," they get confronted with them this means that banning them for up to five year olds would make over five year old children be eã¡n easier target

to sum it up ",12
9361, that it is not usefull to bann those kind of advertisements because with the help of the parents they could teach a children how to handle advertisement for the rest of their lives,13
9362,television advertising is already a big and controversial topic but advertisments for children that are  years old are even more controversial there are a lot of reasons for and against those advertisments but just some of them will be discussed ,13
9363," text

  first the advertisments help the children to get used to the media they will use ",0
9364," they get older because of television ant its advertisments the young children will get an impression of how the technology works and what it is for 
the information they get leads to a better view on how the things they will be confronted with really are which helps them to make their decisions
  on the other ",24
9365, the use of media can lead to a dependence on media and ,10
9366," on television ant its advertisments 
furthermore the young children will not be able to see the differences between true and false because of the mass of information they are confronted with this is ",17
9367," an influence on their decisions that leads to the question if their decisions really remain their own decisions

to sum up television advertising  should not be allowed because they would be influenced to much by the information they would get 
in my opinion media is no bad thing but in such a young age children should ",14
9368, play outside with other children than watching television and advertisments they should learn about ,1
9369, they are that young they should stay independent from media ,24
9370," write an argumented essay about the statement if televison advertising  young people sdf habe irgendwie die zu argumentierende frage nicht verstanden
television advertising  young people can have many ",5
9371,"if the children see advertising in television they want to have this products
the hersteller can manipulate the children with the advertising of new products

but televison advertising   can ",0

",23
9373,in the last decades the fast developing of technik and its masive relevance in the modern worldand influence on the personal life of every individual has lead to veryous kontrovers questions of the use and monopole of techniks and especcely ,23
9374, it comes to the relationship and influence of media towards children there are always many critical voices ,17
9375, people who defend the nem developing one of these controverse ,19
9376," can be clearly seen in the television advertising toward young children
on the one perspective it is clear and profed by studies that children from an age  are very easy to influence ",7
9377, that this practice can imensly lead to a change in there personal developement in a way the producers intend it through the shown stuff and ,6
9378," producing in generall and again proofed by science television is not good for very young kids and should just used limited from an age of eight because based on the braindevelopement kids younger than four can not even understand what they see in television and untill six or sevenforgot the exact number they have problems to see the difference betwheen it and reality the medical effects a use of television in to young age or too big amount can reach from anything like headache unability of concentration underdevelopement sleepingproblems realitydisconection two overweight agresivity and in extreme cases even paranoja or psychical illnis
on the over ",17
9379, it is clear that in our technological based world every child ,12
9380, in a young age should learn how to deal with any kind of media and ,6
9381, televison seams to be a less dangouress media in difference to the internet where through a personal interacting of the user much more can happen this should be the media to introduce kids with it ,17
9382, in conection to this generall ,21
9383, importened to teach children a critical view on the media and the knowledge that it tries to influence them ,6
9384," if this happens by the parents kids can learn how to deal with it while you can not keep them away from it  
finally i see my personal view completly in this last ",7
9385, but would like to add that this from my perspective should start in the age of primary school and not from an age of two untill five ,8
9386,advertising is a difficult topic  because sometimes it is helpful and othertimes not but advertising for children  is really bad every little child wants to have what it sees in ads the problem is that  the parents have to pay for it and out of this they will become poor and this why they maybe kill themeselves so the child has no parents anymore annother possibility is that the child only focus on ads  ,16
9387, it is already an adult if the parents donâ´t let their children watching tv the whole day the risk of influecing ads is not ,14
9388, high but children like to watch tv extremly long ,1
9389," they have to find a compromiss 

summarizing ",19
9390, that the risk of a death of anyone is too high so ,21
9391,"advertising has become a important thing for many companies and stores to show people what they have to offer adverts are everywere they appear on televison are talked about on radio and hang on all sorts of things but are there any limits schould advertising  be allowed

9690, that television advertising  young people should not be allowed the problem is not the advertising  the problem is that a lot of children are allowed to watch all programms on tv and to watch the whole day today in many familys it is normal that the tv is on in the background  everyday ,13
9691, the children see it everyday and learn that this is normal it is the parentâ´s duty to teach their children the right way to deal with all the advertising the children need tvrules ,14
9692, they are just allowed to watch specific movies and programms because ,6
9693, advertising directed to children aged  is not allowed there is advertising ,16
9694, they are older and it becomes more difficult to tell them they can not have all and buy all furthermore there is not just advertising on the tv there is advertising everywhere ,2
9695, the children would not be protected against it ,12
9696, it is stopped on the tv so the right way is not to stop the advertising the way to solve the problem is education so ,15
9697," with the statement television advertisement  young childreen aged  should not be allowed 

because ",13
9698," they get contact with the television they can easily get addicted to it and they do not know the danger of this media it can give them false illusions for the real world or they do not get out of the world of the tv show they can not see the wall between reality and the tv
if they get addicted to television the just want to watch it and do not something else like playing with friends and create their own universe with them they get the universe from the tv and do not create theit own they ",17
9699," want to get rid of their friends because they want to wantch the tv show and they get quit their hobbies if they have hobbies like sports in this age and their creativity will not be upgraded 
also the tv sends dangerous beams into its surronding which makes it dangerous for the childreen it is not necessary that they get in touch with this media in this age they have time enough to explore it in their future years 
i did not have a tv in my childhood and we have it ",17
9700, not now and i live i had a great childhood because i was a lot outside playing in the sand or with my toys  in my room or with my parents i ,8
9701, think that my brother 8 years old is addicted to the media because he always want to watch his time on the tablet or play it he started this ,17
9702, he was five or younger that is why ,18
9703," the statement

to put it in a nutshell ",21
9704, with the staement and would go a step ,18
9705, that the media should only be allowed for childreen at the age of eight or higher,12
9706,it has been always very controversy if direct television advertising direct toward children should be allowed in the following essay ,13
9707," have a look on the different perspectives

first of all young children are not the only one who can be manipulated by advertisment so the same issue appears with very old people nevertheless ",16
9708, children should not be confronted with television ads because they you can not really say what effect this has on their development the age from 2 to 5 is extremly important for their ,14
9709, it would not be good if they would be harmed by advertisment but ,11
9710, it is really up to the tvchannels or advertisers todo not advertise for children it is more up to the parents of the children to make sure their children do not watch tvchannels with this advertisment so the parents have the responsibility to care of their child also i do not really see the sense behind advertising  because they are not the generation who buy a lot of things on the other ,14
9711, you can not estimate the power of advertising on the life of the children so it is often a competition between companies to try who is the ,0
9712," to make the customer realize the product because of this they begin with the youngest customers possible and this is alright because it is their right according to law  

all in all ",2
9713, in commercials advertising to young people is no nogo but the companies should not be over do it ,16
9714, not enough research on the effects to the development of children but ,4
9715, children from 25 should not watch tv at all ,17
9716," not shows with included tvspots

 ",6
9717,"television advertising is a modern concept of brainwashing young people
such statements might seem utterly wrong and stupid but they have reason
in todays society it is common for a child to watch tv and for a family to have one when they come across an advertisement they are being influenced by the ads believe it or not watching ads affect you unconciously whether you like it or not if you watch an ad for a certain company producing shampoo ",14
9718, you might not realise it but you will ,18
9719, buy their product than the product of another company this happens ,23
9720, their brains are underdeveloped and ,7
9721, they do not have an own opinion they will be amazed by the ads and will ask their parents to buy them that ceratin product since the child is not able to watch this ad without being influenced by it and ,2
9722," it happens without them knowing it is fairly reasonable to assume that ads should not be allowed
now its not like the companys are secretly planning on brainwashing the viewers ",11
9723, they are certainly thinking of ads that will influence the viewers however is it even a bad thing ,11
9724, children are being affected they have parents that hopefully have a mind big enough to tell if the product their children want is actually needed if it is they will buy it but thats not a bad thing if they didnt buy it from the company the ads belong to they would by it from another company and for gods sake there are enough companys that produce shampoo and ,2
9725, they see an ad they will buy the product introduced in the ads ,11
9726," companys produce ads otherwhise no one would know of their product
all in all ",11
9727, television ads directed at young children should be allowed if the parents are overlooking the whole thing and decide whether its a good idea or not and if not let the children be happy with the product they get i was not the one to phrase the words of wisdom naivety is a fools blessing or  ignorance is bliss but i would certainly use them here,16
9728,"young children are not able to handle their own money much less to make smart decisions so why should commercials directed specifically to them be allowed it doesnâ´t even seem logical 

advertising teams know what they are doing they make research and tests on different age groups ",16
9729, find their weaknesses and strengths ,19
9730, get to know how to get exactly into their minds ,18
9731, they can sell their products does this not sound at least somewhat dangerous it is known by the people that work with children and advertisements that these are very influential to the vulnerable minds of children they are greatly moved by a number of things that we might call simple and these could potentially create mentally disrupted adults later on in life since the main ,2
9732, of advertisements is usually to sell something companies and their advertisers will stop at nothing to convince a small child to believe that they need their product this could potentially lead to harmful images texts and ideas being put on screen and ,16
9733," directly into the minds of the children 
this is something that can not be easily controlled if it could even be and could influence in a negative way a child or even a whole generation within a country or perhaps with a sufficiently big company internationally

do we really believe that it is the best choice to put our children and the future of our world in the hands of people who only have their own interest and benefit in mind is it really worth it

in conclusion i believe that televised advertising s young children aged  should not be allowed under any circumstances ",14
9734, the potential risks that this could bring ,4
9735, to the little good that it could make parents not advertising should be the ones to have the major influence over their children not advertising teams from companies that only want money and will not regard the ethical lines that exist ,13
9736, it comes to selling something to children,20
9737,"if television advertising  should be allowed or not allowed is a very controvers topic which gained more and more meaning over the last years

there are many things children of the age of  are not able to understand ",15
9738," the most advertisments for children this young might be more for food and toys with this comes a problem for all the parents kids that see an advertisement do not look for the food itself they will look for the sound and the colours of the advertisment and the most advertisments are not about healthy food 
also advertisments for other shows on the channel might be not a good thing it will happen that they want to watch one show ",14
9739, the other if they see what cool looking show will come ,19
9740," the show they just watched they do not want to quit and kis should defenetly not sitting in front of the tv the whole day
for companies this might be a good marketing strategy ",10
9741," the children can not buy anything by themselv kids will see their food advertisments and if they like it they will beg their mothers to buy it and everybody knows how pickheaded a little child can be
it might ",2
9742," cause an unrealistic way to think about money and its meaning
for them kids are way more easier to influence than adults or teenagers 

in my opinion television advertising  is not a good thing 
i ",2
9743," want my kids playing outside where they will hurt themselve from time to time than getting this brainwashed many parents underestimate the influence a tv and advertising can have for a child 
and as a parent i would not like to have always a fight with my children over what food they would like to eat i would want them to grow up healthy and raised by someone who knew what he is talking about and not by what they have seen at the tv
sadly advertising  is already a thing which is not regonized by too many parents 
",14
9744,some parents use the television as a grandmother or somebody who looks ,17
9745, they want to have some free time other parents do not allow their children watching tv because of bad influences and ,17
9746," on especially in christmas time you can see more and more television advertising directed torward young children but should that be allowed
television advertising might be a good way to show new great toys to children
but the tv or actually all modern media influence the childrens life more and more even children in primary school or kindergarden have an own mobile phone or a tv in their room some of those children begin to live in a very different world wanting to be like the famous singer or actor children between two and five are easier to convince ",14
9747," they are somehow a present for the advertising industry after watching those television advertising they start to ask their parents could i get  and most of all mothers are not able to say no children start to be not that creative are influenced start to compare themselves to the children in the add or to children who have this new great toy 
in my opinion there is no way to forbid television advertising toward young children industry will find another way ",0
9748, television advertising somehow it starts in the supermarkets with all these colourful sweets and famous disney princesses on the food we are not able to close our eyes and the young childrens eyes ,0
9749, enough channels exspecially made for young children without television advertising in this young age parents watching tv together with their children is a good opportunity to controll what they are looking when the children get older parents are not able to protect them from all these influences the most important thing is a good and healthy way to deal with the television advertising children have to learn even ,14
9750, they are between two and five that the add industry wants you to buy everything and parents have to show their children that it is not possible to get everything but to be happy ,24
9751,"television advertisement has always been very important for different companies but nowadays there are a lot more people watching television including young children a good advertisement can have a big influence on people and an impact on companies

on one ",14
9752, it is okay to direct television advertisements toward young children because every company does its best to earn as much money through products or offers as possible if parents dont want their children to be influenced by television advertising it is their job to educate them and to maybe not let them watch television as often to be honest i dont think that television advertisements can have an impact or influence on a child at that age because they probably dont understand everything the advertisements talk about young children arent able to buy something on their own ,14
9753," its not a big problem if they see products on television that they want to buy 

on the other ",10
9754, products are shown on television children should not be confronted with advertisements at a young age because i suppose it can have an impact on their thinking advertisements ,13
9755," influence a teenagers mind by always showing skinny people or the newest trends on television if young children already get to see these things on television and hear about different problems they grow up with it and they immediately think the same way if their parents dont educate them differently

to sum it up ",7
9756, with the statement because i feel like its the parents job to educate their children and to show them the things that are important in life parents can let their children think that the advertisements  dont always tell the whole truth and that they only let us see the things they want us to see,13
9757,there are many advertising in the tv today and pretty many of these advertisments are for little kids today the young kids from 2 to 5 are often allowed to look tv on kids channels where they look spongbob or other films so the tv channel show more advertisments wich get more attention from young kids who are intersted in these produkts that are presented the kids now want the produkt that is presentd but they do not know how expensive it is because the parents would buy it for them ,0
9758, they do not mind the kids start to ask their parents if they can buy the shown produkt and do that the whole time and maybe they would cry for it ,6
9759," the parents are like under pressure to buy that produkt because their kid do not stop asking them to buy it so the advertisments can put the parents that much under pressure that the produkt will be bought and it does not matters what quality the produkt have or how expensive it is 
if the parents are not able to buy the produkt because the price is to high the kids would maybe do not like their parents that much or get very mad because they have nothing to play with
on the other ",2
9760," watching tv for kids could be a good thing too they can talk about the films they watched with other kids and learn speaking also the kids learn maybe new vocabularies or humor from the films they watched 
another ",6
9761," is that the kids get entertaind by the tv or the advertisments wich is pretty important these days because often the parents do not have that much time for the kid and it is alone at home 
it is good too that the channels for kids just show advertisments for them ",14
9762, they do not watch advertisments wich show horror scens ,6
9763," the kid will not be scared

so i think that tv is acceptabel for kids becuae they can learn thinks from watching and get entertaiend the only prblem is tht the parents get under prssure by their kids but i think the parents have to be strong there and do not feel with the kid and buy the produkt everytime the kid asks them ",17
9764,"advertising for young children
it seems like a lot of children in families have the same problem the kids watch too much television and ",14
9765, the spare time of the kids flys away one major problem ,1
9766, that there is too much cartoons is that there is a lot of advertisment between the diffrent episodes those advertisments arent boring for the children because they advertise ,6
9767, toy or the following episode so ,20
9768, going outside with their friends the children stay at home and keep watching television ,1
9769, most of the time the children want that specific toy which they have seen in that advertising thus the mother or the dad has to buy it ,20
9770," the kid wont stop asking them to buy it 
lets assume advertising  would not be prohibited than it would be ",2
9771, the same like it is now the children would not waste their time watching the advertisments and would ,0
9772, go out and play something with their friends so without advertising  the families would save money and the children would go out more ,1
9773," watching television
in my opinion it should be the same like it is now because it seems like we have a balance between families and children which are positive and negative influenced of advertisments from the television",17
9774,"in a time periode of consuming and buying is advertising in television and other medias a vital thing the more people you can reach with your advertising about your product the bigger is the amount of money you earn now the question isif television advertising should not be allowed  in age between 

at ",15
9775, this kind of prohibition would be a nice protection for the innocent little childrens but in the opposite a big part of costumer would missing there kids ,12
9776, in age  make a huge part of the potential consumers another ,23
9777," is that the children can grow up without any bad influence the television is like a big irritation machine too much information for this little brains it is like a kind of manipulation the big companys give the direction how the kids should play and life 

but ",17
9778, everyone should make his own thouts about this statement in my opinion this idea were a good thing for protection the new genereation but ,12
9779, a big fail for our economy,23
9780,regarding the statement television advertising toward young children aged  should not be allowed ,13
9781," make my opinion clear in the follwing essay

i do ",21
9782," television advertising can be very aggressively pushing and there are real geniuses developing always new ways of manipulating the human mind
",10
9783, that it should be forbidden to advertise for ,11
9784, clothes for these children addressed towards their parents ,9
9785, grown up people and even older children who are ,3
9786, developed have to deal with this because advertising ,11
9787, is not a bad thing just not for children who are not ready to judge and order these situations as the children get older with their personal development they will ,12
9788, learn how to deal with aggressive advertisements and there is no way of protecting your child of advertisements everywhere it goes ,16
9789," there will be advertisements on most ways it will go regardless whether it is the way to school or to the supermarket we see it all the time but advertisements in the television are not as hard to ignore as outside the supermarket because a jumping colored little guy with his voice bursting of excitement is clearly more catchy than a salad now 50
psychologists are powerful people in this society ",11
9790, they can practically manipulate people with the researches they did and science being ,23
9791, progressing opposing that we have children of approximately three years who do not even fully know what they are doing and just want to have fun watching television ,17
9792," being confronted with the result a mastermind of advertisements created i do not really think this is fair

concluding ",11
9793, addressing television advertisements toward children aged  years should be forbidden to simply save them in such a helpless phase of developing ,13
9794,nowadays it is normal that ,19
9795, children at a young age are confronted with diferent media ,6
9796," telvision but is this really the right way to educate a child or just a way to keep it busy 
of course for many parents television is a great help in everyday life often parents have to work much ",17
9797, in an era where it is normal that ,19
9798, have to watch their child if the child watches television it is ,17
9799," much easier to handle things because the child is quiet and doesnt disturb
nevertheless televion can ",17
9800, have bad infulences for instance it is much harder for children to understand life in a community if nobody talks to them or plays with them anymore they ,7
9801," get isolated and dont understand the rules on that a community is based on 
on the other ",19
9802, you could say that television can ,10
9803, help children to understand life and to get educated nowadays there are many programs that teach specific things in live on a level wich is made for children still it stays a machine and is not a human being ,8
9804," that it isnt the same as if the mother explains them to her child 
referring to this the child might feel very alone and sees television as the only sense in life or thing that counts this can lead to a strong need of television which is very dangerous if it gets stronger thouought the years 
also on television many things are shwon that are not specificly for children many programs for adults show torture and other strong actions that are exaggerated and dont show reality this might lead to a wrong picture of how the world works and can ",17
9805," be very dangerous 
furthermore it is proven that children who get in much contact with television or computers are not as smart as children who spend their time playing outside or reading a book because of the electronic waves the brain gets infected so it is proven that if you spend too much tiome being confronted by electronic media you will get sick over time or at least wont be as competitive as you could have been without the media
to sum up i come to the conclusion that television ",17
9806, not for little children but you should be very careful what the child watches and how long television can ,17
9807, lead to danger for the child phsically and pscycologically if television is the only thing the child learns to know this can influence its live in an extremely bad way from time to tiime it might be helpul and ,17
9808, has the impact that the child learns how vto behave in a world that is leaded by eletronic media but mainly ,8
9809, that television has more bad influences on little children than good ones as you can see in my argumentation my proposition is to focus more on the child itself ,17
9810, that it feels loved and not just to keep it quiet ,18
9811, that you have less work because with a child there comes the duty to educate it right,9
9812,education depends on the parents following a freedom of advertising should be guaranted because the parents should know what their children should watch on tv or buy at the gasoline station especially ,13
9813," they are under 5 years old they have to be watched the government cannot take a part of the responsibility of education from the parents away a law in this direction would be a statement against the liberty furthermore it would mean that the governemtn does not trust its parents the people television advertising should concern every group of consumers how they people behind want that 
clearly children are more affected by advertisment than adults they do not have the ability to evaluate as much impressions than the adults ",13
9814," although the adults are not resistent against commercials too the opposite is the case moreover the advertisment for products which are thought to be used by children concern in almost every case the parents the parents buy the toys or the shampoo with the unicornsmelling foam 
the interdiction of advertisments conercing the under five year olds would not satisfy the needs of its initiants they want more than that whats ",16
9815," will it be forbidden to make television advertisments for people over 65
the children should better go out ",13
9816, watching tv the best weapon against television commercials for children is a playground,14
9817,we all know the feeling the feeling of being in charge of children and having to look ,7
9818, theyre protected without us hovering over them helping a person become a grown and able human being is quite the responsabilty its a feeling of power and uselessness ,7
9819," on where to draw the line on situations that might change a childs perspective or behaviour situations like television advertising are escpacially controversial some mothers and fathers say that ads that are s small children should not be alllowed because they create an unnatural urge to buy things that arent necessary for life that this urge could cause finacial problems that follow the childrens life until they die 
the ceo of the ellison advertising agency clayton ellison disagrees very strongly he says that children of that age were not capable of understanding these ads the way we adults do children could not evolve an urge to buy things until later in life and that these ads were simply to show different toys that they could select 
a study of the university of oxford proved the opposite of mr ellisons theory psychologist tested children and their behaviour befor and ",2
9820, watching television ads for toys the study ,20
9821, documented the later life of children that watched or didnt watch television ads the results state that televions ads do ,14
9822," have an influence on the later life and a persons finacial status children that watch televions ads are more likely to have money problems and an excessive consum later in life 
in my opinion ",14
9823," analyse whether televison advertising  should be allowed or not 
in this time televison advertising plays a big role in our communityin young ages children were confrontated with televison advertising ",14
9824, they often understand nothinga big ,3
9825, is that children were often manipulated with televison advertising when they see a product in the televison they often wanted to have these products for christmas or as a birthday present as a result they often get angry ,2

in my opinion televison advertising should not be allowed for young children children need to form their own creativity and should not be able to buy some expensive things young children should not be able to watch to tv that longfurthermore they should only watch children tv channels where advertising plays not a big role in my youth i was confrontated with television advertising and ",14
9830, wanted to have the cryziest things which often were very expensive today i am glad that my parents did not buy me everything,9
9831," explain why television advertising is not good for lillte children


on the one hand children in this age are in a really important developement they look at their parents and copy their behavior the advertising at the tv is often extremly overdone but the children think that it is reality but it isnt they cant understand what is fiction and what is real ",14
9832, need no tv for a good developement furthermore they need social contacts in kindergardens and the love of their parents the parents have to give them a way to go then they get older they ,24
9833, could look tv the advertisiung is ,10
9834," not good because the children want their parents to buy more toys and they could be sad because they realise that theyre poorer against the other kids

on the other ",20
9835, i can say that the tv advertising is not important if they look tv ad or not they wount understand anything they dont know what the advertising want from them the advertisising is ,10
9836," very good for the economy they get more money and the people getting more jobs


all in all ",23
9837," that young children shouldnt look more tv than 30 minutes per day but the advertising is the same bad as the normal tv show children should play outside and go into the kindergarten but advertising shouldnt be forbitten it is important for our industrie and for our economy because the parents buy more toys for their children

9844,advertising has always been a crucial part of marketing if you want to sell your product you have to advertise it properly a topic that is frequently discussed ,11
9845, talking about advertising is to what extent it should be allowed to influence the potential buyers for example publicities where you only show a delicious looking bottle of coke for a fracture of a ,11
9846, have been prohibited because they influence the consumers only on a subconscious level a common statement is that advertising s young children aged  should not be allowed this essay will outline to what extent one should ,13
9847," to this statement

young children dont know much of the world they havent ",7
9848, developed an ability to think critically this explains why it is ,21
9849, easy to impress them a child might see a toy that is looking great in a publicity on television what immediatly causes the child to develope a desire for this product the imagery featured in advertising can often be misleading or even wrong ,0
9850, very high expectations towards the product these expectations are probably going to disappoint the child ,20
9851, it can be argued that because these children are ,7
9852, very young the influence that television advertising has on them might be much smaller than we think young children will only look at the imagery ,14
9853, the content of the publicity because of this it really is not clear how big of an effect advertising has on them and the parents should ,16
9854," control the television habits of their children they will know whats going on and can talk and explain things to their children

in conclusion we can say that advertising s young should not be prohibited because there is no real reason to belive that these children will be damaged by wrong expectations and influence of the subconscious the parents will notice it if their child is influenced in a wrong way and ",14
9855, they can just take them away from the tv even if childs are influenced to make their parents buy something because of advertising they will just make another experience ,14

another good ",6
9886," is the variety this means that children have different activities in their freetime they donâ´t only play with old stuff dolls stattdessen they watch a nice and informative tv show about dolls and learn from it nearly everybody should know famous disney movies like german shows called barbie 

watching tv at a young age is very good because everyone should go with the media and digital world if children often watch tv they will maybe lear how the technology works there are kidz like a realtive young child who are able to play with a tablet and he knows how you come from the offline modus to youtube and starting movies 

but ",6

if young children watch a lot of television leeds this often to become dumb or lazy or beeing a passive person why children will sit in front of the tv and only watch on the display without talking to other people or doing something by themself furthermore children can become more and more passive in they later life if they watch too much tv

9905,"whether advertisements by television should be allowed to be shown to children between the age of two 2 five is an often discussed topic
in this essay i shall explain why it should or why it should not be allowed

children between the age of  ",13
9906, lack the ability to differentiate between righteous and bad advertisements that advertise products what i mean by that is that children at that age do not know if what is said during the advertisement is true or false ,2
9907, lack the ability to judge if they should believe what was said or not on the other ,3
9908," as young as two definitely shoul not be allowed to watch television all by themselves at all it is the parents job to help their children at deciding what to believe and what to ignore that could cause future adults to become too naive which would result in them believing whateve lie they are told


another ",17
9909, is that in todays society it is important to find customers at a young age ,23
9910, transform them into possibly future customers who would help the organizations keep up with the market that might include using cheap tricks ,23
9911, promising them things that they cannot keep as stated above the children are not able to recognize those cheap tricks and might really be tricked into believing that whatever is said in advertisements must be true which certainly is not another great example are toys for young children that in television look amazing and seem to work perfectly fine sadly thanks to my own experience most toy reclams in television are ,2
9912, heaviliy modified that children are extremely disappointed by the ,7
9913, that their toy does not work ,3
9914," as previously advertised

however not all advertisements are bad but most of them show us what kind of new products are being developed which certainly is not bad at all thanks to advertisements we are able to decide between various products of the same type ",11
9915," cosmetics thanks to them you might actually find something for your health that you have been searching for for a long time which is actually good

as a conclusion to whether television advertising should be s young children aged five to two or not i would prohibit that for the sole reason of children not being able to judge what is the truth and what is not as many products on the market are just a way to scam people that are too naive and belive anything you tell them stopping that would certainly lower the amount of people buying products that do not keep what they promise which would filter out the bad products that circulated thoughout the market",2
9916,"i wouldnâ´t say that advertising toward young children shouldnâ´t be allowed
on the one ",16
9917," it is true that young children arenâ´t that grown that they are easy to manipulate and advertisings are doing thatalso the  children will mostly say that they want this product and tell their parents to buy it

these were all negative ",2
9918, you can say that it doesnâ´t harm anyone because the children arenâ´t allowed to buy something ,4
9919, they are dependent on their parents to buy the products they want in this case the parents are less dangered to manipulation by advertising than their children and ,2
9920, they should know which product could come quiet in handy and which not in addition to that the negative ,23

all in all i would say that it doesnâ´t harm the children or the parents in a very bad way but it should be made clear regulation for advertcampaign by not telling lies to take away possibilities of manipulating the children in a bad way

my ",15
9926," thought to these theme was yes why not because i do not remember myself watching television at this age so i figured that parents could just not allow their children to watch television like my parents did the problem would be solved 

but ",17
9927," i realised that nowadays children do watch television at this age and they get manipulated by advertising a good exemple for this manipulation is that advertising directed to little girls are often very pink and very ladylike advertising for little boys are often colored blue or just dark they show weapons and they are often filled with violance and that is how they get pushed into our societys gender roles

children at this age are easy to manipulate so ",14
9928, advertising s young children should not be allowed of course you do not have to watch it but you cannot ignore it because sooner or later you will come across advertising and just not watching television is not the ,14
9929, i have to say i do not appreciate advertising towards young children but ,16
9930, we need to get alongwith it that is how this world works ,19
9931,why do we think how we think if we look at our past our childhood we get remarkabel influences in evereything that we do or watch or even not do the question is where the strong influences come are television is today a big part of our and our childrens lifes younger children are stronger in focus ,17
9932," my question is should it be forbidden to focus on younger mostly faster influenced children

younger children are fast and for a long period of time influenced by movies and other things they watch in tv their parents role as the bigest part of their life and the ones which wach for the right place they get in society is more and more endangered by the things they watch in television if you take at look at this ",7
9933," of view we probably should not allow this sort of advertising 

but if you change the spot on the pleasure the children have if they watch tv and what they can learn by watching those hidden advertisments which their could never learn them because they simply do not have ",14
9934," much resources financaly and of time

my personal opinion is split up one way ",23
9935, they often do not have time to learn their children everything they have to now for their futur life so i would not change anything the parents have ,9
9936, enough influence on their children and ,7
9937, it will never change my generation already had television and advertising trough it and we did not become ,10
9938, wrong to say it would not allow the same for the following generations ,21
9939,"the television is a big influence in almost everybodys life many of us watch television everyday included young children in television advertising they are many unfiltered and uncensored informations television advertising  is not good for the psychical health of the kids 

firstly young children aged  should not watch television on a daily basis or even better not at all its not good for their creativity and there are many ways to spend the day better and healthier in front of a television nobody makes friends or learns new skills like jumping of a swing in a park there is ",14
9940, much that gets lost of life if they are in the same room all day long it is a huge hype to let the children in front of a television with some snacks and a soft drink ,17
9941," giving them something healthy and going to a playground or in a park that is not a good childhood 

the ",24
9942, is that the advertisement in tvs is often pervert or just for the eyes of an adult children that see this kind of advertising may do not understand them or really get them but their brain is like a big sponge and gets all the information ,14
9943," it can not deal with them it influences them more than many people think it is critical to let the children watch all this stuff and not to care about what they do understand and what they do not

lastly in many television advertising they give a wrong picture of something if little kids see them all the time they are going to believe everything the advertiser says and preachesthey are going to want everything they see and that is stress for the parents too there are many grownups that get addicted to buying things from television advertising it is sad that this is the bigger problem than children that get influenced everyday by bad campaigns and bad deals between the newest episodes of winnie the pooh

to sum up small children in such a young age should not be watching television advertising at all it is acceptable to watch television if they watch a movie or something that is made for younger people without any advertising it is really frustrating to see that more and more children do not go outside to play with their friends and become a television addict without even watching a good program but advertising it would be ",14
9944, easy to not watch advertisements at all bur people are ,10
9945," lazy and they often do not care however this can not be healthy and can not be good for a childrens psychical health at all to watch television advertising this young 
",17
9946,a lot of children spend most of their free time watching television and with that a lot of advertisement the companies soon realised this and started to make advertisement specifically for children studies show how the mind can be subconciously influenced by advertising and to make such advertisements for children is a ,0
9947, dangerous thing because the brain of a child is ,4
9948, to be fully developed being less responsible than their parents the children often go to their parents to beg for the advertised product even if the product is absolutely no fun to have or play with the children will believe it is if the advertisement makes it look like it does some companies have made advertisements where the sound has a higher frequency which only the young children are able to percieve and ,2
9949," delivering a subconcious message to the children without the parents noticing 

the parents are the ones who buy the pruduct ",2
9950," but it is the children who are used by the companies to sell them using young children without the right judgement to evaluate the product is unethical and is a mild form of child slaveryalthough the children are not forced to do anything against their will the companies make them believe that what the children want is their will but in reality it is just the advertisement controlling them 

brainwashing children and taking their freedom of choice just for more profit is morally wrong and should not be allowed",2
9951,television advertising an industry involving a lot of money it makes sense to advertise products for all ages but is it okay to direct it toward young children can they distinguish between it is only an advertisment and it is real ,16
9952," this essay will give reasons for why television advertising should be allowed to be  and why it should not

when watching anything on tv about one ",15
9953, of the time is filled with commercials lots of people of all ages watch tv including young children in the age between two and five kids are easily influenced by what they see and hear and they can not ,14
9954, distinguish good from bad and real from not real very well if a young child is watching a tv show to learn something and all of a sudden an advertisment comes on telling the child that it needs a new stuffed animal that can make sounds the child will likely not know that it is just an ad and it does not really need the stuffed animal if the advertisment has a lot of colors and music the effect will be even stronger this means that the ,11
9955, time the child mentioned is in a store with its parents it will definitely want the new toy and because it is in the age ,20
9956," with a little bit of whining it gets everything it wants the parents will buy the product for the son or daughter taking this into consideration the advertisement should not be allowed

on the other ",16
9957, considering the paragraph above it can be said that television advertising  is the best advertisement it is most effective because the children are ,0
9958," easily influenced as soon as the children grow older they start to think for themselves and they will realize that the advertisements are mostly exagerated and do not show exactly how the product will be so if a company wants to sell a specific product it will have the most sucess if the product and the advertisement is directed at young children

considering the two ",0
9959, with the statement that tv advertising  should not be allowed ,15
9960, above with the mentality of producing commercials for kids it is expected of them to watch tv this is wrong ,14
9961, because kids between two and five should be playing outside with other kids and should not sit inside watching tv,24
9962,"television advertising  shouldnt be allowed because theyre easily to be influenced brutal images and gender stereotyping
especially at a young age children are extremely easily to be influenced by any possible thing as an example they look up to people they want to be like them they see things they are fascinated about them and soon theyll want them anything could be presented on tv with some glitter pretty colors and some catchy music and the younger children would get hyped about it and many of them are likely to use the strategy ",15
9963," just scream until my parents get me this this means that one of the main reasons why it shouldnt be allowed is that younf children are very easily influenced
another ",12
9964, against television advertising towards children is that there arent only advertisements for good and bright things on tv there are ,13
9965, for example there are already pretty scary toys for young children robots dangerous animals aliens on tv theyre presented fighting against each other going to wars and killing each other it might seem catchy on a short advertisement many young boys or ,20
9966," girls get too hyped about it fight and competition shouldnt be brought to children in this way brutal images dont have a positive effect on them growing up 
also a very important ",6
9967, why television advertsising towards younger children shouldnt be allowed is because of the usual stereotypes we see young girls playing with blonde dolls and pink castles boys building roboters made out of lego or playing soccer we never see a boy carefully brushing his barbies hair or a girl kicking the ball ,13
9968, playing outside but this is a highly important ,18
9969," for young children to be and become who they really are and not who theyre thaught to be 
in conclusion television advertising  shouldnt be allowed because theyre very easily to be influenced brutal images and gender stereotypes 

",13
9970,to direct children with your advertise can be very effective you create a dream in their little world and they will do everything to reach it they beg their mother and father they think the whole day of it and ,0
9971, until they are adultsthey loved gelly bears ,24
9972, they were kids they loved the funny pictures in tv and they will buy for themselves even gelly bears ,20
9973," theyre standing in front of a big big sortiment
so ",19
9974," its a big manipulation behind television advertising wanted to be seen by little kids its not a fair step of the concerns and its a way to change childrens live only to get some more money when children cant get what they are introduced to want they become very sad or even mad its like all the other kids around you have this special toy and only you poor child arent able to get it
but in the other way around ",2
9975," that it should be forbidden people who are designing advert should decide on their own if they want influence the childhood of many kids if it is okay to drill children to like something only to have some more profit and if it would be forbidden the big firmas will find another way to get what they want but the parents should learn to avoid to much tvlooking of the children they should give them an alternative for example go for a walk in the nature and spend time with their children or they play a game with each other
so ",14
9976, i would not want to forbid advertising toward young children but it would be great if the social environnement is organized that the influence is very little to this young kids ,16
9977, is already an actual topic about which many peaople have many different opinions we already pay taxes to whatch television ,15
9978, why should we pay even more with our freetime which is used ,23
9979, whatching advertisements obviously it is a ,11
9980, that there wouldnt be as many private programms as we have now to whatch and ,21
9981, already this is a controversal topic even ,21
9982," it is not the question already this could easily fill a whole school lesson to talk about but the actual topic is if advertising s young children should not be allowed
in my opinion its not about the question if it should be allowed or not if i was a worker in an advertising company i would need to ask myself if it is even worth it to produce advertisements towards children at such a young age because normally these children are not even allowed to whach tv and ",13
9983, they are i feel pretty sure that they wont focus on the advertisments in ,11
9984," they would just focus on other stuff in their environment during the advertisments 
but there are people who could be affected by these advertisments for example parents or family members of children in that age who want to make a present but again as a worker in such a company id have to ask myself if it is worth it to produce advertisments for such a small amount of people who could feel affected by these advertisments
for conclusion i have to ",0
9985, its definitively not a question about allowing or not allowing its about the value for the company if its worth it to advertise it or not in general i would ,11
9986, say that where we are able to not use any more laws about allowing or not we should try to avoid crating them and just leave every human being doing what he feels like,21
9987,some people think that television advertising  young childeren should not be allowed they say that advertising for children aged  leads to a more developed tv programme for kids and ,13
9988, a higher risk for television addiction if a child ,17
9989, watches tv where there are lots of brakes with boring advertising for adults children will be more likely to stop watching tv but if there are lots of advertisements which kids are interessted in they wont get bored as fast ,17
9990, theyll keep on watching tv the opponents of television advertising for young children are concerned about more children spending their time watching tv ,14
9991, playing outside which is important for the developement for a kid these people ,8
9992, fear that children will get more unhappy through advertisment they think that it is very important ,2
9993, for little kids to learn to be happy with what they have ,8
9994," than to experience a lack of consumption goods
others say that television advertising improves a childs developement they think that its better for  children to see tv advertisments for their age than adult advertisements these people ",14
9995," say that child advertisement will lead to a better economy because more kids beg their parents to buy them the products and toys that they had seen in tv
in my opinion television advertisement for children should be prohibited ",13
9996, that it is important for children to learn to be happy with what they have than to experience a lack of something i ,8
9997, encourage kids to play than watching tv and i am afraid that television advertisment for kids will lead them to get more used to watching tv,14
9998,"television advertising toward young children

nowadays the television programs are often interrupted by advertisments young children between the age of  often lack of experience and do not know how to interprete them the advertiser takes this ",14
9999, and produces adverts just for young children the aim of the whole process is that the children make their parents buy something as soon as they see the product in a supermarket it is quite mean to produce advertisments like this ,2
10000," should it be forbiden

personally me i can see the problem in spaming those children with television advertisments to make use of them the children are ",12
10001, young but they actually already get to know the preassure of manufacturers the television advertisments give them a feeling that they have a lack of something beacause they dont have what the children in the television are having obviousely not everyone needs such things to be happy but an advertisment always looks ,2
10002, nice  and the people in the advert always seem to be ,11
10003," that they want to experience this feeling themselves
it is ",3
10004, kind of stressfull for the parents for example ,4
10005," you have a child which is five years old and it comes shopping with you it maybe starts to scream out loud in public just because it saw something that was recently in an advert if you cant stop your children crying you maybe ponder to buy the object just to keep your childrens mouth shut

in conclusion the adverts arent good for children neither are they for the parents it would be the best ",2
10006, to just not allow these adverts to exist if they are forbidden the children are able to go into a magazin and decide on their own wheater they are interested in something or not without the influence of television advertising,13
10007, we turn on our television there is advertising famous people are promoting things ,10
10008, that we get almost forced to buy them advertising is like manipulation and should not have an affect on children ,2
10009," not on young children should television advertising  children aged  be prohibited

firstly television advertising is  every group of people everything is getting promoted by everyone this is what makes the things attractive because if everyone sees the same television advertising almost everyone gets affected by it and wants to buy it

secondly television advertising has not always a good influence on people supermodels and actress with a body and face with no mistakes have an influence on ",14
10010," young women and they are like a role model this is a prove that everyone is at least getting a bit influenced 

thirdly small children will grow up with the perfectness of life which the television advertising shows and even more childrem aged  are not supposed to watch tv furthermore children remember a lot and if they see toys and plays every day on tv they will always have the feeling which a lot of human beings have to not posses everything what they want 

so ",6
10011, they should not allow television advertising toward small children they do not realise the affect of television advertising ,13
10012, they grow up it is going to have an influence in their thinking and behavior nevertheless it is not proven but tv makes people stupid ,17
10013, that we should protect our children from bad influences and do something about it like prohibiting it  ,12
10014,if a child is difficult to handle the parents nowadays just put them in front of the tv and ,1
10015, they are quiet it is a absolut unstressful ,19
10016, wellknown the television business produces loads of advertising towards the children which are hold quiet at the tv in these advertisings the children are beeing spoken to directly they see things ,17
10017, toys and afterwards they are going to stress the hell out of there parents to get these things shown in the advertising so it is contraproductive if the children just get more dickheads if they watch tv the only reason to protect children from this huge advertising business is to do it like the old way never let them watch tv at all just go out with the children in the forest or to the playground children have to move themselve have all the childrenillnesses and get really tired in the evening ,14
10018, they are going to be fat and become autistic or they have other disturbances so my personal opinion is that you should never let your child watch tv advertising and do it the normal way somwhere outdoor ive never watched tv ,14
10019," i was young we didnt even had one
",18
10020, of advertising toward young children dont have to be bad ,16
10021, if the advertising has a negative result on young children does ,16
10022, depend on different conditions which ,21
10023," now take a closer look at 
there are probably several reasons why advertising toward young children shouldnt be allowed young children dontt know as many things about probable advertising products as ",16
10024, teenagers they can usually not decide if an advertisement can be taken totally seriously or if the advertisement isnt really realistic ,16
10025, in an idiomatic meaning and cant be taken literally this could be dangeours if the advertisement tells you things like this and that will make you fly or give wings to you because some young children might think that they will really be able to fly which can cause accidents advertisements ,11
10026, have a bigger influence on young children than on adults because they dont have an own opinion about many things in life ,7
10027," they are easier influenced and manipulated than adults which is actually one of the goals of advertising 
there are certainly ",2
10028, positive things about advertisements like ,11
10029, that you get to know lots of different products ,23
10030, for children that dont have a big knowledge about the variety of things you can purchase ,20
10031, they will notice that there are many different things ,3
10032," in only one area which will probably widen their horizon 
in my opinion advertising toward young children should be allowed but its important that their parents know what kind of advertisements their children are watching ",16
10033, that they could stop their children from watching things that may have a bad influence on them i consider it important that parents talk about advertisements with their children to explain them the differences of the things that are communicated in the advertisements and the actual reality ,0
10034, that advertisements can even be a good thing if you watch them from a critical ,11
10035," of view which is something really important to learn for the whole life  
   ",21
10036,"avertising
there has always been a great controversy about television advertising in todays society although advertising through television has declined ",15
10037, the rise in the online market television advertising is ,10
10038, one of the biggest markets out there but should there be an age limit to ,12
10039," companies should be allowed to advertise their products to kids

sales men know that the best ways into the wallets of parents are their children it is such a big opportunity that some advertising companies focus on children only but the advertisers go ",16
10040, promoting their products to even the youngest of the young television shows use the time between childrens shows to capture the attention of a kid to the newest toy and ,0
10041, the kids bother their parents with it this is ,24
10042," too small to actively recognise an advertisment and maybe ignore it also kids want anything that they can get as soon as they see it and it looks fun

although it might be an unfair tactic to show advertisments right ",16
10043, you know there are mostly kids watching it ,6
10044, is an open market and parents have to decide ,9
10045," to let their kids watch tv and how to prepare their kids for the constant advertising that is going on in our world also this might be an opportunity for parents to show kids that they dont always get what they want and that they cant always have what they see on tv

for my part i would not put an age limit on television advertising mostly for the reason that a parent has to decide ",14
10046, their kid is old enough to watch tv and ,1
10047, it might be better to keep their children away from it and do something else,12
10048,"television generally can be a very dangerous subject children are very likely to copy what they see on tv but that is the case no matter if its normal tv or advertisement 
so now we can ask ourselves is there really a difference between publicity and normal programs people might argue that directing the advertisement at children will destroy their imagination and influence the capitalistic behaviour of kids the destruction of childrens imaginations is a wide spread problem in todays world thousands of small children already own a smart phone and are using it several hours a day they cant entertain themselves anymore they always need this little electronic device to accompany them 

but isnt it already too late to save children from electronics televisions computers and smart phones dominate our world materialistic things are everything that counts in many countries they helped to revolutionize the modern world ",14
10049," many of us would be nothing without them so many people depend on them they characterize who we are today

i ",21
10050, think that forbidding advertisement towards children is useless even if theyre not influenced by the advertisement they will ,13
10051, be changed by the hundreds of shows that appear on the screen daily so i ,10
10052, with the statement on top ,18
10053, we should redefine what electronics mean to us and start being less materialistic ,23
10054," to that statement

in my opinion it its absolutly bad to directed televisoin advertising to very young people thay are ",14
10055," young and are not able to have they own opinion they are not able to say anything against this advertising and for the parents it is bad to they don not want to buy this products but can not say something against they childrens 

you hvae to keep in your minde that chirdrens are absolutly more ijnfluenct by this commercial 

atthe ende i have to say that television advertisng for young kids shoud not be allowed it is toeasy to influence the young kids

on the other ",16
10056," we have to say that young kids are not allowed to buy this thingd from the commercial  but they con influence their parents

so television advertising direct toward young children schud not be allowed

",16
10057," with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed
its not okay for the young children that they are directed by television advetising because its not good for their eyes head heart and body its better ",13
10058, they are doing anything else for their age and would conzentrait on thing for their age in this age the children want more and more television advertising and you should not be allowed this probably ,14
10059," they will live ther life like they see in the television advertising and that doesnt work 
when you allowed that television advertising  they will porbably learn something for their life and would see what they should not do in their life they will probably know how they can help anyone ",8
10060,"
                                                                                                                  
 the following essay handles with the statement of using advertising s young children             
                                                                                                                  
 young children can be influeced easily but young children are not able to buy the products shown in the         
 advertisment themself so the indusstry doesnt earn money directly children have to ask their parents ",0
10061,"    
 and  a parent can say that he or she doesnt want to buy this product                                           
                                                                                                                  
 otherwise you will need to keep in mind that children may influence their parents ",9
10062," a parent will buy 
 this product without needing it often these products are very expensive and shown better at the televisio     
 that  they really are so the industry earns much more money with it than with products for adult all in all  
 the industry uses children to earn their money with them young children are too easy to influence               
                                                                                                                  
 to come to a conclusion the tlevision advertising  should be allowed because     
 they  cant buy the products themself                                                                           
                                                                                                                  

",2
10063," wih the statement
children at such a young age are very impressionable
everything they see will have a lasting impact on them and determine what kind of person they will become ",7
10064," they grow up
so it is the special responsibility of every human to give a child useful and age apropriate information that will help its development
it must be decided carefully what kind of material we want our children to look at and what will be advantageous to reaching important developmental milestones
giving this responsibility into the hands of corporations whose primary goal it is to make the most profit is very irresponsible
corporations dont care about the development of children
for them a child is nothing more than a potential customer
so how can we trust a corporation to make content that is helpfull and not harmfull to the childs development
an advertisement would not give the child new insights and information about the world but would force an idea made by a corporation onto them and could potentially distort the worldview of an impressionable child to ",16
10065,"a young child is used to watch tv almost around the clock so they are confrontated with a lot of advertisment
now the statement was made that showing these advertisments  shouldnt be allowed 
a child that is aged  is naive and believes almost everything for example a child thinks that santa does really exist etc 
when these childs are watching an advertisment in the tv it can have an effect on that child these ads we are talking about are shown on channels for kids 
so these ads are dealing with childfriendly topics these could be about toy horses and mostly playing with barbie 
these childs who are watching these ads are willing to buy those things except their parnets have to buy it
",13
10066," that its good to avoid showing these kids advertisement in young age because they have to grow up with no nonparental influence these children are innocent and they should have the chance to grow up like that
  ",13
10067,television advertising is much more comfortable for the teachers the young children can learn and the teachers can watch but i think the childs donâ´t ,14
10068," with this because they are too young
 they donâ´t want to watch at the television learning films they want to watch funny and real movies
 in this age the television can ",6
10069, hypnotize the young kids and they ,24
10070," with and watch the whole film without speaking
 in this young age they must play and play with other childs they must learn from humans and ",24
10071," with their statments i think they are too young to watch tlevision in this age they must interact with humans and each other they can play in the nature and do some activities
they can watch a film with breaks and a teacher how say what happens ",24
10072, they donâ´t understand a topic they canâ´t ask the television they must teached by humans ,6
10073, they watch filmsthey want the same thing at home and ,3
10074, the perents have to buy it and than they play not outside they play alone at home,1
10075,"television advertising directet toward young children

nowadays nearly every child has the opportunity to watch televison and use laptops tablets and smartphones on each of this electrinical devices advertising is  they show the newest toys ",14
10076," that the children get attractet to them but should this and mostly television advertising be allowed or not

on the one ",16
10077, 10 years ago children didnt watch ,6
10078, much television like nowadays so if a child which is a lot at home sees television advertising with toys and it despritly wants them it could be a possibilty for the child to go and play outdoors and do physical activity children had to learn to be resistent toward television advertising because in the adulthood the situation will not change they should learn to see which other things exists ,14
10079," to say sometimes no to them

on the other ",19
10080, its the responsability of the parents to look ,12
10081, their children and to pay attention that they dont watch too much television children are influented by the television advertsing ,14
10082, if a child aged five is in the kindergarden and it sees another child with the latest toys it could get an impression of beeing lower than the other child it gets a wrong impression of himself and the world for single parents with finanical problems television advertising could be a problem because their children want the newest things which are mostyl very priceful and maybe they cant afford them so parents are ,14
10083," influented by advertising and are put into pressure because they want to give their children everything they desire

in my opinion the ",2
10084," against television advertising toward young children are more important because children are too young to decide what they want they dont even know that they are influented by advertising and they have no chance to escape from them because they are everyhwhere present children should be more protected
",13
10085, that television adverts arent good ,10
10086, if you just want to watch tv adverts are just a bother you want to watch your favourite series or a good film but at the most exiting scene they throw lots of adverts at you when youre old enough you can just ignore them but a child at the age between two and five mostly cant so for their sake adverts should be banned but its not that easy you cant just ban adverts from tv most free tv programms earn their munney throug these adverts so ,14
10087," keep broadcasting our favourite shows thei need these adverts
so ",10
10088, that adverts are a bother and not particular good but the tv programms depend on them ,10
10089, you cant remove them from tv,10
10090, have to watch television advertising these advertisments often speak to a certain target group which is most likely to buy the product speaking of young children as a target group we must think of their innocence ,2
10091," only gaining money

firstly it is important to mention that young childrens life experience is very small ",8
10092," adults in other words most children arent able to differ between real interest in a product or simple manipulatin caused by the advertisment which means they could become advertising victims and get the unrealistic need to buy a product

on the contrary the ones who actually buy the product are adults and adults should have got enough life experience and responsibility to say no to their kids ",2
10093, they want to buy something completely unnecessary on the other ,3
10094," if parents become the bad guys who dont buy their children happiness  because of television advertising  this state has to be considered as highly sceptical 

however most television channels only exist because of advertisments and they must advertise for the specific target group that watches them if we stopped allowing television advertising s young children ",13
10095, children channels would fade out as not many grownups watch them they have to direct their advertising towards children and if they couldnt they would ,14
10096, stop existing or become pay channels and pay channels is ,10
10097," not what we want

as a result it is very likely that free children channels will stop existing if advertising s children becomes illegal however it is morally not acceptable and we should kill it burn it with fire and make it extinct sorry",13
10098,"the question wheter television advertising  shoulld not be allowed is complicated
on the one ",15
10099," you dont allowed the television chanels to show television advertising
but ",15
10100, see a toy in the television advertising thats were discribed as very cool they believe that and want one no matter how much it cost there we are at an ,20
10101," children in this age dont know how to handel with money they dont know wheter its expenciv or not they only want to be cool with the newes stoff 
last but not least young children dont care about the danger of the ",24
10102," toys in the television advertising it would be shown as easy to use but mabye it isnt that easy and than the children hurt themselfes with it 
to sumerise ",20
10103," children aged  arent in that age to dicide whats good for them and whats not
 ",4
10104,in the following text i discribe you my own meanig to televison for children i the tv are ,6
10105," you look at this you make most right but children have a chance to watch things they not good for the children in the tv is all day and all time any to see children can watch the hole day and this is very dangerous  because the children watch tv in the time were athoere people play handball or some other thigs 
when children look news at the televion or documentions it can be good for the children because they know ",17
10106," more actually thing about the world and about the people this can be very helply at the school or annywhere 
televions arenâ´t ",6
10107, important hwo school or sport but itâ´s can be a small factor at last television is very different there are many different programms and very different shows many of the shows and of the programms arenâ´t important but some like a newstime or ,17
10108, are important in this timeand ,21
10109, the children watch the right things itâ´s very good for school and the knolge ,6
10110, children watch tv but the parent must controll the programs and the time,17
10111, that young children should not watch television too much and better not at all they need to go outside to get friends do some sport or just move ,13
10112, playing with friends but if they watch television they are easily to convince by television advertising because they realy belive what it tells them and ,1
10113, it is not realy moralic to try to convince young children who are too young and naiv to realise that not everything you got told in television is true this might be a problem for many parents the kids want to have all these things and they have to buy them and it is not easy for parents to convince their children that they do not need all these things but if parents let their kids watch tv in this age they have to deal with it and ,17
10114, it is about to be a good parent to tell your kid that not everything in television is true so ,6
10115, it should be about the parents how they rule their kids and not about the law to make television advertising forbidden,13
10116,"now i have to discuss abot the statement if television advertisnment  should be allowed or not
first of all young children ",13
10117, children aged  get easily fooled by advertisement in television they see something what have been shown there and want their parents to buy it for them but on the over ,2
10118, if there was no advertisement for children everybody would be upset about that too ,16
10119, you canâ´t make it right for everybody and to be clear i ,19
10120, think many children at the age of two wouldnâ´t really understand advertisement in television because they are just too young and ,14
10121, not all children want to play with the same type of toys ,20
10122," that would be a big problem too that has to be solved 
in the end i can say i have no pronblem with television advertising for young children because i donâ´t really care not offensively but i mean i donâ´t have to watch it ",13
10123, against whether it should be allowed for television advertising to be  some ,15
10124," can be found being for it
for example ",21
10125, all thats what an advert is ads are supposed to convince consumers to buy stuff or to have a specific opinion about something while young children wont be convinced to have opinions simply because it wouldnt matter as they are ,16
10126, young there are ads trying to convince them to ask their parents to buy new toys ,0
10127," this is not bad in any way because as said thats what adverts do age does not matter in this case
also the one paying money ",16
10128, advertise doesnt care whether childs or adults see it as age is not of importance and the ad should convinve anyone who sees it regardless of age or gender while there may be some differences anyone can play with remotely controllable toy cars ,16
10129,"
finally the one advertising cannot control who sees the ad he may change the time the ad is being shown ",11
10130, in some cases this can result in less people seeing the ad the one advertising is not responsible for young people seeing it so again its not a matter of ,16
10131," whether its  or adults
on the other ",24
10132, of view its simply wrong to convince children to ask their parents to buy something that way adverts can be sure of some of the stuff theyre selling being bought they could raise the price up to a ,2
10133, anyone would think the product is not worth the money still because children between  dont have a relation to money ,9
10134," they will ask their parents and some parents will buy the product because their kid asked them
furthermore other adverts are ",2
10135," reviewed as ethically wrong because of categorizing if theres one bad ad the other ones too must be bad
in the end its just wrong to convince young children to ask their parents to buy something if the product can be afforded with the money they get from their parents regularly ",16
10136, its alright for ads to do ,11
10137, companies like kinder ãœberraschung or other little cheap candies can convince children to buy them without any doubts thats what the money parents give their kids regularly is for,2

my ",15
10139, is that there are a lot of children which are addicted to tv or other electronical devices they donâ´t want to meet other kids or play outside because they only want to watch tv because they think that the tv is their friend often itâ´s very easy for children to change the tv shows and switch to programms which are not made for kids young children get influenced easily by thing they see in the tv ,17

television advertising let people feel like they need this product but they didnt

televison is paid by advertisment ",10
10147," you cant cut the advertisment off the screen for the children because the televison need it its normal to say its bad for the children but the question is better advertisment and tv for the children or no advertisment and no tv
so ",14
10148, its better to have advertisment and tv because advertising is everywhere and young children are on plattforms like youtube and something like that and this pages are full with advertising ,11
10149, it makes no sense to cut off advertisment from the tvshows for children,13
10150, pro and contra the telivision advertising with children one ,14
10151, contra is that mostly the parents decide their children be in the advertising and it is not the wish of the child the parents who do something it that way are very interessted in the carier of the child ,0

10153," some children are interessted in this world and it is fun for them some of them really want to do this and their wish is to be a star the way is very hard but they wanna make it because it is their dream

in my opinion that should not be allowed because the children can not be children they are too young to think about that and this life this step is mostly too hard for them ",12
10154, most children who think that they really want this say this only because it is the wish of the parents and dont know what it is like to life like a normal kid,20

the young children wouldnt even notice the advertisement sometimes and they wont be shown that much on the tv
also will they forget what were in the advertisement they are very young ",16

i dont see a good reason why it should not be allowed 
the children are ",13
10162, much of the advertisements and they dont watch that much tv they should play with their family or friends and not watch tv when some families have problems with it they just need to not allow the children to watch tv ,14
10163," with this statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
children in the age of  shouldnâ´t watch television with advertising directed to them
if children see that the think itâ´s true 
because they often think that what adults and older persons say is the right
if it is with toys the children whats that and they can be manpuled
for example is kika its a kids channel on tv and there are only movies und no tv advertising  
kids gets influence through it
but there are some kids channels with werbung if there are toys the kids say that they want it and ",13
10164," some parrents wants that they only look â´kikaâ´ because they shuldnâ´t see the â´werbungâ´
",19
10165,"television advertising s young children is a topic i am sure about that there are a lot of different opinions but should it really be banned

what could be possibly a good ",13
10166," for television advertises for young children children will see the commercial and probably think hey that toy looks like a lot of fun i want it so they will ask their parents to buy it for them television advertises for children are mostly about new innovative toys getting new toys will have the child to think about how to interact with it which will boost is creativity and for today it is important that children learn how to be creativ because once being and adult with no creativity you will be having a hard time also denying the wish from the child will show that the child can not always have what he wants this will teach him a good lesson

but television advertising directet towards young children is not always that good let me explain why

first of all children from age  are not really good at making decisions they lack the knowledge and experience when they see an advertise for toys or other attractions they will mostly want to have or experience it because in the advertise it always looks like much fun and children ",0
10167," want to have fun all the time the children will constantly ask their parents if they could buy it for them when they say no it will lead to the child being angry and sad becuase some children are pretty stubborn at that age they will make the parent buy it for them that attitude could possibly lead to the child staying stubborn for a longt time maybe even until his adolescence the child will think that if he gets what he wants by staying stubborn he will choose to keep that attitude such small things can change a lot on the outcome of a child

10177,to start of actually small children under the age of five shouldnt even be watching tv so it wouldnt be raisonable to have advertising dirrected toward small children i ,13
10178, think that firms should think their concept over if they think they need to advertise to small children than younger kids have a different kind of thinking they ,16
10179, have problems with knowing whats dangerous and what isnt wachting tv is ,17
10180, a kind of taking away their fantasy because you already give them a picture of brands they sould like brands want to fund a connection to their products very early than the possibility that somesone changes the product if hes already used to a special kind of product is very small in my opinion its important that our society doesnt start a hype about advertisments for children those small things are our ,2
10181, its more important that their brain doesnt get a damage of all that crap they saw on tv now if i would ask you what would your answer be if you were a firms cio would you tell me that the brain of children wouldnt be influnced by the advertisment because that would be a lie and even we grownups get influnced by advertisments so why already start at the age of two years old in what kind of society sould this be normal ,14
10182, at the moment doctors are very worried because children at the age of one and two cant talk the way the sould they know very little words and do you know why its because the parents are on their mobile phone all the time or are wachting too much tv so why advertise to children the parents are the ones who can understand what youre trying to tell them,12
10183, advertisments get even grownups hucked to a brand it causes the lose of the fantasy of small children and it damages their brain if they even watch tv my personal view on this topic is that nobody sould have the right to advertise to children ,16
10184,"television advertising  should be allowed

the productmaker needs new clients
they are making adverting for young children because they are a big group of humans little children often want new things and the parents buy them the new things because the children have ",14

television advertising  should not be allowed

the children want everything what is new in the advertising and this can be very much
children are very easy to manipulate and the productmaker know this they know that children are going to want everything that is new and looks cool or sweet the children show their parents the new things and the y buy them that but not everyone has enough money for buying all the things from the television

children shouldnt watch television alone
when they are looking television with their parents they can teach the children to not wanting everything from the advertising advertisinds arenoften for the right age they are to loud or colorful

i find that advertising for young children shouldnt be allowed
they should be more outside and play there something with theire friends when they are outside they cant listen to the advertising in my opinion advertising for them is not good because they want everything but not all parents have enough money for buying all the toys that make the children sad young children cant understand the most advertisings they are to colourful loud or not really for their age parents must keep an eye at their children all the time 
 

  
",14
10188, children aged  couldnâ´t really dicide what is good for them ,24

10190, they areâ´t able to buy something their self ,3
10191, they could only say their parents what they want ,9
10192, this advertising is not fair to the parent because the children have no idea what money is and they arent able to dicide if something is cheap or expensive they would only be a pain the until they get what they want another ,2

personally ",2
10201, that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed ,13
10202, it isnt a good idea to let young children being manipulated they cant decide on their own and ,12
10203, should be protected by the law instead the companies can make advertisements toward the parents of the children who can already base their opinion on real raguments and arent manipulated as easily ,13

10206," not good for their healthy for me it should not be allowed

the hobby of little children is playing playing everywhere they are with food toys flowers with every thing they have if they are only watch television they do not play it is not normal

also because they watch to much they can not develop their creativ thining they have no exercises in makeing handcrafts the young children watch sometimes a creativ programm but can they do it ",17

10212,"should television advertising direct toward young children not be allowed
its a controversal topic ",13
10213, its hard to say because there are two ,18
10214," against each other

at the ",19
10215, you have to think about the effect advertising has on young children they are too young to think critical about the things in the television they see something new and ,14
10216," they want it no matter if they need it or not so maybe its hard for parents to handle this
the other ",9
10217, is that maybe things in the television advertising arent ,10
10218, good maybe they are insecure or discriminating or something like this young children cant form their own oppiniion on something new they are easy to influence they orientate on older people ,7
10219," the adults of the advertising 
but ",11
10220," the children are too young to buy these things too when they see something in the advertising its hard for them to buy it by thereselfs maybe its even impossible so parents have a controll on the things the children buy and they even have a controll on what the children watch in the television so its there task to save their children 
and ",2
10221," against the banning of the advertising is that there are concerns which need to make money its the fault of our society that they need to make advertising even for young people they need to sell lots of things and its easier to influence young children maybe its not totally a moralic but its a notwendige thing 

so ",13
10222, television advertising toward young children is okay because our society make it notwendig,13
10223,the question if young children should be allowed to watch tv is a discussed matter which the parents should consider and think about early but the advertisement companies clearly ,14
10224," do have children as their target audience the question wether or not this is a good thing might be heavily discussed too
the ",12
10225," thing to say is that mostly those advertisements quite appropriate for children the often do publicity for toys or dolls so the danger of heaving ones child wanting inappropiate things would be small if it was only watching those publicity but there are other kinds of publicities shows and series on the tv that a four year old kid should not watch and that is the real problem while wachting the shows and publicity that are meant for children the children might get to see other things that are not meant for its eyes and with those childmeantpublicities the advertisement companies lure children to the tv 
what is more children will want to possess the products which are being advertised for so parents will have to buy the toys and dolls children can develop a weak way of a shoppaholic and if parents are not able to afford those toys the children might get angry or maybe even bullied ",14
10226, the get one or two years older and children are already being transfered an ideologized picture of the society dolls are a good example ,24
10227," our society nowadays is advertising for a lot of unhealthy lifestiles and trends like the trend to be really skinny dolls are really skinny too eg barbie and with those dolls children at a very young age are already confronted with the idea that the skinnier and more beautiful a person is the better it is this is very unhealthy
but ",2
10228," there are some useful products being merchandised for products which can help kids with learning the alphabet or preschool learning or even products that simplify the daily life for children who have physical ord mental issues so it can turn to be a good thing if children get this product 
all in all i ",0
10229, think that advretisement for young children is not the best thing beacause children should not watch ,6
10230, much tv and dangers and problematic matter can come along with the publicity ,10
10231, it wasnt meant to be dangerous in the ,4
10232,the opinions concerning television advertising  aged  are different some people think it should be allowed to direct advertising toward them and some people dont think ,13
10233, its important to take care of ,18
10234," of view

in television advertising things are shown positively to make people buy them if a child watches an advertising ",0
10235, for a new game it could ask its parents if he or her could buy it but there are many different advertisings on television ,20
10236, the children could want more an more of these things which are shown in the advertising in addition children should actually dont get the chance to watch tv all day its important for the childrens development to go outside ,2
10237," or to get a good preparation for school in the kindergarten the advertisings are created funny and intersting for children to influence them
the people who sell the things of the television advertising just get ",0
10238, of them they get a lot of money for their products beacause many parents buy them ,2
10239," their child asks them to 

im not quite sure about my opinion concerning this topic on the one ",9
10240, its okay to allow television advertisings  but ,15
10241, it could have a bad influence on them there are some things in the tv that are not nessesary for children of young age ,17
10242, its more important to prepare the children for their future life and a good education of course they should be allowed to watch television ,17
10243, its not too much to have a bad influence on them,19
10244,television advertising  aged  should not be allowed this is a very controversial topic and there are some ,15
10245, which support this statement and ,21
10246," some which attack it

 first of all ",21
10247, television is a bad thing for young children if they start early with watching tv they will ,17
10248, start early with playing computer games or playing on smartphones and ,1
10249, if they cant than theyll wanna do that against that you could say that in our generaton its very important to come very early in contact with this things because they are used way more often than in other generations ,7
10250, its not worth to spend your youth on this things and not on going outside another ,24
10251, against the television advertising  is that the parents of the children will advertise their children less if the television does that also the television doesnt advertise the children in individual ways ,13
10252, the indivuduality of the children will get a crushing blow which could be a problem because for everyone is a specific advertising the bestand ,12
10253, it will be hard for this children to find themselves later on also the children could misunderstand the advertising of the television and become later on very bad people ,17
10254," against that is that if the children have parents which are bad people the television will probably advertise the children better than their parents would

all in all ",13
10255, the advertising of  young children should just be allowed in the case of bad parents or in the case that the parents are just ,16
10256, rare at home that they couldnt advertise their children enough but ,0
10257, its a bad thing because the children will lose their ,12
10258, years on the tv and not on the world outside and will get less information about their surroundings and will ,24
10259, many friends in addition to that they will become not ,19
10260, open minded if they just sit always at home a good human can advertise a child way more better than a machine could ever do,9
10261,it is very controverse issue if children should advertising directed through the television there are many people which thnik children should not watch television at all because they just get manipulated but there are ,14
10262, people which find it ok or a good idea ,3
10263," children watch television just to keep them calm or to lern things like by dora

at one ",17
10264, many people say that telivision manipulate children and that advertising would make the situation even worse how often run childre ,14
10265," a commercial to their parents and ask them to buy this things furthermore young cildren are easy to influence and thats very bad espacilly because children should rise in a safe area without any commercial influences

at the other ",2
10266," why should companies advertising parents for staff whitch is espacilly for childeren and is it not the responsibillity of the parents to safeâ´â´ their children from commercial influences so if parents do not want that their children get directly advertising by television than keep them away from it or just let them watch non advertising channels

in my opinion it very hard to descide ",14
10267, children were advertising for things that are useful or intelligent like a shining football but it is very bad ,0
10268," the commercial just advertising crep which is extreamly expensive and the main funktion of the commercial is manipulate the children but i know that it is hard to say which things are useful and which not which are good commercial and which are bad 

we see there are positive and negative ",0
10269, of advertising children directly through television and that it is nearly impossible to say which is a manipulating commercial for unusful things  ,13
10270,nowerdays children cannot grow up without any sort of device or television in many cases ,17
10271," children donâ´t get what they want they just watch tv because this is an easy method for the parents to calm them down the parents canâ´t force what exactly their children are watching in some cases the children watch ads which are not really appropriate for them the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed canâ´t be managed but it can be forced by the parents i think with the following reasons

the televison thinks that showing the ad is going to make the children wanting to watch the movie or whatever it was advertised for the children convince their parents to go to watch the movie together because they donâ´t want to miss it in the moviebreaks there are new ads which are doing exactly the same again they get addicted to the television the children watch more and more tv as they grow up they learn a lot from it but ",14
10272," the parents canâ´t gurantee what exactly their children are watching and the things they see is what they wantet them to see anyway the parents cannot control their children 
there should be a better way for the parents to control this part of tv one way to sort the problem could be that for money you can buy a televisionprogramm that doesnâ´t show any ads then parents would have the ability to see what their children are watching there is already some sort of adfree chanel with netflix you can set in the settings that you want to have a childrens channel the children can now only watch childrenmovies 

so if parents think it is necassary for their children to have an adfree channel they can buy it but if they are fine with the ads they just leave it it is the decision of the parents what they do with their children",14
10273,in our todays life the television is a big part of our world weâ´re always surrounded by series movies variety shows and ,10
10274," by bright coloured most stupid advertisements everybody reacts different to them but how do little children between two and five react to advertisements which are just exactly for them and should it been forbidden to make advertisement for such young persons

of course itâ´s not okay to make your money with producing irrelevant stuff for little  children and manipulate them ",16
10275," much that they couldnâ´t think about something else
but ",3
10276, that little children do not understand what advertising means and i actually think i would regulating what my child watches in tv and iâ´ve got the money i donâ´t think that my little child which absolutely hasnâ´t got any idea what money is could buy whatever it wants ,13
10277, i would know if my child used to have the super bright fluffy flying unicorn which spies glitter ,20
10278," you squeeze it 
maybe there are parents who are buying their child everything it wants to have but thatâ´s actually not my problem

",9
10279, that the television advertisements for children between  should be allowed because ,13
10280, the parents decide what they want to buy or not and the children are ,9
10281, much to young to understand the world of capitalism,23
10282,is it a good idea to advertising direct toward young children this is the question i will manage with ,16
10283, against this topic is that the children gets antother ,12
10284, of view of one topic ,21
10285, it could be harder to understand themitâ´s hard for them ,19
10286," they only see and hear them  beacause the teacher could explain it better
otherwise the students could learn it better ",8
10287, they see it and doesnâ´t hear it from the teacherwhen you have a bad relationship with the teacher it could be better for some students ,7
10288," they donãÿt have to talk them much with this teacher
",8
10289, that it isnâ´t a good idea is that the relationship between the student and the teacher couldnâ´t get better ,4
10290, you canâ´t speek to them ,18
10291," you have a problem or something else
on the other ",18
10292," the teacher television advertising s  they learn the right things beacause the teacher search for them to show the right ones to teach them the students

",10
10293, it isnâ´t a good idea and it should not be allowed because for it would be harder to understand the main topici think you hear lots of things and donâ´t know one of them are imortant and noti ,12
10294, think itâ´s more stressful to learn it on this wayi ,18
10295,we all know advertising in television the good ones as good as the bad ones but we all know what theywant us to do they animate us to buy their things the most of us know this by their own experience and maybe ,11
10296, because our parents warned us more or less at the age of 12 or earlier we start to make differences between what do i really need and what they want us to need but as child we cant make a difference mostly our parents say to us that these advertisments are dangerous so obviously as young children we cant take decisions ,2
10297," they are influenced by advertisments
because of this and the following reasons ",11
10298," with the statement 
also because for adults advertising is not usualy a good thig clear it shows us things to buy that maybe make our lifes easier but we should not forget why there are ",11
10299, manyadvertisements obviously they want to make money with them and if people want to make money and they see an opportunity for it they are ready to make many things to get it for example they ,11
10300, dont refuse to make advertisments for young children ,16
10301, they know that its kind of unfair against the child as said ,12
10302," that its not worth it to support such things that poison our children
and last but not least there already exist such laws which say that its not allowed to make advertising for alcoholic beverages because of all the alcoholics they argue that an alcoholic cant really controll his addiction so its like with little kids who ",13
10303," cant really controll what they want 
kids get too easy influenced by advertising and they can hardly do anything against it ",2
10304,"small children running around on the playground in hot pants and having fun stores like hm use advertisement directed to childrenbut is that oversexualised advertisement or just advertisement okay should it be allowed to manipulate our small folks

children want what they see its in their nature so it is a natural process to want all the things the tv provides to them toys clothes and candy but this has a big influence on the rules of their parents now they are more or less forced to buy their kids thingsthat arent good for their health or their behaviour in the future children strive things they wouldnt if there wasnt any advertisement
nevertheless kids get to know all their possibilities they have they get to know whats new on the toymarket or what they could do with friends and family if their parents dont want to let them see advertisement they could cut out the tv of their everyday life

for me the big question is if advertisement affects the children ",14
10305, they arent capable of deciding and knowing if this is really something they want because they like it or if its just something they want because they see it on tv in my opinion advertisement is a big problem in our society not only children even adults get manipulated by it and they are older and it seems like they should know what the purpose of the stores are in conclusion ,2
10306, tvadvertisement for children and adults,14
10307,"the topic of advertisements for young children aged  is very controversal 

some people might find advertising directed  completly fine and dont see a problem in that the children get to see eg toys which they might like ",16
10308," they can wish for them this is very helpful for the parents because this way they know what to get their children and wont buy things they wouldnt like

but thats not the only opinion on this topic others might argue children of that age dont know what it means to spend money on certain things ",9
10309, they got something they wished for because they saw it in an advertisement they might want something completly different the ,3
10310, seeing something else on television they dont understand why their parents wont buy it for them ,2
10311," it will make them very unhappy this way the children dont learn to appreciate the presents given to them 

for me ",9
10312, a reason to be against advertisements for children is that children will eventually be confronted with ,16
10313, they grow up anyways its important to avoid them for ,24
10314, television advertsing directed to such young children shouldnt be allowed ,13
10315," discuss whether television advertising towards young children should be forbidden or not 
its getting earlier and earlier that  young children are confronted with media and ",13
10316," the tv so why shouldnt there be advertises directed to this group 

the children would ",16
10317, be happy about advertises that are made for them and they could perhaps identify with the acting persons on tv and it is possible ,10
10318," that these children could find some heroes in these advertisements who are now important persons for them and maybe an aim to be like them

another ",0
10319, is that advertises are made for each age for adults for seniors for teenagers this could be interpreted as something which is not just ,11
10320, these children are much too young for this sort of media or visualisation they just dont understand the meaning and are confused and my imagination of a good childhood is definitely different than amusing with tv advertising these children should play on the playground go outside to grow up correctly it is important for becoming are normal intelligent child and for their future not to watch too much tv in this time even more important ,6
10321, is that these young children are not consumers ,2
10322, and dont make their own decisions about what to buy or not  and ,3
10323, that their parents are not that much interested in these kind of adverts and what you shouldnt forget it that these children are well influencable and can not build their own opinion ,16
10324," and this is definitely a risk and unfaire to use them for their product 

in the end i come to the conclusion that children shouldnt watch tv with adverts ",14
10325, made for them but this should be in the responsibility of the parents like education ,9
10326, that these adverts are very useless for children of this age i dont support forbitting these adverts there are definitely more important things to forbid ,13
10327,the followinf statement is television advertising aged should not be allowed in my oppinion the age two and the age five is a big difference,13
10328, you have a two year old children its not good ,18
10329, you watch tv with because theyre a lot too young ,1
10330, two years old children have better things to do than watching tv,17
10331," exploring new things and grow uptelevision did not help to grow up good
when your child is older",8
10332, five yearsmy opinion isthat it is okay,4
10333, they sometimes watch tvbut just for a half or one hour per dayfive year aged children have a lot of other and better thingsthat they can do in their lifea better option what they can do is meeting friends from the kindergarten and play with thembut in my oppinion it is okay and ,1
10334," the kinds can watch tv for one hour in the eavening
 a good example is my babysitter jobthe kinds are allowed to watch tv for one hour at the eaveningthe kids are seven yearsfive years and three years oldin this situation its okay that the three year old child watch tvbecause they do it all together ",17
10335, thatthey know that they have to go to bed ,3
10336," that conseqeces are a good option
kids should learn that television is not ",17
10337, good for them like reading a book or play with other kids another option is that,1
10338, two childsthe older one is six years old and the younger one is three years oldthat you bring the younger one to bed for a little sleep ,8
10339," the lunch and in this time the older child can watch tv for a moment
",1
10340, the consume of television in this young age can be really bad for the children,17
10341," a bit with the statement
",21
10342,the queastion today is wheather it should be allowed that television advertising is  or not in the following the question will be answered ,15
10343, lay all the information down and ,18
10344," explain my own opinion 

on the one ",21
10345, it would be possible to create the advertising in a nice and friendly way ,11
10346, that the children woundnt see the advertising for adult like half naked woman on the ather ,16
10347," kids would be more manipulated by the advertisement than they would be atherwise 
it would make it more easy for the comanys to sell their stuff but the parents wouldnt have the same amount of sayings in what kind of products their child should use than befor 
another ",0
10348, for the allowense is that chidren see advertisment every day ,11
10349, it wouldnt make any diference but directed directly against it  is the ,21
10350," that children already see to much advertising every where they go there is no need to make it worse by producing advertising especally for them 

to sum up the positive ",13
10351, about advertisement just for kinds are that the shops have a better groung to sell their products and the negative ,11
10352," is that the children will have to grow up around it and get manipuled it want they need and what not
in my opinion advertising  children should not be allowed it is an anessesary manipulation and it forces the parents to buy their children stuff they wouldnt have atherwise sometimes they dontt have anough money to by all the things the kids want ",2
10353, the child would be devestated what could have benn prevented the wills of big concernse shouldnt be more worth than the savety of our children,9
10354,"the  question is if television adversting directet toward young children should not be allowed
you can see this ",13
10355," on two different sights in following i will try to cover these to pages

if you were a buisnessman you want that children see the adversting cause you want to get money and that is easy with kids because if they see the adversting in tv the children ask their mother if they get these toys ",20
10356, and the mother said nearly ever yes to make the child happy on the other ,9
10357, are the parents they dont want that their kids see adversting in tv it could be a reason that the fear of poorness is there or they want to safe their childs for the industrial society another ,17
10358," it is really hard to turm off the screen every  time there is adversting in television
i understand the problem with kids and adversting in television but i think it is really hard to realise
kids with five years are able to watch alone tv and you cant safe the kids from the adversting and where is the difference between television advertising and advertising in the city 
all in all i think its not able",14
10359,"specific advertisement for children

everyone knows the feeling ",16
10360, you start your tv and and the ,1
10361," thing you see is advertisement everybony hates it but this is how the televisionprograms are financed but is it right to advertise specific stuff for children who are  years old in the brake of a childrens show

this should not be forbidden especialy not for childrenadvertisement because they dont have the economic power to the advertised things anyway they cant buy the advertised stuff and are ",14
10362," not influenced by the advertisement 
this is not true at all firstly children are very easyly influenced by  advertisement and ",16
10363, they themselves dont have the needed money to buy those things most certainly the parents do so indirectly the children ,9
10364, influence the parents and push them into buying stuff they saw on tv this may sound a little unplausible but as child one has a big power to stess parents and ,2
10365," to make them have mercy 

most of the advertisements contain brutal things that arent made for childrens eyes and ears so in these spots the violence somtimes is even praysed ant this would lead to a new generation whose priorities are set wrongly 
but if you thinke these advertisements are bad you couldnt allow your child to wacht any tv because even ost of the series and films that are approved for children contain violent actions anyhow children dont have to watch tv at all and if you are a good parent you would check that what your child is watching is   okey to be watched by someone his or her age this would elminatethe necessarity of a law against advertisments directed to children

but those rules are there for films and series so why not make any for television advertisement one is not allowed to show any advertisement which might be missunderstood in the cinema and ",14
10366," for children it is very difficult to whithdraw themselves from such advertisement and to live an easy uninfluenced life 

in the end ",16
10367, it is important to define this law more clearly is all advertisement vorbidden or only violent ones this has to be cristal clear ,15
10368, can even start talking about the necessarity of such a low so ,21
10369, a law against advertisements whith violent contente would be important ,15
10370,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

in our modern world people only talk about the problem with smartphones and how children and young people are distracted by them
people do forget about the old electronics like tvs

most young kids even babies are watching a lot on television with it comes the advertisment
is advertising which is already adressed to the young kids tells them to buy it showes happy kids with a lot of colorfull stuff to play with this advertisment is part of the introduction into our consumeristic world the kids start to ask their parents right ",14
10371," they just saw in the commercial if they can go and buy the just seen toys an because the parents are nice they buy it for them the kids are tending to want more and more
things to play with dont let real happieness follow human connections bring the real happieness into our life
another ",20
10372, seen over a long time it is not good for the eys in the ,4
10373," kids want to watch the movie series or a documentary they dont plan to watch the commercials but they are made to watch them without the commercials children would have more time to do other activities like going outside and playing on a playground with their friends
television over all is not a bad thing documentaries and other shows can teach kids a lot and advertising is a normal part of our economy 
i can say that ",14
10374, i was little i always used the advertisments as breaks to go upstairs and already brush my teeth ,11
10375, the documentary i can go directly to sleep i did ,18
10376," beacuse my parents tought and raised me that way
after all i can say that advertisment should not be allowed to children at the age  advertisment for older kids and adults should be allowed maybe advertisment should not be allowed on kids channels
in my opinion this problem is mostly about the education kids get from their parents and about government regulations which should be there to give kids more time to play outside",13
10377,"why television advertising shouldnt be s any young children

they are everywhere advertismenst on busses billboard and at home on television its almost impossible to avoid them they are at some ",14
10378," annoying and contain false information they make promisses to sell great things but actually they just try to make money out of everything 
if grown ups allready do think that way about advertising ",11
10379, why are there advertisments s young children ads are unrealistic and this could affect children by making them believe toys exist that have abilities they sure cant have hotwheels ,0
10380," they make it seem like their racing cars are able to drive by themselves but in real life you have to push them forward this leads to disapointmentif children dont get exactly what they wnat they will be pretty sad
 at some ",20
10381," ads are just hiddious the products are shown as something magical that can make things youre dreaming of come true
marketing is a good way to plant in image of somthing in our heads that is not true for us grown ups its easy to differentiate the false advertisment from the product itself but children ",0
10382," toddlers have a great imagination and for them everything is possible it does not seem impossible for them that a toy that claims to have the ability to make itself turn invisible is not true they cant make out the diffrence between a lie and and ad thats the problem kids are going to ask their parents to by them things that are not as fun as they seem on television plus they are really expensivesome parents that allready have trouble keeping the household going will have few more essues having just enought money to feed your children and pay the bills is hard enought but with the children being exposed to magical toys on tv its hard  to turn their begging down everytime they ask for new toys the kids have broken hearts about toys
thats how i felt whenever my mother told me we dindt have enought money for toys
",20
10383," advertizing towards children should be banned
",16
10384,today i write about the statement  television advertising  should not be allowed one the one ,15
10385, that television advertising could change the mind of a child but one the other ,0
10386, that they couldnt buy anything alone ,3
10387," they want to

everybody knows that advertising is a piece of our live everywhere we go somebody wants to advert for something and we all know that there are good reasons for it because it is very easy to change peoples opinion about something and to change the mind of a young child and make them to want something very badly is just more easy than to do it with adults so i dont think that advertising directed  is fair because they are easy to manipulate
",16
10388, it is okay to advertising toward adults because they know about advertising and the ,16
10389, that it is very manipulative but ,21
10390, young children is kind of unfair otherwise there is the ,12
10391," that young children cant buy expensive things by themselves theire parents do it for them and they arent manipulated by the advert that is directed  so they have choice to dont buy 

in the end ",0
10392, that televison advertising  young chidren isnt a good or fair thing beause of the manipulation ,10
10393, but there are the parents who have the choice ,9
10394, there a more badly things than it,18
10395,todayit is the easyest thing to let children looking tv you dont have to tidy a room full of stuff whitch they let laying around and where you probably can slip out on them the children stay in one room where you dont always have to look ,17
10396," them they dont run away
the most important thing for children to discover the word by touching everything they should look at things feel the surface of diffrent things smell how they are children learn by dooing and playing with real stuff ",8
10397," you have to tidy up the room at the end of the day
children dont have to sit in a room the whole day they have to run around ",8
10398," they get hurt and get dirty outside discover the nature learn what they are able to do learn to do things at their own and get confidence
",8
10399, the most importent thing for children is playing with their hands to learn to feel ,8
10400," smell and lookingtv should not be forbidden but parents have to allow to their children in a normal way 
the childhood in this time and the years ",12
10401, times forming the personality the creativity confidence and behavior,8
10402,television advertising is an important thing to reach as many people as possible every big company uses this type of marketing but young children are very easy to manipulate ,14
10403," should it be illegal to direct television advertising toward young children 

our society is full of products and consum we should keep our children safe from this type of consum which can be bad for them they should not define themselves over brands of clothes or some new toys also kids of poorer people could be bullied in kindergarten because they havent got the new toy or something like that television advertisment shows what everbody should have and whats trend in the moment this could be the trigger for these children to define themselves over this trends there is ",14
10404, a new barbie on the television and thay say that the cool kids should have this barbie this could be a trigger for mean words to kids that dont have this new barbie another opinion could be that there is nothing negetiv about television advertising the advertisment is just an information about new products and the parents can decide on their own what to buy on ,2
10405," is that those young children arent interested in toys of other kids they arent this mean like older children 

in my opinion television advertising for young children isnt a really bad thing we all grew up with those advertisments its important that the parents make a decision what to buy and what is good for their child in addition to that ",2
10406, say that a children shouldnt watch this much television ,17
10407, that the advertisment effects the behaviour of the kid ,0
10408,"many children are watching movies or other specific things for kids on television in television it is totally normal to put advertisings in breaks between series or movies but should it be allowed to advertising 

in my opinion advertising toward young children should be allowed but in a specific way the advertising should be about school things or games with a background to learn something the advertising should not be about killing other people with swords or about pistols which shoot water ",14
10409, annother reason why advertising toward young children should be allowed is that the channel where the kids watch their movies or series should be a channel for kids only and if there would be some advertises for older people that would not be ,16
10410," good especially if there are advertises about death or somethingelse

all in all i think there is no reason that television advertising  should not be allowed ",15
10411," itâ´s about games with some background to learn from them books or computer games to prepare for the elementary school itâ´s better than  normal advertises where they show how to shoot at eachother with a pistol or fighting with a sword in the garden the advertises should fit in the channel genre so if itâ´s a channel about history or stuff like that there should be advertises about antique swords thats totally fine but if that channel is for kids only they should play advertises  the young children
",0
10412,"today there are many advertises for toys and stuff in programms for children but is that okay
in the following text ",16
10413," discuss if it should be allowed or not to produce television advertising direct toward young children aged 

for the economy it is a very good way to earn much money ",13
10414, they produce advertises in channels for children like disney channel ,0
10415, the reason for this is that the cildren if they see well looking toys in the advert they really want to have that and ask their parents ,20
10416, that until they will buy it for them so you can say that the big concerns programmed something in the head of the children and they are a part of our economysystem but ,9
10417," children should just be children they should play outside and should start living their lives without being part of a system where everyone just want to earn money 
another reason for this ",12
10418, of view is that children should learn to be happy with the things they have and they should not always want to have new stuff just because it is in the television adverts this is ,2
10419, bad for people with less money than others becaus they canâ´t efford to buy their children all the new things from the adverts and than the children become unhappy to avoid this  itâ´s a very good idea to donâ´t allow television advertising  ,14
10420,sould television advertising  be allowed with this statement the advertisement for things ,15
10421," very young children would want is questioned 

first of all i want to refer to a core value of our swiss constitution freedom freedom is a very important core value of our society and by prohibiting television advertisement directed  this value would be severly affected erverybody should be able to advertise for any products he thinks are worth advertising for be that a product for very young or very old consumers
secondly ",13
10422, young children like advertisement and they are often very fascinated by the colorful and often funny ads advertisement ,0
10423," doesnt force the children to do anything therefore it doesnt really make sense to forbid something that simply brings joy to some people
furthermore young children like to get their ideas for their birthday and christmas wishes from magazines ",12
10424," why not from television

on the other ",1
10425," one has to consider that young children are very easy to manipulate with a less experienced and educated mind they are a easy target for advertising and can more easily fall for subjective and incorrect advertisement
also the children who saw those ads can afterwards be ",16
10426," obsessed with the presented article that the could try and force their parents into buying that product for them
finally by allowing television advertising  on secretly supports young children in watching tv it is scientifically proven that tv is not good for young children and can really hinder their development is a thing ",14
10427," bad for the childs development really to be supported

to sum up there are pros and cons for ",4
10428, one carefully has to evaluate those ,21
10429, to make a decision in my opinion freedom as a core value of the swiss constitution is to be promoted as much as possible also advertisement musnt just be a bad thing it can amuse and bring joy with regard to these ,15
10430, i am definetly for allowing television advertisement ,15
10431,"today i would like to discuss the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
",15
10432, its a statement with different opinions about in the german television is a channel ,10
10433, for children named kika when i was a child i watched this channel ,6
10434, im watching tv its great for children to learn new words or see new things so ,1
10435," its a good way for kids to learn new things without to much konzentration because they learned it in a funny way and i dsagree with this statement
on the other ",8
10436, with the statement because today there are ,21
10437, many channels or series for kids without a good backround and children cant learned from this there is a difference between series where kids can learn from and series where they can be dumb from when we are talking about these series or channels i ,6
10438," with the stamement
i cant ",18
10439, i was a child i sometimes watched tv and the channel and the series was very good and i cant say that television have a negativ influence to me but i cant say if this is different today because i doesnt watch there channel anymore but i believe that we live in a world with ,17
10440, much new things and changes ,18
10441, maybe now there are some bad series on the kids channel and i think these series should not be there anymore ,6
10442,"should televison advertising be allowed for young children 
first of all we have to speak about the different types of advertises and that i am talking just from tv channels for children there are three categories i would say
the ",14
10443, one is the type of advertises that shows trailers of new series or ,11
10444, a specific show comes in tv this type of advertise is ,10
10445, okay for children because they can see which show comes ,6
10446," and is thought for information the children can see which show they want to see and which not but in special the parents can see wich show is good for their children 
the ",6
10447, type of advertises is the one that shows new toys and games for the children its the typical advertise in this adds the children get manipulated ,16
10448, they want to have this one new toy the problem is that there are infinite new toys wich means infinite new advertises the children get manipulated by loud voices that say how good this toy is blinking lights that gets them focused on the add and in the advertise are other children that seem happy and look cool with that toy this type of advertises should not be allowed for children because they cant realize that they get manipulated they are just too young ,2
10449, type of advertises on tv channels for children is the one that advertises for websites or apps the websites are filled with a lot of simple videogames for children that arenâ´t good for them and can make them addicted the apps that are shown in the tv are often ,14
10450, called paytowin games where you can pay real money to get bonuses or other things it is often very expensive and ,18
10451," the parents logged in their children with their accounts the children can accidently pay a lot of money from the parents without even knowing that this is a terrible type of advertise and is just existing to get money from people that do not even know what they are doing
 
to summarize my text i would say that ",16
10452, advertises are bad for young children they get manipulated without even knowing it so if someone can decide for children to not look advertises in tv ,14
10453, it is on the parents they have to be informed what theyr children are watching and decide what is good for them and what is not ,17
10454," with this statement
that statement isnt in my interesting for students is that fun and  
students has ",21
10455," more chance in english but teachers are inkompetent to make the leason intesting we learn poem and to writing a sonnet and not to the gramm   
statement is for schools very intersting

so im ",8
10456,"should television advertising not be allowed 
",15
10457, with this statement because the young children should not watch all the day television the children need the television ,17
10458, they watch it every day ,6
10459, that young children need real friends and not the television where they doesnâ´t learn something when the television make advertising directly to the children they canâ´t make a social structure and be alone the television want to make more shows where the children can learn math or german but this doesnâ´t help to learn it at a television show better is it ,17
10460, the family and friends learn together with the children i donâ´t know good things what a television is doing to humans the television make it young children hard to live in the real world ,17
10461, they watch all the day dump shows only to become ,3
10462," television advertising  should not be allowed beause the children which are looking television became the feeling that they must have everything what they see in the televison later if they are older it could be that they order things which they cant pay that could be very dangerous also its more difficult for adults to satisfite their childrens 
a big playmobil tower chatch the eyes of the young children now they think every tower should be ",14
10463," big an high as the tower in the televison advertising if they wish a tower for birthday they will be sad if the tower isnt that big 
but ",18
10464," i think television advertising can have positive affects the children learn in young age how it is to have wishes and how they have to handle this wishes maybe they can wish the things that catched their eyes for birthday or they have to save money they learn the use of money also they learn how to react if the wishes dont come true 

",14
10465, with this statement because the show often pictures or spots withes arent for children and those advertisments often spells for children a big trouble because they in their ,16
10466, years of life and if they learn bad things from advertisment ,0
10467, their character will build on the bad things and the childrens will have in their late life a bad and hard lifea child in this young ages often will everything buy the things wich he saw in the advertisments and goes crazy if his or her parents wouldnt buy it for themin advertisments they often show dangerous scenes from famous movies and the childrens often imitade the fight fight scenes wiches often spell big danger and big trouble for the childrens ,0
10468, show my opinion is television advertising  should not be allowed in general ,15
10469," with this statement
the children who watch this advertising in tv probably get wrong information because they believe in everything which is showed to them if you can buy a thing for which is advertising made on tv which one child wants to have you can manipulate them ",2
10470," you say to them that this thing is very cheap but in real it is very expensive
when you do television advertising for young children ",0
10471," they can get more information about the other parts of the world so they become a better world view in their younger years not like the others who dindt watch these or dont have a tv 
an another ",6
10472, with this statement is that the young children dont know what they have to think about that advertising these children who looked the advertising probably have a thought which makes them angry or something the children ,16
10473, sit a lot more time ,18
10474," the tv because of these advertisings who make them watching the series or something which the advertising shows

in general ",10
10475, the television advertising direct toward young children because the negative ,14
10476," are too big to ignore them    
 
",19
10477,"in the following iâ´m gone creat an essay about the statement  television advertising aged  should not be allowed

first of all itâ´s important to meantion that the television could be used in many different ways you can use it to have some fun with your children and the children can learn many thinks from watching but you can spend to much time on it ",15
10478," it could be negative of couse thereâ´re many thinks in the television a child havenâ´t to see but itâ´s emeasing how much a child could learn the language only by wathing television

",17
10479, that itâ´s right to allow children to use the television because of the learn effect but iâ´am not ,21
10480, by let a child do what heshe want to because just like i meantioned ,12
10481, in the television youâ´ve got ,18
10482," many options by switching form one channel to another that you can lose the feeling of the time and start to spend to much time by watching it
my opinion is that itâ´s from familiy to familiy different because you canâ´t tell your children to stop whatching television if you spend the whole time by doing it and in this ",17
10483, it isnâ´t important how old these children arei would meantion too that the television is a medium which have a big might at which is able to form the way a human think and if a child start with young age whatching television it will be have more effect od the children ,17
10484,"the topic whether telivsion advertising  should not be allowed can be considered as very contreverse
in our society is capitalism the leading cause to advertisment in television newspaper or elsewhere the big companies do not look at the negative effects they cause ",15
10485, on young children as a young child it is very easy to manipulate you because you do not own the ability to reflect ,7
10486, to problems in later childhood and ,8
10487," teenagetime girls are shown perfect dolls with a unrealistic bodyproportion maybe they get trouble with their body in a higher age because of that 
also the advertisments show that dolls are for girls and ",20
10488, cars are for boys this causes misunderstanding later in the years our progressed society has no gender rols ,19
10489," advertisment for children ought to stop teaching gender rols or stop showing at all
another problem is that the children learn in the youngest age of their life that consumption is important because that is what advertisment shows and if this person thinks its whole life that consumption is needed to be happy this person will never have a fullfilled life
otherwise the parents can decide wheter their child is allowed to watch television or not so they can regulate the impact advertisment does in our society it is pretty normal to use media as a child but there exsist ",14
10490, many options to watch movies and series on the television without be forced to watch advertisment ,10
10491,television and other modern media is more and more popular in our culture if it is tartort for adults dubbed american series for teenagers or animated learning shows for children and something that goes ,6
10492," with the produces tvshows are advertisements most commonly used during a film and just rarely betwen two of them

as allready mentioned there are ",10
10493, shows produced only for children and most of these use the same concept of advertisements during series or films the problem is that children in the age of  cant see the difference between something they like and something they really want because they want bassicly anything they like so they are pretty easy to manipulate and with them there parents are ,14
10494," too
especially for young parent the pressure of a crying child that wants a specific thing it saw on tv can be to much so they need to buy it and thats exactly what the creators of such advertisements want 
children in this age shouldnt ",2
10495," be directly confronted with the main thought of capitalism in our culture if they grow up with advertisements as part of threre culture there is no way of teaching them the right way consuming later in there life or this will become at least harder
but ",2
10496, asking about if this kind of advertisements should not be allowed there are some problems and ,11
10497," against it asswell
first of all you cant really define which advertisements is for children in this age because of the diffrent nivous they are on some of them learn to speak faster and some of the wouldnt even understand what the advertisement is about when advertisements for children in the age of  would be forbidden the companys would send the same clips and say they are for children in the age of six there ist just no possible way to provide a save way of watching tv without advertisements because you cant controll which programm the chikdren are going to see
also it is part of the responsibility of the parents to teach there children about consuming and they cant get everything they see on tv and the choice of the channel and the time they spend of watching them is something the parents are resposible for aswell

so in my oppinion these kind of advertisements should not be forbidden because it would change anything you cant controll who watches them because its the responsibility of the childrenn parents so ",13
10498, trying to provide advertisements seen by the children you should use the neccessary recources you need for such kind a projekt to make watching tv self saver for them maybe in making more channels complitly without advertisements ,14
10499, kika but stopping creators of making advertisements directly for young children is wasting time,16
10500,the discussion about television advertisment s  year old children was already held multiple times but its ,13
10501," a hot topic

one the on ",18
10502," young â€“ childern are easier to manipulate than adults if children get in touch with advertisment in young years their personality development will be strongly influenced by the values shown in the television advertisments the problem here is that those values are selected to sell as much as possible not to secure a well personality development in most peoples eyes
one the other ",2
10503, there is the right for every one to advertise his products if this right is not granted for sellers of eg kids toys it will put them into a ,11
10504," and young children are not the only group wich is easy to manipulate

the question if such advertisment should be forbidden is worth asking but if such a restriction is made other questions have to be ask ",16
10505, television does appear every now and ,10
10506," watching tv nearly every child does watch tv by the age of  years it is obvious that they will collide with the advertising 

at a young age children do imitate and do things they get caught advertising is trying to convince the watcher young children have no experience to differ what is good and whats not so they get taught about something and grab this knowledge in a time where getting an opinion and make yourself an image of this world is pretty necessary not ot forget advertisment is manipulating not a positive word 
but ",14
10507, advertising wants you to buy something like products or services and kids  years probably wont have the financial force to execute these purchases in that way advertising maybe ould not affect the situation negative in this way and ,0
10508, a positive effect is that the child does get an idea of the technical and engineering situation of the moment how do products look like what are you able to do with them for example how does the new iphone look what can you do with it well thats not central in this case because it is not s young children but it goes in this way children ,8
10509," learn to differ what would i buy and what is not necessary

concluding ",23
10510, advertising is everywhere where you can probably look seriously what can you do about it ,11
10511, that the negative effect is not that important and society should just ignore this issue because it is not worth to think about it when your children are not supposed to see advertising ,13
10512, give them something else to do,3
10513,today many children are influenced by some modern technology like the television the adults can decide what shows the children whatch there are some ,17
10514," that have to be mentioned if we talk about this problem
first many children can be manipulatet from tvshows a lot of the movies espacially the movies that are recommended for the age 16 or higher have a big influence to the children in this context the adults have the responsiblity to advise the children and tell them whether they are allowed to watch the movies or not but in this context they are many children who know how to get this movies whithout the look of the adults
second they are many series or tv shows that are representing the sociaty in a wrong way and implicate wrong thoughts into the mind of an innocent children in the most vincible paragraph of a human living they get influencend and that could cause for ever an can not be changed anymore of cause tvshows are not evil at all but the ",17
10515," should be clear
in another perspective a lot of children like and love what thy watch in the television also ",17
10516, they like tv shows that exactly fit to this problem and are good for the children and do not influence them like other shows there is no actual problem with it so ,6
10517, they look the right tv shows and do not get influenced badly ,6
10518," they can do what they want and look it of cause too many hours a day is of cause not recommended because they are much other things to experience moreover a children is a children to experience and technological anvancements is a part of the experience
the most significant problem is with the adults no one knows how they think an whter a tv shows is good or not but ",17
10519, they should have the possibilaty to decide in future too the adults have to grow up there children and show them a path where they can go and it should not be a law in book who decides what is good or bad for children but maybe adults have to see that tv shows can have a great inflouence to children because ,12
10520," not it could go in a very wrong disortioning way and that should be avoided
to conclude they are many bad influences the children can take from tv shows and the adults are obviusly the greatest problem but ",17
10521, that they should decide for the children and not a law they should be telled what influence tw shows can make,12
10522,children at the age of  usually have started becoming young people they have got a mind of their own they understand what you are telling them or at least they think they do but they can not differ between good and bad they obviously are not old enough ,7
10523,"  to think rationally which is a crutial thing for decinding to go withthe advertisment or to ignore it 

advertisments are used to manipulate people into doing stuff or going out and buying the product you were just informed about in the television children at that age are old enough to understand what the advertisments are offering and they are at the age where they would ",0
10524, already go and ask their parents if they are allowed to have something usually their questions or demans are more like if they are allowed to eat an ice cream or if they could play with mommys makeup but ,24
10525," if the advertisments are s children alone and not towards the parents of children the results would be most efficient for the company adevertising the product you sow the kids what there is and they go and do the job for you in begging their parents to go and buy the product for them 

on the other ",16
10526, it is morally incorrect to manipulate children into wanting something which they wold be toatally fine without the do not know that it is probably not a good idea to buy all the things shown in advertisments because children always see things as good and not as bad bad is not something they are capable of understanding furthermore ,2
10527," to actually direct the advertisments toward children seeing how they actually do not sit in front of the television at that age so companies investing in making advertisments for children directed to children would lose a lot of money

personally i do not believe it is morally correct to manipulate innocent children into buying new things and ",16
10528, there is no use in it cause ,23
10529, it is the parents that decide what to buy and what not to buy it is neither profitable nor effective or even useful to go to such lengths to sell a product ,2
10530,in my eyes television advertising  should not be allowed there is a very big influence from the world around young children to their mind advertising often uses an incorrect speaking or bad words ,15
10531," that the kids learn things they should not do for example my brother he is four years old watches tv and uses the same words the speaker of the advertising text does sometimes there are words he does not know what they mean and uses them in a strange context
also ",2
10532, young children are not able to decide what is real or what is wrong there are lots of toys in the advertising which are presented in a fantastic way ,2
10533, that every child wants to play with it but the most of them are different ,20
10534," you have it in your hands there are funny and exciting movies to show the newest lego toys the figures can speak and there are supporting soundeffects young kids who are watching this always think thats the way you can play with it
maybe the parents have problems to buy the correct present by reason that the kind do exactly what the want to have  the pretty dollhouse from the advertising and not another one most of the advertising toys cost to much money for normal families with more than one child twohundred euros for the newest model of lego technic ist a lot for a christmas present but the kids are angry whan it is not the same they want in their age they do not know that twohundred euros are a lot of money",20
10535,television advertising s children aged  can there really be any success for the companies ,14
10536, have a closer look at the ,18
10537," come to a final statement 
first there is the question to be asked whether children of the age of two are really watching tv and if they do can they realize that they are the targetgroup of the company at least their parents watch it too they could buy their kids the things they see on tv but ",14
10538," direct the advertisement towards adults if it would be allowed what will happen with our society three year old kids hanging around in front of the tv to see whether there is a new product they would like to have
if it would not be allowed to send such advcertisinganyway where would it be formaybe there would be a chance to prevent the following generations from being couch potatoes in any case the parents are the ones who buy the things ",16
10539," they should be adressed directly to get their attention 
on the other ",19
10540, such advertising would be better for the children to watch than the one for alcohol or cigaretts but ,16
10541, should it be sent naturally not in the evening fot ,18
10542, the elder generation is watching tv that leaves the morning were they are probably attending the kindergarten or the afternoon where they should ,17
10543, play with friends or go outside in general i see no real possibility in reaching the children through this kind of advertisement it bears huge problems as to ,16
10544, to send it and if they are old enough to understand what they see in my opinion televion advertisement for kids of this age should not be allowed they will get in touch with the whole tv and marketing business soon enough and ,16
10545, they can decide on their own where to spend their money,9
10546,the statement says that television advertising  from age  should not be allowed ,13
10547, that the author of the statement is mostly correct with his opinion because these children donâ´t know what is good for them in their age their parents should know whether they should get a new toy or not in my opionion television advertisings are nothing a child should deal with because they donâ´t know how advertisings can build up the extreme will to buy the advertised product on the other ,13
10548, it is good for companies to advertise their products toward little children because they often get presents from ,0
10549, their grandparents if they see a new toy they want in a television advertising ,20
10550, they probably beg for it in front of them  to not allow these advertisings could cause big financial problems for the companies but ,11
10551, that the mental health of a child is much more important than the financial crisis of a company ,7
10552, with the statement children  should not be directed in television advertisings because of the spreading will in their little minds to get these advertised products whether the parents should care more about their children and donâ´t let them sit in front of the hypnotisating televison ,14
10553, parents should watch more carefully over the programms their sons and daughters spend their time with and maybe just turn the tv of ,17
10554," state my opinion on the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
on the one ",15
10555, the advertising  is not good because it somehow influences the kids and making them want to have some specific things ,16
10556, toys so they start to beg the parents if they could get it it ,20
10557," changes the view the kids are having on sticking to the example toys they start to compare the toys they are having to what they are seeing on television and questioning the parents why they dont have such things
but ",20
10558, parents are letting the kids watch television they know what the ,17
10559," could be also a two year old will probably not notice that much from televison because it is too young 
personally ",6
10560, that television advertising toward young children should be allowed because if parents think that its good to let ,13
10561, a two year old watch television ,17
10562, why would the advertisement a problem ,11
10563, that a two year old shouldnt be even watching television because it is too young if parents dont see a problem by letting them watch television which influences them ,17
10564, the advertising they shouldnt see a problem with the advertisement,11
10565,"advertisements got more popular and have grown a lot of importancy in our society in particular television advertising is influencing us every day and developed ubiquitous in this development one way of advertising evolved and has been selected the advertising toward young children the question is is television advertising  problematic

young children havent developed their own opinion ",14
10566, and act very naiv their opinion is depended on their parents and other people surrounding them because of that advertisements have a very big influence and is more effective not only products for these children can be sold easier ,2
10567, other things can be advertised toward them for example an advertisement of a shampoo can show a little teddybear using it ,20
10568," young children develop a sympathy to this shampoo and tell thei parents to buy it

this principe can be used to sell neary everything  ",2
10569, they dont need it for example they dont need a shampoo because they already have one but because they like the teddybear they have to will of getting it anyways with this methode it isnt difficult to sell products and it is ,20
10570," do not have developed an own opinioni and started to believe what the television or other media told them

all in all ",7
10571, there are some problems in advertising products towards children but it is ,16
10572," nearly impossible to fix this problem and they will grow even more
",19
10573, discuss the statement that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed an ,15
10574," for this statement is that a young child wants everything they see or everything that is hyped so they can get easily manipulated by firms because they canâ´t know what they really need they are wanting their parents to buy all the nice stuff from the ads
an ",2
10575, against this statement is that big concerns just want to sell their products and if they are selling things for children they should be allowed to show it to them but my main ,13
10576," against this statement is that young children have to learn that they canâ´t get everthing they wantthey must know their parents arenâ´t aible to buy all of the things from the ads so they are learning how to handle with money and that you have to do something to get little presents eg cleaning your room
to put it in an nutshell ",2
10577, that television advertising  aged  should be allowed at ,15
10578, you may not see it but there is a huge learning effect ,8
10579,"nowadays lots of young children are watching television in our society it is normal because of the media in addition to that there is lots of advertising in the television for small children 
",17
10580, there are positive and negative ,21
10581," that it is not good that the people in the media are speaking directly to the children for example the small children would see a toy that they want because they see it in the television the parents would have a problem maybe the toy is too expensive or the the parents say that the children not need this toy 
besides the children would spend more time to watching television the ",17
10582, would be that the children would be lately dump they would ,9
10583," believe that all the advertisements are saying the truth
furthermore ",11
10584," that the children do not meet other friends the children would be isolated of the environment
now i say someting about the positive ",4
10585," of this topic
televisoin and ",10
10586, media are inportant things in the future ,10
10587, that is good that the media directors talking directly to the children because they included the children directly in the media and ,6
10588," about the lately future
besides the parents should protect that children ",12
10589, the children are watching television that would not bring ,17
10590," the parents would choose the series that should see the children in addition that there are lots of series withoot advertisements
all in all ",6
10591, that are posive and negative ,21
10592," to this topic 
i thinks its good for the children because of the future and ",12
10593, bad because the children would not spend lots of time with otther things ,4
10594," that the parents should care about the children and should choose wheather their children should see advertisements or not 
personallly i would not show my children advertisements or mainly television because it is dump and they would not learn something in this advertisements but it is ",13
10595," the disicion of the parents
",9
10596,nowadays everyone watches tv it became normal that even young children watch tv and grow up with it but there appears the question what does the tv show it is not just about showing movies and series there is ,6
10597," lots of advertising and some ads are  now we have to think about whether television advertising  should be allowed or should not be allowed 
allowing television ads that are  would mean allowing companies manipulating young children for making them buy their products the companies show their products in a way that gets the attention of children and makes them want to have their product so the companies put their product in the head of young children for making the young kids ask their parents to buy it causing ",14
10598, against advertising  the parents lose much money by making young kids want to have something the parents are going to be asked to buy these certain things and often the children convince their parents to buy them the things they want and parents ,2
10599, want to make their kids happy another appearing problem is that if the kids have this product they often play for maybe a week with it and ,20
10600," see another ad and want another product which leads t
to put it in a nutshell ",11
10601, television advertising  should not be allowed because it has a big impact to the children and ,15
10602," makes lots of people lose much money
   ",23
10603," for and against the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed
an ",15
10604, for this statement includes the ,21
10605, that for those children advertising could be an oportunity to get to know things they have not known ,0
10606, they can get the impression of things they have not seen ,3
10607," which can be an intresting experience for them 
on the other ",19
10608, against that statement advertising  may have a bad influence on them because they get manipulated to buy things it is a manipulation ,11
10609, that they are shown things like toys which are ,20
10610, very expensive it could lead to problemes like getting addicted to things like that and wanting more and more toys which could ,4
10611," lead to problemes with money furthermore it is a process of stealing 
the free choice of childreen they should have the right to choose whatever they want by themselves and not by the manipulation of advertisings
to put it in a nutshell i prefer the opinion that advertising  should not be allowed because they should have the right to choose their own intrests and get to be independent in very early ages      ",13
10612,television advertising is very known  because they often enjoy watching it regularly on tv shows ,10
10613," made for children there are lots of ads which show new toys that seem often very appealing to them

i remember that back in my childhood days i would love to watch tv and seeing these adverts made me want to have that new toy immediatly i would run to my mother and ask her to buy it ",0
10614, without giving much thought about it ,21
10615, i am just a child who wants everything nice it sees because of this many children fight with their parents because they do not get what they want this leads to ,9
10616, parties geting angry and sad moments like these ,18
10617, a child does not get the toy it wants and in the  worst case get his or her heart broken over this are very critic situations for a family additionally parents cant always afford the expensive toys their children want and start to feel bad about themselves because they cannot fullfill their childrens wishes furthermore children are ,20
10618, quick to decide what they want and what they do not want ,3
10619," them often wanting unnessecary toys

because of all these ",24
10620," listed above i come to the conclusion that advertising s young children should not be allowed they do not have the ability to decide in terms of buying and get influenced very easily 
 ",16
10621,watching tv from a young age on is normal today everybody has a favourite tvshow even the youngest ones but there is always advertisment between the tvshows television advertising  should not be allowed because the advertisments make false promises that small children can not distinguish from reality ,14
10622, the advertised product is mostly unhealthy for children and ,4
10623, a child is far more disceptable to advertisment ,16
10624," an adult
for example kinder country you have an advertisment that shows a picture of a perfectly healthy nature landscape and you think that this company produces a healthy product that is good for your child but the reality is very different than the advertisment the nature from advertisment never made it into the kinder country it contains mostly sugars and fats and is ",2
10625," unhealthy but if you get fooled by advertisment how should a child distinguish advertisment from reality
another example would be red bull in the advertisment of red bull it is said that if you drink it ",2
10626," you will grow wings an adult should know that this is probabably not going to happen but a child is going to think that it will really happen and that is a false promise that a small child can not distinguish from reality
we all know that we are quite disceptable to advertisment but small children are even more disceptable to it also studies have shown that children want to buy a product because they recognize it and we all no the situation where a child in a store wants an unhealthy product and the parents will not buy it with advertisment that is not directed to children we would have less of these situations
with a ban of television advertising  we would have less discepted children that want to buy an unhealthy product that is advertised under false promises that could lead to an reduction of the obesity rate in small children and ",14
10627," we would have less enerved parents in stores because children want to buy unhealthy products


",9
10628," explain why television ads for children between the age of  should not be allowed to be directed 
an ",13
10629," that if children see some toy in the tv that they want parents get a thought for a  present for christmas or for their birthday 
but this ",20
10630, of view maybe the toy they really want which they would cry for is too expensive for the parents and maybe the children are very sad about not getting this toy the parents get very sad about the ,20
10631," that they made their children sad because they are too poor to give their children the toys they want to have
and maybe if the parents are very rich they buy their children everything they see on television but the problem with that is that the children may get used to it and in their adult life they want to ",9
10632, everything they see on tv ,3
10633, they get bills and bills and bills they cannot pay because they are not ,3
10634," rich as their parents 
another ",9
10635, for not directing television adverts for young children is the ,13
10636, that maybe some parents dont let their kids see television but if the parents see an ad for a big toy they just buy it without asking their kid if they want it and ,2
10637, that the kids just play 2 minutes with it and ,20
10638," they put it in corner and never give it look back 
watching all ",3
10639, my result is that television adverts should not be directed for children between the age of  years old,13
10640,the television is in our community an important topic everybody get informed about the news in the world and ,10
10641," everybody get entertaind
but the television has ",10
10642," thats the reason why the topic of my essay deals with the pros and cons of the television the statemet is if television advertising  should not be allowed
first ",15
10643," name the pros of television advertising 
in the tv are many tv shows and movies where kids learn something ",10
10644, counting ore reading they learn this important things indirect ,8
10645," they donâ´t realise it 
another pro ",3
10646," is that watching tv could be an relaxing part of the day for the kids 
on the other ",1
10647," many shows and movies that arenâ´t good for young children sometimes they use words that children donâ´t have to say 
another contra ",6
10648," of tlevision advertising  is that some kids sit a long part of the day in front of the tv and donâ´t go out of the house and play with other kids 
in my ",14
10649," of view children have to be allowed watching tv but there have to be some rules 
one rule has to be that the childrens only watch special tv shows and movies that are only for children another rule has to be that they only watch tv in the evening ",17
10650," they go outside with friends in the other part of the day
",1
10651," give my opinion on the statement that television advertising  at the age of  should not be allowed
first of i cant tell any positive thing about advertising  the only positive is the firms earn more money with it and ",15
10652, it is a genius idea as soon as young children see any toy or something like that they immediately fancy and want to have it they will ask their parents to buy it about everyday itll be getting on their nerves and ,20
10653," the parents will probably go for it 
the other thing about it is that i dont understand why there even is an advertising ",2
10654, watching a kids show children mostly watch tv shows running on a platform made for their age ,6
10655," why isnt it forbidden to let the show break for advertising children who cant even buy the shown things themselves because there are not even earning money by their own 
another negative thing is that advertising does make stupid und unhappy first they build up random things to make their advert more interesting and children get even convinced about what they say because theyre ",14
10656, naive also youll get unhappy ,19
10657," seeing all those fabulous stuff you would really like to have their old toys wont be enough anymore and theyll alsways crave for more they wont recognize the worth of their old toys 
summed up ",20
10658,we live in a world full of electronic devices and one of them happened to be the television nowadays children start watching tv at a really young age and are ,17
10659, influenced by it because with their favourite kids series they ,6
10660," watch advertisements so if advertisements really do influence children at a young age should it be forbidden for companies to direct their advertisements towards these children

one one ",13
10661, it could be that kids aged  dont even comprehend what they are seeing on television and do not react to it so there would be no reason to forbid advertising towards young children you could ,14
10662, say that it is the job of the parents to keep their children away from danger ,8
10663," these advertisements

on the other ",11
10664, you could say that it is morally not correct to try to influence audience at such a young age consequently the government should lawfully forbid it because it should not be allowed to act legally in an unmoral way and ,12
10665," if it concernces helpless kids

in my opinion there should exist some sort of law that does not allow advertising s young children but to me it seems really hard to draw the line between what is s kids and what is wanted to influence an older audience for example if you have a look at the evian advertisement with babies dancing and driving rollerblades in it you could assume that the advertisement is s babies or children too but ",16
10666, you think about it an advertisement about water would originally not be s them ,11
10667,weather advertising toward children should be allowed is a controversial topic the major ,13
10668, of critics is that children are inexperianced and cannot interprete and understand the tricks used by advertising agencies false advertising and imagry is commonly used in tvads but are expected by adult viewers young viewers ,14
10669, dont know what to expect one ,18
10670, for the use of targeted ads is that in the developed world children through their parents make up a huge part of the buying power of countless markets children are exposed to ,0
10671," many new things to interprete what difference does it make if its an ad 

parents of young children would probably argue that they dont want their kids exposed to media that they cant control targeted ads would allow marketing departments to tap into living rooms the world over and affect the behavour of children in an uncontrollable fashion but children are already exposed to ",16
10672," much media that influences them hughmongusly some movies and tvshows made for children are littered with product placemen corrupting kids minds impossible for them to interprete law makers would argue that parents let their kids watch all kinds of movies and shows how would tvads make a difference 
another ",7
10673, against ads for kids is that even ,16
10674, the ads are not hard to understand for children they ,16
10675," advertise negative things many children in the developed world suffer from obesity because they eat to much junk food they see doritos on tv and just have to have them

in my opinion some regulation is definitely needed children cannot be exposed to physically damaging envirionments why should they be allowed to be harmed mentally but a strict noadsforchildren policy would be over the top the regulation should limit and define what products can be advertised and in which fashion that happens",13
10676, television advertising has a big influence ,10
10677," on very young children the advertisings on channel for children often advertise for quite expensive products like lego its very easy to manipulate children of this age and its very difficult for the parents to decline something their children also the childrens brain develop very fast at this age and this process is very complex its important that theres no negative influence on the children created by the advertising 
on the other ",2
10678," the television channels somehow have to earn their money and advertising is the best and easiest way to do this beside product placement which has an even bigger influence on the viewer we live in a capitalistic worlf and without the money earned from the advertising television channels wont be able to produce any new childrenthemed shows the channels wiich arent founded by the goverment are normal companies and have to bring up money to pay their bills
",10
10679, with statement because i believe theres no necessity for a law against televison advertising the channels somehow have to refinance themselves in general young children shouldnt spend too much time in front ov the tv what could have a bad influence on their development i ,14
10680, think its the parents duty to watch out for their children and decrease the time spent in front of the tv if they recognise a change in the character of the child ,17
10681,"television advertising toward young children is an often discussed topic these daysin the following text i am goingt to state my opinion if television advertising toward young children aged  should be allowed or not
first of all it has become a normal thing that most of the children are allowed to wacht tv a few years ago like back ",14
10682, i was a kid we only had one tv in our house ,17
10683," i couldnt watch tv whenever i wantedt to 
when i see little children nowdays they watch tv like everydaythat means companies know it is a good idea to put advertising in between tvshows to reach many viewers
they see ",14
10684, much advertising or hear it from friends ,11
10685," it is okay to show some of it on tv
but there should ",6
10686," be a limit 
in general i think children with the age of  should not sit in front of a tv that often they are ",17
10687," young and parents should definitly control theitr children tv consume 
children are easily to influcene ",17
10688, tv companies know how to produce smart advertising they mostly believe everything they see or hear ,10
10689, if we all look back the world ,18
10690," we where young looked pretty different in our eyes
so ",18
10691," television advertising for young children should have a limit because children are easy to influence with that the advertising can change their behavior and mind
",14
10692," write about television advertising  young childer is it okay to advertis young childern should that be allowed

very often young childern aged  watching television because the parents doesnt want to playwith them or arent at home in the pauses is every time advertising there is a advertisment about the sale in the migros and coop or about the new ford young childern doesnt understand this stuff but there is ",13
10693, advertising about a new toy the best bobbycar or about a better babyborn which can eat and cry on one ,0
10694, it is good because the young childern sees what they can put on their christmaswishlist on the other ,20
10695, is in the internet and the television often stupid and bad stuff so the childern put stupid stuff on their wishlist and are cry ,24
10696," it isnt under the christmas tree
advertising isnt that good for young childern because more often is advertings sexualised children shouldnt be confront with that ",16
10697," early in their life they should enjoy the childhood outside with their friends and not alone at home with watching televison
when a little girl sees the newest babyborn in the television she runs to her mother and says mummy mumm ",24
10698, have this babyborn it only costs 69â£ the mother answers hmmmm i dont know sewatheart i have to think about it one or two weeks later she says to her daughter that she will buy the babyborn she went to the store and sees that the babyborn costs now 100â£ she must buy the babyborn if it costs 69â£ or 100â£ as we see  the factory or the store makes profit because of a young girl and ,9
10699," it is not okay

as you maybe saw im not that happy with television advertising directed young children for the parents it isnt that good and ",14
10700, for the children television advertising is totally okay but not directed to young childern they shouldnt even watch televison but that is an other question  ,14
10701," discuss the question if television advertisment for young children should be allowed or not 
in many families even very young children are placed in front of the tv ",14
10702, that they do not molest their parents of course they see their favourite new toys in the advertisment ,20
10703," they go to their parents and nearly force them to buy new toys this sometimes ends in a difficult situation for the adults should i buy every new toy from the advertisment to make my child happy what to do with tv advertisment for kids 
firstly there are multiple ",0
10704," against tv advertisment for kids for example one could say that tv advertisment is bad for the childs development if you buy new toys for your kid every time they see something in the tv they will end up with the attitude of getting everything they want right away so tv adverts should not be allowed to save the childrens education and behaviour 
on the other ",13
10705, tv advertisment for kids can ,16
10706, be very useful and absolutly great for their development if you control the tvconsum of a child and explain them why they cannot have every toy they want children can learn that one cannot have everything by watching tv so they can accept a no ,17
10707," asking for a new toy from the advertisment 
in my opinion it all comes down to the question how children are raised by their parents if they have a good education and understand how advertisments can manipulate ones mind ",20
10708," advertisment s kids is absolutley fine 
",16
10709," dicuss the controversial question if television advertising  shoud be allowed or not
in the last centuries media usage like television has risen ",15
10710," in the younger generation a part of television is advertising and many people have the opinion that young children should not be allowed to see adverts  them 

i only ",14
10711," several reasons
the most important ",19
10712, why advertisment toward children should be forbidden is because the younger a person is the more likely it is able to be influenced an average adult who sees an advert is able to seperate things they want from things they actually need and understands that advertisment uses certain marketing methods to make the product look better with this knowledge that they developed over the years they think about if they actually should buy the product ,16
10713, they see it in an advert most children usually do not have these abilities ,24
10714, they see a product in a television advert that they like they do not think about important ,3
10715, the prize or the quality of it if they want to have it ,3
10716," they will only think about that
another ",19
10717, is that it is morally not right to take ,4
10718, of a young mind to get their money compared to an adult a child does not have much money at the age between  usually none but if they do it is not okay to make a child spend this small amount of money ,9
10719, because they cannot understand the concept of earning money and spending it ,3
10720,"

on the opposite there are a lot of ",19
10721,"
firstly we as citizens of western countries have rights in our laws that allow us to say whatever we want in public and on the media ",21
10722," it does not go against the law in my opinion if one forbids certain television adverts it is a cut in free press speech which is not right
also important to note is that a child should stand under the surveillance of its parents it is their job to watch out which channels the child sees on television on german television their is a kids channel called kika where there are not any adverts if parents do not want their child to see advertisments they should let their child only watch channels like this or turn the television off in the advert breaks even if it is influencing children it is ",13
10723, every parents own choice on how they raise their kids and ,9
10724," they explain to their children the concept behind television marketing and do not buy them everything they see it is okay if they let their kids see advertisments

because of these last reasons ",14
10725, that television advertising toward young children should be allowed to a certain level influencing children is not right but more important is the issue of freedom and everyone should be allowed to raise their children the way they want therefore i believe that there will not be any problems if television advertising stays the way it is now,14
10726,the technology develops very much in the past everyone has tv in his house or flat young and old people spent much time on watching television ,17
10727, going outside and meeting friends especially young children spend much time infornt the tv a statement is television advertising  aged  should not be allowed but is this true in the following text ,14
10728," talk about young childrens which are watching tv very often 
television advertising  aged  should not be allowed because they see ",13
10729, much stuff in the tv and doesnt lern anythink for example if they whatch  they dont learn anythink ,17
10730, watching it if they watch ,19
10731, a positive effect on spending their time infront the tv ,17
10732," going outside  or to someting without technology 
but ",1
10733, television advertising  hould not be allowed a reason ,15
10734, is that the childrens sit alone infront the tv ,1
10735, meeting their friends the reason ,3
10736, many sendungen for childrens which they wanted to see for example  is a sendung for young children the childrens woult like to see it and ,8
10737, meeting their friends they sit infront the tv and just watch it for a long time but often ,1
10738, one sendung for children comes the ,8
10739," the kids spend much time on watching television 
another reason that televion advertising   should not be allowed is that the childrens sit in the house and watch tv no matter if the sun is shining or if its a rainy day the reason ",14
10740, is that the kids want to watch their sendungen and dont want to go outside and go on the playground or do something else outside for expample the weather is great at 12 oclock but at 1230 comes the favorite sendung of a child the child wouldnt go outside ,1
10741," watching his favorite sendung 
all in all i would ",18
10742," to the statement that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed because there are many thinks which would be much better for the young childrens 
",13
10743,should we allow televison ads to be directed at younger kids this is a very controversial question with no definite answer and a lot of different ,13
10744, of views the main problem with advertisement to very young kids is the ,16
10745, that they are extremely susceptible to it and that their brains are not ,7
10746," fully developed should we let our kids be controlled by television ads or is the whole discussion unnecessary as older people are influenced on the same level

the question we must ask ourself is are these kids really ",14
10747, much more susceptible than we are on the one ,19
10748, kids at this stage in life have ,24
10749, a lot of things to learnand are more susceptible to influence but ,7
10750, the ad is not making them buy it it is just showing them a product that they want to sell and the kid can ,2
10751," decide if he wants to buy it we know that we can influence kids very easily and we can steer them in a direction you can tell a kid how cool a soccer club is and he might just start supporting that soccer club at their age kids might not know what they want and bombarding them with  ads will only confuse them and they will want something new everyday but we always influence our kids no matter what we do no matter what you tell a kid you are influencing him one can argue that if its not a televison ad it will be a poster or a toy that you see in a store and that it is just a different way of advertising 

in my opinion television ads to under five year olds should be banned as these companies are just trying to make a profit if a child sees ",0
10752, many ads a day it will influence him ,11
10753, at such a young age it will have an influence on him and i cannot see how this influence could be positive the only positive is that companies make a lot of money and ,4
10754, that is not a good reason to negatively influence our children,12
10755,"should it not be allowed to direct television advitising towards small children
some people think it has bad influence on  children ",13
10756, they see television advertising some people think that it can have a bad effect on young children i totally ,4
10757, that television can have an  effect on the way people think  ,10
10758, on the way younger ones think but ,7
10759, it should be forbidden to direct advertising towards children the children today need to learn how to live with social media and the advertising on it ,16
10760, on  tv it is part of life nowadays and by forbidding advertising s children one takes away time ,14
10761, they the children could actually learn how to not believe everything they see if television advirtising is forbidden the problem wont be fixed the problem is that ,17
10762, many people fall for everything they see hear or read and the ,3
10763, to that problem is learning them how to check ,7
10764," and be critical this can be achieved if one starts talking about it to younger children 
then ",7
10765, one cant just place their children in front of the tv and leave but this should not be done anyway one has to prepare the younger children for the future and part of their future is fake news and advirtising ,17
10766," they need to learn how to react to that at a young age
that is the reason ",7
10767,"  not alowing television advertising s young children 
 ",0
10768," tell you if children in the age of  should not watch television
children in this age should not watch tv because it is not good for them all of these children programms on nickelodeon are pretty uselles and that stuff they should learn by watching this tvshow they can learn in a book for children in this age the children should not waste their time by watching tvshows they can go in a park with their parents or just meet with other friends there are enough options they can do but if the children at the age of ",17
10769, three start to watch tv there is higher chance that they will get dumb and if the parents will not say anything against that the children are watching ,24
10770, much tv the children want to watch more and more and later on they will not learn that much for school because they are too interested in watching tv ,17

10775, play together it is important to show that what the parents are saying has to be done and the parents need to demonstrate this power the ,8
10776, step should be to not allow television advertising for young children it is the best thing for the kids  ,13
10777,"there is no possibility to flee them  the advertisings in the tv for almost every productfor hotels or even animals commercials exist with only one aim  to increase the requests for it but should it be really allowed in all areas

first of all ",11
10778," we have to look at this theme with a split view advertisings are nothing more than clever business models which try to influence the a large number of community members as followed it is not surprising that the commercials are even created for minors and young children children are those persons in a family who probably have the greatest influence what they want theire parents try to get furthermore the parents should decide on theire own wether it is okay that theire 4 aged children look television or go out into the nature

althoug advertisings in tv even for young children are very important for the companies we should ",14
10779, take the other site into consideration children are ,12
10780, the persons who influence the most they are ,21
10781, the most influencable members in a familiy with advertisings in the television they always get an idea with what they could enlarge ,10
10782, theire collection of toys unhappy and sad faces if theire parents could not afford everything and a consumation community even in the ,9
10783," years of a childrens  life is the conclusion 

all in all television advertisings for minors and young children should not be prohibited but restricted in a certain mass because a consumation community with 4 aged children is absolute nonsense  ",13
10784,people of all ages are interesting for advertising agencies but ,11
10785, young people are easy to influence a very popular way to advertise today is the television and already young children watch regularly tv ,0
10786," victims of manipulative advertising 
advertisement is produced for specific groups for children they use ",16
10787," a lot of colours pets and children as actors all things that children like they are instantly fascinated of the advertised product an exhausting thing for the parents who have to handle the whishes and annoying insists of their kids they obviously cant fulfill all those wishes and buy all the mostly unnecessary products
in my eyes its cruel to manipulate young children who are ",2
10788,"television advertising is common in todays society nobody is enjoying them and nobody actually watch them but young children can be influenced strongly by the loud music in the background the many colours and the speaker they simply cannot ignore television advertising and get influenced by it

television advertising should not be allowed young children are very easy to manipulate and therefor it should be illegal to produce television adverts s them some parents tend to buy their children everything they want and if theres a new advert in the television every week theyll ",14
10789, have to say no to a child thats used to get everything it wants or face financial issues eventhough children will cry like they are dying as soon as they have their new toy theyre happybut ,9
10790," a week its already boring again and it gathers dust in the wardrobe

on the other ",18
10791," if the children dont see the adverts visiting a friend has almost the same effect everybody has something different and it seems to have an even stronger effect on the influenced child a child can be as easily influenced by friends as by television but actually making television advertising for young children should be against the law

i can remember playing with a friend of mine and he had black and white lego blocks nobody i knew in that time had those till today were best friends just because of a toy then again i ",0
10792," had alot of toys i simply watched on television i didnt even know that they existed until i saw them

in the end i can only repeat what ive already said television advertising should not be allowed for young children because they can be influenced easily and its just immoral",20
10793,advertising in childrens television has always been a heated topic the banning of advertising targeted at young children has been proposed by numerous parents ,13
10794," that a ban like this is a very bad idea and i will explain why

first of all the only people complaining about tv advertising targeted at young children are parents parents that allow a child to pester them into buying a new toy need to learn how to say no even if advertising was banned the child would only have to see another child playing with a toy another important ",13
10795, is that childrens tv shows are funded with advertising money many wellmade childrens shows would suffer a mayor loss in quality or disappear entirely the shows that would remain in case of this ban would be filled with hidden advertising in form of product placement or other ways but there is always another ,14
10796," paragraph

children between 2 and 5 are very impressionable and ",8
10797, vulnerable to advertising they do not really know what they want ,11
10798, which means an ad that tells them what they want is very succesful the companies making these advertisments know this and fully use this vulnerability to their ,11
10799," which is considered quite immoral the children pester their parents incessantly until they buy them a toy they do not really want

even ",9
10800, there are many moral problems with advertising targeted at young children i ,16
10801, think that banning it would not make anything better the childrens shows would become absolutely terrible,12
10802, that parents that cannot say no to their child sh just pay for a payperview channel these channels have no advertising at all,13
10803,nowadays television advertising is a very common way for companys to bring their products straight to the consumers while it may seem to be a good idea to show off products to a lot of people ,10
10804, talking to them on the street or whatever way they would chose ,18
10805, contains hidden threat for the consumers which many do not really know about the companys manage to influence the tv watchers to the ,10
10806, of where they feel like they really need something ,3
10807, theyve never felt the need ,3
10808," until watching a certain advertisement
when it comes to children it seems to be even more severe young children have wish ",7
10809," wish and those may change from one minute to the other if they really urge to have banana you can almost bet if you ask them 5 minutes later what they want rightnow that their answer probably wont be a banana anymore
so in my eyes its quite unrealistic to even consider advertising stuff for young children as they want everything at once and cant really decide wheter or not they really need something apart from that are the parents the one who decide what to or not to buy as were talking about the role of parents children between two and five years shouldnt be allowed to regularly watch tv on their own as tv programmes can contain a lot of violence younger children may not understand jet 
to finish i have to say i definitely ",2
10810, with prohibiting television advertising toward young children,13
10811,"nowadays children get influenced by television advertsiing very early this is because of the habit that already  children of a young age could watch tv but does this advertising influence them too much and should it be forbidden
first of all young children are really easy to influence this is ",14
10812, why such a lot of advertising is faced towards young children because they believe everything and if small children see something they want ist is hard to tell them that theyre not going to get it so there are some ,16
10813, in favour of not allowing advertsing towards children  but it is the resposnibilty of the parents to decide wether their child can watch tv or not and they have ,13
10814," to inform them how to react to this advertsing in the end the parents buy an advertised product for their child and theyre old enough to decide if it is a good thing or not so the child can be influenced by advertising but it doesnt harm them straight away last but not least it would be difficult to decide what advertising is for children between two and five years and what not because its different from child to child what they like and what not
in my eyes it isnt a good idea to forbid television advertsing for children between two and five because it would be hard to regulate and ",14
10815, the parents are able to inform their children and take responsibilty of them,9
10816,nowadays observing young children watching television is nothing astonishing anymore there are a lot of kids who are not older than five years old spending several hours a day and doing noting but staring into television ,17
10817," there would be such a enormous amount of energy in those lowaged children this is very sad and must be changed television advertising directed to young chidren should be forbidden

first of all it is clear that the development of a child is ",14
10818, thing this development is influenced by different parts one of those parts is the movement sports and movement are enourmously important because they have positive effects on body and health of a human ,8
10819," of a child because as explained they are in the state of developing

in the ideal case children play or move outside because like this they learn to know their environment and the nature in their following lives they are ready and able to use protect and respect

another ",8
10820, is the social one playing is not just playing it is more dealing with other social individums when children play with each other they have to respect their partners and learn a lot of skills by doing that the earlier they learn to share things ,24
10821," the better they are able to do in their following lives

to sum up chilren are made for moving in the free nature to play with other children and to learn how to act in their following lives watcing television does the opposite with these children it iaolates them a lot of very important experiences get lost",17
10822,the advertisings are often doing it on purpose to impress children ,16
10823, that they want to have the product and are annoying their parents until they get it but ,3
10824, it is good to desensibilize the young generation with the diversity of all the products and ,23
10825," the children need to learn to get on with this situation that they can not always get what they want 
and if they will never see an advertisement on the television and ",2
10826," they are adult are confronted with this it could be that they can not handle the situation 
sometimes the spots are not amed for children and show them things that could disturb their developement
a ",24
10827, for this conflict could be that those advertisements are not allowed to be showen during a film for children but sooner or later they will be in contact with all those kind of things ,16
10828, why should they not learn it ,8
10829," they have a parent or an adult they listen to many parents who complain about this are often just too lazy to invest their energy into argue with their children
",7
10830, we should not totally ban the television advertising but we should ,15
10831, not use the naivness of kids,8
10832, that their children often watch tv and sometimes ,1
10833," see advertising is it possible that a strange television advertising can have bad influence on children aged  and have to be forbidden or is this only a claim made by some advertisinghaters

nowadays in every house or flat exists at least one electronical item on wich you can watch tv therefore its difficult to bring up children without to let them see television but for childre it is very important for their futur life to play outside experience the world and have fun

research shown that almost all parents dont know that very young chrildren shouldnt watch too much television because of the advertisings therefore informational days for parents with young children would help a lot they would ",14
10834, learn that there exist some channels with no advertising wich are ,10
10835," made for children 

advertising is mostly made in tv programmes who arent made for children ",16
10836, blockbusters or other films in my opinion it depends on how the parents educate their children,6
10837, with the following statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed because ,15
10838, that young children this age should not even watch television to give children the opportunity to have a childhood without television and other electronic devises involved in it  would vanish this statement i ,17
10839, wasnt allowed to watch television untill i was eight years old and i never had the need to buy something i just saw in the television at the age span of  the main reason why television advertising  children this young should not be allowed is that the tv industry takes ,14
10840, of children  i mean if young kids watch television already they should have a programme where they could watch kids movies like the disney movies or stuff like that they should be happy with what they have already and not be led in to a world where greediness and capitalism are ruleing they should not be jealous of their kindergarden friends because they have a toy more kids do have a big impact on their parents because if theyrenot happy their parents arent ,17
10841,"nowadays almost every familiy owns a tv that can be used by the every member sometimes even by young children these affect them in different ways depending on what kind of programs are shown on tv sometimes even advertisement can affect them big companies sometimes produce commercials that are  in this essay i want to explain if television advertising  should not be allowed
one ",15
10842, against this kind of advertisment is the manipulation that commercials can do young kids can not decide maturely ,16
10843, it can be dangerous to them another ,4
10844, against television advertising towards young children is that ,13
10845, seeing such a commercial kids want such products ,0
10846," parents rarely would buy or cant afford it what makes kids very sad
an ",9
10847, in favour could be that it teaches kids a lesson because they cant and wont have eveything in life another pro ,12
10848, is that kids could be influenced by commecials with good purpose as ,0
10849," antiracism campaigns
in my opinion television advertising toward young children should be allowed but only if they have a good purpose",13
10850,"a lot of parents put their children in front of the television to have some time for themselves but what do the children see and how does it influence them
children learn a lot by seeing and hearing they want to do the same thing like they see if there is an advertising in that you can see a child playing and beeing happy the child in front of the televison wants to play the same game it influences children heavily they ask their parents ",17
10851," game
but an enterprise wants to be successful and uses every possibility to be more successful its just naturally that they produce advertising for children a teenager is ",0
10852," influencable and its allowed to produce advertising directed to them every generation is influencable where is the diffrence between young children teenagers and adults
children cannot decide between reality and fiction an adult knows that he is watching publicity but a child doesnt know 
an other ",14
10853," is that children believe everything you tell them if they watch advertsing its possible that they believe in something thats not true this can cause harm
children dont have any money they cannot buy anything if they want something they have to convince their parents ",14
10854, television advertsing  can be allowed the parents have to decide if they want to put thier children in front of the tv or not they know that there is advertising if their child wants something they will know that and ,13
10855, they can decide if they want to buy that or not because of that ,23
10856, televison advertsing shouldnt be not allwoed,15
10857,"advertisement is omnipresent in the world of today there is advertisement for every age group and every category of life but is it appropriat to make advertisements s young children 
young children are much easier to influence than adults advertising is often presented in a way to make the product look good no matter what ",16
10858, the product isnt as told in the advertisement if you put an advertisement for something on tv and kids see it  teyll believe anything it says so if it distorts the reality or only tells the half truth the children would believe it and it could have very bad ,2

there is a lot of different advertising for children on television at the moment normally this advertising is about toys making an advertisement for toys and putting it on tv isnt really problematic it may be annoying for the parents as theyd ",14

10861," they want anyway but there is no harm done to the kid 
on the other ",12
10862, there arent only toy advertisements for kids there are ,16
10863, companies that produce sweets advertising their products espescially for kids sweets are very problematic as kids cant understand that they are bad for our health if they see sweet treats in an advertisement they are going to want to eat one ofter parents dont like to argue with their kids ,16
10864," they just give it to them or the children get it themselves advertising sweets very often could lead to a more obese youth  

",2
10865,nowerdays it is nearly impossible to escape from television advertising forteen minutes out of a fortyfive minutes fil is just adverising it begins early in the morning and ends late in the night not only adultes are influenced by advertissements ,10
10866," little children under school age it is very easy to influence children with little cute  advertising films for toys the parents hardly can do anything against this their kids just want to have everything what they see on tv and it is nor easy to explain why it is not possible so some people say that television advertissement  young childredn sholud be ilegal

first of all it is hard for children to understand why they can not have the cute doll or the little toy warrior ",14
10867," it is showed in a film on tv they start to terorrise their parents because of that and this situation is the goal of those advertisers they just use sad you children to earn money

the advertisers state that they must promote their toys somewhrere whrere the children can see those and than want to buy those the television ist one of the easiest way because many children watch tv daily and for the parents ist is nearly impossible to avoid their kids watching the advertissements

further more children under school age mostly can not know what they really need they are to easy to manipulate by stupid but welldone advertissements in the advertissements every toy looks interesting and funny eventought it is not in reallity when the child ",2
10868," gets the toy it is not that much fun as expected

all things considered my opinion ist televison advertising  childeren ",20
10869, very young children should be forbidden because it influences the children in a bad way it causes many ,12
10870, in the fammilies about buying unnecessary stuff childern can not understand why its familly can not afford the toy warrior ,20
10871," the child in the advertising film can have one they just think they have mean parents and that the parents just do not want to buy it

",20
10872,the advertising industry is well known for many years now we are all used to it and accept it ,11
10873," watching tv but we all know that they can trick you have a big influence on your decisions during shopping is advertising s young children now more dangerous should it even be disallowed

for me advertising ",14
10874," is well known by all of us it already got normal and to disallow something that is already normal for people is a very difficult move 

on the other ",12
10875, advertising s young children aged between two and five is not really fair the products in advertisements do not look the same in reality as they do on tv and most of the time the product is not able to do the things it does on tv and very young children are not old enough to see that they can be tricked very easily and that is the ,2
10876," wehre you have to say that it is just not correct

furthermore young children watching advertisements just want the product they dont even care about whether they are going to play with it or not during that age you just want anything and dont say no to nothing

but the biggest ",2
10877, is that children between two and five are not able to buy the stuff they see on tv by themself the product shown on tv ,2
10878," has to get bought by the parents 

to summarize i think that you cant just disallow advertisement s young children you would always have to debate about whether ",16
10879, the toy is made for children aged five or aged ten in addition to thatthe toys and other stuff ,20
10880, need to get bought by the parents and with them agreeing that the product is good for the kid theres nothing wrong with it,2
10881, that some television series can be very educational for the children to learn more about the world or to learn for exaple english but in the age of  the children maybe dont understand the educational television series so it is difficult to find the right serie that you can let your children in front of the television the problem which i can see is that in the television are ,6
10882," many different series which are making your chose for the best serie more difficult
i ",18
10883, that it can be very usefull ,21
10884, the mother is in the kitchen and the father is at work so you can switch the tv on and you can let the children in front of the tv ,1
10885, that they have something to do in such a situation it is ok ,19
10886," that you can cook in calm and you dont have to worry about what to do with the children
but ",1
10887, your children wating tv the whole time it is not good you as a mother or as a fahter have to go outside with the children or play a puzzle or something like that with them it can be very good for your soul and for the children imagination to go outside with them they learn how to play alone in the nature the fresh air ,17
10888, helps the children to be or to stay fit not to get sick when your children ,8
10889," stay in the house and sitting in front of the tv they dont run around and keep fit 
",1
10890, that the tv stop the imagination of the children when they draw they use the imagination ,17
10891," doing something with the hands 

",18
10892, the children in the age of  watch television but it should not be the whole time maybe on sunday afternoon watiching a movie together is a good idea but the rest of the week you can go outside or play cards with the children,1
10893,television advertising is certainly one of the most effective ways of advertising but children dont know how to deal with them and they cant really estimate what the advertisement says in this essay ,0
10894," try to answer the question if it should be allowed to advertise towards young children
many young children wath television and if they watch  television they automaticaly watch television advertisememnts television advertisements are often presented like the product is the best thing that exists if you dont know that tricky way of presentig a product you think i must have that thing and if you have this attitude once you wont ever see the negative things of it again you cant really teach a child that advertisements exagerate a lot ",13
10895, they present a product they wont really believe you if theyve once seen the advertisements young children ,0
10896," often can persuade their parents very well
for the company this must be a good way of advertising products because they can make a lot of money with it if you watch it from the parents perspective it isnt very nice because you have to tell your kids again and again that they cant have that toy and the child thinks that the parents dont like him anymore
",20
10897, a child of the age  shouldnt be wathcing a lot of television anyways if he does ,17
10898, a part of the teaching of the child to show him how to deal with advertisements they should learn that advertisements dont really show the real things and they cant just have anything they want ,0
10899,  because of our luxury standards if we wouldnthave televisions we wouldnt have this problem all in all ,10
10900, you cant just forbid it because fr the companies its a way of making money,23
10901,we know the television is a real problem ,10
10902, it comes to manipulation even adults struggle with it we see new iphones new tablets new furniture and everytime we see it we want to have it more and more it is enough that adults are confronted with this problem why should we ,23
10903," let television manipulate our children
advertising is a huge business in todays society and it makes some brands get extremely popular and rich a lot of money would get lost for brands like playmobil barbie and lego these brands want to do something good for our children but technically they are just stealing our money because they manipulate our children to realy wish they had these toys they see on television most of the time parents cant resist but buy their children what they want because ",2
10904," they want to make them happy in extremely bad cases the children cant stop to wish themselves new toys 
we have bad issues with the unbelievable high consum in our world which is not going to get better if we let television manipulate our children to even buy more stuff 
if we stopped television advertising  it would have ",2
10905, for the brands like a lower sum of income but ,23
10906, the children see toys in a shop they want it anyways ,20
10907, it wont make them exremely less money it would just prevent the ,19
10908," that children should not be manipulated
at the end it would be a huge improvement for the respect towards children because they wont get used for their naivnessthis iswhyi think it should be forbitten to do advertising towards children on television",13
10909,there are a lot of reasons which speak for television advertising  and ,10
10910," with the cons 
 first we have to mention that there are maybe some parents who hate it that her child have the desire to have a product because the child saw it on television
 then we have to say that it should be the last thing to make advertising because which parents want to break the desire of the child
continuing with the pros
 why should we forbide things like that there are ",14
10911," much limitations in our daily life i speak about laws
 ",21
10912, the parents should be enough strict with their parents ,12
10913, desire from their child then the parents can play another film for the chidren ,9
10914," they have time for taking heroin and go to the toilet because of their rectal disfunction 
 bolassi would say it should be legitim to show advertising ",11
10915,the television as we know it is a significant invention and has taken the globe by storm in his beginnings there was not this unbelievable selection of channels from all around the world the opportunities are endless and it is by now not just where to  us there are endless functions ,10
10916, the app netflix you can download without problems and enjoy the latest tv shows and much more but it is not just fun if you decide to watch a movie on a saturday night have you ever count how much time you waste by watching the whole advertising oh dear it is way too much so which ,10
10917," to prevail now

television advertising has become a real problem it is not just about the amount ",10
10918, about the contents throughout the years they reached a whole new image but the biggest problem are the young children who grow up with the myths transfered by marketers little kids are easy to manipulate and develope because of fake information and input a false state of mind about things like success money and fame  the advertise marketers want them to believe everything they say children at the age of  are until ,2
10919, not able to build their own opinion about things ,3
10920, they think the perspective of the marketers and elders is the way they have to look at things and that they ahve to support the same ,3
10921," of view 
it not just about the superficial things they show us on tv screen in life it is about the little things but they never even looked behinde the masquerade why would they they are kids 

there is television advertising for everything toys food games cars everything you could imagine in my eyes it has become a real problem and the negative ",14
10922, television advertising  yound children should not be allowed ,13
10923,watching television today isnt possible without seeing lots of adverts which are trying to convince us to buy or do something people seeing said adverts can ,10
10924," resist them or not this goes for people of all ages my question is shouldnt we teach young children to resist their wishes to buy something they saw on television

first off ",2
10925," which might be bad about television advertising s toddlers 
children are said to be more gullible we all know it someone told us a fantastic story and we instantly believed it because we couldnt know why this shouldnt be true why this person would lie to us its the same with television advertising if someone tells toddlers to buy something ",14
10926, a game because its funny and super cool they would want it because why not but ,20
10927," they cant have it because their parents might say no and they are sad

but i mean why shouldnt they see those adverts about this game they like the parents ",20
10928, take contol over their child and its not like a five year old could even grab his purse and go buy his beloved game no the parents can ,9
10929," say no and teach their kid to not listen to the adverts worst case scenario would be the toddler throws a tantrum but in most situations like this he will calm down and forget about this game
and the parents could even profit from television advertising  their toddler they might see the reaction this game got out of the kid and they know what to buy him for christmas

in my opinion we should educate our children and let them watch those adverts teach them how to resist their urges and its maybe even easier for the parents to know what to give their little one for his birthday or christmas",20
10930,im watching a nice show on tv and suddenly advertising i dont like it but whatever i just switch to another channel but again advertising everywhere those adverts since some years there are even adverts for young children in these following lines ,11
10931," talk if those adverts toward young children should be allowed or not

some ",16
10932, that think why it shouldnt be allowed are for the sakes of the parents young children can be very greedy ,12
10933, it comes to stuff they want so if they see an advert and a toy they ,20
10934, really want in it theyre going to ask the parents to buy it for them and if not they will cry until they get what they want i often did that ,20
10935, i was young but there were no such adverts but now we live in 2016 and everything is obtainable in the internet ,11
10936," its a three step process to buy something and the young children of this generation know that
 
if im honest ",2
10937," it shouldnt be allowed what bad influence can it have for the young children they dont even have to watch these adverts if they dont want to

i dont really mind what kind of adverts they are it just gets on my nerves ",13
10938," they interrupt a good series again and again 

my personal opinion is that they should remove all adverts ",10
10939,as a child i used to watch a lot of televison while watching my favourite series like spongebob or bob the builder every 10 minutes there were television advertisings they were annoying but i ,10
10940, watched all of them usually the advertisings were about the newest playmobile or the babrie which didnt interest me ,10
10941," suddenly there was an advertisment about a spongebob figure which can talk i wanted it i told my paraents about it but they never bought itit was frustrating 
should television advertising directed young childrean be allowed 

well the advertors know that childrean are very influencible if they just show a simple barbie figure a lot of young girls are going to want it or if they produce little cars all the boys are gonna tell their parents to buy it for them and here we have a critical ",16
10942," the childrean dont think much about the money which their parents are spending for them the producers of the advertisments could just crave an amount of money for a simple products which shouldnt cost more than 35 dollars 
but advertors and producers need to get their money from somewhere

",2
10943, televison advertising should be allowed because of the ,15
10944, that others alao need a way to get their money its not the job of the advertors and producers to take care of childrean,13
10945,advertisement is a very present phenomenon it is all over social media everywhere you go there are billboards ,11
10946, big you can not possibly oversee them it is on television in books etc and in this essay ,21
10947," talk about why it is not fine to direct advertimsement directly towards young children
the goal of most spots on tv most billboards and all the other ways you can advertise a product is to make us feel like the product is all we have been looking for the thing we desperately need in our life most of us are ",13
10948, used to advertisement that we do not even notice it anymore but if something catches our attention it is very had to resist the temptation of buying the product at a certain age we should be able to rationally think about our actual need of the product and weather we should buy it or not young children ,2
10949, are not able to do that ,18
10950, all they can think about is that they really want that toy or whatever is being advertised that does not just put the child under a lot of stress ,20
10951, the parents because they might have to deny their child what it wants of course that is a lesson we all have to learn at a certain ,9
10952, in our lives but it is ,21
10953," stressful for the parties involved 
another ",19
10954," is that by making children want something through advertisement the companies the childs vulnerability and naivity to make a profit from it they push senseless consumorism to fill their own pockets and they use impressionable children for it
advertisement is a ",0
10955, effect of capitalism that we have to live with of course not every way of advertisement is bad there is certainly no harm in simply talking about a product ,11
10956, if it is actually useful but sadly most advertisements are very manipulative and ,11
10957, should not be s people who are not able to decide for themselves or think rationally about what their ,12
10958,"a lot of children like to look tv but is this good for young children or should that not be allowed

one ",17
10959, that is should not be allowed is that the parents can not controll what the children watch and that on the tv ist has ,12
10960," a lot of serie that are not good for children 

but ",6
10961, we can say that it has very good and helpful series and that children ,6
10962," can learn something for example a serie in french helps learnig french i know a lot of children how learned a lamguage with series on the television

but the problem is that ",6
10963," children start looking television they can not stop with them they are to young to unterstand that a person can not look the whole day tv and that this isnt good for a person

a ",17
10964, problem is that on the televsion it has a lot of publicity and that the children are perfect victims ,12
10965,"

so my opinion is that televison is cool for children and that they can ",17
10966, learn something but that it is very important to controll the children durant their televison advertising,14
10967,television advertising is more or less a new thing in the past we did not have any television or computer we only bought what we needed but nowadays we live in a comercial world you can buy and sell everything all over the world thats the 21th century so ,10
10968," advertising should be allowed

first of all young children have no money to spend so the parents buy all important things for them the children have no problem with the advertising because they can not buy anything they ",16
10969," too young to understand what they really see on tv

my ",6
10970, young children should not watch tv and in this case we have not any problem with television advertising they just do not see it and ,14
10971," they have other things to learn children should play outside and explore the nature and the life sitting infront of the television is not healthy for their growth  and their education 

and my last ",17
10972," in this essay is that if children do not see the advertise nobody will pay for this advertising service because it would be useless and that creates no money for a company so this hole debate about the permission or not is for nothing big companies can advertise with other things

to put it in a nutshell ",13
10973, we do not need this prohibition companies can do it if they want but ,23
10974, it is useless i want heathy children with experience not stupid tv people go outside explore the world and its secrets but do not raise a new tv generation we live in a democracy and we have a lot of rights for example to advertise so ,17
10975, we need to interrupt this so leave this televison with away and be free,18
10976,television advertising is definitely something that has annoyed everyone of us at some ,15
10977," you are watching a movie and suddenly there is a five to ten minute break filled with those advertisings the question now is if those television spots should be restricted for young children because they are not appropriate for them

young children aged between two and five are ",14
10978, in the state of growing up the whole day long they learn and discover new things in their surroundings so we can say they are highly influencable of course nowaday there are ,8
10979, many brilliant tv shows for young children from which they can learn ,6
10980, many things for instance they can learn how to count to ten or what the different colours are called but obviously in between there are commercial breaks for the newest shoes or a movie that is going to come out soon or even for another new show on tv the children who sit in front of the tv and wait until their show goes on they watch those advertisings and probably going to be influenced by that so if there is a incredible new toy out in stores they run to their parents and beg them to go and buy them that exact toy nevertheless ,8
10981, the advertising is going to be restricted to youg children there is ,16
10982, a high possibility that they will see advertising ,11
10983," their parents are watching some tv shows

i do ",1
10984, with the statement because television advertising has a really bad influence on young children so ,13
10985, it should definitely be banned from television,15
10986,in this essay i am writing wheter ,21
10987," with the statement that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

television for young children offers many different shows from bob the constructor to shaun the sheep a child can find anything it desires to watch on television this does ",13
10988, help a child to widen its knowledge about the world it is now living in ,8
10989," helps it decide what it build his or her own oppinion and lets it decide what it likes or dislikes in the wide range of shows on television

on the other ",6
10990, experience all these things showed on television by itself in real life whish has many ,6
10991," is that it is outside in fresh air and has a way more realistic view on the world than it would have in a living room 

all in all ",18
10992," television advertising  children aged  should be allowed just to help a child grow i mean it did not hurt me

",13
10993,"when you watch tv there are allways breaks where they show advertising on programs for children like super rtl or nikeloden  the advertising is often  they show plays and toys and young children thing that they absolutly want that toy the saw on tv often the children woudnt want that toy if they just seen it in a store but the advertising has a psychologly effect on the children an thats a big problem the children are manipulatet by the advertising in order to do something agantst that manipulation some people say that advertisind  should not be allowed 

the problem with this sentenc is that you often cant see to witch age of children is the advertising a lego advertising is for children from 48 years ",14
10994," its difficult to make it just for children from 58 years also every child is diffrent some children may be more attractet to the advertising for older children 
a ",16
10995, for this problem would be that the tv programs for children dont show advertising an exemple for this would be kika they know that often young children watch their shows and dont want children to be manipulatat by advertising directet to these cildren ,13
10996," they dont show advertising at all

",11
10997, its an good idee and more tv programs should make it like kika because we have to protekt oure children  ,6
10998, that television advertising has influence on all the viewers however ,10
10999, that television advertising has an impact on children from the age  the main reason that forms my opinion is that children at this age start to see the good and the bad i this stage they are very likely to develop the consciousness about their own senses and desires in this age they ,14
11000, state their level of comfort they start being picky about the food they get served because they are aware that spinach has a less plesant taste than candies which are sweet they whine about toys they dont have but is shown on television children at this age these days tend to spend more and more time in watching television that is because the parents of our modern society are having difficulties to balance family and work in order to entertain their children it is easy to just switch on their television at home and like i mentioned ,24
11001, these children are absorbing what one told them ,8
11002," theyre at an age where they start to pick up behaviours from the adults and start to develop a consciousness
and ",24
11003, i believe that there are strict regulations concerning the contents of those advertisements advertisment nowadays should only influence your sense about the commercial matter i believe that advertising has,11
11004,in this world in which we live today we are influenced by many things other people influence us our work has an influence on us and all the little things like television can have a bigger influence than we think they have but through our experience we mostly can know ,21
11005," something has a bad influence on us normally we dont believe erverything and everyone

young children cant have the konwledge which adults have they believe always everything you tell them young children dont have the experience to know what is wrong and what is true ",7
11006, they see things for exmaple in the televiosn advertising the children are influenced by adults the environement and things like televison they dont see ,17
11007, something is not a good thing they always try to act like that what they see so ,3
11008," children see a pretty princess in television they want to be a pretty princess too when they see a man with a gun they want to have a gun too its a pretty dangerous thing young children are too naive to know the differnce between the real life and televison or fantasy

",6
11009, televison advertising  should not be allowed but ,15
11010, its pretty difficult to stop that things like these are everywhere and we cant stop all of these ,19
11011, the parents of the children have to take care what their children see and of what kind of things they should be influenced  ,7
11012,"in my opinion there shouldnt be any restrictions in this regard parents should decide themselves what they expose their children to besides which child at the age of two is gonna be influenced by a commercial it doesnt even understand it therefore the person that is being targeted is the parent so i dont see the difference between this and advertising s adults the child isnt going to be the person that buys the product anyway 

furthermore young children are as easily manipulated as teenagers it would be consistent to ban adverts ",16
11013, let people think what they want to think dont overcommercialize every piece of media that gets in your hands television was only the ,10
11014, i think that there is no difference between adverts directed  and ones who are s older people allow nothing or allow everything   ,11
11015,"

to the question if television advertising s young children should not be allowed we need to disguss their efficiency ",13
11016," well as reasons they should be strictly forbidden
advertising on television directed  are a questionable topic ",15
11017," we dont know how much little children actually understand about the product youre trying to advertise you could spend thousands of dollars on creating a good advertisment for a toy without being sure if the audience is listening to what youre trying to tell them 
on the other ",0
11018, you could direct your advertising towards children with the goal to make their parents like your product because ,0
11019, all it willl be them spending the money and buying something for their children youd have to make sure that adults are enjoying your advertisment ,0
11020," much as young children are to make them want to get your product for their children
an important ",2
11021," of all that advertising might be that little children enjoy watching tv more because they see things they like all the time so if now we would ban any advertising towards young children this problem could be solved in our generation its very important for us to make sure children starting at a young age get outside often enough
creating a new law that bans that kind of advertising wouldnt be exactly fair towards all the labels that are producing things for young children without advertisment on tv there arent many other possibilities for them to sell their products
summarizing this all together ",14
11022," its necessary to ban advertising s young children as longs as there are nice pictures and music in the backround even children  at a very young age like something or dont like something also children wouldnt watch less tv unless they stop showing their favourite show and their parents need to find out somehow what they would like to get their children for christmas 
 
  ",13
11023,the children nowadays get more in touch with electronic machines at a very young age most of the adults say it makes the youth dumb children should more go out and do things ,24
11024," laying around and consuming the youth is getting lazier and they getting more obsessed by these little machines
 
parents say the television is good because you can learn a lot from it but its not that what the kids do they watching cartoons the children learn more of going out and see the world the television ",17
11025, sends out some stuff that probably is not good for a kids body and ,4
11026, the children are young they can learn the most their brain is fresh and they have it easier an adult has more problems with learning spanish ,8
11027, a child with the television you ,17
11028," make the time rush have of your lifetime rushes with the television away in hard words its for the children an addicition in later life they cant without the television more and more time they will sit in front of the television
i have no television at home and ",17
11029, my mother was right for me it makes me angry if i see children with the newest iphone ,9
11030, a child should go out and learn the television is bad and makes people dumb and lazy im ,17
11031," sometimes but most of the time i want to go out every child should have that feeling
",8
11032," look at the question if television advertising  should be allowed 
first of all why should it be forbidden there is television advertising for children in every age there is no ",13
11033, that makes the advertising for the young children in any kind different from the one for older once for example ,16
11034, there is shown fashion advertising on television older children want ,0
11035,what they see this is not about the age of the children further how should little boys and girls know what they want ,12
11036, they dont see it on the television there might be parents that go shopping without their babies so the little girl would never see the dolly she wants then the advertising is ,2
11037," really important for chirstmas the grand parents that dont know the child really well maybe dont know what to offer him so by watching television advertising the child might tell its relatives its wishes 
but ",20
11038, we all know that little children are fascinated by nearly everything so ,24
11039, they see a zoo in the television they want to go to the zoo when they see a little train they want to play with this train also there is a problem ,20
11040, the parents dont have much money and ,9
11041, cant afford to buy many toys children in this age cant understand what it means to have money or no money they just see something they want to have and ,20
11042, they dont get it they get sad and start to cry further little boys and girls dont get any poket money older people can buy things themselves by getting poketmoney or even having a little job ,3
11043, babysitting but for little children in every case the parents or any other relative has to pay for whatever a child wants another problem is that advertising doenst tell the truth mature people know that they can handle with it but ,9
11044, exiting they want to have it immediatly because they cant understand that is is just a lie also because the advertisement is moving and there is maybe music and many colours children might find something interesting just because of the advertising not because they like the actual object for example ,0
11045, i was small i totally wanted to have such a thing with different symbols on it and ,18
11046, you turn it youll never know which symbol is coming but ,18
11047, i didnt want to play with it because ,18
11048," i found it boring 
over all i can say that ",18
11049, think that the advertising directed to children that dont have own money should not be allowed because ,13
11050, this is just a trick to get parents to buy something for their babies that they actually would never have bought if their children wouldnt have seen the advertisiment and ,20
11051, wanted to have it everyone knows how little children are they change their minds every few seconds this is totally normal and allowed because they are children but ,12
11052, it is not fair to direct advertising to children,16
11053," discuss the statement if television advertising to children aged to to five should be forbidden

adevertises are here to make us buy something they try to stimulate our feelings ",13
11054," we might feel in need of the product being advertised and tend to buy it
many parents and child protection organisations say such adds should be forbidden ",2
11055," avoid the creation of consum and desire in our children 
i understand their position ",9
11056, young children get very easily convinced by something and they might feel ultra dependent on the product being promoted but i simply dont se the function of forbidding such advertises in my opinion it is a parents responsibility to teach his child what heshe is allowed to have and at what time that is ,16
11057, a good way to educate the child that he wont get everything he wants ,9
11058, is if we ban adevertises for children aged from 05 they will get to se them at 6 and older the older a person gets the better ,12
11059, it will be more difficult to teach him that he wont get the productuct on the advertise older children do ,24
11060," bear more money what could lead to them just going to the mall and get that product by themselves
therefore i firmly state that advertises for children aged 05 shouldnt be banned it is a good and effective way for parents to teach their children that they wont get anything they se and get them used to se such advertises and dont feel attracted to them ",16
11061,since television has become the number one electronical media for children companies have discovered a new way of advertising chanels like nikelodeon kika and many more are interuptet frequently by advertising breaks should television really be allowed to advertisise young children directly ,14
11062," they have such an big impact on them

many industries profit from the advertising how would  year olds be reached if not over the thelevision many new products have to sell and if people arent interested in them it will cause harm to the economy many adults are glad to know what to gift their children for christmas for their birthday or for other ocasions the ",0
11063," that because of television advertising many children already know what they wish for can be helpful in such situation an other reason why advertising might be a good thing is that the companies pay taxes to the chanels to be able to stream the cemmercials of their products if chanels wouldnt have that source of income some chanels for children would transform into paytv

even thought there might be some positive ",0
11064, of television advertising direct toward young children there are ,14
11065," many disadwantages many companies
have commercial tactics that help them to sell more products children will always want the newest toy and the coolest game such behavior can distress the parents it is ",20
11066," very exepnsive many families simply havent got the money to buy always new toys for their children just to make them confident or make them stop crying  

in my opinion there shouldnt be that much advertising on thelevision not only on chanels for young children ",2
11067,generly speaking advertising is common thing in our society and necessary for companys to sell theire products ,11
11068, in the lates time advertising has got an negative tone people are more and more annoyed by the many posters and spots they see during the day and the idea behind it that they should buy the shown products when it comes to children in gereral people mostly parents are very concerned about what theire children are confronted with by dircting advertisement toward children the companys use tricks to influence the childrens wishes and change theire buying behaviour ,16
11069," they spend more money or in other words they get theire parents and family to spend more

in terms of law specific advertising towards children in young age is completly legal like it is for every other age group speaking about economy it is only fair that companys are alowed to make television advertising s children if they could not do this they would lose much income and were left behind ",14
11070," other companys which is not what our modern economy stands for

speaking about the influence of this advertisement on children there are no evidences that it has an negative influence on children and ",16
11071," it had it is the responsibility of the parents to not let theire children see this form of advertisement 


 ",16
11072,as a young kid at age  you are maybe watching tv your ,6
11073, time mostly these kids are watching special channels made for children at that age like disney channel or else like other normal channels they show cartoons shows and other programs and ,6
11074," or between those programs they show some advertising mostly about five to ten minutes but because they show advertising on a childrens channel they have to adjust those advertisings and show something that fits the viewers age they advertise dolls little toy cars and other things that kids normally like but should these advertising programs be allowed to advertise young children at age 

many children look up to their parents and mostly want to bejust like them they want to develope and become independent just like their parents children like to act as if they are older than they actually are so they ",14
11075, want to watch tv programs with advertising like their parents ,14
11076, they can show how cool they are for that to happen kids ,19
11077," need advertising on their cartoon channels to grow up and develope to a person that can decide alone if they want to buy something or not 
but many kids just want to watch their cartoon series and dont care about advertising they get annoyed by these advertisings and maybe go do something else or even go to their parents because they are bored the parents are ",0
11078, their children always watch advertising and see something they want these parents have to buy these toys to make the kids happy so ,20
11079," the parents get annoyed spending even more money because of advertising 

personally ",2
11080, about the parents who have to buy more toys arevery accurate when i was little and i saw some toy on tv taht looked cool because of the special effects i wanted to have it very badly and my parents got annoyed because i wanted every single one truly kids can be manipulated with these special effects and cool new toys to go to their parents who ,20
11081, have to buy them but i ,18
11082, got annoyed about these advertisings myself because i just wanted to watch spongebob and not advertising about barbie dolls ,11
11083,television advertisement has always been a controverse issue and ,15
11084, it is about their own kids people now a days are very protective advertisement over tv has a big effect on our society there are many studies that can proove that however ,14
11085, you have reached at a certain age you can build your own opinion on something and you can see more clearly what is right and what is wrong for youthat is something that is very different for children between two and five they are ,24
11086, young and dont understand a lot of things in life it is in their natural instinct to automatically believe what they see and hear they usually dont ,7
11087, guess what they are told i can see how this is very helpful for the advertisment market if you think about it they can literally manipulate a whole generation to like something just by showing them positive things about that product on tv during their childhood years i am sure that there are many companies who made a fortune with that stragety however ,2
11088, if i would be a parent that would make me really mad that is almost propaganda and i would not want to have my kid being exposed to that i am realizing just now that that must have been one of the reasons why my mother never let me watch tv ,17
11089, i was young she was protecting me i ,18
11090, think that it is kind of sad that some companies are specifically reaching out  because they know how fast they can make them like their products i wish they would give the kids the freedom to make their own experiences and build their own opinions without trying ,2
11091, hard to influence their desicions on the other ,19
11092, i get it all they are trying to do is to have a sucessful company and to make enough money to pay all their workers ,23
11093, they can feed their families which ,9
11094, makes their children happy when you think about it it is a cycle ,3
11095, this is one of those issues in life that are way more complex ,21
11096, we think and it is very hard to find a ,19
11097,once my sister was four years old she saw an advertising of some barbie stuff all she wanted ,20
11098, was to play with barbie she did not want to go ouside playing with her parents and ,20
11099," my parents just bought this barbie for her

firstly i have to say that money making is a major pro ",20
11100," much parents act like that these advertisings are a big part of the money making system of the concerns because the child has only to cry a little or mock around and voila they have their barbie or superman action figure 

secondly these advertisings dont actually hurt someone if you are against them or dont want your child watch it just turn off the television there is no need in watching these advertisings

lastly for the pro ",14
11101, i think that at the end the child has fun with the toy that is shown in the advertising even ,20
11102," the child dont have to buy it it is not that big of a deal for parents who can afford a television

on the other ",9
11103," children might be to much into the product shown in the advertising for instance if you dont buy the toy to your child they might cry as loud as they can or just mocking around so it is better to remove such advertisins from the tv

now the ",14
11104," is there is no need in having always the newest and mot expensive toys not even  long time ago  children used to play outside and didnt care if they have the best toys they made their toys by themselves

finally my main contra ",20
11105, is that these advertisins show only the good part of their products how many times have i wanted something ,11
11106," i had it it was just a big disapointement  this is the same with these advertising stuff they present it like it is the worlds best toy but the truth is it just isnt

lay and large advertising  should not be allowed it is much better to go and play outside and get used with friends ",20
11107, than playing home allone with a toy that isnt even that good,20
11108,"advertising 

the new medias has changed a lot so ",11
11109," the advertising methods of the companys but is this okay that we do not have the controle over this think and we can not decide if we want to see this stuff or not

the compays use the televison to make their new products famous also a lot of small children see these thinks but this ist not acceptable the parents can not control what their children see in televison there is some advertising you do not want that your kinds see this but you can not all the time look what your children are doingthey become a ba influence from the televison

the kids ",14
11110," do dot know what they see and they do not know what they want but if the kids  see everyday a new toy and the want to play with this the parents have to drive every day to the toysrus this is realy anoing and not useful the stess wich the parents than have nobody want this 

but we ",20
11111," have to say that advertising is a part of our community and is a fixpoint in our lives it is difficult to not allow it and its  a part of being a mother or a father to look what the kids see and what they do not see 

but what makes a smal kid in front of a televison is it realy necessary that the children have to took into this stupid thing the advertising comanys have to use they halthy smartnes and the know what they can show the kids and what not  ",14
11112,"advertising 

imagine your child comes walking up to you just to ask you if you can buy him this really cool toy he saw in the tv at the moment it is allowed to make advertisment towards any kind of age but if we prohibit tv advertising towards young children aged  this situation wont happen to you too 

first it must be said that children younger tahn six shoudlnt be watching tv anyways moreover that more advertisment boosts our economy butyou have to keep in mind that it only brings more money to the toy companies and to be honest do we really wanna help them even more in addition the advertisments help the children to learn to misstrust but there youhave to think if this really is what we want a world lead by misstrust and lies 

however i think that children are to young to decide for themselves if the things they see in the tv are true or false furthermore it ",13
11113, is very easy to influence a children i mean if you teach them a new word they will constantly repeat it and share it with their friends exactly the same happens if children see something in the tv they will go to their friends and tell them about the great toys they saw in the tv  ,7
11114, make advertisment towards their young friends and the advertisment will even influence more young children to the worse children ,7
11115, want to buy whatever they see and alot of parents struggle with the earlier described situation which ,9
11116," is not necessairy to happen to them in there allday life

in conclusion there are alot of strong ",19
11117, but some where better than otherrs for example that the children annoy their paretns with unimportnt things therefore ,7
11118," you shoudlnt show advertisment towards young children
",16
11119,"there are a few reasons why advertising companies aim their adverts at children as a marketing trick

firstly a child is easily influented and is more likely to believe what it sees and what it is told than an adult might be in its naive beliefs a child can get easily attracted by an advertising and that is all an advert is used for if ",16
11120, morning cereals are advertised by a friendly cat and somehow shows that whoever eats them gains supernatural powers what a lot of cereal adverts do in a way a child sees the advert and instantly wants to have them mostly it a subconcious feeling ,0
11121," screaming children in supermarket because they do not get what they desire parents want to calm down their child and buy it

secondly children have a great influence on their parents too if they want something they often do not accept a no instantly and like it is said above a great amount of parents are too annoyed by there screaming kid and fail at calming it down ",2
11122," they do it the easy way and get the child what it wants

",9
11123, that adverts aminig at children should not be allowed because they misuse the children for marketing reasons not to mention that it makes bringing up children a lot more difficult for parents because they have to decide between the two optoins saying no to their beloved child or spending money to calm down their child which brings up extra pressure i have to add that the ,13
11124, option is the harder way but leads to a child that knows what a no means the ,8
11125, a lack of good parenthood and is just a lazy escape from bringing their child up properly from my experience i can say that the ,9
11126, option is not the minority case,21
11127,"television advertising 

as we all know children start watching televiosn at a very young age becasue of that there are ",14
11128," a ton of advertising  for exapmle for a brand new toy or a new flavour of their favorite sweets now the question is if those advertisings  yooung children should not be allowed
at my ",16
11129, of view there is only one ,21
11130, that is against this statement with those advertisings the children get to know all the new stuff that is new  on the market they get an idea of what they could wish themselves for christmas and the advertising companys can make a lot of money with that because who cant resist the big shiny eyes of a cute little child  i know this isnt a good arguement but right now a better one doesnt come ,0
11131, with this statement that those adervtising should not be allowed is from my opinion a really good idea because as ãž already said at the beginnig children start watching televison at a very young age and they shouldnt get overwhelmed with all those new toys etc that they are suppost to need advertising ,14
11132, makes you feel that something is missing in your life and that you cant live without this new anti aging creme presented by a women with a perfect matt younglooking skin children shouldnt feel that way at this very young age its definetly not healthy to always want and mostly ,4
11133," get everything children should learn that you cant always get what you want in life and these
so for the future i hope that those advertisings  are not allowed",16
11134,"the porupose pf this essay is to have a brief look at the above mentioned statment talk about my own oppinion on this subject
television advertinsing has become a big part of watching different episodes on telvesion not only can it be very annoying and stupid ",10
11135, can it be harming for small children as a ,4
11136, mention that television advertising has no ,15
11137, of learining new things or understanding something better there is no ,21
11138," of gaining new knowledge at leat not to small children
 it is said that television advertising can make small children become impatient and loud ",14
11139, their brains are uncapable of storing ,19
11140," much information that they dont need small children have no chance in understanding the language that is being used in different advertisements they are lacking of vovocabulary and they cant find a cotext between the advertisements and daily life 
although there are many negative ",2
11141," talk about some positive ones 
advertising is the marketing of real life products which small children will use someday sowhy not showing and teaching them as early as possible about products they might need someday 
as a last ",0
11142, mention that television advertising will be a ,10
11143, small children will grow up and get older they will be face to face with advertisments ,0
11144," why not start showing advertinsments as soon as possible
by lookimg at the above mentioned ",11
11145, it is clearly to be seen that ,18
11146," television advertising directing to small chiildren is no good idea 
there is simply no ",11
11147, of learing and understanding but more of annoyance and stupidity so i my oppinion television advertings should be forbidden to small children ,14
11148," television advertising dierected toward young children should be be prohibited because they are not mature enough to know what they see and they cant really understand it

also if they already get inducted witch advertisment at such a young age theyre going to be alot easier to manipulate through the media because they are ",13
11149, used to advertisment and media presence its ,11
11150, the advertisment was created to ,11
11151, influence those young children on the other ,7
11152, you could say that because they are ,19
11153, young they wont understand it and ,24
11154, it wont become a problem later and the only thing that would happen is that those children would ask their parents more frequently for a gift and ,9
11155, argue that this could only boost the economy also advertisment is something ,23
11156, common today that it would be really hard to draw a line where it is advertisment especialy designed for young children and ,16
11157, it is ust advertisment for children alot of people probably ,2
11158, dont care because i mean how could advertisment be harmful in any way in my opinion thats exactly the ,11
11159, why its important to prohibit this kind of specialized advertisment even ,11
11160, it isnt harmful its not good to exploit your young child to ,4
11161, much media children need to be able to grow up without already being influenced in such a young age by advertisment or the media ,14
11162, it would be a good idea to ban advertisment designed for children of such a young age and maybe even ban advertisment that is specaly designed for specific groups ,16
11163, we as a society should try to raise our children as independent as possible ,12
11164, they have abilites like critical thinking ,3
11165, we cant let them get exploit to advertisment in such a young age because if they ust watch tv all the time they wont think themself and they ,14
11166, wont question anything they will become mere puppets of the media and we have to prevent that at all cost,19
11167,in the current day and age the usage of advertisments is becoming more and more obnoxious this includes ,11
11168, much more subtle ones one question which often arrises in the discussions surrounding the topic of ads is whether one should be allowed to directly target children with these marketing campaigns while proponents argue for free speech and the right for companies which target children to be equally represented in the media opponents claim that children can be too easily influenced and are ,13
11169," not suitable for direct advertising purposes

the main reason why i do not see a ban on commercials targeted at younger audiences as a suitable measure is ",13
11170, that companies which produce childrens products would be shut out of a market they desperately need to stay profitable a company which is not legally allowed to advertise suffers heavy losses because it is in direct competition ,13
11171," many other companies which aim to offer toys and other entertainment goods which are not banned from advertising their products 
also childrens inability to decide to buy something on their own means that the ads cannot directly lead to a purchase

on the other ",16
11172, they cannot directly buy it they are ,3
11173, able to be influenced by commercials and much more ,10
11174, than adults while they will not buy the goods themselves the pressure exerted on to parents if their child sees a toy he wants to have but the parents cannot afford it is immense banning commercials aimed at children would ,2
11175, reduce that pressure and allow parents ,9
11176," of lower income to surprise their children more and make more decisions regarding the toys their child should play with

from my personal experience the pressure of a young kid who wants to get a toy is not that big of a problem because children that age usually lack the memoric ability to hold on to a wish for a long time and can easily be distracted by another toy therefore ",20
11177, holds as much weight as the proponents leading me to the conclusion that television advertising s young children should remain legal,13
11178,"children are very easy to influence by showing them food toys and other things that they like but do not already have the chance is high that they try to persuade their parents of buying it for them furthermore television for children is made to show them different stories and characters with which they can identify television advertising interrupts these stories and movies children are watching and with that their concentration towards the story or storyboard showing the children more and more of toys that they do not even need makes them addicted to it and has brainwash potential
on the other ",14
11179, advertising is always on television wether it is directed to children or not in this case it would not be wrong to direct advertising ,16
11180, adults it is even more interesting for them advertising can ,16
11181, be found on television but all over the place in many cases it is important to have the skills of reading to understand the meaning which children of five years do not already have with television advertising that includes the written and spoken words ,8
11182, as pictures of the product lets say of a barbie children start to compare the letters and the voice and try to understand it through that reading and auditive understanding are improved the other ,20
11183," is clearly made for the toy and movie industry which produces the products treated in the advertising spots the consumebehaviour of children is totally different than the one of their parents children at an age of five can not really consider wether they need something very bad or not if they have success with convincing their parents of buying the things they want the industry can make a big success out of it

to sum all the ",2
11184, to the statement that it should not be allowed for the reason of influencing children and trimming them to consume more and more of course it depends on the ,4
11185, on the interest but  children should learn on their own to decide if they need something or not and not be brainwashed through funny tvspots with their favourite songs and colours in it,17
11186,nowdays the tv is one of ,10
11187," way to spreat advertisations many people talk about the bad affection of the television advertising on young children

first of all children can be very easily be manipulated whatever comes out of the television children take a example of it if a advertisation for toys comes up children mostly go and begging the parents for it till they buy it thats how the producer sell their expensive toys

secondly the advertisation disturbs the children during watching their favorite serie or a film a children should be able to watch tv without any unnecessary breakes

on the other ",14
11188," it can have positive afffection to the children
there are ",4
11189," advertisations on tv for good things like futher schools etc which can educate the children

",0
11190,this essay is about television advertising  that are aged between  and if such advertising should be allowed or not there are many controversial ,15
11191," which makes people think about the new type of situation we are confronted with at the moment

nowadays technology is used and found everywhere and ",23
11192, getting more modern every time something new is released but does this allow industries to influence our children on buying or more precisely on wanting new stuff through a new method of adevertising parents believe not ,2
11193, for loving parents that are not extremely wealthy and are not able to buy their children everything they wish for makes it just more difficult with this new type of advertising because they know they cannot afford a lot of things that are shown on television they ,2
11194, do not want to tell their children no everytime ,9
11195," they would love to say yes and buy all they desire that is a disappointement for the children that can be prevented

on the other ",9
11196, there are people that think ,19
11197, and claim that it is not that bad children are mostly playing outside and do not watch television all the time ,17
11198, they do not even see the advertising that is shown ,11
11199," will not get influenced in their opinion 

still are parents frightened not just because of the financial situation but the types of advertising there will exist children are actually really easy to read and influence which most of the adults know which is a problem we do not know or are not certain which products or what they actually advertise for surely it will be about toys most of the time but what if not what if it is something dangerous they advertise ",2
11200," the kids should not even think of this is what worries a lot

however do most people not care about this allowance at all this generation is our future and it is not a serious issue that we have to work on right now if they are able to have a good education and the possibility to study and afford things they would like to buy the rest does simply not matter no one will know about that in a few years anymore people should focus on things are important and depending on right now not later

therefore we see there are many different ",9
11201, which show the different sites about advertising toward young children in my opinion it can be allowed but not used that much ,16
11202, we do not influence their behaviour in any way possible children nowadys should ,7
11203," be able to experience a wonderful and carefree childhood like we did
",8
11204,in my opinion this statement doesnt make any sence why should television advertising be bad for young children and why should they even watch it there are hundreds of channels nowadays ,14
11205, they or their parents can easily zap through the channels if they dont want to watch something the television advertising with erotic or brutal components arent streamed during the young children are awake ,17
11206, they cant see them and why should those children want to buy anything showed in the television advertising ,2
11207, they wouldnt even be interested if they are watching their favorite series and dont want to switch the channel they have the possibility to make something else during the advertising since they are children they can play with their siblings or their toys until their series will ,14
11208," actually it doesnt even take a long time the longest advertisings are around 10 minutes 
another ",11
11209," is that the television channels cant control who is watching their program
so they couldnt stream any advertising no more just because a young child may be watching it if they would have to stop showing advertising they wouldnt get the money of the advertisingproducers im sure some channels need this money to keep them existing otherwise there could be a channel less this would make those people mad who watched it and liked it of course the parents can control what their children are watching but they have the full right to decide by themselves what they want to show them and what not to forbid television advertising wouldnt make any sence to me ",13
11210, it would create more problems than it would solve the best option for the channels the advertisingproducers and the people who are watching television is to keep it up how it is at the moment,10
11211,"advertising

a lot of liitle children grow up with a televison and with televsion you ",10
11212, have advertisement some advertisement is good some is bad some people like avdvertisment some notit all depends on the person himself and ,11
11213," you can choose if you want advertisement for your child or not and now the question comes up  is advertising for young children good or not

you have advertisement all over the world for food for clothes for parfumes etc ",16
11214, its impossible that you can grow up without advertisement young children are addicted to advertisement cause if they see something they like in tv they want to have it and you know how little child are they wont stop crying and be bad with you aslong they got it and ,14
11215," companies can manipulate parents with their own childs 

on the ",9
11216, of the companies its a good tool to sell their products because adults wont buy  normaly stuff they dont need and with their childs they have a weak ,2
11217, its sounds really bad but thats the reality and with that weak ,19
11218," companies can sell a lot more products 

on the other ",23
11219, parents want to buy something for their child and with avdvertisement they see what their childs could like but you have ,0
11220," much advertisement for anything that you have problems to check out if this product is even good

on my opinion i would let the companies made some advertisement for young childs just for some companies like toys a rus or franz carl weber or some free time parks like europa parkbut for all other companies it shouldnt be aloud cause these companies wont sell good products for childs they want to sell cheap products for adults and they use the weak ",16
11221,"in my opinion it should not be allowed we live in a time where eveything is advertiesed not deciding wether it is good or bad for humanity
at that age not a single child has the conciousness and knowledge about themselves as much as we do at our age so if it would be allowed we would be brainwashing them by trying to make them want things without them even realizing what it is or what it is used for we know that advertising is a small for of brainwashing for us say adults adolecents it is easy to relativate wether something is good or bad if the things we see on ads are things we need or do not need because we know what we need and what we do not need a young child may not even need that thing and only want it because it sees happy children their age on tv

ads for youg children tho would be sad ",14
11222," that children that age should be used to playing outside playing with friends playing with their parents they should be learing to talk well and not to sit infront of some kind of computer looking at something they do not need if they did need it they would already have it at that age and not socializing

these days a whole bunch of things are online and digital and it is believed that every generation is used to more technology than the last one this is good i think but only if they learn by it brainwashing children by adverts ",8
11223, is not considered very educational and ,4
11224," should not be allowed  

this raises the questions if it were allowed would that generation be completely different from ours
a counterargument for this is that young children like that do not even have the competence to really understand it and they just see some pretty things on tv true but a child between the ages of 2 and 5 really does not understand what they are watching but we underestimate what stays in a young  subconcious without us realizing these things are ",17
11225, much more delicate than we might think on the other ,19
11226," it is fascinating to see hoe fast they catch up and understand connections between different things

",8
11227, i think i would be acceptable to show them cartoons as all shown cartoons on tv are tested and proven to be fine to show young children but not try to talk them into talking their parents into buying them stuff at that age  ,6
11228,in the modern world advertising becomes more and more important you cant step out of your house and not be bombared by dozends of advertisments even the children are nowadays a target because of their influence on their parents ,11
11229," that somewhere there have to be limitations regarding the age 

of course there are some realy good reasons for the advertisments for children these days the content on television is suffering because fewer people watch television than ",13
11230, many people have even refused to own a tv because of the poor content the children channles are ,17
11231," forced to alter their programe somebody has to pay for their cartoons this problem would be solved if companies could make money with them
the economy would ",6
11232," grow because the consumation of goods would grow the society would profit from that
of course the parenting would be a bit more complicated because of the many wisches their children would have 
 
on the other ",9
11233, children would become conditioned from an early age on and woulg probably think twice ,7
11234, they reach their teenage years this on the oter ,24
11235," has a negative effect on the economy and would destroy our financial system because a psychologcal responce to adverisments is crutial these days 
my biggest problem is that the companies manipulate children who are not able to take dessisions ",2
11236," that is a very dangerous development

to conclude there are a lot of ",19
11237, against and some good reasonst for the advertisment allowing ,15
11238, that our society is used to the order and rules of our world and to change such vital things would mean to make dangerous experiments are we really ready to do such things,21
11239,"todays television is full with adertising mostly they are about toys or food for kids they affect them in positive and negative ways and scientists now claim that this advertising should not be allowed

as soon as kids see a new toy in television tehy want to have it as ",14
11240, their parents have to buy it because else their child will not stop crying most of the parents do not want to buy their kids ,9
11241," many things and want that this advertising stops

one positive ",11
11242, of advertising for young children is that the brands which are selling those toys gain a lot of money because every kid wants this new toy and ,0
11243," the televison companys are gaining a lot of money because lots of brands want to make their advertising there

",10
11244, that this advertising should be allowed but maybe their should be less of it ,11
11245, parents should learn how to say no to their kids and children should learn how to accept that no that is an important thing to learn in live and if all this advertising is not there anymore those children will not learn it,13
11246,everyone at the age of  watched television we looked cartoons sports etc our parents did not allwoed us to watch televison ,17
11247, the programm is 18 but ,18
11248, every serie there is an televison advertising which is allwoed to person over 10 ,10
11249," now the question is schould televison advertising  aged  be allwoed or not

on a televison people advertising a couple of items the aim is to sell these products if an young child watch these products and they like it they claim on parents to buy this so the parents get nervoused by their children 
a nother point is that young children follow everything what in televison is shown for example it shows an drink advertisting for sports and you can do life danger things the child would try this danger things 
the last adventages is that an child can change his attitude with worng televison advertising the child is on an age to be grwon up with good attitudes so televesion advertising can change the childs mind 

on the other ",14
11250, there is a one plus ,18
11251, advertisment which is usefull for the child for example there is an advertisment for the drink evian it is showed ,0
11252, people drink water they look younger children want to be young to drink water is ,24
11253," good for health

in my opinion televison advertising should not be allowed ",15
11254, a child should be grown up with parents and not with the telvesion advertisung a parent should give the child the future and good opinions and not the televison advertisments ,17
11255,in our modern society the media is ganing a lot of attention and power with it advertisemtent is ,10
11256, growing and catches our attention through our daily lifes conflicting children with advertisement isnt a new idea or strategy it has made now for decades and ,2
11257, is very effective children who see a new toy on television will be ,20
11258," birthday if requested enough by the high determination of children in their families today make the advertisment  children even more efficent but this is a controversy should parents just buy things that their children like to have or should the parents decide with their grown up mind whats good or bad for their own child 
many believe that advertisement  children is manupulting and stops the developement of the own identity i ",2
11259, think this is not the fault of the advertiser i believe the fault is on the parents ,16
11260, out to their children that they should be critic about television ,17
11261, advertisment by holding a good distance with a critical view advertisement ,11
11262, wont stop a personal development of a kid and ,8
11263, lets him keep his personal freedom ,12
11264,its not good because children are very easy to manipulate so theyre going to ask theyre parents if they could have the thing that has been advertised when the parents dont buy the stuff the children will be angry and it results into an argue in a few situations it could be that the parents just ,2
11265," that the children stop crying this means its good for the company that sells the stuff because they make more money but its not for the parents 

but this ",2
11266, thats against this statement because the children could learn that they cant always have what they want if the parents persist and dont buy them the toys so this would be good for them because they learn a lesson for life but it could ,20
11267, be a good thing because ,21
11268," its christmas time and the parents dont know what they should buy for theyre kids the kids will see something that they like on television and they will say to their parents that they like to have this thing for christmas so the parents know now what to buy 

i would ",20
11269, sometimes it could be hard for the parents and the advertising can manipulate children easy but it depends on the kind of advertising most of the advertised things for kids are just toys ,16
11270," its not a bad thing and the children could learn something from it i dont remember any kind of bad advertising for kids that manipulates them really

so my conclusion is that television advertising toward young children schould be allowed",14
11271,television is media which has been used for many decades it had some bad times and some better times television programes do not have to be bad or deceiving for the audience but it is well known that the media was used for many bad acts which caused  a lot of pain and made the times ,10
11272," they should have been

do ",19
11273, that the television should not advertise no ,15
11274, that advertising is always bad ,11
11275, and other people but the people should be aware that the media is controled by the state or by large companies in my opinion advertising towards children is not always bad but perhaps the parents of the children have to surveile their children more often and better if the parents do their job properly and interfere ,13
11276, the programm is not save for children the advertising should not be of any problem but ,16
11277," that works it does not have to be save or any good for the children because the parents make the decisions if the programm is any good or not and that might be a problem but it does not have to be one

personaly ",9
11278, that i should be asked such a question because i have not watch tv for almost 7 years ,6
11279, i do not know if the advertising got any better or worse in the sense of beeing deceiving towards children without care in my opinion the only down ,16
11280, of not wathcig tv is that i do not realise new trends ,10
11281, as the other people do,21
11282,telvision advertising which is directed a young group like chlidren  has to be handled withe care children in that age can be influenced very easily when a product ist shown to them through tvadvertisment its often done in quite a manipulative way what i mean is the way a product is presented to them all the children in the advertisments are super happy ,14
11283," playing with a new doll they are smiling and giggling playing with there friends and its always great weather everyone wants to have such a life rights for children thats a reality they maybe dont have but they want it to be like that it seems like only with those products one can be happy and have such great fun when they now go to their parents and insist on getting that knew doll or the new lego set young children can be very complicating they often dont let go of their idea and and hardly insist on it with crying shouting and other actions without such comercials one would relive parents from alot of trouble and stress
on the other ",20
11284, if someone has a problem with tvadvertisment just dont let your kids watch tv nowadays kids are spoiled with tech and otherthings anyway which manipulated them the same way ,14
11285," why blame it one the tv
furthermore how should a business producing products for children ",17
11286, show theit product to their targeted client group children that age dont go to town that often or use the internet ore listen to the radio the only thing where they get in contact with the big world of advertisment is television and ,0
11287," we live in a market economy why should such a business not be allowed to place such advertisment if they couldnt revenue might go down people lose their jobs an industry would be destroyes
but how about my own opinion well i dont support the manipulative way some commercials are made but thats how it is if parents cant stand the way their children annoy them in the shops ",15
11288, seeing the products they saw on tv and now lay on the floor and shout that they want that doll maybe one should think about his or hers parenting and the way they raise their kids maybe tvadvertising s that group should be changed and oprimised but not allowing it seems like an overly harsh ,2
11289,"television is a good way to advertise new things but the problem is that a lot of young children watch telvesion and are influenced by those who are directed to them so should this be forbidden in the future

",14
11290, that it does not have to be forbidden in the age form  you do not have a lot of knowledge and you do not understand everything you see in the television so ,6
11291," that young children dont even realize what they are seeing or hearing in an advertisment they only want to see their show and dont care if an advertisement shows up

they maybe only realize something ",13
11292, there comes an advertisement for a toy that seems funny and interesting then they ask their parents if they could have this toy but the child does not have a say in that decision the parent decides if they go buy it or not so ,20
11293," they are influenced by the advertisement they can not go buy it themselves and probably forget about it a week later

so the question should ",11
11294, be if it is worth making an advertisement that is specifically directed  or if it is just a waste of money and time because ,11
11295, that the children get influenced by advertising in a bad way maybe they even get used to it for later and dont get annoyed that easy ,0
11296, they see an advertisement later in life,0
11297,"television advertising should not be allowed toward young children in the age  it is not that complicated to manipulate the children they just see a picture of a new toy and they can not say no to them and cry all the time to have this toy untli the parents cant say no and the children get it 
maybe this is not the same way ",14
11298, the child is two years old ,8
11299, in this age the child can not say specific which toy they want to buy if the toy is there and the child likes this it will play with it ,20
11300," in the age of five it is more complicate 
but ",24
11301," young children in the age  should not be allowed to watch television on their own the mother or father of the child should be there or should define which movie the child can watch 
so ",17
11302, the parents can protect their children of television advertising but my opinion is ,14
11303, that television advertising should not be allowed toward yound children because they can not do something against it ,13
11304," they are to young that they could not believe what people say it is to simple to manipulate such young children that television advertising should be allowed 
it is simple enough to manipulate us or adults and ways to simple to manipuate the children 
so ",2
11305, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed ,15
11306,"television advertising toward young children

advertisment is in our society follows us everywhere and we see it in television placards the internet and magazins they affect us in various ways most of them are for advertising clothes or parfumes for adults but some exist which concern small children between kindergarden and preschool we do not exactly know how it can affect them so the question we must ask ourselves is if it should be allowed to create advertisment s children at such a young age

small children are very naive and they tend to believe everything an adult tells them without any doubts if a grown up man or woman tells them in television something about how great a product is the kids will most certainly believe them they can be influenced much easier than adults in a way their own parents cannot do much against for example ",14
11307," a small boy sees in television between two episodes of his favorite cartoon movie that the newest toy race car can now even climb stairs and he sees how other boys in his age have fun with it he will urgently want this toy and quarrel with his parents and try to force them to buy it for him without regards to the price 

perhaps ",20
11308, nowadays advertisment is such an everyday accompagnant it is important that ,11
11309, children face it in an early stage of their lifes ,7
11310," they can deal with it later in life the parents task is that they inform their kids about commercials and they should show them that you should not everything you see in television take for granted and believe what you see it can be a good thing for young children to learn about such things from an early age 

i ",14
11311, think that it should be allowed to create commercials for young children and they do not have to face adults advertisment which they do not understand in their young age and they often contain sexual pictures which is disturbing for young children i ,13
11312, think that it is a good opportunity for children to learn about deciding what is fake and what is real which they can do well in childrens commercials,0
11313,"in these days almost every family has a tv at home and use it regurarly the most children come in contact with television in a realy young age the grow up with the tv and are influenced by it television advertising toward young children is a normal thing today but should they be allowed to do advertising toward young children 

one ",14
11314," against the advertising is the bad influence they can have one children they can give a worng perspective of the real world they can lead children to think that the things shown in advertising are things they need to be a real girl or boy 

an ",0
11315," that is for the advertising is that the advertising shows things the children maybe need an add for children is almost everytime in a childish way and it can learn them something about the right way to treat other children or persons

the last ",0
11316," witch is against advertising directed  is that it can lead them to buy everthing they see in a add and like they beg to there parents that they want something and start to cry if they dont get it most of the things in the adds they dont need but if they look cool they want it

",0
11317," that television advertising  should not be forbidden but it should be controlled by a organisation of the 

",15
11318,"advertising for children aged 

first of all i do not believe that advertisings for children are really useful for ",16
11319, for the children and the companies ,9
11320, that television advertisings are not good for the development of the children because the influence of the advertisings affects the thinking of the child permanently these advertisings could affect the thinking of a baby for a lifetime on the other ,14
11321, i do not believe that children aged  will get much out of these advertisings children aged  should not watch television the hole day anyway they should go outside and explore their enviroment on the other ,16
11322, i do not believe that this advertisings are worth the money because children between two and five do not watch that much television and they can not go and buy these products from the advertising ,0
11323," their parents will make the choice to buy it or not so the advertising for toys or something else should be adressed to the parents

in the end ",2
11324, the parents are responsible for their child and they should know whats the best for their child ,12
11325, they could decide how often their child watch television so the parents could decide how often the child is confronted with advertisings for children so my opinion is that the advertising for children between two and five should not be forbidden because it would be a unnessecary law beecause ,13
11326, the parents can decide if it is good or not for their child so the parents are responsible for the mental health of the child,4
11327,a child is watching his favourite television programme spongebob during the time hes watching this entertainment programme theres always a lot of advertisement because its during the day the advertisments are explicit produced to reach the interest of the kids for example theres always this nice advertisment for the new edition of the legos but is this acceptable doesnt the kids get manipulated and brung to the ,14
11328, where they want to buy it in the following essay ,23
11329," introduce you into my opinion

advertisment is a huge business today and it has become very essencial the ones who arent good at advertising are going to fall soon advertising has become ",11
11330," important today that it controls a big part of beeing succesful or not but do they have to advertise at kids 

idont believe that its a good thing to advertise infront of young children because they are ",16
11331, easy to manipulate its clear that many businessmen take an ,23
11332, of that its like fishing you just have to present your bait good and you will catch one another ,19
11333, is that you got almost controlled by the advertisments if a child sees the new advertisment of nivea it might think automatically it has to be like the beautiful women in the advertisment in the worst case you get ,16
11334," much controlled of the media that you start questionning yourself and think you have to be like the women in the advertisment i dont believe its good to give the young kids such a feeling it just would be a lost of individuality

so because of the different ",2
11335," say that im supporting a censorship of avertisments for children in the young years















copyright â© 2016",12
11336, the question about advertising directet toward young children is an interesting quesion today because many children watch a lot of television today the adverts are sometimes very stupid and not good for the children but ,16
11337, every company can make some adverts probably its better ,11
11338, you put the adverts who arent good for children ,16
11339, like with love sex and alcohol not between the films or series the children will watch it ,6
11340, doesnt make sense because they wont buy it now you should put some adverts for toys or something like that there that the children want this but ,20
11341, the parents can say if they think the children should watch this ,6
11342, in this age it isnt good to watch to much television they should go out and play on the playground i cant say its bad ,17
11343, they watch television because you can ,17
11344, learn many thing like the language from some kind of films but the problem is that ,18
11345, they watch to much television they dont know the real life the most of this films arent from the same country ,3
11346, see the wrong cultures they lose ,19
11347, he contact to real person and espacally to the family and friends but ,18
11348, i thik the adverts arent the problem the problem is that to many young people watch tv or ,14
11349, use the interent all the time and they dont have a reason to use it they see ,3
11350, many stupid things all the time dont realise the real life ,3
11351, write about television advertising and if it should be prohibited to diect it towards children aged  with pro and cons ,13
11352," of view and how i experienced it as i was a child 

advertisment is part of our every day life werever we go we see it on tv hear it on the radio or pass them on the highway but why is television advertising differently probably because we dont have to have a big imagination and the feelings which they want to connect with the product are more real and more easily to transmit to the audience 

especially for products made for children its one of the easiest way to show it during a break on tv children can be highly influenced by television advertisment as they arent ",14
11353," able to completly  disinguish between real and fake reality and fiction are close together and with their  fantasy and the shown product they want to make it to a part of their own life  

in my opinion its not a necessitiy to prohibit advertisment towards children its part of our society and every one is influenced by it its nearly impossible not to come in contact with any kind of advertisment the only thing parents can do to keep their children partly away is to control what they are watching and to explain the goal of the advertisment 
",14
11354,"television advertising is a thing many of us hate nowadays advertising is to be found everywhere no matter if you are in a cinema or if you read the daily newspaper television advertising is a very extrem topic because of the time most of us spend in front of a television every day and the amound of people possesing televisions television advertising is a very attractiv way to prmote products therefore a lot of companies invest in television advertising promoting their new or old product s their aimed consumers

since young children between 25 are not old enough to understand the sense of advertisment many believe this should be illegal allthough there is deffinitely a ",15
11355, to it this shouldnt affect children in a negative way because thats where the parents have their part to play it is the parents duty to tell a child what it can or should whatch and whats not sensible and ,12
11356, dont allow them to whatch certain thing another ,19
11357, of the opposition to this topic is that the advertising doesnt mean children are forced to buy these things and can ,2
11358," siply not be restricted

my personal vew is ",18
11359,"no television advertising for young children

sadly ",14
11360, young children aged  already watch a lot of tv but should advertisments which address this group of people be allowed ,14
11361," no because there is no need  to address any products at people aged this young
young children should not even be watching television at this age they should go play outside in real life not in front of the tv if there are advertisments addressing them they want to watch tv even more they may see the commercial on a grown up channel and ",16
11362, that a show which is not supposed to be for them sure you can argue that they could only bring these commercials between programs for children in that age but it would ,14
11363, that children in that age are not active consumers when you advertise something to them they can not just go in a store and buy it they have to ask their parents to get it for them so it indirectly would ,2
11364," have to address parents and parents usually will not just get it for their childrens
in addition to that i believe that children will become more of materialists which is not good at any age but ",9
11365, not that young television commercials are  usually for something materialistic ,0
11366, they would learn to only want to own more and more things children should learn to ,9
11367," have fun without or with few toys if you show them advertisments at this age they would learn that they need all these things
in opposition you can say that some advertisments could help them learn some things how to use language or learn about specific products but there are surer other ways they can learn that",24
11368,some companies use advertisements specially directet toward young children they may do this for a lot of even understandable reasons but ,16
11369, some poeple dont think this is a good thing to do its a very discussed topic and ,12
11370," parents are against it but why

television advertising allows you to do a lot with the thing you want to sell that would not be possible in real life using this type of advertising one can basically lie to the people with saying ",14
11371, that a tv or a computer has this or that function ,10
11372, in reality its actually not true this is something you learn ,21
11373, growing up every advertisement is totally exagerated and you should not believe all of it small children dont get this they believe in the things they see so on one ,16
11374," tv advertisements can kind of manipulate children very easy

on the other ",14
11375, these kinds of advertising the ones that manipulate the children can ,16
11376," be used in a positive way the children can be made to do something good for example if their favourite movie character tells them on tv to clean up their room they will more likely do it than if their parents told them even if the whole thing is an advertisement for some kind of trash can it leads the young ones to do something that is good for them

as for my opinion the ",0
11377, seems to have more importance ,21
11378, that small children should be manipulated in any way very little or even never are advertisements meant to do somethiing for the children they are all made to do the same to make people buy the product i can ,16
11379, understand why parents are against it it must be very stressful ,12
11380," their kids beg them to buy something every time they watched tv




",3
11381," for and against television wich advertising direct toward young children

first of all its important to make sure that the children actually learn something by watching television young children can learn extremely fast in compare ",14
11382, they get older they save many things in there brain without actually know it if a tvprogram is just telling bullshit to the children they will ,24
11383, learn bullshit because as a child you will take and use all the information you get from everywhere if a tvprogram shows senseful stuff where children can improve their english knowledge ,6
11384, its good for the learning but there is always the danger of getting addicted to tv if a child is addicted to something like tv its really difficult to take that away from it i remember ,17
11385, i was about five years old i woke up in the middle of the night maybe 300 walked in the televisionroom and watched some tvprograms that we recorded during the day sometimes i just went to a friend watching tv ,6
11386, i told my mum we would play soccer futhermore we dont know that much about what is tv actually doing with us television is existing for about 100 years ,17
11387, humans are existing for more than 10000 years what ,21
11388, say is that our brain and eyes are not made for something like television there is actually a risk to get physicly damaged in different ways by watching too mutch tv or watching tv ,17
11389," if you do this as a young child the damage will be more fatal

at the end ",4
11390, adversting television  is ok aslong the content is senseful and makes children learn something that they can need for their future live and aslong its not too much but ,17
11391, parents have to decide on their own how to handle the risks of getting addicted or physicly damaged by tv,17
11392,nowadays ads are everywhere whether it is on the internet in television or in real life in form of posters etc everyday we are exposed to brands telling us what to do although no one forces us to buy anything there is no way to escape these advertisements and ,11
11393, we might not notice they are constantly influencing us we all are victims of advertisement however we ,11
11394, have the ability to stop that up to a certain degree because almost every adult is able to see things critically and have an own opinion but what about children that have not ,7
11395, learned what is right and what wrong children tend to believe most things they see or hear so ,7
11396, they are watching tv they will probably ,19
11397, believe the advertisements especially at the age of  children are influenced by everything surounding them and it is important that parents think about what environment their children are growing up in so they should ask themselves whom they want their children to be influenced by is it really brands that should teach children what is important in life do we want children to learn that kinder bueno bars are the only thing that will make them happy that they need barbie dolls for complete satisfaction do we want them to be opressed by capitalism and fitted into norms created by a profit orientated unfair and sick society no hence we should defenitely prohibit ads for children under the age of at least five and much ,16
11398, teach them real values despite i ,7
11399, think that children under the age of five shouldnt watch tv at all as it can cause harm to their brains stops their creativity and diminishes their ability to have human relationships  ,17
11400,i believe that there are different methodes how to raise children ,7
11401," they have a good knowledge about how to behave but i really do have a clear opinion about the above mentioned question 

of course there are a lot of young children who do not know how to order in their thougts ",7
11402, watching a more or less scarry movie on the television so ,6
11403, with parents which do not let their sons and daughters near the televison ,17
11404," movies are played for adults

easy scared children should not have full control about  the remote control its ",6
11405," the parents decision whether they want their children in front of the television or not
there are ",17
11406," a lot of channels which shouldnt be shown  because their really just made for the older ones the younger ones wouldnt understand the topic and couldnt learn something about what they have seen the news are not really the best show you could show your children because they would be shocked what is going on in the world because i do assume that they would definetely not understand one single word they would just recognize some terrible pictures

its ",17
11407," really important that they do not sit in front of the television all day they should play more outside because thats how they envelope appropriately

the thing is that technology envelopes every day a little more children which are used to tablets computers and television will have it easier in the future

they could ",17
11408, learn a lot in tlevision i believe there are some cannels for kids where they can learn another language than their mother tongue or they learn how to count how to spell and ,8
11409, the alphabet this can be really usefull and they wouldnt be overwhelmed ,8
11410," they start school

for me it would have been disturbing if my mother would have forbidden me to watch tv because i knew that she liked to watch a movie ",1
11411, if i ad a daughter i would never forbid her to watch television interely i believe they need some rules ,17
11412, they do not get stucked with the shows there is need of a time limit but they have the same right to watch series as i have,6
11413,advertisments are often an issue which is concerning nearly everyone there was a toy you always wanted but never got that toy that was in the advertisment ,11
11414," the episode of whinnie the poh commercals often tend to give false needs but behind the commercials there are companies

companies which often exploit yong children to increase their income whith shotrt clips to manipulate the buying behavior of families those companies always use the same china imported products and give them other brand names and colors to make a ilusion that their product is the most satasfaction giving product if the children do not get the products they want they are just disapointed and unhappy 

on the other ",2
11415, advertisments fo young children are not ,16
11416, effective like advertismens for children aged five to ten there are two reasons why they can not create a craving that is consistent the ,2
11417, one is  that the kid the gets at the moment of watching the advertisment a strong need but is forfeited until the ,0
11418," reason is that infants are not steong enough whith the communication to tell what they want   
",8
11419," that advertising for small children should be prohibited because they can get tricked very easily also the advertises have a great influence on the children because they do want the things that are in the tv spot and if their parents will not buy it they will be disappointed

on the other ",13
11420, children aged  should not watch television at all because the are too young to really get whats going on on the screen and they are overwhelmed very fast so if every parent would know that watching tv at that age is not very healthy for their children and that they should ,17
11421," go out and play with them advertising directet toward toddlers woulnt be a problem because they would never see the adverts

but ",16
11422," the children will not be able to tell whats good for them and what they shoul not like so if there is an advert about plastic guns they can not see that this is a very violent thing and thet they should better let it be the children will be loving the guns displayed on tv because the ads are made to attrackt them

nevertheless adverts towards toddlers are ",14
11423, on the street in shops and in magazines so why should television spots that are made for small children be forbidden even if there will not be any televison ads for children they will ,13
11424," see these ads only that they are printet and no longer on television

in conclusion i strongly ",11
11425, with advertising directet toward toddlers because as i said they can get tricked very easily and the ads do have a great influence on them even if they dont watch television very often they will come across spots that are directet to them ,16
11426, we should prevent that they are going to love gunviolence only because they saw several advertises about plastic guns,3
11427, off the advertisting cant have a big impact on the children ,16
11428, they are far more interested in the show they are watching anyway even ,3
11429, young children are more easily influenced the only thing they can do afterwards is annoy their parents with what they want maybe the early tv advertising even is a good thing as it teaches them that they cant always get everthing and they get used to adverts at a young age this is ,2
11430, the whole world is full of adverts and things you could possibly need ,11
11431, you cant protect your child from every sort of advertsbecause if it is banned from tv there will always be other forms of manipulation in everyday life also children cant go and buy stuff on their own they ,13
11432," have to convince their parents that they really need and want it that they can get it this assures that the parents approve of it and that the adverted product cant harm their child 
",2
11433," as a new parent you have to learn how to deal with a childs wishes so television advertising might even be good in some kind of way it helps to teach children how to deal with overwhelming impressions of things that are made more important than they actually are and they teach parents how to  talk their children out of something they dont even need 
but as to everything there sure are bad ",14
11434, to this especially children with rich parents could get anything advertised in tv which would lead to many spoiled kids later in their lifes they could have a problem balancing their finances the discussions about whether the kid should get the advertised thing or not could escalate into ,14
11435, between parents or parents and kids quickly in extreme cases this could lead to an unhealthy family relationship but ,7
11436," those kind of things are only exeptional
so overall ",21
11437, television advertising doesnt harm children and hasnt got a strong influence on their lives and because of that i ,14
11438,"should television advertising  young childer aged  or should it be prohibited

a reason why it is okay that childerns look advertising is that they live in a world where the televison and the media has a very important part in our lives  ",13
11439," if you live in europa or usa  and you everywhere see televisons you have to be confronted with the tecnology and learn how the deal with it
 
an other reason is that childs get influid really easy the believe everything they see so if the things that they got showed arent good or the only want to manipulate and convice the childs of buying these things it is a really bad infulence

on one hand the advertising can help to find out what you like or doesnt like for example if they see a horse in the televsion its possible that they start liking horses its away to find outwhat you like and what not 

on the other ",14
11440," in the advertising are many stereotypes like the girls like playing with barbies and boys lke playing with strong soldieres castels etc
its in this moment were the childrens get introduced in the societyits a bit like they couldnt choose what they like they see young boys playing with a dragon ",20
11441, want to play with a dragon the same happens with the girls but with barbies ,20
11442, think it okay that advertising is  childerns but in a controled way there has to be  always someone who tells the childerns that what they see is not everything in live and that a boy ,16
11443, can play with barbies if he want to there are very much more reasons and ,20
11444, in favor and not in favor but i think advertising should be prohibited if the goal of theclip is to manipulate and convice the childs because that is really iresponsible its a way to abuse of the childs,16
11445,i dare say that it nowadays it is quite normal to watch tv it ,17
11446," is a source of entertainment but the frequent advertisement can be extremely annoying but event worse it has been claimed that viewers can be unconsciously influencned by this and that it can be harmful for children thus discussions are led to find out whether children should be allowed to watch television or not 

recent studies have revealed that people who watch advertisements tend to buy the products which they have seen ",14
11447, than other products by streaming the advertisement on television over and over again viewers might build up an unattended relationship with the product ,11
11448," they would not have done this if they didnt watch these advertisements especially younger children are not able to resist that temptation 
on the other ",16
11449," should receive information about newer products it is the parents who are responsible for their children and they should not give them everything that they want or that they have seen on tv 

also it is claimed that children are more risked to become addicted than grown ups as they watch more tv they will ",17
11450, be more confronted with advertisement that is s them on the other ,11
11451, children sometimes adore to watch the advertisements as they ,0
11452," want to know whats on the market so actually they do want to watch the advertisement they arent forced to watch it 

my ",11
11453," can be influenced quicker than older peopole therefore advertisment s them should be regulated without being totally forbidden even more important is that the parents are aware of that their kids can be influenced they should not allow their children to watch tv literally all the time they are responsible to dose the duration healthily 

",14
11454,children at the age of  can be impressed and influenced very easy companies want to reach the individual person to buy their product and companies that direct their advertisements towards the children use them to reach the parents because parents are the ones with the money not the children but parents would never see a toy on tv and say i have to buy that ,0
11455, these companies need a stream to reach their customers a child is influenced by an advertisement and the parents are influenced by their child and ,0
11456, the parents buy the product the idea of this would be good but it might damage social ,9
11457, of the children they cannot seperate advertisements and normal tv shows from reality for example a child sees an advertisement of a sad person that gets happy with chocolate and ,14
11458, the child is sad at the moment it tries out that chocolate and gets happy again in the time the kid is eating its chocolate its getting happy again but maybe only because it forgot why it was sad not caused by the chocolate the only thing the child will remember is that it was unhappy until it ate chocolate and from now on the child will always eat chocolate ,8
11459, its sad or angry or depressed that was just an example who knows if it has serious ,18
11460, and the child will be extremly overweight in the future but it can really influence what the child thinks and can have higher damages in the future ,4
11461, that the companies should wait until the child really understands the meaning of advertisements ,13
11462,"first of all television advertising means all the adds during the break of a film now the question is is it legal to direct one of those adds toward children

now ",14
11463, that the young children are much more easy to influence them ,7
11464, its a clever marketing strategy of those big concerns ,23
11465, lego or other things like that and which parent wouldnt love to buy to their child the newest action figure or comic or whatever its ,20
11466, the charg of the tv channel which adds they bring at wich time but ,10
11467, its their right to place those add spots at the right moment ,19
11468, that as many children as possible are watching tv its ,17
11469, a question of money its obviously that the channel gets more money ,10
11470," they put the adds at the time the concerns wants 

on the other ",19
11471, its not correct to use young children as a moneysource and ,9
11472, maybe to make the family poor or less rich it ,9
11473, depends on what they are selling many concerns sell stuff that is getting better and better every month and ,23
11474, every child wants to have always the newest one so ,24
11475," its manipulation and iss a really dirty strategy 

all in all my opinion is not clearly ",21
11476, are the parents its their challenge to dont let their children watch to often tv ,17
11477, its llegal to direct advertising toward young children ,0
11478, it cant contain erotic stuff or something like that,18
11479,in this day and age advertisments are all around useverywhere we go we can ,11
11480, see them or hear them with the use of hoardings banners internet media radio or television it is almost impossible to avoid them advertisments can play a big part in our lives ,11
11481, they can influence one in a negative or positive way but is it really a good idea to let young children be influenced by it ,7
11482," through televison advertising 
young children havent developed fully and arent really educated ",14
11483, televison advertising has a bigger influence on youngsters ,14
11484, on adults children tend to believe everything one says on televison there are many children who spend a lot of time infront of the tv and parents do not really pay attention to what their children are watching it can be quiet dangerous and it could ,17
11485," have a long lasting impact on the childrens future life advertisments can be alluring and come over as really good but sometimes they are just a trap a sham to make the companies rich advertising child toys is probably one of the most succesfull ways to make loads of money when children see a new cool toy or game on tv they automatically want it they could start to beg their parents for money and it   could put families who are financially unstable in a corner because they want their children to be happy 
televison advertising or any kind of advertising could be dangerous for small children ",0
11486, i suggest that they ban it or at least make less advertisments for children ,16
11487,today it is normal that ,18
11488, very young children watch television it is just a simple way that the children are calm and parents have time for other things in the tv there are advertising  but is it a good thing to put little children on the couch and let them learn something in the television and ,17
11489," they were influenced from special advertising

to sell toys it is a good way to show them in the tv an ",20
11490, for the advertising is that it is the opinion of the parents to let the children watch tv if they dont like the advertising they should use the time with the children without watching television ,14
11491," the companys need commercials to sell the products 

an ",11
11492, against is that in the tv children could learn a lot with special series but there are breaks and a lot of influencig of the children with commercials they have to watch it and it isnt fair that ,17
11493," young children are already influecend from the television advertising they cant have an own opinion and this is bad for our society

in my opinion tv advertising  is not a good thing but the companys need it to sell their products i wouldnt support it but ",14
11494," you dont want the influence of it for your children they shouldnt watch television but the parents should think abour it and make how they want in the end it is just an opinion of the parents because the children are to little 
",17
11495, television advertising  its very bad for them for example there is a clip about playmobil and a young child sees it they want to have it ,2
11496, much they go to their parents and ask them again and again until they have this toy but ,20
11497, the dont get it they will be mad and angry so ,3
11498," they wouldnt have shown this clip on the television the child wouldnt even wanted to have it 
so actually its bad for kids because they think they need something they dont really need and their parents have to buy it to dont make their children mad
and there are ",2
11499," adverts which arent really good for kids to see them there are often nearly naked people which isnt nice too see at the age of 

but ",16
11500, you are the seller of this toy or of something else kids would love to have its a good way for you to show advert in teleevision because young kids believe or admire the things in the tv and theyre ,20
11501," easy to influence maybe not all but most of them so its a good way to sell your things

in my opinion there shouldnt be ",23
11502, much advert in tv a little bit maybe at the evening or in the night ,10
11503, the kids are in their beds already would be okay or even better ,1
11504, in the parents hands if they dont want their children to see all the adverts that they dont let their children watch ,13
11505,"it is widely maintained that tv advertisements are seen every day on the tv program more and more brand are getting used to know that advertisments who are  are more efficent than advertisements who are directed to elder children studies have proven that young children aged to two and five years will insist on buying the things they see on tv than elder children who are more elevaged due to this reason the advertisements are economical more efficient

on the one ",0
11506, most of the parents will ,9
11507, that the adverts should be forbidden these are mind tricks to get the children with the parent to the shop and buy all the things they saw in the advert even if the parents deny on buying all these toys and foods the children will insist and even cry so the parent has no chance and he must buy the things his child wishes the ,13
11508," of the parents are understandable the adverts are really mean these young children dont have an understanding about money or other possesions if they want something theyll get it

in the other ",16
11509," these adverts are very efficient they are directed to the young children most of the money from adverts come from whom who are directed  they are the one you can easily influence they will
instist on everything and the parent will buy them everything to make their child happy until now there arent any laws opposing to that the brands can make a lot of money until there will be made a law from the government

all in all it is to say that these adverts are really good on the economical ",0
11510, the brands can make a lot of profit ,23
11511, they are advertising directly to the children the parents and other activists arent keen on that these adverts are really mean because they are directed to children the parents cant say no the hole time they cant deny to their young child who insists the hole time these adverts should be forbidden,16
11512,during our childhood we all saw some kind of advertising more often than not very flashy and brightly coloured they came in between parts of our favourite cartoons and wanted us to buy some new toy im here today to discuss wether or not television advertising directer towards young children aged  should not be allowed i personnally ,14
11513, most of the time it doesnt interest them on the ,3
11514," they dont have any money third they could be easily influenced in their lifechoices

first thing is children usually dont care about advertisements because they watch tv to see other things i concede that the doubtful choices of colour can attract the eyes of the children but ",2
11515, it doesnt hold their interest anymore for example ,3
11516, i was a kid i watched cartoons on tv and i was always annoyed ,6
11517, suddenly some kind of advertising popped up and cut my emission in two if not more parts on conclusion advertisements arent useful ,11
11518," the target doesnt want them here

secondly kids cant buy anything without their parents thus the advertising doesnt make any sense if the decision to buy doesnt depend on the target of it to exemplify ",2
11519, take a fouryearold who saw something on tv about how cool the new gameboy is the child goes up to her parents and beg them to go get one they say no and the little girl cant do anything about it this proves that this way of acquiering new buyers isnt effective because ,23
11520," the will to buy is here the targeted audience doesnt always have the possibility to get the product

last but not least if a child is overwhelmed by pictures of what heshe has to buy as a boy or as a girl it sends the wrong message to them it conditions them to think that a woman has to do the chores and take care of the house and loves pink by the way and that a man has to be strong to love building things and to play war i know some kids that once into teenagehood discovered that they could do what they wanted tv advertising is wrong because it perpetuates the stereotypes of our society

in conclusion ",14
11521," say that it isnt useful be

",23
11522,television advertising is just a method of many to get people in the store ,10
11523, it should be allowed to make televison advertising directed twoard young children if there are companies which want to spend money ,13
11524, there is no reason against it ,21
11525, because i believe that childrens aged  should not be in front of a televison so no childrens that young would see such comemrcials i suppose that the impact of those commercials are not huge because it is not the childrens who decide to buy it or not parents should be responsible that their kids cannot get affected by such stupid commercials companies should think about what commercial they will do and who gets directed ,14
11526, it is wrong to do televison advertising  because the childrens should not be in front of a television or at least not completly alone children that age cannot decide from what they get affectet but teir parents can and should avoid stupid things it is alright if childrens watch a episode from their favourite serie but it is absolutly not okey if childrens watch four houres in my opinion it is better to do advertising for such young children ,14
11527, do advertising for adults on a channel that is manly watched from childrens,16
11528,"television advertising

television advertising s young children aged  should not be allowed this is a clear statement but should we really forbid this kind of advertisement

on one ",13
11529, it is easy to say you shouldnt advertise your products to a target audience that is aged between  years old simply because they are easy to influence and it would be unfair and not right to tell them what they should like and should want but ,16
11530, tv advertising clearly works on grown up humans we ,10
11531," let ourselves be convinced by advertisements on what we should like and what not what we should want and what not so shouldnt we ban all advertisements

a ",15
11532," would be that if we really banned ads for children between two and five years old a lot of people would lose their job first of all all these people engaged in these ads would lose their jobs camera men directors people who write jingles advertising companies even the tv station who would show these ads would have to find something new to fill this spot and lets not forget about the people who are advertising this product companies who produce games or barbies etc for small children would have to close because if they are not allowed to advertise their product they arent going to sell it well enough to survive a lot of these companies would have to close and with that thousands of people would lose their job

a ",13
11533, would be that children aged between two and five years old should not be let watching tv a lot especially because of medical reasons if the parents dont want them to be exposed to tv ads they can ,13
11534," show them movies without any advertisment in them

to conclude i have to say that im not a big fan of tv advertisements i didnt like them as a child and i dont like them now as an adult yes you are easy to influence ",0
11535, you are a kid but ,18
11536, are we as adults the big problem i see is that advertising has grown into a huge industry you cant just tell them they should stop targeting little children with their ads they will simply switch target to the mothers or fathers i myself think that it is good to be exposed to advertising as a child youll learn quicker that you dont always get what is promised to you in ads and ,16
11537, it will help you later on in your life to not always believe evrything that is being told to you is true its better to get used to it early on than just being isolated from the world we live in and once you are an adult away from home you fall for advertisements and have to learn it the hard way late in your life,0
11538,"why not companies need to sell their products somehow and who should they show their products to if not to the one who will eventually use them a child who sees a advertisment for a toy does often want to have it of course they wont get every single toy the see on tv but on christmas or their birthday they will probably have many know what to wish for

also the ",0
11539," that the child wont have all the shown toys will make it learn that in life you wont be able to have everything you want immediately or at all and they will appreciate the gifts given to them even more

depending on what the advertisement is for it can give the children some inspiration of what to do the generation of children is growing up with ",0
11540, many technological advices like cellphones tablets etc that they dont know anything else than playing a game on their mothers phone in advertisement children are often shown playing outdoor with each other which is ,24
11541, very important for their social development  ,8
11542,"are children to naive to have their own advertising 

kinderschokolade  mcdonalds and many other companies are doing television advertising manly  now some people question the society if it shoul be allowed to exist or maybe it would be better if happy meal and co is banished from the televisions 

its certainly true that children  especialy of the age of  are easly manipulated to various parts but gives this us the right to stop commercials only because our child is to naive to understand it  

let us take the example of mcdonalds and the happy meal every view months mcdonalds is brining a new toy for the happy meal on the market for sure it is a way to sell more because everyones knows that children like to collect surely now in some parents heads an alarm in rining and saying it is not good to eat with the children often in mcdonalds and that it maybe is even evil but we should be faire with each other if an super healthy foord concern would be able to pack our childs interesst as much as mcdonalds do we all would be super happy and noone would be against it 

the same goes with kinderschokolade if they were not chocolate but ",2
11543, tomatoes or carrotsticks would be ,18
11544," be against it too imagine a super healthy and happy child on the package and insidesome yummy carrots certainly it would be a huge succes 

france as an example in television advertising had brought this theme to a whole new level they must write at the bottom of every commercial a sentence like   try to not eat during meals  or  try to advoide eating to salty or to fatty food  and ",2
11545, on thats a way too ,18
11546, solve the problem and to ,18
11547," not forbidding a comercial

in my opinion it should be absolutly allowed to direct commercials  towards young children it is way of bussines and marceting and it should be the responsibility of the parents to watch over a childs behavior or like in my examples eating habbits  but if we should be chaning something i think france is doing it quite good with the sentences at the bottom ",13
11548, not every child can read them ,24
11549," television advertising is the only way to influence a child to eat healty and to have a stable life


",14
11550,nowadays television advertising is a very important marketing tool they are made carefully and it is supposed to convince the audience to have a desire for the product they are advertising for ads can influence a person emotionally and inspire them easily its something visual and ,10
11551," people can fall for the ads even easier because we like to believe in what we see 
children like to spend time in front of the tv and watch cartoon all day certainly they are not going to switch the programs because they are way too excited for the following one and ",14
11552, the kids are waiting for the ,24
11553, cartoon advertisements will show up which is actually not a bad thing because they are sometimes quite entertaining ,11
11554, all those ads give the young people a desire to get those products ,0
11555, they are going grocery shopping with their parents depending on the childs personality it can react dramatically if the parents refuse to get them a toy they have seen on the tv but there are ,20
11556, parents who want to make their kid as happy as possible and keep getting them whatever they want which will make the young children spoiled without them realizing at that young age  although at the end it depends on how parents are taking actions towards different types of ads and how they are going to deal with the desire which their child got from television advertising now that i mentioned different types of ads ,14
11557," say a few things about it
myself ive never experienced any bad influence from a tv advertisement and i believe that people make sure that most children program are safe to watch however there are ",14
11558, very inspirational ads ive seen in my life ,11
11559, an insurance advertisement which can be very touching i remember crying because of an advertisement from an asian insurance company if people will support the company is our decision but at the end i ,11
11560, learnt something out of that advertisement what i am trying to say is with ads you can basically talk to people all over the world over the tv screen or any other types of screens thats why ,11
11561," it should be forbidden for kids to watch television advertisements 
to sum up television advertising can influence peoples mind easily but how we are going to act ",13
11562, watching it is our decision and the parents responsibility ,12
11563,television advertising is a good method to convince customers about certain products to buy them children do ,0
11564," watch television and there are advertisments s them

in my opinion advertisements like that should be allowed because advertisments are usually positive and do not scare children the only problem would be if the advertisment scares the children if it doesnt i dont see any negative ",16
11565, about the advertisments i have to admit that it is quite difficult to ,11
11566, in their younger years humans want to play something and with advertiments children might be able to discover something new eg playmobil lego furthermore with new technologies like swisscom tv it is possible to skip advertisments ,0
11567, children usually wont watch advertisments by the way i would never ever make an advertisment for children aged  because these children are normally not able to convince their parents to buy a product ,16
11568," young are the wrong target group

to sum it up advertisments for young children should be allowed if they arent scary because that might have a negative effect on them but ",16
11569, it is absolutely fine to make advertisment for children aged  because there is no other negative ,16
11570, nevertheless as mentioned i would never make television advertising for this target group because usually these children arent able to convince their parents about a product ,0
11571,since the drastical change of the industrial revolution and the ,23
11572, of the modern era mankind started to consume more and more not only products which are essential for the survival like food and drinks ,23
11573, luxuries started to become everyday consumables with this drastic change a whole new science got the spotlight of univerities and scientists the economical sciences today we are used to being confronted by flashy and intriguing advertisments with every step we take and people of all ages from toddlers to pensioneers are targeted by a vast variety of companies in this essay ,23
11574," discuss the moral behind advertisment aimed towards children between two and five and if there are any risks that need to be taken into consideration

on one ",16
11575, it seems perfectly logical to aim advertisments towards the need of little children reproduction has been essential for the survival of every living being and by adapting and adding this special stage of our life to the laws of economic we ,16
11576, create a bigger benefit for the market as whole but we ,23
11577, support families and toddlers where there is a need for knowledge or help ,9
11578, if the kid suffers from minor medical issues and the parents are not capable of finding a ,9
11579," are guardians and protectors of the kid and as grownup individuals are capable of saving their children from dangerous influences and deciding what is best for their wellbeing

on the other ",7
11580, does the age not tell you anything about the maturity and knowledge of a person even parents can be tricked by sly companies with goodlooking advertisments nobody but the little child himself would have to bear the ,2
11581, of such a fraud and as a fragile being the worst possible outcome is certainly the death of the infant another ,9
11582, agains advertisment for toddlers is that advertisment create a false image of society during 18 years kids and teenagers are tought moral standards but the deepest rooted ones are the ones created in the early childhood its not possible to let companies control and educate the consumers of the ,16
11583," it brings a high risk to destabilize the whole market

in consideration of everything i have to say that it is delusional to think one could exclude toddlersand their consumables from the market but there certainly is a need for various people and institutions ",2
11584, parents or the state itself to control this advertisment and make sure it does not cross a line or starts acting out of pure greed for benefit as always its a fragile equilibrium that needs to be supported by everyone,16
11585," about allowing and not allowing television advertising  the question is which are more  important than the others

in case that children at that age should not be watching television ",13
11586, that there is not a reason to forbid television advertising s them the parents themselves are responsive for their children and ,13
11587," they do not want that their children are influenced by advertising they should not let them watch television

but considering that nowadays television and mobile devices ",14
11588, are getting more and more important there maybe is the wish of having some laws to protect the children they are very fast greatly influenced by almost everything but it is obvious that a child of two years can not even realise what it is watching there so this ,12
11589," is not that strong as it seems 

another ",21
11590, to let this advertising allowed is that buying things supports the local economy of course children at that age are not having as much influence at this as other generations like teenagers ,16
11591," but in some degrees they maybe could help with their wish to have everything they see 

so ",3
11592, there are wether more good nor more bad ,21
11593, thing should be that children at that age should be playing and not watching televison because ,17
11594, the advertising does not matter,11
11595,nowadays television is a very important topic especially ,10
11596, it comes to small children watching tv along with the tv program there comes a huge amount of adverstising many people say that watching television in young age should be forbidden anyways some parents let their kids watch tv too early ,17
11597, and the kids are confronted with adult advertisement ,16
11598, late at night few may have the opinion that a regulated amount of tv a day does not harm their child ,17
11599," watching tv with their children like that parents can control unwanted advertisig and channels and turn of or change the progam if the content is inapropriate 
todays advertising is full of things that might let kids get in touch with social media too early dating websites computer game advertising can often be dagerous ang kids can get wrong ideas of social life 

talking about problems with advertising i ",14
11600," think that kids should not even watch television with five or six years old except for child programs 
those do not show any inapropriate content that might scare or disturb kids of young age i would not let my four year old child watch tv unattendedly just because i know how weird advertising can be sometimes",17
11601, everyone of us knows this funny creative and inspiring advertising videos in the television usually we have a advertissment in mind ,11
11602," thinking of a particular product we get to know new stuff through television and it feels like advertising is a powerful weapon when i was a kid i saw all these beautiful musthaves and i was thinking why cant i have to have this and that is how probably every kid thinks but what influence does it have through the day does it change our way of living in a positive or negative direction or do we do not change at all is it bad letting kids seeing such things or is it okay 

a positiv ",0
11603, is that kids get to learn to handle things they could havebut should not have that is education because ,8
11604,  many things they have to realise and to learn that they have enough and that they do not need more  you can not hide everything from your kids in specific space they have the oportunity to grow a disatvantage is that if they do not have any parents looking ,24
11605," them who actively decide what their daughter or son is allowed to do or have it would be highly possible that they get badly influenced by what they see especially their social activities would get disturbed

all in all i believe kids being ",7
11606, young should not sit in front of the screen they should ,24
11607, learn to enjoy what they have around them and not focuse on nonrealistic virtuell entertainment in my opinion if there is a kid watching television with this age no one has to pay attention or has to change anything because ,17
11608, you do not know which series this child is skipping through ,6
11609, you will never have a hundert percent control over the different kids ad the lessons and experiences they learn and make through the television as you may already heard of the television companies earn their money through advertisment if it would be forbidden to show such short videos television would not exist anymore or we would have to pay a lot of money summing up there is totally no reason to do anything differently this should not be the thing we should fix our eyes on,17
11610,already between the age of two and five years we have a huge problem with the children they are sitting in front of the television watching their favorite series without communicating to other young poeple at all there would be a lot of postitive ,17
11611," putting a sign and say thats not allowed to watch tv for children between two and five they would automatically prefer playing oustide and making friends not only that if we know whats happening in the tv show sometimes we should really change the rules  


but ",17
11612, the series of small children on superrtl or something like that is a good ,6
11613, for the imaganition and the phantasy they even learn something by watching tv and thats the positive ,6
11614," of it not only this its a kind of living into the aged person they already know how to use it 
on my opinion it shouldnt be changed a lot but it should be controlled strictly by the parents the children may watch maybe only a half an hour per day or something like that bacause the most impotant thing in life is communicating to other pepole you cannot afford poeple to watch tv they should realize themselfe where they should stop thats just a kind of human intelligence and ",17
11615, it shouldnt be changed anything     ,19
11616,we have a number of questions to ask ourselves ,21
11617, examining this statement is the child being psychologically harmed and is it moral to indoctrinate and influence a child of such a young age ,7
11618, it is moral to indoctrinate people through television advertising at any age why because  ,14
11619, who we are and what we think is always a result of our surroundings even talking to someone is a form of indoctrination it is basically impossible to forbid indoctrination if you take a look at how many children are forced to go to church on sundays where they are taught to believe ,7
11620, than to think or at school where you are taught to obey and be disciplined fox news ,7
11621, this form of indoctrination to me is simply disgusting a political agenda covered up as news and ,12
11622, we are constantly being bombarded by other peoples beliefs and what they think so ,21
11623," thing is to learn to think for ourselves that is the only way to resist indoctrination
anyway at the age of  ",7
11624, you cant really think for yourself and ,21
11625, you rely on good people to take care of you ,18
11626, it is harmful to watch an advertisement because at that age you couldnt care less what the telly tells you it is far more important what your parents say and how you are treated at home,14
11627,"the advertising  in television

it is clear that nowadays where more and more children are alone at home ",14
11628," their parents are working they often spend this time with the television running in the background or even actively while they are doing this it is early evening or even afternoon the channels realised that and send advertisments suitable for a childs eyes they love to see the brandnew lego or playmobil sets and spend hours imaging how it would be to have such a set as soon as their parents arrive at home they try to convince them to buy such a thing for their child
many people claim now that it is mean and rude from the televison channels that they bring such a problem to the homes of young families but i have to say that these channels make it exactly correct what should they advertise if not playing things for children it is the time of the day where mostly young human beings watch tv and the advertisments for typical adult things like razor blades or new films would make absolutely no sense as young children would be scared of the trailers the objectivity of an advertisment is thath the product will be bought more often and this can only be generated if the people who can and will buy the product will watch the advertisement
to the people who say that it should not be allowed to make typical children advertisements i can only recommend to visit such a channel headquarter where they decide what how and ",14
11629," they advertise their products 
on the other ",11
11630, i can understand the problem the parents face because it is really mean for them if their children come everyday with a ney tow they want to buy another factor is that these advertisements often show things like special effects which the actual product will never be able to do so ,2
11631," the children get frustrated and angry and this is not what a parent wants

my final conclusion is that it should not be forbidden because ",12
11632," it would even get worse
",19
11633,in the current time it is normal if there is much advertising on tv and there are ,10
11634, not many rules about how the companies have to do their advertisings the television advertising should not be allowed to be  because influencing them with advertising is not ethical acceptable in the following ,15
11635, of allowing television advertising  the most important ,15
11636, is that the companies want to influence young people for getting profit of them or their parents this is the sellingtactic of the most companies of the world but ,2
11637, showing kids television advertising is much more effective than showing the same television advertising older people secondly it is ,14
11638," well for the economics the more younger people watching television advertising and are buying the products the more jobs are getting created and these jobs prevent the people of getting poor 
the positive ",23
11639," of television advertising is strong but the arguements are not ethical acceptable 
however there are many negative arguements first television advertising  should not be supported by any estate because it is in any way incorrect that companies are allowed to influence younger people furthermore it is not ethical acceptable that a company influence young children because every person should have the freedom to think how they want another ",15
11640," could be the cost for beeing allowed to watch television espacially in the estates like germany or in swizerland they could get troumendous
at the end television advertising  young people should not be allowed because the negative ",15
11641, is much heavier than the positiv ,21
11642,so many parts of the todays television is the advertising ,10
11643," we watch it in the evening there is an advertising break about all 15 minutes what about the young children should television advertising  be allowed

we could say that it is difficult to forbid it when the parents of the child watch television and there are advertisings for the new barbie and the child sees it and wants to have it it is ",14
11644, the parents decision if they buy it or not it is ,9
11645, the question which advertisings are for young children because they could see an advertising of a chair and would like to have it mostly the advertising for a product for a child is not for the child it is for the parents so the parents can see what toys there are for little children and ,16
11646, it is their decision to buy it also how could the companies which sell stuff for children get the attention of the parents without television advertising if the advertising  was forbidden the companies would not be able to sell as much as they do ,2
11647," the advertising is allowed

on the other ",11
11648," we could say that it should be forbidden because the companies manipulate the little children who can not question the products or the things the advertising says if the advertising was good they could sell everything to the children as little children are if they want someting they want it really much so they could get into trouble with the parents

i ",16
11649, with the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed because the parents of the child ,13
11650, the manipulation would not work also because ,19
11651, that the advertising is not made for the children only it is made for the parents for me ,16
11652, the television advertising is allowed for all generations or it is completely forbidden of course it is necessairy to put the adult advertising in the adult channels but ,15
11653, it is clear that there should not be a banking advertising on kika,11
11654,there are many ways of advertising you can make a television spot a radio spot or you can ,11
11655, out papers how you advertise depends on what you want to advertise if you want people to go to the casino you wount advertise directly towards children so this is an important ,11
11656," 
if you have a doll or a new legohouse you want to sell you have to advertise directly towards the children you have to use a lot of colours and make your product lool like its the best thing on earth you are able to influent young children very easily they dont think ",0
11657," much about money and how usefull something is as adults when they like something they want to have it even if in a few months there will be a new better doll 
television advertising is one of the easiest ways people who watch televison have to look at the spots during the breaks especially ",10
11658," its a nice spot they will start to think about your product and as this is your goal its the perfect way 
its not easy to advertise something directly to children they dont often listen to the radio and they dont go the the city so televison advertising is one of the only ways you can make them wanting your product 
but is it okay to abuse the ",0
11659," easy to influent everyone is influentable the advertisinindustry works with influenting the people they know what you have to do to influent a person its their job 
television advertising s young children should be allowed because of the ",14
11660," that there arent any other ways to advertise a product even if its moraly incorrect  
",11
11661, on television is always in the news is it good for us or should it not be there many studies at universities in the united states have searched an answer but none of them ever had a well ,4
11662, with advertising many people make really much money so they and ,11
11663," others maybe us can not live without it but should television advertising directes toward young children aged two tho five not be allowed

firstly the advertising should deffinitly be allowed the children schould live in the same world like the other people the adults why should you forbit the advertising there then other questions come like with wich age should the advertising be allowed can you control that younger children do not see such thigns moreover the whole cities are full of posters and televisions wich want to sell something 

secondly this young people are just to young to get overflushed with ",14
11664, much advertising that we see every day now they just sit more on the television ,10
11665, being outside and play with peers furthermore they see ,8
11666, many toys and things they want to have one one ,20
11667, it is great for all the shops they have ,23
11668," much more income but what about the parents it is difficult to tell a child that they do not get this toy or this game 

finally is to say that television advertising  such young children should not be allowed they are just too young to can get on with this whole material it is best they can just watch their one or two favourite series a day without this breaks",20
11669,"should one prohibit advertising toward children
this is a question that must come from different groups in society there are the parents and ",16
11670, the advertising companies the parents are most probably against is firstly advertising uses manipulative methods to gain the attention of their aim group the message buy this product immediately is commonly used ,16
11671, the advertisers do not directly indicate this in their commercials or advertisements however advertising is ,11
11672, a billion dollar industry and can make the advertisers extremely rich the more people see it the more people are going to buy the product childrens attention is easy to get ,0
11673, its even easier to make them or their parents buy products and ,9
11674," its easier to make money with them 
advertisements ",11
11675, for children they feel the urgent need to buy the product and if they see someone else buy it they get under pressure because they want to be like them my opinion on this is that one should not start advertising towards young children sitting in front of a tv in your childhood is one thing but ,2
11676, being encouraged to be materialistic and greedy by ads is even worse kids should not want to buy things that they actually dont need wanting to have a toy ,2
11677, is different from wanting to buy a toy that someone said is all fun and games ,20
11678, that kids should express their real needs and not those a company made them think they have,8
11679,"the television adversiting  is as it says made for children aged 2 to 4 so i wont discuss in my essay the content of this advertising because i never watched tv at this age but the consumers
in my opinion its no good to let children watch tv at home we dont have a television and i dont and didnt miss it like this i could ",14
11680, i was a child always go out with friends and play in the garden we have ive learned ,1
11681, many things with just going out which ,18
11682, cant be learned better or at all also ,21
11683," that we are only one time in our life children so its really sad if we miss this time because of a television i always say you can watch television all your life long why do you have to begin as a child
a very important example in this theme ",17
11684, is my exchange which i made in france last six months i spent there and learned a new style of life in the two families i was there was a child in the ,18
11685, one a 8year old boy in the morning he stood up very early at sixoclock ,18
11686, because his parents didnt want to get up this early he sat in front of the tv when he got home from school he watched tv until we had dinner then he went to sleep but ,1
11687, sleeping he played on his play station in the other family there was a girl at my age during the schooltime she didnt watched much tv because she had to do much homework but as the schoolholidays began she sat in front of the tv from 9oclock in the morning until the mother came home at 5oclock in the evening thats what she did the whole holiday long i know the two examples arent really connected to the age of 2 or 4 but ,1
11688," its the ending of children which began watching tv in this age
i really think its sad if children or teenager have to spend all their time in front of a television i ",17
11689, time we will change something on that its a problem which ,19
11690, the adults have to solve because te children are to young to get rid of this adicction,7
11691,"television advertising direct toward young children aged  should not be allowed

nearly every family posseds a television and in most cases its a everyday use to watch televisionyoung and old all of them like to spent their time with watching films and series but shuld young children should be comfrontated with this virtual world

thirst it must been said that the tv has becomes an important role in our life in the job at school at home we cant think about a life without a television so why shouldnt learn little childs to handel with this gadget in her early years then they havent to learn it ",14
11692," theyre older and theyre prepared

secondly television can be a kind of education when childs watchts some interresting documentarys or learn to count that way i thin television makes a great job

also an important ",17
11693, the parents want to do something in the houshold like cooking cleanig etc they cant play with their kids in that moment the kids get on the  parents nevers because they will cry and scream beauce of boringness the it is an easy option to switch the tv on ,1
11694," the child has something to do and the parents can do their work

on the other ",8
11695, we have the danger of the television theres a lot of rubish whitch young childs can watch there like dangerous horror films pornografie or ,17
11696," on in the worst case childs become psychical problem from this and cant sleep at night

another ",4
11697," is that the tv coveres the real world for childs it is better to invent the word not on tv they should go outside and play there with other kids to become friends also they have to play in the wood or in the mud to come in contact with the natur

my conclusion is that childs should be confrontated with the television but controlled it should be an mixture

 ",17
11698,"young children often can not understand things like adults they do not know that television advertisings can sometimes pretend to be something that they are not children aged  can not handle this kind of advertising because they believe everything someone says

in my opinion ",2
11699, that this is fair and ,21
11700, with this statement if a young child is watching television and an advertising for a toy ,0
11701, appears all the time they start to like it and ,3
11702, they want to own it this is the problem in that case young children are very naive ,3
11703, they believe everything that was mentioned in television maybe the parents should not let theit children watch television on their own but that would be way too complicated and ,17
11704," television advertising  should not be allowed 

on the other ",15
11705," the companys earn their money like this it is their job to make people interested in their products and children are the best agegroup because like i said they want to have everything a person talks about that is appealing to them the company just has to make it appealing to the young children but as soon as the advertising has toys in it or something like that the television advertising has earned the attention of the child

nevertheless ",0
11706, that there has to be an alternative to this problem maybe television advertising should only be allowed on channels for adult people and not on a kids channel because adults are old enough to interpret the product and ,13
11707, to judge it they can decide on their own if they want to have it or not in my opinion this would be a very good ,12
11708," to this issue

to conclude ",21
11709, that it is not right to influence young children by advertising in television they want to have everything someone talks about and they believe everything that they hear in television because of that ,13
11710, it should be prohibited to show television advertising ,15
11711,there is a discussion on whether or not commercials should be legal ,15
11712, directed  kids do not understand what advertisement is ,16
11713, the offspring tends to fall for many marketing methods for example buy one little stuffed bear and get one free the innocence of not understanding that buying a product and getting one free does not exist and the price for ,2
11714," products is being paid make children immensely vunerable capitalism is oversmarting children and not many individuals seem to care 
 on the other ",2
11715, commercials and product placements are nowadays as common as water is so it does make much sense to prepare the offspring for reality the parents are responsable for teaching kids on how to overlook or detect false advertisement therefore the future adults know how to make educated choices ,0
11716," it comes to their consuming activity balancing out what the commercials promise and what is real such behaviour is a part of common sense
  after examinating ",10
11717, of view my opinion is that there are no reliable reasons for children not being exposed to advertisement even ,13
11718, kids might be easy victims for selling strategies it is important that such experiences can be made parents have the obligation of teaching and preapairing offspring  for the world ,2
11719, the addition of common sense should not be destracted by fooling protection policies,21
11720,a controversal subject nowerdays is television advertising  it is often seen as a problem because the young children get very fast fascinated from the advertisment and ,14
11721," force the parents to buy certain things television advertising should be allowed because thats the reason how they get their money but for the kids that dont really understand how the advertising influenc them its a bad thing

  one ",14
11722," why television advertising is allowed is because thats the way how the producer get their money with that money they make new shows or series and pay their worker we and our kids whatch it later this is the good part about television advertising the problem is how they make their advertising 

  the producer of the tv shows know exactly how advertising for kids work it must have a lot of bright colours and has to be very loud the children get a feeling of wow thats awesome ",14
11723," they want to buy it they dont understand that they got influenced by the advertising and thats the problem the kids have a lack of knowledge and are not experienced with such things and the advertising producer use that for their profit

the idea of the advertising for getting money for producing and other things is good the problem is that the producer use the lack of knowledge and experience from the kids for their profit this is very mean and nasty and should not be allowed for kids aged 

",2
11724,"should television advertising toward children between two and five be allowed

here in switzerland you are allowed to make advertisments towards people at all ages so in that case ",13
11725,"  between the age  as far as i concern these adds mostly contain toys or fun activities

toy companies or companies who sell products for children wouldnt be to happy if their kind of adverts would be forbidden because they live off their products and it would influence their sellingquotes a lot they ",16
11726, find that its a good idea to start influencing the kids at a young age ,7
11727, they get used to it and ,19
11728," buying stuff from tv adds
these adds are ",10
11729," good for our economie because more gets sold and therefor more moneys around 


",23
11730, these young children arent old enough to decide what they want or need to buy ,9
11731," the adverts influence the a lot more as you would think parents with young kids often have the problem that their kid wants to buy the newest and coolest stuff from tv that will mostly end in tears and nobody likes situatuion like that

in my opinion parents who have a problem with their children wanting to buy stuff shouldnt let them watch tv all day ",14
11732, advertisments should be allowed for ,11
11733,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

in our time the media including television radio and social networks make a great impact on our lives if we have a question and can not seem to find any answer we look for it in the internet we believe most of the things we are shown from the media but to be fair ",15
11734," that some advertisings should be forbidden because of the age that advertising is 

television advertising is for companies to be more popular because most of the time many people are watching it if they are more popular more people are convinced that that product is right for them and there is a higher chance that they are going to buy it therefore the companies can make more money with advertising all this does not make sense to children at the age of  ",13
11735, that they are watching a lot of television and ,3
11736," they did they would not realise what they are actually watching 

adults ",6
11737, are watching those advertisings and are old enough to decide if the product shown is useful for them or their children or not this results in companies trying to achieve the ability to convince parents and not children if they are trying to convince children they want to manipulate them ,2
11738," that they will convince their parents themselves but at that young age it does not seem very efficient to me

to conclude ",7
11739, that television advertising toward such young children makes sense but ,13
11740, if they want to do this they can it should not be disallowed because ,12
11741, that it has a bad impact on those children or their parents ,7
11742,in a time where different types of media are dominating our thinking and the way we view things it is only logical to think about expanding the influence of media on us it is said that ,10
11743, something is done earlier it will be better for you in the future showing little kids television advertising and making them familiar with it is an advance for them they learn early to cope with ads in the television and to form their ,0
11744, of view of a product that is being advertised they learn to see what tricks advertising uses to draw the attention on a particular product later in life they can use this knowledge and can detect better if they are in need of that product or not it ,0
11745, helps them not spending much money on things ,9
11746," they learn the way how to treat money

television advertising for children is okay ",2
11747, the product that is being advertised is not something bad and contraproductive for the growth and development of little kids if the product ,2
11748, is a tablet app for painting on the tablet or a game that you can play on the computer it stops the kids of going outside and experiencing new things of learning about the world they live in another ,8
11749, against television ads for young children would be that companies should not try to get the attention of little children and ,13
11750, taking alot of money from the parents ,9
11751, it is a poor family children tend to get enthusiastic about something pretty quickly ,9
11752, an electronic device would be a walk outside or something different that helps in the developping of the childs brain if the television is full of advertising products for children they are sitting a lot more in front of it than in the situation ,17
11753," ads would not be there 

",11
11754, advertising directed to children is getting out of ,16
11755, if a food item is being advertised or a normal toy like a stuffed animal it is acceptable but ,16
11756, products are being advertised that are clearly not helping a child ,16
11757, these ads must not be allowed ,11
11758,"the advertisement is an important factor for every company around the planet it has the power to influence the shopping behavior of people there are advertisements just  children at young age because these innocent children are easier to influence and direct than a grown adult the question if these commercials should be allowed stays unanswered 
first of all it is important that we visualize the impact on a child such a advertisement could produce small children are believing everything and tend to be mad if they dont get what they want this ",16
11759, makes such a advetisement a problem for the whole family of the child it could lead to ,12
11760, the commercial is directed to the child but advertised a product for the parents ,0
11761," a car with good seats for the children
secondly is the personality of a child easily changed by subconcious messages which lead to problems with te education thought by the parents an advertisement convincing a child subconciously to buy something or ask a parent to buy something could end with an agressive young child having problems with its all day behaiviour
another reason not to publish such advertisements is an economical one companys with products which have nothing to do with children get a huge ",16
11762," by such advertisements because they have to make commercials directed to adults who are more difficult to influence
to sum up today there are 2468 advertisements directed just to children it is time to act and minimize these commercials for the well being of our children it should only be allowed to make such commercials about products which are only beneficial for young children like lego and that kind of stuff let our children have a uninfluenced childhood because they are going to see enough advertisements ",16
11763,on television theres a lot of advertising espacially for young children because the dont have to go to school or to work ,0
11764," the have the time to watch television the whole day now we discuss if it should be forbidden to produce advertising  children aged 
if the advertising  is forbidden the companies who produce toys will have problems to bring the product to the consumer the children wont know what they want for christmas so the parents will buy some toys and the children will be sad because there parents bought the false toys young children will ",13
11765," go more outside and play with there friends games like hide and seek or football so they get away from the srceens and do something usefull
but if the advertising directed to young kids is allowed the producer of the toys could sell some cheap produced toys for high price to the kids because they dont know what a fair price for a toy is also the children will annoy there parents because they want a lot of things that the dont need the kids will ",2
11766, be a lot of time in front of the screens to watch their favorite tvshow and ,1
11767," watch more advertising
in my opinion the advertising directet to young kids should be forbissen because if the children watch advertising they will annoy there parents until the parents buy them a toy and ",0
11768, two weeks they wont play with this toy and the want the ,20
11769,"in this essay the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed will be discussed

nowadays more kids watch television than ever ",14
11770," it makes sence to direct the advertising towards them they want to get the things the advertisement is showing and the market would increase because a lot of parents spoil their children this would speak for allowing the advertisements 

but ",16
11771, there are much more older children teenagers and adults watching television than kids between two and five wich means that the advertisement should ,14
11772," be s them advertisement for young children is very boring for older people the number of people watching television could decrease which would be more of a loss than an increase 

also often the things that are advertised towards young children are useless and more of a waste of material and energy than a contribution towards the better living of people it takes time to develope the advertisements and the advertised things and often little kids can not understand what the advertisements are saying television advertising towards young children should ",14
11773," for this is that little kids should not be watching television they should experience the nature and the live outside the house they should craft and draw and increase their ability to make fine little things in the future that will help them more than sitting in front of the tv all the time 

",17
11774, television advertising should be forbidden because of the ,15
11775, the advertising company would not benefit from the young children as much as they would by investing the time money and energy in advertisements for older people ,16
11776, i do not really see a problem with advertisements for children i mean if it should be really banned the companies ,16
11777, find other ways to advertise their products to children for example they could make product placements in tvshows for children ,2
11778, it does not matter if you ban it because they will find other ways to advertise their products for young children also ,16
11779, a child sees an advertisement it can not just go and buy it it has parents who decide if they get it or not the child just can say it wants the product but ,2
11780, the parents make the decision if it gets it or not so banning television advertising for young children will not help a lot but ,14
11781, it is important that our children are not manipulated ,12
11782, they are young maybe today its just a advertisement for a soft drink but in maybe ten years companies might use the advertisements to brainwash children so ,0
11783, this will be in the future an ,18
11784," you banof banning advertisements ditected towards children
so ",16
11785, outweight the advanteges of banning television advertising directed to hidlren it is not a big deal that there are advertisements for young children ,13
11786, they are not too manipulative and ,19
11787, the decision of the parents of wether buying something or not for their child so it is not necessaire to ban television advertising ,13
11788,"television advertising  should not be allowed

im not sure whether television advertising  should be allowed or not on the one ",15
11789, you can say it isnt really fair to do television advertisting directed  because they arent old enough to decide whether its a good or a bad thing which they are seeing in tv they ,13
11790, need their parents to help them through their life they need their parents to show them problems dangers and difficulties but ,7
11791, there are like tv spots directed ,6
11792,  children will be very influenced by it so ,7
11793, you go shopping with your child they want everything they have seen in television and maybe you cant afford it ,20
11794," its not easy to say no to your child

on the other ",9
11795, you can say thats life honestly in our world its all about money and in a world full of captalism its clear that even young children are important clients ,9
11796," why shouldnt television advertising  be allowed and maybe you could even go that far that you can say that children learn from tv they are going to  improve their language skills but most important they are going to get more mature because they are going to compare the tv spots and the products theyre about so they become more independent and mature in early age

after looking through the ",14
11797, i can say that i dont really have an opinion to this statement honestly i do not care there are some ,21
11798, that support the statement but there are ,21
11799, everybody should decide for himself whether he does support the statement or not if you support the statement you need to live with the ,21
11800, because we live in a capitalistic world and this isnt going to change ,23
11801,in my opinion it shouldnt be allowed because children are inocent and emotional they believe what they are being told and what they see they take everything literally ,12
11802," if someone in the televison says for exemple the world is a plain they are going to believe that because they dont know it bettereven if they do know that the world is actually round they will start to question it because that is just what children do 

an other reason why im against it is that young children dont even understand what they are being told and that is exactelly the reason why they could understand or interpretaed something wrong that was ment to be something totally else 
unfortunately it is likely for a child that it believes what it is being told young children can easely be manipulated and producers politiciens or other people could take ",6
11803," of that they could brainwash childrens and manipulate them as they please just to get what they want

anyway ",7
11804," you shouldnt direct something towards little children as i said for the reason that they would take everything serious and would listen to what they are being told

sorry that you have to read this but i had really no clue and not the slightest idea what advertising means ",16
11805,"advertisement is something we are surrounded with all the time most of the time we dont even realize it but we remember a lot of it unwillingly advertisement influences us and particularly our decisions what and how much we buy should it be allowed to influence young children from age  through television advertising to such a degree

first of all the directing of television advertisemnet towards young children would make sense from a economic ",14
11806," of view children of that age can be influenced easily by a happy jingle a speaking animal and vibrant colours they could try to get their parents to buy the advertised product

but ",0
11807," of view is it okay to use children of a very young age to get people to buy your products are the children getting instrumentalised for an extremely selfish cause of making as much money as possible

the question is ",16
11808," how many children of that age even watch television on a regular basis i would guess a lot of them are allowed to watch a kids program or a movie from time to time and dont get to see a lot of advertisement on television therefore the advertisement could not do a lot of harm and there would be no need to have any restrictions

all of the above considered ",14
11809, that children of a young age should not be seen as a way of selling your product they are too young to assess things objectively and to make up their own minds and ,2
11810, they dont watch television and dont see the advertisement they could ,10
11811, hear it or be influenced through other media there is no need to direct the advertisement directly towards them they will come across it anyway,11
11812,it is not a secret that advertisement can be manipulativpeople who are the most confronted with this manipulation are teenagers and adults but it may be ,11
11813, possible that childrens are manipulated by the television but is it ,17
11814," bad if young children see some advertising

first of all we have to make clear that only a few young children are allowed to watching television most of the  aged children are outside to play and their parents keeps an eye on them so not many children are confronted by advertising 

secondly we need to consider that children not are able to buy anything so if they see something on television ",14
11815, a toy which they want they can not just buy it like an adult so what can be the ,20
11816," if the see some toys on television 
of course they desire to get this toy they want the parents to buy this toy 

but is this such a worse thing it is ",20
11817, that children need some toys to play and learn thing with playing furthermore they learn to appreciate things one toy they get but the other not the parents not just buy every toy their children wants so the children have to learn how to choose and what is important besides the parents ,8
11818," can show their children that the television is not right everytime there are toys which are not as great as it seemed at the advertisement

in conclusion adversitsing is not as worse as we thing if we use it the right way the children can learn much about the television advertisement and the world outside they learn to choose only the one thing they want and not to desire useless things",0
11819,should television advertising  children 2 to 5 be forbidden this isnt a hard question ,13
11820, to answer because i only see ,18
11821, for this statement on the one ,21
11822, there is the problem with children and television ,17
11823, nowadays almost every child grows up infront of a television whereas twenty years ago they only knew advertising from the newspapers on the other ,10
11824, adults more affected by advertising because they dont realise that it is advertising at all they see something and ,11
11825, they want it but what they do not see is the manipulative advertising company and their goal to earn money behind it its just a simple toy and they want to have it all they see are the material things and it takes them only one ,3
11826, to decide wether they want it or not so companies like to produce advertising directed to children because it is ,2
11827," effective 

considering that nowadays children are confronted with advertising in a younger age ",0
11828, that there should be a discussion on wether we allow this or not with social media and media ,12
11829, like radio and television children get in contact with advertising in a younger age because ,14
11830, every child understands a short clip about a new product on tv i actually cant think about a reason for advertising directed at children because ,0
11831, that it is just a simple and very manipulative way of companies to earn money children are very naive and they dont see the problem behind advertising they simply believe everything ,2
11832, in the age from 2 to 5 ,8
11833, forbid this kind of advertising ,11
11834, the money of their parents because ,9
11835, the parents are the ones that have to buy it for their children,9
11836,we see it everywhere the advertisement for the newest car praises for the tooth paste that makes your teeth the brightest or a huge poster that claims that this is the drink that you need ,23
11837," become happy advertising plays quite an important role in our society the more interesting gets the question whether televison advertising s young children should be allowed or not 

on the one ",14
11838, one could claim that advertisement doesnt do any harm  at least not if no violence and sexual language is used advertising might be an option to show adults ,16
11839," as young children what kind of possibilies they have it can be an inspiration and give us a clearer view of our desires and needs that we have 

but here comes a big but showing us all the kind of options that we have might create needs and wishes that we wouldnt have had if we didnt watch the television advertising which can be negative as it leads us to desire things that we dont need in the ",0
11840," place especially young children should not be contronted with opinion influencing advertising for they shouldnt be determined by pictures and clips that brings them to a demand of products where there is no actual need 

another reason why ",16
11841, television advertising towards young chilren is that i believe that advertisement impresses the viewer with false standarts as it tells you want you need for a great successful or famous life it makes you believe that you need this certain product ,14
11842, have a certain status in your life children ,9
11843," ages  are very easily influenced presenting them these standarts gives them a wrong view of the real life and might even be the reason for the lack of self confidence later in life 

this is why ",24
11844, with the statement that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed ,13
11845,it depends on the time they took for watching tv watching to long could cause you heatache or eyesache but the tv could ,17
11846," be a good way to learn a particular language so the parents should have the choice what their children watch a serial in a diffrent languages as the motherlanguage could help children later in their school days
its ",6
11847, important that the children have social contacts with other children by playing outside because the tv can be like a drug children dont know ,17
11848," they should finish with watching the tv can isolate you in your room and you forgot to do other things like doing homework or other stuff 
",1
11849, that bringing the children in a kita would be more hopefully ,9
11850, have social contacts in a diffrent language ,18
11851," speek the language they are going to learn

",8
11852,when i was young at the age of five i went out playing with other kids football and other kind of plays but i ,18
11853," actually watched television and i remember that many friends of my didnt watched television because their parents forbidden it for me it didnt make any sense

clearly every parents told us children watchig to much television is bad for us my parents ",17
11854, thaught this but for them it wasnt such a danger they thaught it is okay watching children shows ,17
11855, like spongebob tom and jerry or all the disney shows i loved it to watch this shows especially at weekends every morning at seven oclock ,6
11856, all the childern programms started and it was ,6
11857, nice to talk about these shows with other children in the kindergarden and ,6
11858," in the primary school

and ",8
11859, talking about all the shows many children told me it is very bad watching ,17
11860, much tv they said to me that their parents have told them it isnt healthy for people watching to long television actually for young children the eyes will become more weak ,17
11861, the brain their parents alouded them to watch television only for one hour in the week some families i know dont use television ,17
11862," today

in my opinion it is okay to let children watch television but not to much childeren ",17
11863, have to learn other things to go out have fun with other kids but i find it almost brutaly to dont let a children watch tv some things you ,17
11864," learn thigns by watchin tv

",6
11865,"when you watch a movie with your child the worst thing that could happen for you is that your little son or girl stresses you all the time because he or she has just seen a new advertisment of a huge and expensive legocastle the children always want to have it so should it be allowed to show television advertising s your young children

for the companys the best thing to sell there toys is it to show them to the children if a little boy watches the advertisment of ",14
11866, a legocastel the chance that he wants to have it imediately is very big and ,20
11867, he has seen it he would go to there parants and stress them with the new lego toy up to the moment wherethey go together to the ,20
11868, shop and buy that castel another ,18
11869, for the advertisment is the tvsponsoring every child likes it to watch tv but who acctualy pays the tv a big part pays the sponsors they pay money ,14
11870," they can put there advertisment into the breaks of the movie and without that tvsponsoring we couldnt watch movies on tv

on the other ",10
11871, children become manipulated by the advertisments on television which is not good for there development in addition to that a child should not see disturbing advertisments like them of a shootergame or stuff like that so the advertisment should be at least filtered another ,14
11872, is that the children like it more to watch there movies ,6
11873," the advertismentof a fe cupcake store 

although there are some positive ",11
11874, the television advertising  children because it might desturb the childhood and it manipulates the children ,14
11875,in the summer holiday i visited my family in germany and they watch tv quite a lot there so one evening i had to watch super rtl with my little cousin fanziska and there was a horrible advertsing about babyborn and ,10
11876, she laid her eyes on that doll she wanted to have it a few weeks later she got a present from her grandfather a babyborn what a surpise so in this essay ,18
11877," write about a common problem should televison advertising directet toward young children be allowed or not

we got televison advertsing about everything ",13
11878, why should it not be allowed towards young children the children arent old enough to decide wheter they need something or not so ,12
11879," they see a nice toy on televsion they want to have it the people who make the advertsing use exactly that furthermore if a little child wants something its really hard to get it out of their mind its easier to just go to the store and buy it the advertising did his purpose

my personal opinion is that you cant stop the advertising towards children because we are surrounded by advertsing but you shouldnt let your two years old child watch television anyway so it is ",14
11880,"young children nowadays are watching more and more television it is a big problem that marketing gets even bigger and the companies tries to sell everything and uses advertisemen for those reasons but is it ok to direct advertisements towards children

first of all it isnt good to use children for economic purposes children have a blank mind and they got influenced quite strong by those advertisements for example if the children see something they want they will ask their parents again and agian till they will recieve it 

another big ",14
11881, is that children children dont earn their own money the parents have to pay for them and all parents wants to see the child happythey are quite likely to buy whatever they want to make the child happy and to use this ,9
11882," to sell products is not right

on the other ",23
11883," if the parents wants to buy what the child want and it is good for the economics if things are bought so it is good for the economics if advertisements are s children the cashflow wont get stopped and there wont be any bad incidents for the econimic

last but not least every singel child have theire own opinion of what they just saw and if they want this product or not they cant think about the use of the thing so if they like what the advertisement is about why shouldnt parents buy it to them 

to sum up ",0
11884, it is ok to direct advertisements towards children it is a part of marketing like social media markenting and if the parents are willing to buy the products to make the child happy it is a good way to sell products many parents dont like it but ,16
11885, the parents could provide the children from watching ,9
11886,nowadaysevery child aged  watches television there are ,17
11887," many channels for children in our time but as we know a channel cant stay alive without showing advertisments on tv but does this affect the children to buy something

firstly children grow up with their parents and the parents always teach their son or daughter what they should do or believe and what not so now ",14
11888," they see an advertisment on tv they should know if it is something essential or not
secondly the owners of the tvchannels are very smart and they know what kind of advertisment they have to show to children they show them advertisment of new toys coming out soon or trailers from disney films they try to force them to ask their parents to buy this or to go to the cinema to watch this movie
finally showing these advertisements on tv is rightly correct theres nothing like a law against these advertisements they should only content stuff for the variety of people who are watching for example it would be a crime to show on a channel for children an advertisment with sexual content
in conclusion my ",13
11889, of view is that advertisment toward young children should be allowed ,16
11890, children are smart enough to know that they shouldnt believe everything or let themselves misslead by an advertisment for buying something they dont really need in reality the channel owners just should know what type of advertisment they show to the children,14
11891,in the 21 century it is normal every household to have a tv if young or old ,17
11892, classes like to watch it but should television advertising   be allowed or not in the followimg essay ,15
11893," for and against television advertising directed 
firstly it is unhealthy that young children watch tv a lot so the television shouldnt get too much refered to the children ",14
11894, not to the very young children should play with their toys ,20
11895, hanging on the tv and get more attached to it because of the television advertising but in the other way nowadays its pretty normal that everyone has access to the television and that little kids are ,17
11896," affected of it it is just the revolution and nobody can do anything about it 
secondly television advertising that is only directed to a specific class of age leads to less viewers if theres only advertising directed to children aged  the older people or teenagers will instantly turn off the tv whereas for the little children it is exciting to watch but in the other way it shouldnt be a problem because it has ",14
11897, many other advertising that isnt only directed to children aged  ,16
11898," older juniors or even seniors
the last but not the least reason is that constantly watching tv and being attracted to it through advertising influences the physical actions ",24
11899, it is really unhealthy in the other way it is ,4
11900," exciting to watch and for the moment you forget all the other things and just enjoy watching tv
in conclusion ",6
11901, are pretty equal but one day ,19
11902, i grow up and have children my children wont be allowed to pass much time in front of the tv thats why ,17
11903, with the statement that television advertising  should strictly not be allowed it influences ,15
11904,the average person is confronted with advertisement of many kinds on a daily basis oftentimes we do not even take notice of the advertisement itself and the message it enforces on us ,11
11905," we are all subconciously influenced by it in our choices the average adult person in most cases posesses the ability to distinguish between genuine information and advertising slogans therefore most people tolerate the poster in the bus station or the spots on televison between programmes however if advertisement is specifically  very young children controversy is much higher and there are quite a lot of people who even think that such a thing should be forbidden

one of the main reasons why advertising aimed at children is viewed ",16
11906, negatively is that it can be harmful to their development advertisement in many cases teaches children certain values as they have not fixed their own vlues  and are not ,0
11907, able to distinguish the message of the advertisement from their own opinion it can influence their behavoiur and how they percieve the world because ,11
11908, tv spots are aimed at selling those children their product ,0
11909," than educating them these values are oftentimes not the best ones 

a huge problem is ",7
11910, that such advertisements are often ,11
11911,  boys or girls creating the problem that sexism is directly learnt bythe young audience boys are taught early on that cars are super fun and that they should go on adventures outside ,7
11912, girls are taught to love dolls and puppets and oftentimes ,20
11913," very unhealthy body immages are imposed on them

in defence of advertisement for children one must say that in a free market economy everyone should have the possibility to invest his or her mney as he or she pleases many companies direct their product directly toward a very young audiene and would lose a lot of revenue

i 



",2
11914, does the opportunity to influence people by advertisements however the subjects are changing ,11
11915," companies realised that they have a bigger impact on younger subjects they use this opportunity 

",23
11916,televisions give us the society pictures stories and show us ways of communication televisions kill the time in a fascinating waymany people watch television to come down to relax to stop thinking but what kind of influence brings the television along is this influence a good one or a bad in what way does it change us an influence brings always along that it can manipulate and change youmeanwhile televisions always work you can always watch it children are easy to manipulate they take everything that you show them with pleasure in their headsinfluencing manipulating humans is easy ,17
11917, they are youngso we have to discuss if the influence is good or bad and it ,7
11918," depends on what you are watching

the positive ",18
11919, are that you can come down you forget the world and youre life for a moment you only have to watch and nothing else if you have time and you dont know what you should do it is a way of killing timeyou ,18
11920, can inform yourself about what is going on in the world you have the possibility to watch classic movies to see how human relationships can be to have a view on other cultures and see their problems this is a an immense ,8
11921," us didnt have television can connect us with other people and countries

the negative ",10
11922, of televions are that you become an influence which you often cant realy controll because televisions in my eyes influence you in a very passive way  where a lot of people have difficulties to controll itbecause they show you images which you cant delete ,10
11923, easily most people watch series or other things  which are very stupid and gives us a image of the world which if we live that life that they show us is to easy and would make the world in a sad an stupid place televisions can bring us information but you ,17
11924, could read a book  where you dont are ,18
11925, televisions are in generel bad for the human beeing this brings me to the conclusion that in an age between two and five televisions shouldnt be part of life for children they can do ,17
11926, many others things where they have to think and be creative communicate themself and not the televisions use time in beeing outside in nature and not in front of the television ,17
11927,"should young children aged  be exposed to television advertising or not 
while some think it should not be allowed i believe that living in a free and economic based country has its cost children are confronted with commercial designed in paticularly for them
i belong to the generation which has seen tv commercials between the kids programm on the tv how its ",14
11928, nowadays and i wouldnt think it damaged me in a certain way nor made me want to buy a lot of things for my own pleasure yes some time youd wish you had that water canon 5000 but youd already forgot about it ,23
11929," sleeping in the end it depends on how you were educated by your parents and how you find happiness in things you already have 
in addition our country is based on free thougts and economic liberty this leads us to the ",21
11930, where its difficult to tell how much of something is ,18
11931, good making people buy more things is healthy for the economics and if the economics of a country is welloff ,23
11932," is the population todays system is based on the need to buy more and more if not sustained with buying products it collapses so if children see an tv advertising and pressure their parents to buy something they are supporting this system and helping the economics grow

 last weekend i was babysitting two little girls the younger girl just had her birthday in the week ",13
11939, and is now 5 years old i asked her about the gifts she got and she showed me her new barby she told me that she will soon get the pink car for her barby but she have to wait because the car wasnt avaible in the shop so its relatively clear that she had the informations about the barby from the televisionadvertising ,20
11940, in the sender like nikelodeon or other television for children in the breaks between the series are advertisings like this they moestly advertise for things that the children can wish themselfs for birthday or christmasgifts its difficult for the parents to controll if their children see advertises like this ,0
11941, they are allowed to see tv in the time the parents have to cook or something so the children see the advertise and ,14

11946, the parents should decide how much time their children are allowed to spend ,12
11947, it isnt possible to permit the advertising for little children at all but maybe to start with a permitition in the television wouldnt be a bad idea,16

young children can be manipulated very easy ",8
11951, they see something that looks nice or toys which other children play with they want to have it they believe everything which is showed in television such young children shouldt be influenced by advertisments it is bad for the children if they are faced with all the advertisment it can influence their learning and growing up process badly young children cant buy things themself ,2
11952," the adverisment shouldnt be s them the advertising should influence the parents through their kids it tells young children to ask their parents to buy them things this can influence the childrenparent connection

companies which produce children toys ",0
11953, need to make advertising to sell their product it is not fair to prohibit them to make any advertisments the advertisment has to be directed to the people who use the product and if the poduct is for children the adverisment has to be s children it doesnt influence them to buy things because they are to young to buy ,16
11954," the adverisments cant make people to buy things at the end the parents decide if they want to buy it

i dont tink it should be prohibited to adverise towards young children but it should be controlled those advertisments should have special restrictions for young children for me the bigger problem ist that the young children watch to much television and programes which arent for their age",16
11955,advertising is really popular in our civilisation but is it useful to make television advertising  in our life we get confronted with a lot of advertising in all regions of our life so much that we sometimes dont know what we should belive or which product we should buy with a lot of things it is useful to start with ,10
11956, young because they learn faster and can learn better than older people but advertising isnt learning ,0
11957, maybe it is to early to confront children with tis topic maybe they get confused because of that and young children dont buy their stuff on their own ,2
11958, they tell teir parents what they want but the parents are the ones who ,9
11959, buy it if children get a big choice they can quickly get confused of it and dont now what they really like children dont need thousands of toys and stuff but they need some less that they really like and dont want to give away to have the most and best things is not everything in the life of a child another ,20

11964, shouldnt sit too long in front of the tv and ,18
11965," it is contraproductive to make advertising what means that they just sit even longer in front of the tv
in my opinion it is useless and not really positive to make advertising towards young children ",14

11970," very important to play outside or with playmobil or lego for example a child that plays alot with a smartphone is unhappier than a child that plays with barbies and that is the same topic as television a lot of parents let their childrens watching tv for the whole day like this they do not have to look for the childrens 
the question is not if watching television is dangerous for children the question is how much television is okay for a child like this i guess you can not say that watching tv is dangerous for a child it is very important that a kid does not watch television in a way too often 
but watching tv could ",17
11971, have some positive effects for example today are there alot of prorams where the children could learn english or something else the programms are full with child kindly animations and children are very happy ,8
11972," they can watch their favorite tv programm 
and now to the part that it should not be allowed how should someone controll  that children are not watching tv i guess that this is the choice of the parents there are a lot more things that should not be allowed ",17

11980," the parents decision whether they will buy it or whether they will not
and there are different kinds of parents the ones who buy their children everything they want and those ones who ",9
11981," think about what would be the best for their children

11982," they do not even hear the tip which actually is not radiated in every country to eat or live healthily in the fast food comercials that only health is beautiful in the perfume and make up advertisements

my opinion is that ",11
11983," it is the parents choice if they want to buy their kids the newest iphone or whatever they just saw on tv
but they should go more for education like reading books to them listening music with them and not letting them watch to much television ",9
11984, i was a kid i was not allowed to watch tv it was even until the age of about ten years that i had to ask whenever i wanted to turn on the television ,17
11985, i was not exposed to as much comercials influence as other kids have been,7
11986,youre on the couch with your three year old the soundtrack of the movie madagascar in your ears and the soft light of your television on your face both of you are laughing histerically they because of the funny animals and you thanks to them then the break comes on you know your child doesnt really understand any of it but you ,1
11987, wonder if they are in any way influenced by this advertisement of hasbro about that new toy from a movie which isnt even in their range of age not a ,20
11988," in your thought you see your child fidgeting around and they ask you with glowing eyes if they could get it for their birthday should that way of advertising really be allowed

young people believe a lot theyre at a larger risk of believing things advertisement want to make us believe than adults kids are learning all the time and if theyre not taught the right things they make easy targets for advertisers when children are watching tv most of the time theyre absent minded their visual sense takes up most of their brains available capacity these kids are in some kind of learning mode if in that time theyre exposed to some televisionadvertisement what happens to them would be like some kind of brainwashing also with the repeating of the same ads it gets worse and worse
three year olds should not be influenced about brands and what kind of drink they like best

because children should be allowed to just be children my opinion is that television advertising should not be s young children

",14
11989,"if you do television advertising d toward young children they know what televisons are but children aged  schuold go out to play or should play with their parents or brother and sisters
but if young children know how to watch tv and they know what tv is exactlly they always want to watch tv ",14

for the costumer sometimes its really good to speak to lillte children because they say to their parents that it is a good thing which they schould buy immediatly some parents would do that because they want to do everything for their children little children want everything ",2
11993," its now oder wehn its something specail 

",18
11994, it isnt a good idea because i think its manipulation children should not watch tv often when a children is watching tv they want to watch the serie oder the film and not the publicity sometimes the publicity isnt for little children and ,6

11996, with the statment it shouldnt be allowed to do television advertising ,15
11997,peoples behaviour of what they buy and what dont is influences by advertising in a world embossed by technology the way of advertising changed horrificly companies introduced television advertising many years ago and ,10
11998," it never went down once with the influence on somenones life companies gathered power and now they even start to influence the children so is such a beahviour acceptable at all and should television advertising toward young people be allowed

first of all companies are allowed to put almost everything they want into their advertisment the only border set is one which prevents companies to make a racist statement ",13
11999," that this is really important and im glad that this one exists 
secondly if a company focuses itself on the kids market why shouldnt they be allowed to produce and screen advertising that can influence a childrens behaviuour i mean just because theyre screening it nobody has to buy the things do they
another ",13
12000, which has to be looked at is the time spent infront of television if the children nowadays wouldnt spend hours watching tv ,17
12001," they probably wouldnt be as influenced as everybody says and there wouldnt be such a discussion at all 

in my opinion not companies but parents are to blame television advertising towards young children wouldnt be a problem at all if parents would prevent their children from watching tv that often children should play with their friends outside ",14
12002, making a movie afternoon or whatever you want to call it i ,18
12003, think that countries should be allowed to influence our behaviour even of the small ones,21
12004,"have you ever wondered what is going on in a childs mind whether you did or not you certainly noticed how susceptible kids are to temptations these days such temptations may include toys candy video games ice cream and countless other things all of these are mostly materialistic goods and are usually strongly promoted on tv now is it ethically wrong to tempt children into things they do not necessarily need 
first of all whether a child actually gets the adverted good or not is mainly decided by its parents its really the parents that are the aim of the commercials thus it is the parents task to raise the kids in a way that prevents them from becoming too susceptible to temptations 
secondly it gives the children a chance to deal with temptations in early years later in life they are going to have to resist to thousands of other temptations tv commercials featuring toys and candy already give them a chance to handle such situations  
on the other ",14
12005, the companies that produce the tv commercials clearly aim at vulnurable children ,2
12006," promote their product in reality their goal is that the adressed children will later tell their parents about the new amazing thing they saw on tv and often the parents have a hard time turning their child down turning down young children on a thing they really want inevitably leads to conflict unfortunately many parents act too weak in those conflicts and eventually give in 
therefore it is not the commercial companies that are the problem it is the parents task to teach their children to resist temptations ultimately tv commercials can ",2
12007, act as a life lesson for children as a result the ,8
12008, arguing pro tv commercials directed  clearly outweigh the ,15

like already say i see definatly problems ",12
12014, childrens spend to much time watching television one ,17
12015, is that children who watch already ended stories dont have to imaginate their own stories that means that their ability to build their own world maybe with an friend who isnt there in reality or where they can be a princess or a pilot wont be used and that given stories arent just in their favorite tv show its ,6

you see i am ",18
12021, that young childrens shouldnt watch television advertising when i am honest ,13
12022, that childrens under the age of five should watch televions ,17
12023, but on the other hans my opinion is ,19
12024, that every parents should have the right to what they think is best for their own family,12
12025,"television advertising

todays advertising isoften s young children in those commercials you can see beautifull toys and smiling children
but why are there ",0
12026," many commercials for children and wouldnt it be better if there was no advertising for children

one of the reasons why these advertisments shouldnt be allowed is that it is way to easy to influence children if a child sees a funny commercial with nice new toys in it and children having fun it will often ask its parents to buy this new toy the child will ask and beg until it gets the toy but if the toy is bought the child will see another advertising on another toy and the whole process will beginn again the child always wants another toy and wont appriciate the ones it already has 
on the other ",16
12027," its easier for the parentsit the child already has a wish list they can go trough the list and choose the one thing they think is appropriate for a child at this age
anyway ",20
12028," these advertisements shouldnt be allowed because if there is less commercial for children they maybe wont sit infront of the tv all the time and go outsiden and play something
 
",14
12029,"television advertising and children

first of all advertising isnt any good at all but for the advertisers but how much can advertising harm little children

it is known that it is easy to manipulate little kids this is because they dont know as much as older people ",14
12030, they only have one choice believe or not know anything at all an easy question for most for example if you tell your little brother that a lion is about three meters high he probably will believe you but what does it have to do with television advertising often even adult people get manipulated by television because modern psychology and technic are much better and ,3
12031, much more dangerous today today people just know better how to manipulate humans and in advertiseing it is all allowed that isnt not allowed but ,23
12032, even adult people cant defeat themselves sometimes ,19
12033," little children cant at all
also children are learning the most in their ",8
12034," they learn that advertising is something good and that they should by more than they grow up as big consumers and its known that humans already consume more than the earth could ever give in time the world doesnt need more consumers

but ",0
12035, if they watched the advertising with their parent ,2
12036, probably the could learn how to react and think of it ,19
12037," it wouldnt do any harm its just bad luck that parents dont have enough time to observe childrens television the whole day long

in conclusion advertising isnt that dangerous for children if they watched it with their parents but ",14
12038, the dont have enough time it could harm them and transform the children to little consumer wich ,12
12039, nobody need because it is more harm than good im definately against directing television advertising toward young children,13
12040,now a days there are ,19
12041, many commercials everywhere many of those advertismens are trying to convince the younger population to buy or do something for example an advertisment in the televison for a toy car this commercial is obviously directed  especially around christams there are ,0
12042, many commercials like that  in the tv that try to convince children to believe that they need this toy the problem is that the children that are watching this advertisment are not able to make up their minde about the toy questions like do i really want this toy or is the toy too expansive are not important for the child the only thing the child cares about is that the toy looks like fun in the commercial ,0
12043, it would be great to have it so what is going to happen is that they will put it on their wish list for christmas and hope that santa  their parents will give it to them the positive ,20
12044, of this whole situation is  that the economy can make huge porfits the negative ,23
12045, is that most children are not going to use the toy that they got for christmas more that one or two times the reason for this is that the child didnt really know what to expect from the toy or how it would be to play with  in reallity so the child has huge espectations of the toy because the producer of the advertisment used a bunch of special effects to make it look more fun but than ,20
12046, the child acctually plays with the toy it sees that it isnt as cool to play with as they thought and ,20
12047," they go and play with something else that they enjoy more
my conclusion is that i do support television advertisments that are  because it is important for the industry ",10
12048, that they can sell more and make bigger profits ,23
12049, is it a waist of money for the parents who have to buy the toy for their child an other positive ,20
12050, is that the child may learn something out of this situation and wont put as much trust in the commercial ,2
12051, time and my even think about it a ,18
12052,"redbull had to pay nearly two million dollars because of their advertising a women in the usa went to the court because the advertising couldnt give her what they promised  wings so she tried to fly fell got hurt and got 2 million dollars it was clear that just by drinking redbull you couldnt fly but by seeing the advertise it caused people to imitate what they saw in tv so im asking myself should television advertising s young children aged  not be allowed 
as read in the introduction part imitation seems to be a huge problem children who see boys and girls running through the streets which are full of cars and traffic just to get their favorite drink looks like a fun thing to do in television but in reality they wouldve got hurt since children cant think ",14
12053, adults it is hard to protect them from such dangerous actions and as shown in the example above there are ,7
12054," adults who dont seem understand that advertising and reality are two different things 
on the other ",2
12055, kids could get manipulated through television advertising there could be shown racist ,12
12056, or violence maybe inequality they dont quite understand ,3
12057, so as theyre in the process of growing up television could influence them in ,17
12058, ways the good and the bad television advertising ,10
12059," is a method to show them that school is important and teach them important moral values that are necessary in our community 
as i already wrote chlidren in the age  are growing up they explore the world and are very interested in learning new things through television and their advertising it is possible for them to see things they ",17
12060," help their creativity and fantasy to exposure cause where else would they ever have had the possiblity to see dinosaurs which  lets be realistic  are very cool
finally i can say there are a lot cons about this topic but ",6
12061, the problem is television advertising as a whole its more the kind of advertising shown to the little ones in my opinion we have to set up some rules about what can and cant be shown in these advertises ,15
12062, it could just have a positive influence and they could ,19
12063,nowadays nearly every child watches tv in the evening and even it is only for 30 minutes watching tv without television advertising is not possible ,17
12064," on channels for children you find advertisements for several products or services  
firstly you have to think back ",0
12065, you were a child at an age of about four years you only concentrated on the film you really wanted to see at the ,6
12066, advertisement might had been funny for you to see how a family is at the supermarket or how people are at a place where you had never been to but as soon as the advertisement had finished you forgot about it and you concentrated again on the movie or the advertisement was ,11
12067," boring that you went shortly to the toilet 
secondly ",18
12068, the child is only about two years old it does not really know what advertisement is at all the child might even think that it is a ,16
12069," movie 
however we should not forget that the advertisement can influence young children as soon as the family goes to the supermarket and the child sees a product which had recently been advertised the child wants this product and is extremely angry with the partents if they do not want to buy it as it can be unhealthy for the child 
to sum up ",0
12070," children might have an emotional outbreak at a supermarket it is not as bad as some scientists think young children do not really recognise why there is advertisement at all they concentrate more on the moving pictures and the colours they can see on the screen 
to my mind it is not a bad thing that there is advertisement on channels for children advertisement is more a boring thing and people ",14
12071," do something else than watching advertisement or the younger ones do not even understand what the advertisement is about 
",16
12072,who doesnt know this one is watching a fascinating very exciting movie and suddenly in the most ineresting moment the film is stopped and an anoying classified ad pops up this bothers each time every adult because this ad tries to catch the attention but actually only annoying them in that moment why should advertisement ,11
12073," be s children

on the one ",18
12074, it is a disgrace to try to manipulate the childrens behaviour let alone children aged  by directing an ad towards children their behaviour is played with and one uses their naive mindset to sell products advertising companies aim to grab the childs attention ,16
12075, that their parents are ordered to buy this fascinating gadget besides manipulating human beings in such a young age it is ,20
12076," not allowed in law to tear them into the economic market because they are clearly underaged

on the other ",12
12077, directing classified ads towards young children can be a great marketing strategy for advertising companies children will ,16
12078, be egor to have this specific product and the parents will be forced to buy it what is ,9
12079, to mention is that this includes children already in the manipulation of the modern new market nowadays children will ,9
12080," learn in a much younger age to cooperate with manipulation of the human brain

in my opinion advertisement towards children aged  shouldnt be allowed because it is morally not just to try to use the childrens naive behaviour to sell as much products as possible children in such a age shouldnt be set the objective for the companies marketing strategy manipulation of children should strictly be prohibited",16
12081,"a lot of children start watching television at a young age but should it be forbiden to let them watch tv

depending on what children watch in the television it can influence their life and behaveour in a bad way for example if the watch series or films wich arent made for their age 

on the other ",17
12082, learn a lot by watching tv it can help them in school and in their education if they watch television ,17
12083," in an other language as theyd normally speak

another ",19
12084," against letting young chlidren watch tv is that they may spend a lot of their sparetime in front of the television than playing with their friends

but it ",17
12085, has to been said that a lot of children havent a lot of friends and if their parents are always working and dont have any time for their children it isnt that bad to let these children watch tv otherwise theyd maybe do things wich are ,17
12086," teach children good kind of morals and what their rights are and if a child is very selfcountious the televison can teach himher to love himselfherself and become more confident about themselves

in conclusion ",6
12087, that it isnt a bad thing to let kids watch tv sometimes not the hole day but as an example some minutes per day or some hours each week or somting like that in my opinion if the children watch the right kind of series and films it teaches them more positive things than negative so i personaly dont think theres a need to forbid children to watch television at a young age,17
12088,children between two and five years havent learned to judge they are dependant on their parents and dont really think about whats true or wrong the ,7
12089, is that it is easy to manipulate them and ,23
12090, of this the children are too young to understand that maybe the thing the commercial advertises for doesnt have only ,2
12091, or is actually unnecessary but manipulated by the advertise they want to have it as soon as possible because it looked ,23
12092," cool in television so the commercial taught at a young age that shopping makes you happier more popular more content the society of consume gets stronger a child doesnt spend a thought on the children who had to produce their toys who got poisened by the chemics which are necessary for the production neither they think on the contamination of the environment and with manipulating children in such a young age the problems in our world always get bigger and bigger
the prohibtion is easily said but hard to umsetzen who says where those children are which tv shows they watch which posters they see to which people they talk it is impossible also without advetising companies cant sell their products and the parents of the children are responsible for them they have to teach them whats necessary and what they shouldnt buy so ",2
12093,we see advertising nearby everywhere and all the time in the newspaper on big walls in the city in the bus and ,11
12094," in television companies invest a huge amount of money to present their new products in television advertising  to us but should it be allowed to make advertising 

firstly ",15
12095," consider that not many children aged  are watching television children are often playing with there new toys or with their brothers and sisters therefore they will not even see the adverts in the television

secondly children are confronted with advertising the whole day they can see adverts in magazines hear it in the radio and there are many other examples so why should it be not allowed to make advertising in television it would make more sense to ",14
12096," forbid any advertising for young children or just allow advertising in any form

on the other ",16
12097, advertising can influence young children if they see stunning products in television they want them too ,0
12098," playing with their old toys or with their brothers and sisters

all things considered ",1
12099, it should be allowed to make television advertising for young children there are adverts nearby anywhere ,13
12100, it woud make no sense to forbid television advertising for young children,13
12101,"should television advertising which is for young childern be allowed

why should be this not allowed advertising isnt something bad everywhere you can she advertisings when you are on the street or in public transport there are everywhere some placats with advertise ",14
12102, for young childern as you can see there is nobody thinking about forbid this ,12
12103, why shouldnt it be allowed in the television with televison advertising for young childern you can make them happier because they see something in the advertise what they would like to have which they woulnt have seen without television advertising but we talk here about young children between two and five and most of them even dont understand what the saw in an advertising ,14
12104, it doesnt even matter so ,18
12105, you can say the dont realise what they saw and ,3
12106, you have to look from another ,18
12107, have to look for those who produce those product and make those television advertising because where else should they place their product ,11
12108," that they can reach their possible customers so our opinion is that telvision advertising should be allowed

imagine youre a young kid and youre watching your favorite tv programm and ",15
12109, theres a break because of a television advertising is there something more awful than that first those childrens probably even wont understand what they see ,6
12110, why should you do some advertising ,11
12111, nobody understands or watch it second those advertisings are sometimes really confusing so there are chances that those young childrens coud be influenced by those advertises young childrens could miss understand the meaning of the advertising and get influenced by them and ,16
12112, the young childrens dont often watch tv ,1
12113," they watch tv they should be able to watch what they want to and not some stupid televison advertises 

in my view television advertising for young children souldnt be allowed because ",13
12114, i think theyre to young to even understand those advertisings second i ,16
12115, think they can get influenced or want something ,3
12116, which they actually arent mean to have beacuse the producer placed their product wrong so i have to say we should look that the childrens arent watching all the time and if they wa,2
12117,fun colourful and loud those adjectives ,18
12118, apply to the advertisement aimed at a young target group the children just like the toys and sweets that are being sold to children the advertisement is ,0

children are not ",16

12121, they do not understand economy and ,3
12122, neither they understand marketing children are very influencable ,2
12123, their lack of knowlege and are an easy target by aiming advertisement at a group of  year olds the industry is playing an unfair game by taking ,16
12124," young they are barely able to make up their own mind 

since children ",7
12125, aged  dont have any buying force on their own its their parents decision whether a purchase is made or not advertisement directed at a very young target group ,16
12126, does not have an impact on childrens prosperity they arent able to amass any debt and ,9
12127, the only thing the industry is taking ,23
12128," of is the parents soft spot the children will automatically run up to their parents and beg them to buy the advertised product which only be bad for the parents nerves

after asessing the pros and cons of the topic advertisement aimed at young children i have come to the conclusion that advertisement for children might not be a very fair game but ",16
12129, the children arent suffering any damage from it ,4
12130, the buying decision does not lie on their ,23
12131,there shouldnt be advertisment for young children in the television because ,13
12132, kids tend to watch television and thats not good children in this age should be in the garden or somewhere else playing it isnt good for them my mom always told me that if i am watching television all day i get squared eyes and we dont want that our children have squared eyes and that leads us to the opposite the parents of the children should decide if their children are allowed to watch television the state shouldnt have a word to say ,17
12133," it is about raising a child
on the other ",8
12134," kids dont even have money at least not very much when a kid see something in an advertisement and wants it but isnt able to get it its very frustrating maybe its even motivating children to steal
you can ",2
12135, say that for the community of television watchers it has to be illegal because most of them arent young children and ,15
12136," its very unpleasent to see advertisement for childrens all the time 

i am clearly against advertising  at the age of  because ",16

children often wake up early in the morning and until their parents wake up they go watching tv mostly they watch children tv with many animated series and movies between those series are breaks and in these breaks there are advertisings some of them are advertising for toys so the problem is that the children see these adorable toys and like every other child they want to have them so they ask their parents and ",14
12144, they do not get it they can be very naughty,3

",14
12147, that one can say without a doubt that the exposure of young children to television has increased enormously over the course of the last decade since i am not a specialist on this topic i can hardly speak of ,17
12148, i do believe that children under the age of five can be influenced by commercials ,14
12149," they hardly developped an understanding of what is true and what is a lie so if they hear a certain statement in an advertisement they probably are going to believe it

on the other ",3
12150, see the lack of development in a childs brain as an ,7
12151, if a child will see or hear a commercial they would not even understand it although this sounds plausible to me why would a company make an advertisement s those young children ,0
12152, could be that such advertisements have a teaching effect on the children for example they would learn to differentiate between a ,0

now ",10
12154, one can believe whatever he wants from my ,18
12155, of view a child should not be directly addressed in a commercial they do not have any chance of knowing what is right and what is not and ,16

it is an other situation if children can see this kind of advertising the short video clips in the televison are special made that they manipulate the mind of the childrens and they want to have this toys after the program the children search the parents and ask them to buy this stuff imagine your own young child have those wishes would you ignore them exactly that is the reason why the advertising for children is a such bad buisness the people who works in the television get richer and the parents get poor

12193," without these commercialbreaks the channel wouldnt survive and this would be by far more sad if there would be no channels anymore for children

secondly we need to ask ourself if there is any differences between the advertsing for children or adults in my opinion there are no differences because everytime we watch our favorite serie or sportsteam in the tv deep down in our brain we let us influence by companies which are much more harmful ",14
12194, the toyscompanies on cartoon network   ,20

12201, they want to have more and more stuff they can have the feeling of  never have enough this could ,3

12208,"many people nowadays think that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed some of them think that it is just sensless and others see it as a real problem so lets just look at the pros and cons of this subject and come to a conclusion

waht is definetly a negative ",14
12209, about advertising to kids is that they want everything that they see and stop being happy with the things they already have because kids are ,0
12210," naiv they belive everything said in the advertisement they are to young to understad that the companies want to manipulate your brain in a way that you buy their product when parents let their kids watch television they want the kids to look a serie for kids or animated movies but with the advertisment the kids are not willing to watch televieson anymore but they want that thing that they just saw in the advertisement and start bothering their parents so i definetly understand the parents who wants to ban any kind of advertisement toward their young children

on the other ",14
12211, it is a good way for companies selling toys and things for kids to sell their products like every other company they have the right to advertise their product often the publicities are directed to the parents ,0

first of all we must see that the factories and companies want to sell their product ",23
12218," its essentially for them to produce television advertising especially the children aged  are a goal of this advertisings because they havent the expierence what they want
on the other ",0

in my ",2
12221, of view it should be allowed to direct advertising toward young children but with some borders only advertising for product which support the childrens learn process should be allowed because this product maybe didnt get enough recognicement ,16
12222, they should place the advertisement in the television other products like toys with no learn function shouldnt get the possibility to place advertisement toward young childrens,16
12223," write an essay about the statement if television advertising  yound children should not be allowed or in other words in my words if television publication toward young children has some negatives or positives influences to childrens life 

in my opinion ",13
12224, it plays an important role about which theme this television advertising  is when they cansee some advertising about a movie or serie with sexual backround ,10
12225, it would be a negative influence because they can not understand the problematic about this sort of film but ,4
12226, the publication is about a documentary which can influence the children in a positive meaning than ,6
12227," the children are informed about this documentary

also a ",6
12228," the children have to understand about which thematic this seriefilm is  when they can not understand what this type of filmserie would say to them an exemple if the publication is about an unreal theme they get a false picture of the world

a positive ",6
12229, is the children can watch films and series in which they could be interested and ,6
12230, the publication is about a documentary the children can learn a lot of things in which they are interested and had not known ,6
12231," about the television publication is that the children learn the handle with our digital world they have to find out what they like or do not like about our digital world they can learn how they have to handle with this storm of publication 

my opinion about this statement is children aged  are too young to understand the television world it is too difficult to understand the world from the olders my wish for the future is that my children would have grown up in a world full of magic moments in reallife ",17
12232, it plays an important role that children grow up in a natural world they have to observe the world with all the ,8
12233, they would see a television advertising they would be just influenced in the digital world im very happy about my childhood in which i grew up in a natural and realistic world i had made my own observes and im thankful ,0
12234,the aim of this essay is to ,21
12235," or disagreee with the statement if advertising  should not be allowed

i ",15
12236," with the statement because there is no shown dammage of advertising toward young children it affects nor their brain nor their character in a bad way 
another reasons why i ",16
12237," is that young children should get accustomed to advertising in young age they have to learn how to deal with tempting adverts so its actually good for their learning process

",16
12238," with the statement because young children are overwhelmed more easily and hesitate less to buy a product shown in a advert even worse if they dont have any money they are tempted to steal the goods presented in tv 
adverts are often surreal videos about the affect a product can have for example red bull shows that that the actor is able to fly ",0
12239, drinking a red bull such adverts could influence the behaviour of a young child so if they believe in the advert of red bull they might even jump off a cliff ,0
12240," drinking a red bull because they think they can fly

i conclude that ",19
12241, with the statement based on the reason that advertising could really harm young children and has an influence on their behaviour therefore television advertising toward young children should be banned,13
12242,does tv advertising  influence the job market or will they turn them into mindless slaves of the companies a lot of people think that television advertising towards young children should be prohibited but why well this will be shown ,14
12243," essay

if we let our children watch such advertising they dont really understand what they are watching the brain of a  year old childisnt able to make a difference between reality and fantasy so if it per example watches an advertising for a new toy and it says that it will turn them happy for the rest of their life they will believe it so we could say that this advertising brainwashes the young generation and urges them to buy or make their parents buy the products of certain companies

on the other ",0
12244, the chance that the children dont understand what they are watching or they just forget it because children at this age arent really able to remember all the things they witness especially ,24
12245," they are watching tv because there they have a real flood of informations and impressions incoming 

furthermore the companies which produce the products in the advertising will sell more of their products because childrencould be able to urge their parents to buy them this could be positive for the companies and even produce more work places in the factories also people could start working as producers whih only concentrate on child advertisment and how they are the most efficient this would ",0
12246," create more jobs

but letting children wach tv at the age of  is really  dangerous and could lead to the ",17
12247, that they later wont be able to play by themselve or interact with other cildren because they never learnt it ,24
12248, that they were just watching television the whole day ,1
12249," going outside and play

in the end id have to say that it doesnt matter if there is television advertising toward young children because children shouldnt stay at home and watch television all day long it really isnt healthy and wont help them for their future life also children arent able to know what is reality and what is fantasy during those commercials which could lead to dangerous incidents they will soon or later be more and more influenced by the companies and this crates a weak personality if you are getting influenced and brainwashed day by day so if i have to say yes or no to tv advertising towards children ",14
12250,this hypothesis is very difficult to answer because ,21
12251, young children should not watch free tv at this age but if they had the possibility and see a advertising there the possibility that they run ,17
12252," their parents and moan that they want to have this car or something too is really high so the strategy isnt bad
but i do ",3
12253, it is not too good ,18
12254, the children see some advertising of the companies which is not meant for them the children shouldnt watch tv too much and ,14
12255, they want to watch a little story ,3
12256, going to sleep the parents have to think about it what theire children are allowed to watch and what not so they childs can not raise up to the publicity and during the day the should go out and play with friends maybe it is a little oldfashioned but they have only once their childhood and they cant repeat this time so it is in the force of the parents to look ,1
12257," theire children and to look that they do not watch television without the agreement of them
it isnt good for the children ",17
12258, they watch have to watch programms where are many publicity and which are directed to them because if the companie reach theire end and brings the parents to the shop and buy the toys the children know that this works and want to have more and more toys of this company the parents are ,20

it has ",17

at the end i can say that ",8

12280," why i do not need want sounded good in television this way of handling helped me to get a sensitivity to seperate usefull things from rubbish 

my ",10
12281, reason why i am totally against disallowments is that we live in a liberal world this spirit of free thinking should not be destroyed by people who want to make everything forbidden we have to use our brain to think about what we need in my opinion it would be bad for the economy ,12
12282, many regulations in our society ,21
12283, it would be better if we make good buissines impossible its a ,23

finally ",23
12285,"advertising is one of the key concept of a freemarket economythere are many different kind of advertising adressing different age and social groups even young children with the age of  are exposed to advertising 

we live in a freemarket economy that capitalism can function well we need to limit the restrictions made by the government our economy shall be as liberal as possible and a restriction which permits advertising to very young people is not necessary at all additionally we must not forget the importance of gaining a young customer base all those very young children will be potential customers one day and you as an enterprise want to reach out for them as early as possible

nevertheless we need to consider the possible damage children can suffer from being ",16

summarized it can be said it is a conflict between capitalistic and health values either we harm our freemarket economy even more or we just accept that our children are exposed to a potential disruption of the developtment process",16
12287,today many children are sitting in front of the tv most of their freetime even in the morning ,17
12288, the parents are awake in this essay i explain the ,8
12289," why television advertising  should not be allowed

first of all if children watch tv they mostly like to watch cartoons which arent very intelligent and from which they not really can learn something but most parents let their children watch tv ",15
12290, they can do other things ,19
12291," working or they can sleep longer and the children are happy and quiet and dontt distract them
an other reason is that ",1
12292," children watch to much tv they become less creative in tv the stories are given and you only have to watch and listen this children loose the ability to imagine a own story children which play with toys do that every time thay play
lastly you can ",17
12293, say that children which watch to much tv dont know what to do in their freetime if they cant watch tv they are addicted of watching tv most of this children arent sportif and have problems with their body watching tv is not very healthy,17
12294,the television is a good thing ,17
12295, you have nothing to do unfortunalety parents give childreen the permission to watch tv mostly ,17
12296, they have not very much time for them so the childrens have soemthing to do and the parents wont be disturb by their childrens with the time young children came much earlier in contact with the tv or ,17
12297," with computers or smartphones 
but what are the ",18
12298," of the children if they look to early tv or thing like that
if the partens are stressed they can say to the childrens that they have to look tv ",17
12299, most of the childrens are quiet calm and they are very focused on the tv it depends of cours which program they watch sometimes there are really good programms for kids which be very informativ the kids can learn things from docus about animals or just thing which are important for the world but there is ,17
12300, a bad site in the tv programm are many thing which childrens should not watch if young childreen watch very often tv they know only this and maybe their social behaviour will be not very good ,17

my oppinion is that young children can watch tv but not very often maybe one or two times a week for one hour but the parents should be there and they have to controll what the childrens watch kids should play with their games and with their friens this is much importer than watching tv but ",17
12302," that kids which are younger than four should not watch tv often or weekly because they dont realise really what is happening there 
finally i say they should not be allowed or not its a thing which the parents should say and they can make a desicon how often they want that their childrens watch tv but ",17
12303, interessted that their childrens play with the games and their friends and ,24
12304,"it depends on the given information the intent by the advertisement
publicity is economically the biggest and one of ",11
12305," things money is spend on 
forbidding the publicity would have a great impact on the economical marketing as ",23
12306, it would mean a extrem loss for companies ,23
12307," in politics 
it is often not dangerous it does not affect the childrens minds for them it is more a nuisance than an important information they simply ignore it and ",7
12308, it has not the brainwash effect that is mostly feared more problamatic are the youngsters with 6 to 12 years because ,4
12309," they are in a easier way to influece and advertisements have a bigger effect on them 
children are very interesting because they have the ability to suck up all and every information they are given like a sponge so they are always in danger to learn things they should not but that is a common ",2
12310," that is mostly forgotten
publicity does not harm kids what really harms them is the television itself this is more a parental ",17
12311," of view kids should not spend too much time in front of the tv they should learn things by experience and by watching in the reality 
do you know what really grinds my gears the amount of money spend on publicity it is ",17
12312, ernormous with that money we could have saved and ,18
12313," could save millions of people who are in a very difficult situation
we are obligated to help them",21
12314,advertising is one sort of earning money nowadays after every tv programmes will be time for a five minute break and this break will be filled with advertising adertising are made to cover the watchers eyes and to buy a product but ,10
12315, the television streams cartoons for childern the advertisement agencis use the attenion of the childern to sell even more products the unknown child will fall in to this trap and annoys the parents to getthe toyor whatever this strategy of the agencis are very quetionable and leads to dicussions nowadays here are some ,14
12316," which will show you why the advertising should not be allowed

firstly the children do not know anything about money or the even the world and how it is working it will see the advertisement and will not stop crying until it gets the toy at ",0
12317, it will probably forgetit but a advertisement will come a serveral time during a day on tv so the children sees the toy and can not stop thinking about it and this can happen with plenty of other advertisementsthe parents have no choice and they will buy the product for the baby ,20
12318," it can stop asking and can be happy
another ",18
12319, is that children are in their growth process if it gets confronted with advertising daily ,16
12320, everything and if the parents are not strict it will do that in its teenager years too and ,24
12321, probably for thewhole live children have to be educated thatif they want somethingtheyhave to dothings ,12
12322," they can even imagine of getting something
the last ",3
12323," is that advertising for children is unnecessary and it is just a psychological way to earn money which is really childish a child watches tv to learn the language or to understand the situation in the tv programsnot to get attracted bya toy

in myopinion advertisingon childrens tv channel should be prohibited some programes have already shut down the advertising on childrens programme",14

paragraph 2 why not disallow

introduction
we all know this discussion about the consumerism of the medias by children some people think that children under 5 years should not be able to watch something on the television others think that it is good for the children ",17
12326," that they can achieve a higher level in life because they learned by watching the television

first ",6
12327, look at the position of people who are against the television their probably biggest ,10
12328, is that the tv is not good for our eyes but another very big ,6
12329, write about is the neglection of their social â¨lives children who watch too much tv do not care anymore about their real lifewith their true friends and prefer to watch tv than to go outthese people may have a big ,17
12330, in their lives it is not good if a child is watching tv because it is bad for social lifes in the future and maybe they will get bullied later in their lifes because others who did not watch tv have friends and they have not that is a true sign that the tv and other mediasare not good for children and they should better go out and play football or other games like we did ,17
12331, talk about this out of the view of people who do not want to disallow children to watch television one of their ,17
12332, look at abit more exactly it is the ,18
12333, that if children do nt watch tv until they are five yars old they will try to watch much more ,17
12334, they are over five years old and they can watch tv by these people it is ,17
12335," possible that they sop having a social live and they will get bullied 

in conclusion we have to say that ",7
12336, and we should take a middle ,18
12337, would be that parents allow their children to use these medias ,12
12338, they are five years old but they should control their consum so that it is something like half an hour per day thanks for your attention,24
12339,television advertising directet toward young children should not be allowed children under five years dont have an idea if a product is good or not for them they arent able to think critically about something and ,13
12340," they think everything they like is good 
the general problem is that television advertising can have an influence on a childs way of thinking for example if there is a young boy with playgun in an advertisement another young boy would ",14
12341, like to have such a gun but often these guns look very simmilar to real guns so the young boy wants to have a gun with this gun he ,20
12342," playing with it in the end its possible that he doesnt see a difference between real life and his game
another example is young girls playing with barbies they think the barbie is very beautiful and they want to be like her later in their life they wont look like a barbie and they fall into a depression and if they hadnt seen the television advertising they wouldnt have had a barbie and now a depression 

",20
12343, the real problem is that television advertising  is seen children shoulnt watch tv all the time they should go out and play with their friends if they dont watch tv a lot they dont see a lot of advertisement and the problem wouldnt even exist if they see the advertisement only a few times i dont think that this has a bad influence on them because they will not remember the product so a few advertisings for good stuff are totally ok but it shouldnt be too much ,14
12344,television adverts directed  are no problem the children can see what is new on the market and maybe they find their new birthday present by watching the adverts if there is an advert for a my little pony in television that does not mean every little girl does want to own it if they see the pony in tv or in walmarts is no difference ,14
12345," they will find out anyway

another good ",19
12346," about children advertising is that you can make a good influence on the boys and girls you could bring a television spot about wwf and that they could join the panda club to help the nature and animals 

last but not least parents can be thankful for the adverts because they make a break between their childs favourite show if the series on nickelodeon would play nonstop parents would not be able to take their child away from the television 

but ",0
12347, some people think adverstising for children is harmless you can argue with some ,7
12348," that show the contrary
when children spot their favourite toy in television they immediately want to have it you can not argue with them and by watching television they really get confronted with new toys while you are able to avoid these parts in supermarkets

additionaly adverts can make a big influence and there are not many good adverts around while your five year old son would like to have a lego star wars battleship your two year old daughter is not that happy about seeing little lego figures shooting at each others heads 

to sum up advertising directed  should  not be allowed a child aged  is defenitely too young for adverts and could be influenced badly i understand that most of the television channels do not function without adverts ",14
12349, if there is no possibility to prohibit advertising on kids channels you should not let your child watch television in this young age ,14
12350,"as a child i always used to watch kika my parents tought its the only channel which should be alowed to children because there is no advertising and they dont try to convince and manipulate the children to buy something the other tv channel was superertel superertel had a lot of advertising in between a film and i liked that it was for a child like me very intresting to see what the most common trends are and what i could wish for my birthay or christmas but should it be allowed to direct tv advertising towards children 

tv advertising is s every goup of age ",14
12351, why should it not be derectet towards children if you watch tv you ,17
12352, need to accept that there is advertising the parents of children need to decide if they want their children to watch tv nobody gets forced to watch tv ,14
12353, if you dont want your child to watch advertising you can skip the breaks or your child just dosent watchs tv there are ,14
12354," some channels for children with less arvertisement eg kika

every advertisement company knows that children are very easy to manipulate ",0
12355, they take the opportunity espacialy in chistmestime to influence the children so on one had you can say that they use the maturity of children and ,8
12356, you can say that it is just a business and its just a logic strategy of the companys but the ,23
12357," with the use of maturity imediately loses its power if you keep in mind that watching tv is voluntary

in conclusion ",17
12358, that it should be allowed to direct tv advertising towards children because nobody gets forced to watch tv and there are ways to overcome the advertising ,13
12359, in a filmbreak for companys its very important that they can show advertising and manipulate children because there is no better way to reach them ,16
12360,"were confronted everyday and everywhere with ads the goal of this ads is to influence us to buy the product but where isnt it good anymore to influence people

first children aged  shouldnt watch tv they are too young to sit in front of a television and too young to understand what they see when they see an ad with barbie ",0
12361," they want a barbie because they are fascinated from this toy and want it these ads shouldnt exist because they influence young children who normally want everything what makes sound moves or is sparkling
another reason why televison advertising for young children should not be allowed is because they cant handle all those different ads with thousands of toys these children cant buy the toys by themself because they dont earn money it isnt effective to make ads for young children because the parents control what toys they have

to summarize ads should only exist to adults because they earn there one money and are able to control how they spend there money otherwise the parents have to buy toys for the children because they want it ",0
12362," bad
all in all i can say that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because they are too young to understand that they want to sell products 
",13
12363, explain you the reasons why ,21
12364, they cant do television advertising they find other ways who are ,11
12365, as succesfull as the television advertising to sell there productsi mean just ,11
12366, you go in a  shopping mal you get everywhere influenced and you dont even remark it also it is hard to forbid it because you have to make rules  and its hard to decide ,12
12367, an television advertising is for five years old children and ,0
12368, not they could easily say no our toy is for six years old children so they could put it on television and i don ,20
12369, you cant understand and memorise a television advertising with two years more efficient it would be from the age six to tenbecaus in this age you understand the advertising completely and you remember the wonderful pink dog toy ,0
12370, i was a little kid i didnt watch that much television i nearly never watched ithoever our society has changed during the last ten years the families with young children that i know dont let the chidren watch often television ,17
12371,so i come to the conclusion that it isn the write age because they didn alway understand an memorise it and they dont watch as much television as older childrens do it is a really big act who ,24
12372, wouldn t be really succesfull because you get nowadays nearly everyday and everywher influenced to buy something thats why ,23
12373, the statement television advertising   aged   should not be allowed,15
12374,television advertising is important for young children for learning not to believe everything what is showed in television they have to learn that they cant have everything they want and television advertising is a good way to improve that  children ,14
12375," get a feeling for what is possible in this world and could already make a mind about what they are going to buy in the future
but now to the con ",3
12376," in my view children shouldnt see all that nonsense which is often mentioned in adverts children are to young to make a diffrence between the reality and the informations in adverts adults know whats the truth behinde  them in opposite of the kids futhermore children shouldnt
see some of those adverts because ",16
12377, there are somtimes online games presentedwhich are cruel and show violent or whats with the adverts of online cambling websites most the of them are very colourful and seem very interresting and if a child visit such a website it will become very dangerous for it the adverts of social media is ,16
12378," not very good for young children they come in contact with things for those they are not old enough 
to sum it up i ",4
12379, with my own oppinion i totally ,21
12380, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed in my view children who are aged  are not old enough for even watching television or seeing adverts children couldnt really make their own opinion about a advert because they dont have any experience with them kids are kids and on should let them their lifes without any lyings about  products they are too young for understanding whats behind the adverts,13
12381,"in the days of television and social media advertising is an improtant subject which has to be discussed and even more the advertising  because often even such kids have a free access to such plattforms filled with advertisnig
the main ",16
12382, for abandonig this advertising would probably be that young children are more likely to believe what they see and hear from partents teachers and even television due to theire young age they can easily be persuaded by an advertisning for a product it often is mentioned in these television advertisings that the advertised product  often a toy  is everything that you need these words or phrases like that can have a big impact on such young humans and they often even begin to believe them the consumation of the product develops to a need on the other ,0
12383," you may say that even young children have the possibilty to have a free will and to at last decide wether they like a product or not 
the ",7
12384, that the action of buying the product of interest ,23
12385, is made by adults is very improtant ,4
12386," without parents other family members or other related not minor persons paying for an object the kids cant even consumate it or without people allowing them to watch television they will not get in contact with television advertising kids are depending on these older persons
an ",9
12387, which is not directly talking about free will of children but is improtant for the pro,7
12388," of not allowing these adverts anymore is that the children very early get in contact with a society that mostly consumates and that is filled with advertising children should have the possibility to increase theire creativity in this world they should have the possibility to change the place that they are living in and this can not happen that easy if they are affected by all these advertisings and cant develope theire own wishes and dreams
but are ",16
12389," not even adults products of an advertised world and not as creativ as they could be

for my part i am not to sure what ",23
12390, about the statement the line between a free will and persuation is very thin ,21
12391," have a world without such a lot of advertising affecting me adults and young children
",11
12392,"some weeks ago my five year old nephew saw an advertisement about a car toy on television i remember how he immediately called his mother and asked her to buy him that toy my sister didnt buy it but it was okay because my nephew already had a big car toy 

as young children tend to believe everything they get told they are very likely to be influenced this is used by many companies through television advertising to make them want something the pressure of needing something ",2
12393, have fun or to be cool already confronts these young children and if a child doesnt get what it wants it fastly gets frustrated and sad this might be caused by the famous phenomenon which says that children never can get enough toys on the other ,24
12394, some might say that its the fault of the parents ,7
12395, who didnt teach their children enough to be happy with a couple of toys the ,20
12396, that children aged  normally didnt develop that much ,8
12397, so they do not realise that something isnt necessary to have ,3
12398, they are interested in it another ,3
12399, for these television advertisement could be the money these television channels need during childs programm on television there is always some advertisement when a child watches a childs series it it understandable that it is normal to show advertisements which are appropriate for children and not to show adults advertisements some television channels need these advertising companies to support their channel and to make sure they are ,14
12400," able to show their content in the future 

to bring it on ",19
12401, young children are very easy to get influenced and companies know that it is the parents challenge to talk to their children about that in my opinion this ,2
12402, doesnt justify the companies advertising ,11
12403, it should not be allowed because these children already get to see many toys in the stores and it just brings more pressure for the parents ,12
12404,"television advertising s young children aged  should not be allowed
todays world is overgrown by incessant advertising many ads are unfortunately directed at children that barely learned to talk many people think this should be banned in the united kingdom fast food companies are not allowed to air their advertisements during children tv this was done to lower child obesity rates but many people argue that this is a step in the wrong direction this law does not help the children but ",13
12405, the parents that do not have control over their children or are not strong enough to say no to their kin the same group of persons think that children should get used to advertising as soon as possible and learn to ignore or judge it as this is very important later in their lives on the other ,16
12406, young  yearolds are very easy to manipulate and should be safeguarded until they are ready to evaluate advertising in my opinion are children exposed to adverisements all the time and should ,16
12407, be taught to ignore or evaluate it at young age advertising should not be regulated by the sate but ,13
12408,"advertising
a lot of people of two until hundert years old people watch televsison watch tv is a important thing in our world because with watch tv we learn a lot of things par example with the news on tv whats going on with the word or the document films the life of an animal but should watch tv be allowed to the two until five years old childern ",17
12409," be going on

it is not good for the very young childern to watch television because it is not good for the healthy for par example for the eyes and ",17
12410, the children will be older they look enough televison that is the reason why ,17
12411, televison advertising  the two until five years old children should not be allowed because ,13
12412, the televison advertising should be allowed to the children ,14
12413," they watch televison but in this young ages we can do a lot of other things probably the childern dont want go out for playing whith their friendsthey are only sitting in theirs room an focused on watch tv

but sometimes the television advertisting brings a lot of good things so that the childern can learn a lot of things in this young ages that is an avantage for the children later they can learn things in an other way and that could be funny 

in the end i want say that television advertisting could be an avantage ",17
12414, a desavantage when the parents look that the children dont watch televison a lot ,17
12415," television advertisting should be allowed
",15
12416,it is said that television avertising toward yound children is unhealthy and should be forbidden in this essay ,17
12417, find out if this statement makes sens and ,21
12418, advertising is normal in our society and its not possible to ban it beause of young children i dont know what your children watch but i was addicted to superrtl or nickeloden these are typical channels for children and dont include advertising bad things ,14
12419," there is no reason to ban televison advertising because this only happens on channels which your son or girl shouldnt watch

",15
12420, mention that there isnt just one type of advertising when you hear this word you think about something bad or unimportant but there are few types of useful advertising ,11
12421," sofatutor this is a useful online platform to help your children learn in funny ways

finally its not that every child who sees advertising buys that instantly they have not the knowlege to use moms credit card ",0
12422, its not dangerous that they buy some incorrect things you must be very stupid as a mom ,4
12423," you buy these thingsvso the children dont even realise that this products can be bought

in conclusion there is absolutly no way to ban televison advertising for young children because there is simply no reason to do that because most of the time children dont even realise that its advertising",14
12424,we all know these kinds of advertising when you ar sitting on the sofa watching tv maybe even a good film there is ,11
12425," a block of ads for example one of toys r us they show happy children at the age of four with little cars figures or other kinds of toys but is it okay to influence young children already at this age

if you show a young boy a picture of a toy maybe a car he ",16
12426, wants one but is he able to buy one no hes not ,18
12427," the influence of the television advertising is zero due to this the advertisment is just for the parents who maybe want to buy their kids these kinds of toys because of this it should be allowed to show advertising  because they arent affected
well ",14
12428, its true that the parents are influenced by these tv ads but ,14
12429, affected of course a three year old girl cant buy barbies but she can talk to her mother who hasnt saw the advertising maybe she has to ask more times her mother to buy her a barbie but ,2
12430," a few weeks the mother will eventually give up and buys her daughter a barbie then the toystore has reached their goal the selling of a barbie in this example the mother is only indirect affected by the advertising but the little girl is the direct victim of the toystore if she hadnt watched the advertising which is  her she hadnt asked her mother and she hadnt bought the barbie


because of these ",2
12431, it is better to prohibit the advertising toward young children at least until the age of five it is not okay that the big toy concernes use the young children to make even more money we should safeguard the ,16
12432, generation against the bad influence of the toy industry where only the profit and not the children is important,20
12433,we all are influenced by televison but nothing is as influencable as little children but anyways alot of television advertising is s the youngest of our society in the following text it is written about why ,14
12434," advertising directed to little children shouldnt be prohibitted
while an adult person mostly can tell truth and false appart a child cant and ",16
12435," watching tv they absorb alot of information witch can have a very negative influence to the childs mind and their future consumption habbits
on the other ",17
12436, if television advertising directed to children should not be allowed ,13
12437," the children shouldnt be allowed watching tv at all children dont only notice spots and shows directed to them they notice everything
and back to the future consumption habbits in my opinion the consumption habbits is mostly a question of how the consumption habbit of the parents look like and how they teach their children handling their money
if parents dont want the possible negative influence of advertising for children they shouldnt let them watch tv at all",14
12438,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed 
on television theres allways something for everyone the dads who love car races or the mums who love teleshopping and the teenanger who loves horror and psycho movies and ",13
12439, cute episodes for small kids who like watch spongebob squarepants but what happens ,6
12440, the small  year old children klick to another ,24
12441," and see these disturbing things which they dont understand in this age 
they are scared and cant sleep anymore because they are just too young for these kind of things its dangerous to let a young child watch television alone there are ",24
12442, many other things they could do ,19
12443, always watching television television takes the kreativity and the motivation to expolre the world only watch television is ,17
12444, easy but its bad its bad for the eyes for the concentration and for the power of a child these small humans should ,4
12445," of all learn how to do things by themselfs that they dont get bored in life theres much more than just a dumb television where you only have to klick one thing and its working 
but its ",1
12446, important to say that television ,10
12447, has some good things on it with television you can just put the littleones in front of and you can do the things you have to do there are ,6
12448, many diffrent channels for children which are funny and interessting they actually can learn something ,6
12449," watching television they can nget in touch with the whole world and all different cultures but is this that you want for you child 
my opinion is that its bad to put theire children allways in front of the tv tthey have to learn and meet ",17
12450, many things and have to get kreative its not all about television its important to know what you like and have to get used to the whole life outside the house its more important to know how to life than to know where the hat of dorie is ,17
12451," that theres a lot of television advertisments that are designed to appeal children even young toddlers between the age of two and five years they are usually aired on television channels that aim toward such a young public
but is it okay to influence people with the power of media from such a young age

there are positive ",14
12452, in economical terms children will see a product ,2
12453, watching tv and feel the desire to own it because the promoters on the screen told them that the justshown product was something they needed children who beg their parents to purchase the wanted item usually some sort of toy will eventually get it that means workers are needed to produce and sell the toy ,20
12454, more income amongst workers and ,23
12455," to a higher gdp

on the other ",21
12456," that may affect the childs mental health for example the child will be exposed to our societal standards and all their issues a black child may ask himself why all the cool kids with the amazing toys are white that could lead to decreasing selfconfidence because that black child doesnt see role models that apply to their appereance and heritage
gendered toys could ",4
12457, bewilder all the young viewers because they feel more drawn the the object that is identified with a boy or a girl ,6
12458," theyre the opposite sex

in my opinion there shouldnt be any advertising of any kind aimed to reach children that age because there is more damage than good done also children in that age shouldnt waste their time sitting in front of the tv watching all those advertisments but much more go outside and live in a world where they arent influenced by moneyseeking people ",16
12459,the television advertising  is a critical ,10
12460, young children can be influenced easily if you show them an advertising of a toy with many special effects and stuff that children usually like the children will run to their parents and tell them to buy the toy but ,0
12461," is the only one which is negativ

the advertises for young children arent anything bad and ",16
12462, it doesnt have a bad influence to them well it is an ,4
12463, for the industry of toys and children stuff but it is nothing bad for the parents or the children because if a child goes to his parents and wants them to buy something it is in their own responsibility to decide yes or no another ,2
12464," that speaks for the advertising for young children is that children in this age have to learn not to buy everything they see in the television i dont see any other reasons why advertising for young children should not be allowed

i remeber ",13
12465, i was young and i saw those advertisings i always ran to my parents and asked them to buy those things ,0
12466," but they often say no but told me to put it on the llist for my christmaswishes so there was hope that i maybe would receive what i saw in the television

so with the all those ",3
12467, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed,15
12468,first of all in our days there arent many advertisements s young children aged  some advertisements ,16
12469, illustrate toys or objects to play with which are for young kids but now is the question should television advertising be allowed for this young audience are there more ,14
12470," lets analyse this phenomen
generally technology develops from time to time and becomes better and we can see that theres a big progress everytime we take a look at the technology development seeing kids in a young age holding a mobile phone and texting messages or surfing on the internet becomes more commun than ever ",23
12471, and the same situation is present in the tvaudience we all know that all around the world there is a huge amount of tvwatchers and to present new products or new devices theres nothing more clever than for a firm to advertise its product on the tv where a lot of people could get interested to it and buy it this is the market world its the way it works with a good advertisement u can convince people to buy the product which is presented lots of children stare at the tvscreen for hours and fill their day watching tv programes and during the breaks advertisements are showed for example some are more directed to women some more for menand ,10

12474, advertisements directed to really young children aged  should ,16

12476, in families on the chance that a young child sees the new product illustrated ond on the tv is much higher than in a shop behind the vetrine generally the parents shouldnt allow their young children to sit in front of the tv and stare on the screen for hours this has its health reasons but if the children see suddenly an advertisement directed for them and they like how the toy  looks like or whatever it could be why not buy it im convinced that advertisements  shouldnt be banned every firm or shop has the right to advertise its productif at the end they dont gain a lot its their problem but they ,14

moreover the way how our economy works is by advertising you can not watch tv and expect to not see adds at all or you can not read a newspaper without seeing adds that is just the normal way how tv stations get their money and through the adds the audience will decide wether to buy this product or not it doesnt matter if the add is directed to old or young people if toy companies are not allowed to advertise their products how are they supposed to make money so i dont see why advertising directly toward young children should not be allowed",16

12490, of view a young child is not able to think rationally and decide if an advertisment is accurate or not it just sees the pretty colours and the nice women talking directly to them to try to sell a product they are influenced by many small factors like the specture of colours the different animated characters and ,0

12504, do parents influence their children its ,7
12505, that the children have a huge impact on their parents its very likely that ,7
12506, a kid really wants to have a specific product the parents will eventually buy it for them so indirectly commercials and ads are actually made to get parents or other grown ups to buy certain products for their kids so ,0
12507, there is not much of a difference between the advertisment for grown ups and the one for children ,16
12508, its the same person buying the product if a parent allows the kid to watch tv it ,2

12510," its the parents choice what he wants the kid to influence
on the other ",7
12511, be said that children often watch shows or programmes simply for entertainement like as an alternative to being read a book or good night story by their parents is this really the right occasion to place in commercials tv for children is not some kind of saleshow children dont have their own money to spend they wont question the things showed on tv like that they ,14

12514, why forbid something that each and everyone can avoid seeing its all about choice and willpower to raise kids without their daily dose of tv,17
12515, with this statement television advertisments that are s children can be allowed an ,13
12516, against the advertising for small chlidren is that children are easy to manipulise but that isnt a problem because parents are here care for their child if a child sees a commercial for a toy he wants he will ask his parents to buy that toy for him which isnt a bad thing because there is nothing wrong with liking something and wanting it but it becomes a problem ,16
12517, it repeats itself and at that ,18
12518, the parents should come into role the child doesnt have any money ,9
12519, he has to ask his mother or father for money and ,9
12520," the kid sees hundreds of commercials for stuff he wants he can ask his parents as much as he wishes but they will never buy it for him 
even if television advertising  will be banished it would not change a thing i never saw or heard of a kid that came to me and said that saw a commercial of a toy and now ownes the toy kids want toys that their friends have or that their brothers have and not what they see on television a spoiled child is spoiled because of his parents and not bacause of commercials 
and anyway children should not watch ",2
12521, much television its not the commercials that are bad for the children its the television shows that ruin them the commercials make them want stuff but the shows change the way they think ,14
12522,"should television advertising  aged  should be allowed

im my opinion television advertising  should be allowed because television advertising can be informative for something the children wants and the parents shouldnt allow everything ",14
12523," his children wants something
 
not every television advertising is bad for young children if there is a advertising about a special toy why should that be forbitten for children it is clear that the parents arent happy ",2
12524," their child wants everything what they see in the television advertising but they can learn something about it and the parents know what is fancy and what not
another ",2
12525," is that the parents should decide what the children are watching in the tv and if there is something what the children want the parents shouldnt allow everything they should say no and must be consequent 

so ",17
12526, that television advertising  shoul be allowed because you cant permit every television advertising not every television advertising is good for young children but they have to learn whats right and whats wrong in the end ,13
12527, the parents have to decide what the children shoul watch and what not,17
12528,"if  young children are watching tv and seeing the newest lego or playmobile stuff they are fascinated and are running immediatly to their parents to ask them to buy it so towards who is tv advertising directed

a good thing about tv advertising  children is that parents get new ideas what they could buy their children as a present if they ask for 
but ",0
12529, the advertising is automatically directed to the parents because they owned the money to buy their children something if they are as young so ,0
12530," it is not something parents are happy about because they have to spent much more money they wanted to spent because in the tv advertising only the best and most of the time the most expensive things are presented 

you can say that a child is calmed down if they sees ",2
12531, many things they wanted to own and got new ideas what to play or what they should talk about with their freinds but it is like the opposite because if children want to have something they started crying ,24
12532," they get what they wanted
so for parents it is not a free time ",9
12533," their children are watching tv because they are always intterupted if a new cool game is shown in the tv advertising and their children are asking to got it  

it is a good thing to show your things you wanted people to buy in tv but if you show childrens stuff it is not very efficient because they can ",14
12534," go with their parents in a shop like toysrus and buy it on their own with the knowledge what you wanted to buy your children

so ",20
12535, tv advertising s young children is absolutely not necessary because parents are getting poor by buying too much stuff which their children not needed it is ,14
12536, not s children but towards their parents ,7
12537, you can not talk about tv advertising s children ,13
12538,whenever you turn on the tv whether it is because you want to watch a movie or because you watch the news every day you see all the things you never realized you needed but suddenly you feel a longing to have that special shampoo that makes your hair look like that from the advert you just saw  or you realize you definitely need that new car because the one you have now just isnt as great but is it really important to have these things you are an adult you can make a difference between things you really need and things you want in the end the advert may have woken a longing in you but you can set yourself free from it but can small kids make that difference aswell in this essay ,8
12539," answer the question whether television advertising s young children should be forbidden 
well ",13
12540, of all i have to state that children of the age  are very easy to impress and to influence when they see an advert they like they feel like they really need this thing right now and probably dont understand why they cant have it they are too young to even understand what an advert is ,16
12541," their parents tell them why they cant have that doll right now 
another problem could be the money when children start going to school they usually get a little amount of money every week so ",20
12542, they see something they want in an advert they could save up and buy the item themselves this way they learn that money isnt something people have unconditionally but little kids dont get money im not sure if they even understand the concept of money when their parents buy them what they wanted ,2
12543," badly from an advert they think they can now have everything they see on television 
on the other ",10
12544, that children see advertising everywhere when they walk through town ,11
12545, they play games on tablets or phones we all know that today kids get their ,24
12546, phone or tablet very early ,18
12547," there they are faced with a lot of advertising aswell
also who says that children can get influenced by an advert that isnt s them because we are only talking about advertising  these children not about any advert where is the difference between what a 5yearold wants and what a 6yearold wants
coming to the end of this essay ",0
12548, against the prohibation i have to say that i thing television advertising toward children aged  should be forbidden ,14
12549, it is right to influence such young people with adverts directed specifially towards them  they will get used to these things soon enough,16
12550,the question if television advertising is good or should be allowed for young children is an old question in a lot of countries are reglements that control how much advertising is allowed and how good you have to erkennen that this is an advertising but the companies have tricks how they can confuse children without having problems with the law an example ist the brandmark in the upper left corner where in the most cases is alos the logo of the channel the companies do this because ,14
12551, children are this young you can manipulate and control them easy this is a big problem because children cannot see the differents between an advertising and the normal program on the channel ,14
12552, they want the merchandise or the products ,23
12553, the see something they like and ,3
12554, they have no money their parents have it and they will buy it if their child is crying for it because of this ,9
12555, on channels for young children or between the series for young children advertisings shouldnt be allowed and i would go ,6
12556, there ar series made by brands ,18
12557, in germany the series from leo the adventurer from the icecream brand langnese where children want to play with the merchandise from leo and you can get this merchandise only with the icecream ,20
12558," the parents are forced to buy the icecream this kind of advertising shouldnt be allowedt to 
but ",16
12559, you look from thee other ,18
12560, of the companies you can see that their are forced to do this because a lot of money they get is from this children and if they cannot sell anymore their products they cannot earn  anymore the money they need to make new products and ,2
12561, this is a capitalistic way to look at this it is bad for the children too because they cannot play anymore with the toys they want ,20
12562," they wouldnt want them if there wouldnt be advertising
so ",11
12563, that those advertisings shouldnt be allowed exspecialy not for young children because they are getting manipulated extremly and ,13
12564, theyre older they didnt learnd how to see the differents between advertising and normal program  ,11
12565,television advertising toward young children should not be allowed ,13
12566," 
this advertising attracts the very young children to watch television because they are interested in the channels they are showing on television the children spend more time in front of the tv and we dont know if it is good for the development of the child ",14
12567," they start watching tv at that young age 
another ",17
12568, against television advertising directing toward young children is that we need to know for what reason they do that what is it exactly they show them on television when there are specific programs helping the children to develop some abilities from which they could profit later ,14
12569, maybe they could be allowed then they are ,19
12570," helpful for families and the child himself but what do they learn on television they cant learn in school or everyday life with friends family members teachers or srangers
i cant imagine something that could be shown to children aged  that can really improve their development 
it is ",17
12571, possible that they show the children specific programs which work like indoctrination of certain ideas philosophies or opinions children can be manipulated ,6
12572," easily and they are perfect victims for manipulation because they dont realize it  
it is dangerous to show them pictures that have an influence on them for example ",7
12573, adults wait in front of a pedestrian crossing until every car has stopped and young children see what they do it is more likely that they copy the observed behavior of the adults than doing exactly the opposite if we take this example to explain what could happen on television it is clear that the programs will have a huge influence it is ,7
12574, good or bad but the opportunity the tv channel producers have to influence and manipulate already the children is scary and dangerous as a parent you have to be very attentive ,17
12575," you chose a tv program 
so it depends on what is shown on tv toward the children if it is helpful for their development or their way of learning it could maybe be allowed or its using at least be discussed but ",17
12576, against it are more important being manipulated is something very dangerous ,21
12577,nowadays its quiet common that little children are contacted with electronical devices at an early age parents give their children their smartphones ,24
12578," the pupil stops crying at an early stage of childhood parents just give the smartphone to the child and play a little video 
apparently not every parent out there plays their pupil some videos on their phone there are ",8
12579, parents who are very protective and dont want their children to be contacted with devices like smartphones or tv at and early stage children are believing what the are seeing it doesnt matter if its in nature or on tv this advertisements on tv are giving the pupils the false impression of the world futhermore young children are influenced with advertisements on their true meaning of wrong and right everybody can imagine a child which has just seen an advertisemnts for sweets the ,14
12580," time the child goes shopping with his parents the pupil is bagging for those sweets it has just seen in the advertisement 
to sum up television advertising shouldnt be allowed for young children because they are influenced too much by them as a liitle child cant differnt good or bad true or false it just interprates what he sees as right and that is in advertisements not very wisely if advertisements would be banned for youngsters parents wouldnt have to handle bagging children who are wanting to buy something just because theyve seen it on tv",13
12581,"is it dangerous to watch television as a child

in our civilisation it is nothing special that young children spend their whole time on television and watch diffrent programms like rtl or pro7 but it was not always like that 10 years ago a television was something special and it was used to watch specific films on it in the last ten years television became much more important for us but is it dangerous to watch television as a child of course there are many cautions by watching television especially as a child it could be dangerous to watch to much television because it could change their way of thinking because a child is very easy to manipulate if the television is giving us informations it is important to be cautious and to ask your self if those informations are the truth as a child it is difficult to seperate the truth and lies its ",17
12582," dangerous to spent to much time by watching television because of the social life if you watch to much television you could forget other important things like play football or meet friends 
but ",17
12583, by watching television as a child you can learn a lot about different things like language which makes it easyier to start with school it depends on what you watch on television it can ,17
12584, possible that children who watch television have it easyier to deal with the technic in our civilisation because they use it every day an other ,17
12585," of television advertising  are the many different programmes which can be used by the children which can help the children to find diffrent things which are intresting for them
as a result i can say that television advertising  should be allowed because there are not ",15
12586, and cautions but all at all it is not necessary to ,21
12587,"personally i dont like the idea involving young children to our buissnessworld a child should act like a child he or she should be able to laugh with others or to play with toys or even start argueing about small things with his or her fellow classmates a child should learn how to become someone reliable and trustworthy plus advertisment was the most annoying thing on television children are not watching tv for the sake of advertisment they are watching it because they love a certain movie or they want to watch their beloved series

on the other ",14
12588, if these advertisments include informations like ,11
12589, spongebob squarepants movie comes out its a good opportunity for children to get hyped and if they are looking forward to it they are easily to bait out then its just a matter of time ,24
12590," these children want their new spongebob actionfigure so that means adultes who only cares about money for them its an easy way to make money because the parents of these children are paying for their toys

somehing against the idea is that its going to take ",20
12591," much effort just think about the advertisment which are perfect for children they dont want advertisment about trash or online banking or stuff like that they want something to laugh at

and ",0
12592," questions are are they even able to understand that does it matter to them is it all about the money
and do we really want to encourage them to sit more ",3
12593, to the television should they not ,19

12596, were watching our favourite programm on tv and all of a sudden the show gets interrupted by a loud noise and some strange guys talking about the newest razor as if it was something very very very important i do and ,18
12597, that some channels have way to many of these annoying advertising breaks i know by now that you shouldnt believe half of the things they tell you ,10
12598," they try to sell their stuff but what about little chilren should they be confronted with all these scenes of children of their age playing with the newest toys

i remember seeing those girls on tv wanting to have as much fun as they seemed to have and ",2
12599," begging my parents to get me those same dolls at that time i didnt think for one moment that it might be wrong to show me all those advertisments because i kind of liked seeing them dont ask me why but i did
now ",20
12600, it could be kind of mean to manipulatelittle kids into thinking they need another barbie doll or the newest playmobilset ,20
12601, they probably have more than enough barbies and playmobil ships laying around in their rooms without ever being used ,20
12602, we shouldnt be told to buy more and more stuff from the day were born i would ,23
12603," see children going out and crafting their own ships and cashiers which is what i loved to play and using their imagination because they will never be as satisfied with a piece of wood for a computer as they are at that age 

so no advertisement towards small children sho           ",0
12604,in the modern age children grow up watching tv its seen as a normality that children watch tv series from a young agebut even channels that were made for kids ,17

12606," singing or dancing these advertisments often make kids want the toys or worse make them want to be like the people in the advertisment so should television advertising  even be allowed

some people might say yes they should be allowed its the parents responsibilty to protect theire children if they dont wannt theire children to be victims of the modern world its on them to forbid theire children to watch tv thats something every family has to decide on its own but forbidding these adverts wont be the ",14
12607," many children like them because of the catchy music or the fun dancing and they dont take any harm from it its ridiculus to think that a two year old girl would compare herself to the twelve year old in the advert 

on the other ",0
12608," there are many people who would forbid such advertisments its just another way to make children feel bad about themselfs why dont i have long blonde hair like this girl mummy why dont i have these shiny shoes these are just some of the questions parents have to deal with on a daily basis thanks to television advertisments directed  in familys who dont have the money to buy the newest toys or cloths its even harder adverts like these make them have to explain to theire three year old that they cant buy these things because they havent got the spare money so these children are being made aware of theire familys financial problems at a young age is this what you want 

",16
12609, television advertising  should not be allowed because theyre unnessesary and cause more problems than you would expect ,15
12610,the problem with such kind of advertising is that the children getting manuplated very early in this age the child just sees the ,16
12611, of the product the child isnt able to realise that the advertisment just want to sell his product the ,2
12612," of the statement is that we have to protect these children from this manipulation 
but the counter ",12
12613, is that if the parents allow their children to watch tv at this age they cant complain if they getting manipulated their are ,17
12614," diffrent advertisments for older children in the television wich could influence the young children

my personal opinion is that it is very difficult to see the diffrence between an advertisment for older children aged six to ten and the younger children so how can you forbid this advertiment ",13
12615, that this is not possible so it should be the parents who regulate the consum of tv of their own children ,17
12616, that you should put your four year old child in front of a tv because the child anyway wont understand anything  ,8
12617,television advertising is a subject concerning everyones everyday life everyone got ,10
12618, used to it that nobody really thinks anything of it but how does it affect young children ,4
12619," the advertisment adresses them

it of coures can be a good thing to confront children with that subject from an early age on to teach them to have a reasonable understanding of it especially as this is a subject in our everyday life and children are influenced by it 
from the advertisment makers perspective it can be a good thing to adress children ",16
12620, they are their target group it can make sense ,3
12621, to prromote a product in a way that it is attractive for children ,0
12622," in this case their target group 

television advertising s young children might ",0
12623, have a very negative influence on them where children of a specific looking type are chosen and younger children start compare themselves to them it might ,7
12624, be more difficult for them to accept their imperfections and impurities later on ,7
12625," in puperty where boys and girls have a lot of insecruities
also again of a ad makers perspective it does not really make sense to make advertisments s young children eventhough the product might be for them they are ",16
12626, not their target group the parents are because they buy the product ,2
12627," the ad must be attractive to them

all there is left to say is that advertisement towards young children has its pros and cons but i reckon that the negative ones overweigh the positive ones advertisement influences children in a way parents dont really think about and which can damage them in a way that they might dont really like ",16
12628, their appearance anymore later on in their life because they compare themselves to what is shown on tv ,3
12629,in my opinion childrens between the age of two and five arent able to notice exactely what the should do with an advertising i guess they are just thinking how cool this object is ,16
12630, it is a toy or generally something to play with  it could be that they want to have that ,20
12631, despreatly that they cry and shout until the parents buy it for them this is ,9
12632, a big problem for parents which arent abel to buy there childrens expensive toys because they arent earn that much money ,20
12633," that gives the parents a bad feeling because they cant give there childrens what they want
 it ",9
12634, depends on what they want to present with the advertising and ,11
12635, how when they want to present a playgun and shoot at each other ,19
12636, this would havean bad impact on the young viewers that would be a big nogo ,6
12637, advertising could be something usefulbecause parents can notice what there childrens want and what they would make happythis helps ,0
12638," they are upset to make them happy
television advertisings arent always a bad thing as long theyre not silly or bad but ",10
12639," they are they should need to put out from the tv to protect the childrens from bad thoughts  
 
",12
12640,television advertsing  is a very controverse topic in the age between two and five the children are much busier with things like learning to walk to talk playing etc in the following essay ,14
12641," that television advertising  is a bad idea 

first of all why should a child in the age between two and five sit in front of the television and watch this kind of children shows our grandparents didnt even know what a television is ",14
12642, they were 20 years old i mean this kidswould ,19
12643, make the parents and the children lazy they shouldnt learn the i just to do nothing they should go outside with them the kids should see the world breath the fresh air and not sit in front the tv on a super sunny daythe generation of today is even enough lazy why should we teach the upcoming generation ,8
12644," like that 
but the must important ",18
12645, is that the child wouldnt learn the essential stuff like walking or crabling looking tv is like a drug if you starts once its hard to stop again it would ,4
12646," be very disappointing because at this young age the children have a very big potential to learn new things 

in my opinion television advertising   aged children is a extremly stupid idea we should look ",14
12647," our kids and dont let them being lazy the teens are even to much sitting in front of this box and looking to their series we should defend our youngsters of this laziness and connect them more with the nature again lets go outside playing soccer basketball hide and seek or other diffrent funny games but dont stay at home 
 ",1
12648,advertising  on tv is an undiscussed subject in the modern society of europ but ,10
12649, we should look more critical at the very popular goodnightstory for children of course there are many pros on this subject i am sure that most children like to watch tv so children have fun and have something to do thats a quit qood reason for parents because this way they have some freetime and can let the child alone its ,17
12650, good for parents if the child has a blessure ,9
12651," the child can forget his souffers in front of the tv with mickey mouse for an example 

there are ",8
12652, cons on this topic and these cons i dont hear them very often it comes from my originally suspects to all media work i dont believe in any news messenger or social media ,21
12653, tv is an instrument of political influence and most influence you can take on the life of young children and children ,17
12654, lose their interests in other subjects they only play on sub so its logical that i am suspicious on television advertising  all the people but ,3
12655, toward young children its my opinion that television advertising should be forbidden,14
12656,should television advertising  be forbidden this is a very difficult question regarding the ,15
12657, that a lot of parents dont want their children to be manipulated by advertisements but most child directed programms on tv rely on income made through adverts so does the restriction of adverts ,13
12658," mean a decline in good tv programms for children
advertisement  is a highly controversial thing because children can be easily manipulated ",13
12659," they want a certain product and try to persuade their parents into buying it is it okay to use the easily influenced will of a child for such materialistic purpose a lot of people think not certainly a lot of parents who fear their children could become more materialistic themselves by whatching the little films where buying a certain product seems to lead to great fun and the end of all boredom 
but would tv programms ",2
12660, be able to make high quality emissions without the additional income made by product promotion could they even survive probably not ,23
12661," they would rely on state subventions similar to tv programms like srf and it is very questionable if the state would be willing to pay for an additional channel 
i conclude the path between less advertisements and high quality emissions is quite narrow and it wont be possible to forbade all advertising on childrens tv altogether so maybe one should try to put only unproblematic advertisements on child programms if such a thing exists ",14
12662,"advertisinng

nowadays advertisements toward young children are very popular people have different opinions ",16
12663, it comes to watching television very often i ,6
12664,  think that advertisements  kids arent good at all there are two main reasons why ,16
12665, reason why i dont support advertising towards young children is that mostly children at a young age dont really understand the reason why there are ,16
12666," many adverts on television they dont realize that all those advertisements are made from huge companys which want to earn as much money as possible the products we see on television are often not very neccesary companies promise that we would be happier if we had those things which they are trying to sell the problem with this is that young children are more naive than elder people they dont really understand if a product is neccesary or useful actually they just want it becouse it looks nice or because their friends have a similar one
the ",2
12667," reason why i am contra is that andvertisements influence the standart of the people watching them through watching televison advertisements kids get an image of perfection and they are told how life should be if they are influeced by a given image of perfection at such a young age kids get very high standarts and dont know what is normal and natural 
in general im nor against children watching television but because of the useless content of adverts i think that it in not the best thing a child could watch",14
12668," write about the affect of television advertising toward young children at the ages between two and five and if adds for young children should be forbidden
advertices for children arent good because they can manipulate the children very easy they show exactly what every child wants to see and they ",13
12669, show them an irrealistic world the children cant understand it that the world which they see isnt real and ,24
12670, that it wouldnt be that way if they get what the add want them to buy many years ago for exemple there was an advertising for a toy for girls ans it was connectet with arielle in the add you could see two girls who were swimming in a sea and they have seen many colourful fish when i was younger i thougt i would ,2
12671, see this fish if i would have this toy and i asked my parants to buy it but they said no and told me that ,20
12672," i would have it i wouldnt see this fish then i didnt want it anymore
but the children or their parants dont have to buy these things which are shown in the televison the add is just there that people know that the product is there but it doesnt say you have to buy it its your own decision 
in my opinion television advertising for young children shouldnt be allowed because ",2
12673, it isnt very good for children if they always see things on television which they dont have they can become very sad because they think that everybody gets this thing and they are the only children who dont have it i ,17
12674, believe that it can be very stressful for parents ,4
12675, parents with not that much money ,9
12676, their child always want something which it has seen on television and the parents dont want to buy or cant afford it,20
12677,"imagine your in the bahnhofstrasse and you see a little boy who is shouting at his mother that he wants to buy a actionfigur which he saw in televisionadvertise to change this television advertising should not be allowed

first of you have to say that it isnt very terrible for little kids if they watch a television advertisment because they cant do anything or perhaps they dont understand the advertsie ",13
12678," the faut of the parents of the child if the child watches television at this age
but ",17
12679, tabletts computers and televisions get more and more popular that leads to that even children at the age of 25 already have a smartphone or a tablett in other words ,24
12680, the parents cant do anything against its ,9
12681," a problem that little children if they have seen something on tv they want it so they ask their parents to buy and the parents are going to get it or they start to argue with the kid in the end the kid has his toy or its crying because it didnt get the the toy both options arent really options because it isnt fair to influent little kids who cant defend their selfs against these advertises 

in conclusion i totally ",2
12682,television advertising is really common and most tv companies have to use it to gain the income they need to pay their ongoing costs in their everyday programs many tv channels depending on their target audience sometimes or the whole day play series and movies for children often including formats for younger children aged  those children like television very much and they like to watch those channels ,14
12683," those channels have to gain some money often they solve that issue with advertising
the problem is that advertising for children is not the same as advertising for adults most adults are mature enough to make a decision if they want to spend ",14
12684, much money on the product they see in advertising and they can ,11
12685, understand the problems they could experience ,19
12686, having paid too much money on a product they dont really use in general children aged  cant even propperly understand the concept of money so they constantly ask their parents to buy them the new toy from television and because parents love their children they often end up buing something their child uses once or twice and ,20
12687," doesent even care anymore about it of course that is not the fault of the child but the question is if it actually is the fault of the parents who constantly buy new things for their children or if itis the fault of the tv companies who advertise to a target audience which cant make resonable descisions

personally ",17
12688, advertising and children tv channels havenothing to do with one another and should be prohibited a good example would be the german kinderkanal or kika which at least ,14
12689, i watched it didnt play advertising at all they could afford that because their income didnt actually come from advertising but from their mother company which ,10
12690, that this would be the best ,18
12691, for every childrens tv channel because the only other ones i can think of would be to prohibit childrens tv alltogether which doesent really solve the issue like that children would probably just start to watch normal tv which includes the advertising but they couldnt really understand,13
12692,"should television advertising  young people be prohibited

young childrens are watching more and more tv these days and ",13
12693," watch more and more adverts which are made for them but should advertising directed s be allowed or not

of course there are reasons why this shouldnt be allowed at ",15
12694, small childrens always want what they have seen at the tv because they think it is cool but for the parents this is really anoying because the childrens always want them to buy what they want and some of them just stop if they have what they want the problem is that some parents always buy what the childs want and ,2
12695," they never learn that they cant get everything they have seen at the television

on the other ",3
12696, it is not just the job of the state to look for the childrens it is the job of the parents to look for them this ,12
12697, contains that they have to look what their childs could see on tv and that they ,12
12698, do not watch too much tv because if they watch less tv they ,1
12699, see less advertising and there is ,11
12700, on advertsing directed to children they have to learn that they not just allways get everything they want which is an important lesson for the whole life because a child who learned ,0
12701, it was small that it could have everything it has seen at the television advertising might have some problems ,23
12702, it grows up and has to pay the things by itself they often sped too much money and ,9
12703, they have allready mony problems ,3
12704, that advertising directed on young childrens shouldnt be frobidden because it is the job of the parents too look to the childrens so if they dont want that their childs see too much adverts they have to look that their childrens dont watch too much tv and if they dont see too much adverts it is ,13
12705, no problem for the childs ,4
12706,"for the companies who advertise it is beneficial to advertise toward young children because they are more likely to believe to advertisements they will ask their parents if they could get what the advertisement says young children are easy to manipulize with the advertisement and the companies would make a lot of money 
there are some good commericials out there commericials about toys ",0
12707, does not lead to bad habits or something it just makes young children wish that toy or sometimes the advertisement is ,20
12708," it leads them to do sports it could be a commercial about sport shoes and it shows how fun it is to run around outside with this shoes there are many good products for children out there that are actualy good for them 

in the other ",0
12709, the happy meal from mcdonalds leads children to eat junk food which is very bad for them they will think that it tastes good and they ,4
12710, like the toy they get with the meal and they would want to go back it could start to become a habit eating junk food and it is very bad for their health it causes diabetes overweight and a lot more problems children in the age of  ,4
12711, are to young to realize the compony manipulate them they do not know better ,7
12712, when they are getting older they will know that advertisement does not always tell the trough about their product and the will be more careful when they are ,2
12713," young they are helpless and depend on their parents 
sometimes the parents can not afford the childs wishes and the children will be sad ",24
12714," they see the happy children in the advertisement with the product they would like to have and the child can not get it

in my opinion television advertising should only be allowed ",14
12715, it leads the children to do something good for them like running around outside fast und junk food commercials towards young children should not be allowed i ,14
12716, believe that they should set the age higher ,12
12717, five years old they shoud set it to 9 years old because until ,24
12718, believe whatever the tv says,10
12719,"watching tv is something many adults teenagers and children alike enjoy who doesnâ´t love watching their favorite show be it a morning cartoon or the news or a deep political drama there is something for everyone on tv television means uninterrupted entertainment for old and young but does it ads are the only thing to rip the viewer out of their emersion if it wasnâ´t for ads there would be no end to the enjoyment of television just like tv shows ads try to reach a wide range of demographics from ads for a new videogame for teen boys to ads for a new frier pan for mom and high tech gardening equipment for dad even young children arenâ´t safe from the barrage of ads coming their way is it appropriate to let young impressionable children be subjected to unrestricted advertizing are there any repurcussions
many may argue that ads will damage the childs developement because it will hinder their ability to develope critical thinking skills that are much needed in todays society if a child is repeatedly bombarded with ads this could have the long term effect that the child will start believing anything anyone says because the tv has told them something is true over and over again they may develope the habit of believing ads in other ",14
12720," political discours 
secondly ads marketiing directly  seems to be somewhat redundant the idia that kids will ask their parents to buy them something by convincing the child of the product fails to see the parents as the customer ",0
12721, maybe ads should market a safe and educational experience for children ,16
12722, against all this is why change it ads have been running on tv for decades now and nobody seems to be severly harmed or scarred for life if it aint broke dont fi,15
12723," wherter television advertising  is allowed or not doesnt matter
children at this age dont watch that much television or at least they shouldent also they may be easily influenced but ",14
12724, they do watch it they dont have their own money ,3
12725, their parents are the ones to decide what they get and what not of course there are parents whom will give their child everything they want but even ,9
12726," the desicion of an adult
when i was a child i saw a toy in television it was a plush dog which could walk looking back it was really stupid but for a child ",20
12727, it looked like it was almost like having a real dog so i beged my parents to get me one but as an adult they knew it was stupid and that i would only play with it a week at most ,20
12728," they didnt get me one
all in all ",18
12729,"  adults its just a diffrent kind of advertising its trough their own children this may have an effect on how many toys or whatever it is they sell they sell but it has no effect on the children they will forget about it soon enough
of course you could say they grow up to a world where you can buy everything you want and as much as you want but ",2
12730, it werent allowed there is ,19
12731, a lot of other advertising if it is s them or not doesnt matter here in my opinion they simply shouldent watch that much television ,11
12732, we wouldnt have to worry about it this much ,19
12733,we live in a world where technology and commercial is totally common and normal ,23
12734, it is really important for children to already learn as a young child how to think about television advertising we see and hear commercials all the time ,14
12735," in radio televison or in newspapers parents should bring up their children in our world we live now and commercial is a part of it 
children should ",14
12736, learn to say no to something and should learn to be critical against foreign things they have to learn that they cant buy everything and that not everything that seems nice is really nice when the parents give them everything they want they will really have big problems ,24
12737, they get older because they will never be able to afford everyting but ,24
12738," they already have to ask themselves in young age if it is really necessary to buy something later they wont have any problems 
i know that it isnt healthy at all ",4
12739, young children watch television the whole day if they do other things ,17
12740," sports they dont even see these commercials that often maybe thats why people who often watch tv often get manipulated by advertising but for young children it wouldnt even be a big problem if they dont watch tv all day 
when the children get older the commercials try to manipulate them anyways so why should it be a problem to already see those commercials ",14
12741, they are younger the sooner you get accostumed to something the sonner you learn how to deal with it and thats why ,24
12742, there is a lot of advertising everywhere the television advertising is just another kind its normal for us to have it everywhere and with the television you have it even at home it can influence our decisions a lot specially young children when they see at television the newest barbie or a game for the computer they want to have it but should it really be not allowed in some kind it is a problem but it is ,15
12743, a decision of the parents when the children are not allowed to watch a lot of tv ,17
12744, it is not an as big problem as ,19
12745, they watch the whole day when i look at my childhood it was never a problem because we didnt have a television at home it was a bigger problem to go with us in a shop and we saw some chocolat which we really wanted so ,17
12746," the tv which influence the decisions of a lot children its just everywhere we go there are a lot things they want to have and the parents have just to say no
television advertising comes everytime ",14
12747, a television show so its a kind of boring and ,6
12748, the fifth time they wont give as much attention as on the ,19
12749, time they saw it may be we see just a problem in it where it isnt one so ,19
12750, it is not the problem of the television it is more how they have grown up and what they were allowed to do if they arent allowed to have new things they wont make any problems television advertising  is not perfect but the advertising is just a part of watching television it doesnt matter if it is directed to children or to adults it is important what we do with this informations,14
12751,"in our society advertisment is a big part of our everyday live but should it affect really young children
this is a hard question in this essay i try tho find ",16
12752," for and against this statement
one ",21
12753, against televison advertisments towards young children is the ,13
12754, that those children can not even buy the things that are advertised they can only annoy their parents to the ,2
12755, that the buy them a new doll or the sweets so the parents are the onces which actually suffer from the advertisments another agument is that those children have not ,2
12756," learned how to respond to advertisments in a healthy way they dont even know that they affect them the children dont know that the things shown in the advertisments dont show the reality 
but there are ",0
12757, for advertisments s children aswell one important ,0
12758, is that the children have to learn a healthy way of responding to advertisments sooner or later especially ,16
12759, nowadays they are very present in our lives it can be helpful for the children to get used to the advertisments by seeing them on the tv but ,14
12760, the parents talk about the advertisments with their children another ,0
12761, that advertisment is a very important thing for our economie companies couldntsurvive without advertising their products it can be seen as unfair that a company producing furniture is allowed to do advertisments ,11
12762," another company is not allowed to because they produce toys
my conclusion is that this is a very controversial question and it is hard to answer it my personal opinion is that it shouldnt be allowed to do television advertisments toward young children ",13
12763, that they are not ready to proceed the thing the see and that the companies use use small children to make a great deal out of it,3
12764,advertisement in tv which is directed  is theme which is critisised by many peoplein my opinion it shouldnt be allowed to show advertisement because the children are more affected of advertisement ,14
12765," adults if adults watch advertisement they mostly know that these companies just want to make profit and that the products shown are mostly not as good as they were presented but if a child watches advertisement it just sees how cool a toy or something else is and not the background especially because the toys are shown in a toyworld and not in a realistic way

another ",0
12766, is that a child aged  could never afford a toy by themselve but why do companies ,20
12767, advertise things to children of course because children can more easily confince there parents to buy a toy for them ,20
12768, the companies could convince the parents to buy a toy for theire children children are stubborn and they know much better how to get something of theire parents this is the ,20
12769, that the companies are profiting more with advertisement to children ,2
12770," with advertisement to adults and this shouldnt be allowed because children cant think as far and this shouldnt be abused

summarizing ",12
12771, that advertisement which is direted to children is kind of an unfaire way to advertise things beause the companies are using the power of stubborness and joy of children to make profit,16
12772,"kids are no consumers

if we watch television today its full with advertising for the newest volumenshampoo the most comfortable car the best accurancy yes advertising is every where in our time now but in television it has the greatest influence because you see it again and again adult people can better decide between the bullshit and useful things in advertising but how does it look by young children they believe what they see they think that they all need to have from the advertising imagine an advertising for the new barbiecastle the little girl watch it and thinks wooow i need this she wants that her parents buy it for her  the parents say now and she gets very angry and sad but i have to say there are other parents who want a happy child  and ",14
12773, they buy it the problem is now that the child think it gets everything it shouldnt be like that in childhood the human brain learns very fast kids explore the world they live in but if we imagine that a lot of these young children spend their time with watching advertising learning the advertisnig spells by hearth and thinking always to it its shocking kids should go out and play with other children these are reasons why im really against directed television advertising for young children,2
12774,"advertisings have become a big part of todays television programms there are different advertisings and many of them are  children now the question came up if television advertisings that are  children should not be allowed

on the one ",14
12775, the advertisings are really manipulative they are made in a way that they reach the childrens attetion and that is what they want as son as a child has seen it it wants to have it and in many cases the parents buy it for them so the important thing about it is that they already start with the maipulation at young age ,0
12776, they are bigger furthermore children dont know anything about economy and ,24
12777, they can not know if it is something good or not they just see something and ,3
12778," they want it that is the reason why it makes no sense to advertise for such young people because the parents of them are responsible for them

on the other ",9
12779, should have a look at the people that are advertising for their products they just make their job and they want to make as much money as possible like everyone else does if they do good work they have more clients and earn more money ,11
12780, of view they are successful and they see no ,3
12781, in not allowing advertising that are directed additionally we ,11
12782, have to mention that children at this age should not watch that much television  ,17
12783, they would not even have the opportunity to be confronted to that advertisings it is the parents duty to control whaht their children watch and how long so it is in their ,14
12784," if their child gets to see those advertisments or not 

on balance ",16
12785, that this is a topic that should be discussed  more beacuse nowadays we are living in a world full of advertisings and manipulation from my ,11
12786, of view advertisings that are directed to children should be allowed  the main reason why i am cleary against not allowing it is that it is in every parents ,16
12787, to decide wether they want to let advertising convince their children or not and if they are not intelligent enough it is their own fault and not the mistake of the one that is advertising,2
12788,"well this is a very important question my opininion is that it depends what the content of the advertising is toy advertising is very harmless and somehow they have to sell there toys it is normal that a kid should have toys but we have to watch out wich toys ipads or iphones arent toys when you give a kid an electronic device he or she cant handle it so you should watch out witch toys you should buy 

but things like food or drinks can the kid let think that he can gain superpower as a example so they spred lies in the advertisements and ",16
12789," the kids want to buy this things but they dont gain any superpowers they just become fat 

but ",20
12790, the main problems are the parents if parents control their kids than the problem is solved a lot of parents just want have some quiet freetime and ,12
12791, the kids must be quieted and ,24
12792," the parents give their kids some money and the kid heads directly to the grocery store and buys some unhealthy stuff like chocolate 

i should now this i did stuff stuff like this but my parens didnt gave me money so i stoled it and this was one of the causes that i became fat but the bad parents combined with the advertisement are dangerous for the healthy environement of our future espessially in the united states is it a problem a big percentage of the american people are fat and this is mainly the fault of the food advirtisement 

but today there are luckily some limits and we can say that the world made some progress when you watch commercial of the 90s than you can see that the sugar cornflakes are on the same level as fruits the people thought that evryithing was healthy wath the television said but today it istnt anymore ",2
12793,should advertisements targeted at young children be allowed on tv it is certainly true that young children are very easily influenced by advertissements that could very well be a evolutionary thing because children are genetically programmed to learn by watching their parents a child ,14
12794, cant really know that what they see in an advertisments is not what it is in reality but children are influenced by other factores too ,2
12795, the packaging of the product or what their friends and the cool kids have so if you tend to forbid tv advertissements you would have to do something about the other factors too and that is simply impossible during childhood it is very important to have cool things ,2
12796, toys to be socially accepted if the parents of a child deny him toys it might not be accepted in a group anymore and the other kids dont want to play with himher anymore it can even go ,20
12797, bullying but would it help to forbid tv advertissements personally ,13
12798, even tho advertissements can have a big influence on young children there isnt really a problem with them the problem lies more in the social behaviour of kids the worst thing that can happen if a child sees an adertissement about a toy is that it will annoy its parents to get said toy because it obviously cant buy the toy itself if they say no it will just be sad for a moment and ,16
12799, see another toy that it likes in the end it is more a question of parents being annoyed about their children begging them for toys all the time not about any dangers that the child might face the conclousion is that it isnt a problem of the advertissements but of the parents letting their kid watch tv all day because they dont know what to do with them ,2
12800,for many parents it is hard to refuse to buy toys and other things for their young children if they continuosly ask for it companies are aware of tthis ,2
12801, use advertising that is  hoping they will force their parents to buy the advertised subject by asking for it over and over again until the parents ,2
12802," they cant stand seeing their beloved child being unhappy

to prevent this from happening the idea of prohibiting television advertising that is  this seems to make sense ",12
12803, that kind of advertising basically exploits the parents love for their children exploiting love for commercial sucess is clearly moraly wrong also young children have not ,16
12804," developed any critical thinking and dont realize they are being manipulated

on the other ",3
12805, you could say that it is the parents decision to buy the advertised subject or not if they dont want to buy their children everything they see in television advetising the parents will just have to say no to their children they have to keep that position no matter how much the child begs for it in other words they have to teach their children that they cant have whatever they want whenever they want it thats something they must learn anyway once they learn that television advertising will  will no longer work and ,13
12806," young children shouldnt spend their time in front of a television anyway they should go outsied play and get to experience the world

in the end ",17
12807, television advertising  should be prohibited it might not be easy for parents to say no to their children but theyll have to anyway ,13
12808, why not start with television advertising that is  their young children,0
12809,in the todays world it is a normal thing that a young child in the age of  is watching tv with the permission of the parents they ,17
12810," have to watch some advertisement during the breaks of the cartoon there are some television adversitising s young children some little children are playing with the new toy dog that can talk and act like a real dog or the girls are laughing and giggeling with the brandnew barbie but does the television advertising affect the children
and now the question is should the television advertising s young children be allowed

the ",14
12811, of showing the television advertising  is that they will see how many different toys are there with them they can play not only smartphones or tablets when the young humans like them ,0
12812," they will buy some new toys so they probably will spend more time playing toys than watching tv this would be good for the fantasy insteed of staring at the electronic thing

on the other ",1
12813, firstly the advertisement influents the opinion of the children they will annoy their parents to buy the toys and the parents dont have another choice and will buy them there arent only good toys that the children can use in the advertisement they ,0
12814, can show some violence or sexual scenes and thats not the right thing for the young children who are in the stage in which they find everything curious the parents trust the channel that the children are watching at but ,6
12815," would show to the little kids some brainwashing advertisements the parents wont be glad about it

to sum up there are some ",16
12816, of showing the television advertising  kids in my opinion ,14
12817, its not a great idea to influent the mind of the children they should decide by themself in my ,12
12818, of view the director shouldnt produce television advertising for young children,13
12819,nowadays television advertisements increase rapidly many channels often make advert breaks ,10
12820," a short time of a movie or a show channels for children mainly advert toys or some free time activities like adventure parks but does it make sense to show children in this young age these advertisements
children are very easy influenced by tvspots mainly children between two and five years old when they see a cool new toy they want it immediately and ask their parents to buy it sometimes this desire gets ",14
12821, strong that the parents are forced to get it this ads dont just influence the wishes of the children ,2
12822," the decisions of the parents what theyre buying on a psychological basis
the kids are affected in a very early time by advertisingstrategies they grow up with pictures of a perfect world and stereotypical things those adverts can support stereotypes of gender roles ",2
12823," there are girls showed with pink dresses and dulls in their hands having fun 
on the other ",18
12824," would those toys be bought if there werent any tvspots television advertisement is a good platform for companies to show off their new products
in my view television advertising shouldnt be forbidden for children in this age its a thing of the parents if they allow their children to watch tv or some channels which show many ads ",14
12825,"to start with an agreeing statement you can say that television advertising should not be allowed because it will maybe affect the young children in ways you do not want the child to be affected 
a ",13
12826, which disagrees with this statement is that the parents should look ,12
12827, they have to decide if they are allowed to watch it ,19
12828," it should be allowed to advertise towards young children 
a supporting ",16
12829, is that advertising  should not be allowed because kids can not think clearly and ,16
12830," that it should be clear that this is not appropriate 
to react to the statement ",21
12831," you can say that advertising should be allowed if it does not make any harm to the young children 
a last ",13
12832, to support this statement is that advertising toward young children is unnecessary because they will not buy something but the parents will ,13
12833," they have to advertise  parents 
my opinion about this is following i do not like advertisments at all so i can easily say it should not be allowed ",16
12834,"television advertising firected toward young children

do you remember ",14
12835," you was a little child and you where outside and you played with your friends and now the kids have their ipads their iphone and mybe thier own televiosion but is that good for the kids  would it be better to let them outside or let them playing with barbies and legos

when kids in young age go outside into the woods or somewhere where it has not a good floor it trains the musculature of the leg and the balance of thechild so they learn something for the rest of their life maybe they want to climb a mountain if there where older and whit their balance they trained ",8
12836, they where young their are better ,19
12837," their where young 

the little kids have to do their adventures and ",24
12838," they went outide and play in the woods maye they find their adventurebut if they only sit inside and do not really something they never see  the world  

an other ",1
12839," is if the young kids go outside and play with other kids they leran how to speak with other kids so they learn socoaligy that is something you need the whole life for exempel in your job if you have a problem you can tell your chef other someone else maybe your friends

the  to go to bed time  is not the favorite time of the children because the want be like their old brother he does not go to sleep now but mum does not give the kids more time maybe the kid where outside and it is now really tired but it can be that the kid watched the whole evening television and now it has a lot of energy the mum will need much of time till the kid goes to bed 

in television is a documentair story about horses and the child loves horses ",8
12840," why don not let him watch maybe they will learn something 

finally ",19
12841, the kids should go outside and play with other kids so they can built balance and socilitybut maybe it rains and good film is in thetelevision maybethey can learn something for the rest of their live thekids should go outside but theyshould ,1
12842,nowadays the question if television advertising which are  should be allowed is well discussed in public but where are the ,15
12843," it would be a success for toy shops because children would see their toy of their dreams and aske their parents to buy it for them
secondly if a couple have thei ",20
12844, child and dont know what they have to posses this advertisement could be helpful for them to make their child growing up well it ,0
12845, would be able to find something new to try ,18
12846, light balls for falling asleep ,18
12847," a night lamp

on the other ",18
12848, this influence of advertising would bring up new mobbing victims because you would be an outsider if you wouldnt posses this stuff that the others do additionally stores which havent the money for such big advertisement have to be closed because people would stop buying things thei didnt have seen ,11
12849," furthermore other television series or programms would earn less money because there would be a longer section of advertisement

in my opinion it should be prohibited ",15
12850, because children shouldt be influenced by things from televisionno they should be able to make their own descisions free willed ,17
12851, young boys and gils shouldnt watch television in their yung years they have to enjoy the environment and playgrounds and go out with kindergarden friends or spend time with their family,17
12852,"advertisements are meant to sell something by presenting the product to viewers making purchases are only accessable to people mostly adults capable of making transactions 
children of the age of five arent able to fulfill a purchase and dont understand concepts of money and the market so it is very useless to direct advertisments to children that age because they cant understand 
but most advertisements are trying to convince childern that age because they dont understand and take ",16
12853, of their lack of knowledge the people who make advertisements know that children watch tv and ,14
12854, they happen to watch an advertisement the childern go to their parents becuase they know their parents have the power to buy things its a stategy that avoids directing advertisements to adults because adults ignore them and taking ,2
12855," of their children to convince their parents of purchasing it isnt right to use childern as their marketing machine because theyre incapable of knowing the purpose behind tv ads but its a better way to sell the product because parents wont ignore their childrens needs and buy thigs for them this stategy isnt unfair at all because the child watches tv and its the responsibility of the parents to let children watch parents who really dont want them to watch ads shouldnt let their children watch tv or at least the ads

",16
12856, its just lazy and unfair to think that children can do all the work for the salesmen in my opinion its useless for children to watch advertisements without understanding and the advertising producers should do it fair and challenge themselves to make a good ad for adults ,16
12857,the televison is only one of many different medias we can use use today there are a couple of differernt channels wich have different topics there are some channels wich are more informativ like newschannels or channels wich send documantarys but there are ,10
12858, some channels wich less informativ topics but the thing wich connects the most of alle the different channels is that most of them send advertising espaecially on the channels wich send cartoons or other topics wich are interesting for children there is advertising sent wich is ,6
12859, interesting for childrens thats reality because children are easier to catch for sweets toys and things like that the reason for it is that children cant control their wants as good as adults and ,2
12860," theyre good targets for the industry wich will sell their products
if you hear that the ",23
12861, time it sounds a little weird in your ears but befor you get angry on the people wich had the idea to do that you should think over some ,18
12862, wich show you the good ,18
12863," about advertising to children
the frist ",16
12864," wich speaks real for advertising toward children is that if children are catched from the advertisings on the television the chance raises that the product gets buyed and that is a really good thing because you help the people working in all the toy and sweetstores wich really need the money for their own children
the ",0
12865, reason why advertising toward children should be allowed is that more purchases are very good for the capitalizm and we all know that this is very good for our circumstantials and ,16
12866," we all should support the advertising
to coclude we just can say that advertising toward ch8",11
12867,television advertisisng are always worth a discussion much more if its about young children but ,13
12868," parents should decide wether they like to try out the advertising productbe a

firstlywhat is the perfect age to start to advertise and ",0
12869," which is the perfect age to start watching televisionwe all should be able to take resnsibility toward ourkids and its enviromentmoreand more trynot to face responsibility the htey get

12870, they would decidetherere always other dangers or possibilities of ,19
12871," seeing advertisment towards young preople genually its worth a shot because if  you others into it which could have a bad influence on the kids you dont have ads for little kidsj

on the other ",16
12872," could it be a good idea just to prevent their young eyes wont be manipulated
in the end our world is gettinh worse and worse everyday we live by",12
12873,the biggest income of televison companies comes thrue advertising in these days the advertising is immense there are no borders from baby food to expensive sport cars you find everything but shouldnt it have some limits especially young kids often are influenced by the advertisemts in the following essay ,14
12874," analyse this question and tell you my opinion
its obvious that these kinds of advertising in televison often puts a lot on the parents because kids want things ",14
12875," they see it and often theyre impatient let me ilustrate this with an example a young guy he is 5 years old sees a toy truckin televison the guy really likes it and want it immeadittly because he is impatient because of this the child asks his parents if they can buy it for him and if they dont do that hell rest asking so this shows that these advertisements can pressure the parents they can be a pain in the neck
on the other ",2
12876," we have to understand that the goverment shouldt make even more laws and limit our liberate system in switzerand there is a free economical system which shouldnt be interrupted rhrue laws which arent really essential
furthermore ",21
12877," there are advertisements which can disturb young child and arent good for their mental development and health they sometimes shock them 
i come to the conclussion that the advertisement in televison directed  shouldnt be limitated because we live in a free land and every company should have there right to advertise their products and it shouldnt matter if its s younger childrens or seniors",14
12878,a child aged  usually watches a spesific type of television prgramm or maybe only carefully by the parents selected series there are ,6
12879," special shows only for children 
in my opinion on these shows and programms there shouldnt be any advertisement regarding things to buy ",14
12880, they are meant for children like for exemple a new barbie doll or the new iron man suit for haloween this supports already young aged children to wanting to habe everything ,20
12881, the things they see in this cool television ,6
12882, a child should learn as soon as possible that one can not have everything and like this should apreciate the things one already has even more what doesnt lead to anything like this is for exemple an advertisement for new series or films that would be shown later on ect so ,0
12883," these are perfectly fine for the breakes between two films 
in the end ",18
12884, the biggest part of responsability rests whith the parents they have to be aware what exactly their child is watching and if its really okay for their age the advertisements included even ,14
12885," the producers have to match their advertisement according to the ages meant for the series for example it wouldnt make sense to show toothpaste advertisement on kika a programm for children 
so ",16
12886, showing real advertisement to children is not very helpfull and could lead to them wanting to buy everything therefor it should not or only rarely been allowed but ,16
12887, and what the children are watchins is ,6
12888, the job of the parents,9
12889,"
a lot of people are against television advertising  but why are they against it which effect has television advertising on young children  is it absolutely negatif or positive or maybe its something in between today we gonna have a look on the ",14
12890,"

of course is advertising  a great chance for the economy to grow companies which are using this type of advertising know how good it works to influence the young children first of all you need to convince the young children and afterwards every child will do everything to convince their parents to buy it for them the own children are often way better in influencing the parents to get what they want than any advertising could ever try you can see for the companies this concept has a huge positive effect and ",0
12891," is that this concept is good for the economy and if it isnt allowed to use this type of advertising it will have a bad affect for everyone

but there are ",11
12892, people who think that television advertising  shouldnt be allowed they say that the advertising teach their children that they cant be satisfied with what they have in general advertising try to convince people that they need more than they have young children are ,13
12893," easy to influence and they cant decide if they really need this or not 

in my opinion its true that advertising will teach them that they cant be satisfied with what they have and i that is the reason why it shouldnt be allowed

",15
12894,"in the past years tv advertising has become more and more specific the companies gained a feeling of how to get us to by and use their products and most of the times the statemetns in the commercials arent completely true the companies are moving a little bit sneaky because sometimes they write critical informations extremly tiny at the bottom of the screen and its easy to get fooled so should there be a policy that blocks them form directing der advertisement toward young children 

children at the age of five arnt able to buy things without the promission of their parents ",13
12895," if they get affected by a advetisement their parents are the ones that decide what happens so it doesnt matter if there are ads of kids 
on the other ",16
12896, a lot of children learn to control there parents so if they dont get a toy they start to get angry or cry now it is up to the parent if they ,20
12897," by the toy or solve the problem in an other way

all companies now that children are out of money ",20
12898," they are sure that the kids convince their parents to buy stuff an there is a developement happening many children dont use their imagination that often thy only use toys premade for them i used to make my own toys with my brothers and sisters 
if you take a ",20
12899, look you notice that companies are crual and want children to manipulate their parents and in a way they start to make the children depend on them because ,9
12900," the kids are growns ups they learned to always buy new stuff and they will maybe keep that behaviour for a long period of time 

in my opinion its a good idea to make a policy against ads for kids ",16
12901, that companies will only loose a small amount of costumers because the adults buy all the products and not the children but that policy isnt that important because its the parents job to look ,2
12902,today the most of the families in switzerland have an television at home and there are many children which like very much to watch tv but like ,17
12903," that everyone of us knows is there in every programm a lot of advertising between so its important that we think about if this is good for little children or if its bad for joung children and sholdnt be allowed

actually there are many sorts of advertising which are about things like errotic stuff or pages for meeting someone in the internet which children should learn from their parents or someone else but ",16
12904, not from the television things like this they can ,19
12905," mot understand in a age under six years

on the other ",8
12906,there is many funny advertising which children like to watch and the children are our ,0
12907, consuments also are there a lot of errotiacal scenes or scenes of violence in the normal programm like films or series so shouldnt we ,6
12908," think about young children should watch tv generall

in think that the parents of young children should think about which programmes and how longand often in a week they want their children to watch tv because there are a lot of programms which are extra made for little children and in these series there isnt advertising witch ",17
12909, errotic stuff in it but ,18
12910, children under six years dont have to watch tv theyshould ,17
12911, play with their parents or with other kids outdoors   ,1
12912,the discussion about advertising  is very difficult the following essay will show and collect some controverse ,11
12913," and will try to figure out which one is better
first of all its important to save young children from bad influences like violent videogames or stuff like this advertising for young children counts to those bad influences in the end those advertisings and tvspots manipulate young children they arent ready to decide whats bad and whats okay
the ",13
12914," reason why those tvadvertisings shouldnt be allowed anymore is that children shouldnt watch that much tv they should play outside and search friend and television shouldnt destroy this possibility by using advertising towards children
there are ",14
12915," against this statement
first there is the ",21
12916, learn to save their children and they have to learn how they should teach the children how they have to behave and what is good and what is not advertising in the tv is perfect ,14
12917," its an easy way to learn separating beween good and bad
furthermore children cant understand much of those tvspots ",6
12918, they wouldnt have any grave psycholocical problems it is much worse for the children if they get saved from everything ,7
12919," the wont learn the important things and it is ways easier to learn stuff at the age of two or five

after this ",24
12920, its clear that it would be wrong if we forbid advertising in tv i saw that children could learn very much with those tvspots in an very easy and riskfree way they can learn to seperate good stuff from bad stuff it is clear that the parents should show the a good balance between tv an real live ,13
12921," those advertisings wouldnt be harmful if the parents hold this balance and allow the children to learn but show them the right way
",16
12922,my parents had not allowed me to look any televion advertisings ,10
12923," i was a child but not every parents have the same oppinion in the questen if they should allowed there children television advertising the questen is now if television advertising direct toward young children should be allowed

if these advertisings are not allowed parents not think that it is good for children and they mayby not allowed there children to look any advertisings
 but some parent dont want to do something with their children and ",13
12924, they let look them television advertisings for children if it has nothing for children they let them maybe look some thing for older children or adults ,16
12925," worse

in my oppinion children should not look any televion but i ",17
12926, think that making a low against it is the wrong way ,18
12927, parents should be careful what they allowed to their children and what not but parents must have the chois in these questions,12
12928,today everyone is online ofcoarse young children too certainly the will ,12
12929," be exposed to the television and their advertising but is this healthy or not would the be strongly biased
young children learn everything very fast ",17
12930, children aged  tend to learn fast from their surroundings primarily their parents but tv and media are more and more taking place as a learning and free time platform due to this exposure they will see more advertising and ,17
12931, be influenced by that but is that really a bad thing well ofcoarse on the one han they will be biased might want to by a new cereal a new toy or try the new videogame so ,3
12932, there is an influence but parents must teach their young offspring how to deal with it since the real grownup world is stuffed more with advertising in everyday life ,14
12933, coke is with sugar so it should be viewed as part of growing up and learing to live in the overpolluted world and anyhow if one was to eliminate advertising on tv one would have to eliminate posteradvertising too because parents can stop their children from watching tv but can children be stopped from going outside most certainly not now the question is with very young children but if they are ,14
12934, young can they really understand what is happening ,24
12935, they are being manipulated by advertisment if not ,11
12936," parents can fully control how much their chldren see it if the can they are old enough to learn how to deal with it
so should there be a ban no growing up means learing to deal with the free world and advertisment is part of the world which in the west is liberal ",13
12937, free for the tv to do what it wants,10
12938," discuss about the television advertising 
nowaday we humans cant imagine our society without any electronic devices computer iphones and ",10
12939," television became a very central subject in our world it is not easy to decide wether this huge technological succes is good or bad for this world 
the majority of western worldpopulation owns elevision iphones computers and a lot of other electronic devices lets focus on the televison
on the one ",10
12940, a television can be a practical device watching television you have the possibility to  be always informed about the accurate happenings and events around the world secondly having a television at your home can be very entertaining the tv programm has a lot to offer for example series and movies in all genres and sometimes ,17
12941," in diffrent languages
on the other ",18
12942, being a owner of a television has ,10
12943, firstly watching television often robbs your time away if you have to get some really important things done like homework or studies you waste your time with watching tv ,17
12944," focusing on the essential things in life
this is ",18
12945, the case with a lot of other things as relationships or creating your own lifestyle not only does television waste television your vulnerable time it ,17
12946, has the ability to brainwash humans mind especially for the younger generation when children in young age watch ,7
12947," all this advertements they grow up wanting them so they are being practicly thaugt to live in a capitalistic world which has the consequnce that their values will be about buying things and getting more and more things
 so ",2
12948, television may have a few positve ,10
12949," that it is time wasting and leads to brain wash 

",21
12950,advertising is everywhere even we dont want to admid it but everyone is malipulated by it we ,11
12951, buy something we already heared of than something that is completly new while adults ,20
12952, know that its not believable whats shown in the advertisments children aged  ,16
12953," cant make a difference between a friend who likes his new teddybear or a money orientated comertial shouldnt we protect children that young from those manipulative television advertising

the ads arent only watched by the children a parent who is in search of a new birthday gift for the child is surley thankful if there is something seen in television the child may like or the child even sees the product it likes in the television and asks for it that happens in magazenes too we cant illegalize to get the product for children not to be brought to the people by advertisment children might even get less funstuff if the parents dont know what to buy for them
can children really make a difference between something they will have fun with and something the will throw in the thrash ",14
12954," are the ones who buy they often cant resist in the hope of making their child happy if it wants something it gets it
that isnt nessesarely bad even if the children wont have a lot of fun with it it is ",20
12955," good for the economy to sell something
when a child sees a little modelcar in the television thinks it is ",20
12956, awesome as showen in the advertisment gets it ,11
12957, asking and asking from its parent but ,8
12958," its actually not half as good as beleaved is that really good wouldnt that make a child very sad
that is a experience that the children may should have in early age the experience that nothing is as good as showen in the ads later they will be bomed with advertisment anyway better learning early

if they cant learn that whats good in the ads isnt always good in reallife by themselfes there are ",2
12959," the parents who should show their child what is good for it and what not there is no good reason to not allow television advertising  it is something we have to learn to be with
",13
12960," be talking about the statement that children under five years old shouldnt be allowed to be targeted in tv ads

the big companies make way to much money selling all there toys and garbage to little children especially in places like the us and other ",13
12961," world countries it is a big driving force of the economy these companies rely on rich famalies with extremely bratty children to make money by targeting these children in terrebly obnoxious commercials theyre securing their customers because parents of bratty little children have no choice but to buy whatever toy or product their child just saw on tv or their in for a huge brain exploding tantrum 
the toy branch has become a large player in the economy in recent years the ceos and chairmen of these big companies may be selfish and stingy who take way to much profit money for themselves but ",20
12962," they create new jobs with the expansion of their buisinesses
on the other ",23
12963," to the economical questions to this statement are the moral questions
is it ok to brainwash the joungest part of the population of a whole society with annoying tv ads
of course if one sais it like that the answer is no who thinks its ok to brainwash their child
but these commercials can limit a kids perspective on things with these ads a little kid is bound to grow up in a very capitalistic surrounding without any other ",14
12964," of view 

that being said it isnt moraly justified to manipulate little children in such a way that may verywell have a big influence on their later life
",12
12965,in young age people are more likely to believe what is told so companies can take this ,2
12966, to make young children buy their product should ,2
12967," advertisment  be forbitten 
the idea of the statement is that young children should not be influenced by television advertsiment ",13
12968," they can build their own opinion on certain thoughts but how should this law work television companies do not know how old the consumer is who is watching the advertisment at the moment and what if the parents of the young child are whatching the marketing trick too to fullfill this law is impossible because there are to many greyzones
in my opinion this statement has some good affects as like the manipulation via television advertisment of young children would not take place but children are manipulated by their parents anyway furthermore could the parents just control this by not letting the children watch television which is ",13
12969," thebest way to solve this because children with age  should not be watching television
conclusing ",17
12970, with this statement because it provocates more problems than ,21
12971," the mentoinned problem is fullyin the hands of the parents because a two year old is not able to say wether he wants to see this advertisment or not
",16
12972,"it is believed by some people that television advertising  aged under five should not be allowed since there is the possibility of manipulation of young children parents fear the risk of letting their children watch television 
a young child watching television will probably not be able to understand anything it is watching since it is only two and not over five it is very hard for a child to get what is happening it ",14
12973, does not understand if a clip it sees on television is an ad or just a movie so ,10
12974," it is not able to understand what is really going on on television why would there be a law to prohibit television advertising toward young children aged  
even tough it is already able to talk and most of the time understands what you are telling them there comes the risk of manipulation a child aged  is way too young to be confronted with such a topic like i already said it is too young to understand that it is manipulated but ",14
12975," it understands what you are talking about in a conversation it is able to make a connection in their head and realise that it likes what it sees so with an easy ad a child can be manipulated into the consuming world very fast which is way too early 
what children watch on television could ",0
12976, be read in a book by their parents so why even show them television in such a young age it could be possible that their brains could not evaluate as good as a child who grew up without a television did because by watching television they do not learn the ability of thinking by themselves but let others think for them children should be able to play outside and really enjoy their childhood without being confronted with any other problems ,17
12977," manipulations and stuff like this
i believe that children from aged  should not be confronted with television advertising because they do not learn the ability of thinkinng by themselves or are manipulated way too early  ",14
12978,televison advertising is definitely one of the most frequent forms of advertising because it reaches us in an easy way it catches even more the attention from children than from adults as adults are already informed about the function of advertisement ,10
12979, a more critical view on it children ,7
12980, might take it more seriously and get easily manipulated by it mostly if it is a product made for children as a result they ask their parents to buy them products which have been in the advertisement this ,2
12981, is a problem for the parents as advertisements may hang all over the place ,16
12982," are they found in television 
on one ",10
12983, of view we could say that aready watching to much television does harm to our children advertisment is ,14
12984, the bad component of it but ,4

12986, what can we do about it if parents dont allow their child to watch television but the others do ,17

in conclusion i would suggest that there is actually no way out of our consumer orientated world we can not even protect our children because nowadays every child has an electronical device or is confronted with it at a very young age in computer games there are advertisements too and ",13

12993, show those advertisments on television ,11
12994, many adults sitting in front ot the televison maybe they want to attract the parents to buy the things the want to sell or they hope that there are children watching television and they want the things they see because the adverts are made ,10
12995, it is a bad idea to show these adverts on television because children at that age should be doing better things ,16
12996, watching television and if they are watching television there are special channels for children where they can show films and series for children but not adverts children should be raised to know how to spend money properly and not just buying everything they see and want but this is the ,14

12999," they just make funny and cute videos to attract children in our world it might be one of the last chances to sell things that arent connected with mobiles or computers children stay more and more in front of screensand dont play with real toys and figures any more and the the mobiles are much easier handle for parents because they only have to buy one and than they can download everythingthey want and at the end it will be much cheaper for them because of the mobile games the toy producers had to find a way to sell more
in ",20
13000," it would be better to show them other things insted of adverts because like that they dont make them want something and maybe they can safe more money for the parents but in the more and more digital world i wont get easier to avoid adverts madefor children because it they stop them on television they will just show them on the internet or as hidden adverts in games created for children

13007, parents are working so its totaly impossible to get full control of what your kids watching at the telvision which is ,17

so i try to start with the opinions against direct television advertising towards young children you could argue that its really bad to use young children only to make profit and it shouldnt affect these childrens in every form so if the advertisment is a bad influence for the kids it should be forbidden but in which cases its bad and which its not ",14

13024, not sure what to think about it i believe that the advertisments for small children are necessary because its the main source of money but ,16

13050,advertisement targeting childres has been a controvercial method to boost profits and is now widely discussed in many communities ,16
13051, a nordic state banned them inorder to keep the children out of the market as customers in this following text ,12
13052, for and against this statement inorder to aquire a better level of understanding of this problem in the end ,21
13053," state my own opinion on this topic

first children are the the targetgroup of whole industries especially the toy industry ",2
13054," the industry for electronic devices or sportsarticels relies heavilly on their underaged customers if advertising directed towars children was not possible anymore those industries would have very big profit cuts eventually resulting in many peolple who have to leave their job therefore the children are a too heavilly relied on targetgroup to just give them up

but children are not able ",16
13055, to determine wheather they really need something or they just want it also the question arises if the advertised toy or device is good for their developement better commercial does not automatically mean better toy since the advertisingindustry uses cheap psychological tricks in their commercials inorder to get the children to wanting their products not the children but the parents should be targeted in the commercials it is ,0
13056," their money plus their decition how to raise their children

on the other ",9
13057, children cannot be protected from the influence of commercials if they never hade to resist the urge to buy something only because they had seen it on television they are not going to be able to hold themselves back ,14
13058, they are old enough to buy their own products this will ,9
13059," lead into a higher rate of juvenile consumer debt

but ",9
13060," not the children but their parents walk into a store take an article and lay the money on the table the child is just a manipulated family member that pushes his parents to buy stuff it most probably does not need at all to get there the advertisers want the children to produce tentions between the children and their parents by desperately asking for some article they dont need in the end many parents give in just to have a good time with a not whining child but what the parents olny recognise too late ist that by a behaviour like this the kid will only get spoiled

in the end ",2
13061, that it is a good way to protect the children by shielding them entirely from everything but it is ,12
13062, important not to expose them to a full load from zero to onehundred ,19
13063, it is good to control the dvertisementindustry and to give them some restrictions this would not lead into a toycrisis but ,23
13064, keep the children guarded from annoying their parents over actually unimportant issues,12
13065,"television advertising  should not be allowed
in our time televisions mobile phones computers and all the other electronic things are a very important thing in our life already for young children we even cant image a life without all these mediasthat is one ",15
13066, that we really depend form this things but the other ,21
13067, is that they influence us in a way that we even dont know mostly everywhere we are confrontated whith advertisings so should televison advertising ,10
13068,"  not be allowed 
television advertising for adult and ",15
13069," teenagers is already not a good thing because much of them believe that what they say but for young children its much more bad than for us for example there is 5 years old boy who saw in the televison that he should defenetly buy the new chocolate because it will give him more force in his life so imagine the young boy will run to his mother and ask her to buy him this chocolate he cries and says that he absolutly needs that chocolate to have more force the young boy isnt old enough to know that this can not be real
on the other ",7
13070, it is in the hands of the parents they should decide what is good for their own children and what not so if they think that the young boy ,12
13071," isnt old enough to not influence himself they shou

so ",7
13072, televison advertising for yound children should not be allowed because they are ,13
13073," too young to beurteilen what is true and waht not

",7
13074,now a days you find television advertaising everywere it is imposible to watch tv with out any advertising ,10
13075," on tv programs for children
",6
13076," there is the questionif television advertising  young childern should not be allowed
first i like to mention a positive ",13
13077," why it should be allowed
advertsing can help children to create new ideas ",0
13078, a child likes to crate new stuff for example the can see a new cowboy costume in the tv so trougth this advertisings manitulative way they like to play cowboy outside ,20
13079, in this way it is not a bad thing normally ,19
13080, they do not have a costume at home ,19
13081," they trying to create it on their own and will use their imagination 
an negative ",3
13082, is that all advertising is way to manipulative as i mentiond ,11
13083," children are easily influenzable the marketing calcultes it really well if they can not convinz the parents they try it by the children so the children can later convinz the parents for them
an other bad thing is that the children get really early involved in the economie the economie lives from buyng and using and this is not a good way children should be pushed in
",2
13084, it is clear that televison advertising should not be allowed because of its manupulativity and the bad education,15
13085,young people aged  are easily influenced by everything for example its impossible to go shopping with a young child without having an ,7
13086, with them about wether they can have this teddybear or not at the checkout there is always some candy on the eyesight of the children ,20
13087, they complain about having it the shops make a lot of money with it because you would ,23
13088, buy the candy for your child than hearing them cry about it the hole day if children see advertisment on the television it is the same problem children see something and they wand it and wont stop crying until they get it the shops make it very clever they place the advertisment at the right time and place ,2
13089," most of the people who see it buy it 

on the other ",3
13090, its useless to cancel advertising on thelevision because advertisment isnt only on thelevision you are always confronted with it if you cancel television advertisment you should ,15
13091, cancel all advertisments for children because only ,16
13092, the chilrdren live a advertisment free childhood but obviously thats impossible i mean how should we only save children from advertisment on television if the parents should ,14
13093," see it you cant if children arent alowed to do something hteyll do it anyways

",7
13094, you should stop children from seeing advertisment we should learn them how to deal with them and that they arent allowed to have everything what they see in them,16
13095,should television advertising be allowed toward young children if you consider that they are not able to handle them ,14
13096," there is a lot of evidence which speaks against it because children of that age dont really have the judemental possibilities as a grown up does 

imagine your kid sitting in front of your television watching cartoons and there is a commercial break which shows the newest toys including this great little stuffed puppy which can move and talk probably most children run up to their parents begging them to buy this new toy of course most parents dont like to see teir kids disappointed and ",4
13097, dont like the situation of a crying child begging for a toy which is totally unnecessary another ,20
13098, is that its just not fair to produce television advertising for children because they are ,13
13099, easy to convince they are not able to decide whether this is a trashy toy or not as long as the commercial looks good and there is a nice music playing in the backround or ,2
13100, it is just some television show related toy they want to have it so it is not right if big companies try to use children to sell their toys these companies make some of these kids unhappy and make them feel frustrated ,20
13101," they see this great toy commercial but they cant get it also television advertising is something that kids cant learn anything from by watching it and is pretty useless

over all ",0
13102, its not correct to use yound childrens naivity for your business strategies and too sell a lot of toys parents should not need to handle their begging kids and there are ,2
13103, going to be enough sold toys because these children see them at other kids houses and on the playground where they get their wishes and tell their parents ,20
13104,advertising is a very controversial topic alot of people want to ban advertisements ,15
13105," other rely on them in this essay the question about banning television ads  will be responded 

television adverts are all known to us while watching a movie on tv advert breaks are always present and take up a lot of time this has led to falling viewing numbers and popular streaming services like netflix or amazon prime while most adults are more or less immune to ads many children react to them we all have seen this amazing toy on tv and wanted to have it but most of the time our parents did not ",15
13106," we were not happy about that so the question about banning adverts directed  comes up 
first of all you would think that such a ban would have no negative ",11
13107, children would get less influence from ads because in such ages kids are very ease to influence alot of toy companies use this feature and direct very aggressive advertising strategies during christmas time many kid channels are full of ads about this new toy and that new game the same thing is featured in many following ads ,0
13108, kids get the desire of having it and putting in on their santa wishlist a ban would fix this and let kids decide more on their own about their christmas presents the wallets of not ,20
13109," rich parents would be stressed less because often these adverted toys have higher price tags than comparable products and it would be less effective to get political agendas into the brains of the kids like it had been made with superheroes like superman and captain america during the second world war
but how could you enforce such an advertisement ban about a specific age group how can you decide wich advert is  four year olds and wich to six ones toys have often no real age limits so ",16
13110, specific adverts get banned toy companies would host ads wich do not cover these age groups but these kids would react to these ads and the problem of the whole advertisement would not be solved another problem is a financal topic these ads bring in a lot of money to toy companies because of the raise of electronical devices they already have sinking sellling numbers if ads take away another source of money little not ,16
13111," well known companies could be in serious danger of having to cease business these would lead to rising unemployment numbers 

in the end banning these ads would be good children would have less influence from big coperations and could deciede more freely wich toy lands under the christmas tree but sadly such an ban would be almost non enforceable kids do ",16
13112, react to age specific ads but on these of other age categories too a ban would influence the financial security of companies negativley because adverts bring in a lot of money in the end  a ban would almost bring nothing and is most likley to land on a buzzfeed list of some non effective laws ,13
13113,growing up in a privileged ,7
13114," world country i got used to watching televesion every week i always looked forward to the moment where my mother would announce that we would watch a movie tonight but the only bad thing i remember were the advertisement breaks even if they sometimes showed me the possibility of what i could wish for christmas or my birthday i just wanted to watch the movie so why exactly do enterprises want to make advertisements  should they even be banned

the one word that comes ",10
13115, i hear advertisement is profit it is a way to sell products to people but in a very manipulative way they use psychological tricks to get more buyers for example the perfume advertising have you ever seen on television a dior perfume accompanied by an average looking woman did that woman ever look unspecial or natural no clearly they want you to connect their product with beautiful and attractive things ,11
13116, time youll stand near the perfume section in a store you will subconsciously feel comforted by the mere sight of the flacon you got brainwashed imagine that situation whith a child only aged  and ,7
13117, having a young brain those advertisements would have a much bigger influence on it than they have on us adults they ,16
13118, dont realize what the difference about realoty and imagination is they even cant see the difference between an other person and himself theyre ,3
13119," growing and evolving if they already get influenced in this negative form they wont know in the futuere whats right and wrong

on the other ",7
13120, are advertisemt a way to learn about the world and the things that exist on it useful could be this knowledge as children who watched them will be more experienced ,0
13121," it comes to learning vocabulary every advertisement can show a picture of a product and a person who says something to it an easy and playful way to learn 

i ",0
13122, thing that advertisement should be banned as the risk of influencing children the bad way is too big i feel uncomfortable ,13
13123, i imagine how many children want to buy things just because they saw an advertisement of it on the television so yes stop the brainwashing on children ban advertisemennts,16
13124,many young children watch tv or use mobile phones but ,17
13125, we are at this stage of life we should be playing outside with other kids or spending time with the family i understand that it may really be a problem that most parents have to work and they dont always have time for their kids but it is the wrong way to just put them in front of the tv or give them a mobile phone to play when children watch tv too often they dont have the chance to socialize with other kids in their age which may cause problems later ,24
13126, they are at school but the advertisements in tv which are for kids and starred by kids dont consider that problem and they are ,16
13127, produced that children watch them that is not particularly good for the child who is watching them and ,6
13128, not better for the kid that is part of the advertisement because ,16
13129, of them cant be outside playing with friends and making their good or ,1
13130, bad experiences they are way too early in the life of an adult who always need to work and type on their technical devices and are stressed ,24
13131, they cant like a kind of an addiction its ,3
13132, the health which suffers from this tv or mobile phone addiction and kids shouldnt be part of it at all so i really support the statement that televsion advertising  should not be allowed,15
13133, that television advertising  can cause real damages and can create bad characters there are ,10
13134," which can lead young children to learn new things ore even let them calm down in a different way than just looking out the window

looking into a computer or television screen all day long can cause real damages on your eyes which can be irritating and annoying it would be very irresponsible to let young children watch tv all the time it can damage their eyes and could lead them to wearing glasses in their future adding to the damage on the childrens eyes watching tv all day long can damage their brains ",17
13135," they can create very strong character unable to work in groups or even comunicate correctly in their future these children are used to watch tv on their own which did not learn them to socialise with other people in their age 
on the other ",7

13146,"opinion directed essay advertising and young children

advertising is a very big and important theme of todays society every brand or new thing tries to sell and promote their products through ads like television or internet there are a lot of advertising that are in television for adults but influence a lot young children 

games or cereals with particular designs like disney figures are sometimes made for young children as an example the cereals maybe you wouldnt think that it is an ad for children but they will recognise their favourite figure and tell their parents they should buy this cereals or maybe they will see it in the television and afterwards in the supermarket and beg their parents that they buy it it is probably not really fair because they are just children and they dont think about money or the actual product but just connect their favourite things with the design of the packaging but are this ads really s young children the most ads in television like supermarket or thing to wear a made for adults so the brand wants that the people buy this things this are things that are ",0
13147, made for adults like a car its not for children but has another destination of buyers so lets say that on television a brand is promoting a pram pram are made for children but are the children deciding which one they want to buy or special milk to grow well or something to eat that helps the children growing better this are ads that are  children because they are made for children but who decises which one they will buy ,16
13148," that the children will tell their parents at the supermarket which one they want unless they tried some or the packaging looks like something that children like 

there are some advertisings that are made for children and can influence them but where is the ",2

13150, some ads are not allowed on tv people should just watch how much time their children spend on watching tv and what they are watching there are ,14
13151, outside a lot of ads which can influence children and their behaviour in my opinion the problem is not with the ads in tv because they are more s the buyers and not towards little girls and boys ,14
13152,in my opinion it should be allowed because it isnt a big thing and if the partens of the children allow them to watch television theyll know that it will ,17
13153, an advertisment wont do anything to a child if the parents think it would do something to a child or has some bad influences they dont need to allow them to watch television advertisement sometimes ,14
13154," can help to learn something new watching television isnt a bad thing at all children have bigger possibilities to experience many new things and they may learn from it

some people may think that television advertisement is something  bad the children want to buy this and that and maybe the children will get addicted to the things which are shown in the television they may want to buy more and more and wont accept if the parents wont buy them the things shown in the advertisements and because children arent that smart ",14
13155," the people who make the advertisements can trick them and just make the children more stupid than they already are 

in the whole ",16
13156, be allowed but i can understand if some parents are afraid that television advertisement make the children even more stupid and that they wont learn anything from it but it isnt dangerous or anything like that its just unneccessary no one needs it the parents should decide if their children should be allowed watching this but no one else,14
13157, with this statement products are shown and its told how great they are but negative parts of the product are not mentioned of course they have to do that ,23
13158, that people buy the product but in a way that is ,23
13159, a form of manipulation for example you see on the table of mcdonalds how great the burgers look but if you buy one you get a crumply bread thing that doesnt even get close to the one you saw on the picture the manipulating part is making you think that you get something better than the actual product but ,23
13160, everyone knows it it shoulndt be a big problem right but now these manipulating pictures come in form of a short video advertisement between two cartoons your five year old child is watching on tv and its about a stuffed animal your child absolutely wants to have it not knowing how to critically watching the video because of its age children get manipulated like that all over the world they want the new kellogs they saw on tv or the new star wars lego set and and and they dont know that it breaks easily or that it has a way too high price for its value or that it actually tastes like soap they just see how great it is and you as a parent get the disaster if saying no and have to explain to your child why but it ,2
13161, believes more into something it sees on a screen than in the words of its own parent the bad part thats left out in the advertisment is the one a parent gets to feel ,2
13162, trying to calm its child ,9
13163, every parent is just telling the truth and the trying to make a five years old understand how the world really is so companies actually make similar things like some states do with their people like dictators do with the population of states and this cant lead to a good thing could it ,7
13164,"there is a lot of television advertising every twenty minutes there is a advertising break for about 10 minutes these breaks contain a lot of advertisement and some of them are s kids now there are people who want to ban television advertising s children
children are unfluenceable very easily if they see something that seems cool or looks pretty they want it you just have to make a advertisement about a toy mske it look ultra cool and kids think you cant ive without it anymore 
on the other ",14
13165," children have no money at least usually the parents are the ones who need to pay the stuff for their kids and parents are rhe ones deciding which toy they will buy their kids and which one not
advertisement  children is something not very nice where you can make easy money but ",2
13166, it is the responsibility of the parents ,9
13167,"advertising for children only
the question if tv advertising  should be allowed is very intresting there are many ",13
13168, which show that it would be a crime to allow it but ,6
13169, there are at least equally many ,19
13170," which tell us that is is not that much of a big deal
i ",19
13171, have never seen or at least never noticed adverts which ,11
13172, would have adressed only young children aged  this ,8
13173, doesnt mean that there is no but maybe there are no ,19
13174, many in my region which makes the controvers question ,19
13175, of course i couldve easily miss it because im much older ,18
13176, five but from what i see on the streets every day the adverts are more likely to be adressed to a much larger group of people ,11
13177," women or older people not people from 65 to 70
on the other ",18
13178," if advertising as described in the task is currently present in the world it would mean that almost all children  see or hear it and because of that they could easily manipulate the parents in their choices
but with that in mind the question rises what is ",0
13179, catastrofic about children who manipulate the parents because ,7
13180, the parents see and hear adverts and are equally or even more affected by them as the parents really buy things and can decide how to spend their money ,0
13181," children simply cant
anyway the children can be affected by advertising which could change their personality as they grow up children are more easy to manipulate and are much more easy to convince which ",0
13182, makes them an ideal group to direct advertising to ,23
13183," acts as an external factor on their growth and can manipulate the not completely formed brain 
",8
13184, that adverts made for children arent a big problem but there have to be people who are disturbed by them anyway and ,16
13185, that there is no big difference for the companies wo advertise between adressing a child or their parent the children could get affected more in my opinion children should ,12
13186, grow up at least to the age of 10 and ,18
13187, start to make decisions and not already be manipulated by advertising from the past years thats why i would vote for a prohibition of advertising for children only but i dont see it as somthing very bad,13
13188,like always there are two possibilities to answer this question but neither of the two answers is completely correct or wrong it is a matter of opinion wether youare for or against advertising towards young childre in my eyes ,16
13189," advertising towards young children should be allowed i can not think of many reasonable reasons lead to the answer that these adverts should not be allowed

i do not see this adverts as a bad influence on children neither do ",16
13190, that these adverts harm anyone my main ,11
13191, is that these adverts do not contain products that are dangerous for children all they do is make children want their product which should not be a problem ,16
13192, the adverts are not for cigarettes or alcohol children wanting a special toy they have seen on television is not bad for them it might inspire them for a new wish for their birthday or as a christms gift some people may think different and are concerned for parents which have another opinion of these adverts but ,16
13193," it is in their duty to make sure that the kids do not get to see these adverts this would lead to children not sitting in front of the television which is better for them anyways

so as a conclusion i woud say that it is impossible to answer this question with yes or no there are good ",16
13194, that can not be completely right or wrong in my eyes the ,21
13195, that speak against these adverts are not strong enough to beat the ons on the opposite ,11
13196,"should childrens advertismenets be allowed

nowadays ",16
13197, every show or almost every fifteen minutes there is an advertising break on television most advertisments are s adults or adolescents ,10
13198," should there be advertisements for young children 

if there is a commercial on the tv about the latest princess doll out on the market and your young daughter sees it she is most likely to want this doll afterwards however as a parent we cannot buy our children everything they desire ",16
13199, we have to say no the usual ,19
13200," starts they start to scream and cry saying they want the doll if there would be no advertisments s young children some of these breakouts could be avoided 

on the other ",20
13201, young children might not even notice the commercial they look at it but just admire it and wait for their movie tv show etc to ,0
13202," 
most sellers have the right to advertise their products on television ",15
13203," why shouldnt these sellers be allowed not to they should be allowed to advertise any product regardless who is watching 

",11
13204, that if an advertisement is going to influence a child it does not depend if it is maid for younger or older audience it is ,13
13205, going to affect them so ,19
13206," there is not going to be a big difference in cancelling the advertisements 

 ",11
13207,"televison advertising influences people who watch televison much and as we all know kids are even easier to influence because they are young naiv and can not decide if the commercial they watch is true or not so out of the perspective of an advertisier televison advertising s young children is very effective because they can sell more and earn more money but does not the moral suffer
maybe the kids watch a commercial ",14
13208, a film break about an ice cream they want that ice crem but do not know that it might look different because of photoshop they tell theire partens to buy it and maybe they even do it because they want theire kids to be happy then the children are depressed because the ice cream looks different and maybe does not taste as good as advertised or even worse they watch a commercial like how to get thiner  just drink these smoothies twice a day ,11
13209, they learn that they should be thin and drink these drinks that could have a serious future effect maybe ,4
13210," they are in theire teens they think they should lose weight and remember the many commercial they have seen in the age of a toddler 
in my opinion televison advertising  young cildren should not be allowed because kids are too young to get influences that much in a bad way but i thinke parents have to educate theire children too they can tell them that commercials are often lies and that they have to keep attention if they want to buy something",14
13211, that the children should not be influenced at such a young age by television advertising because the advertising could have a bad influence and it could be a promise of something the children could never get to firstly ,13
13212, that from television advertising only the people behind the advertising profits and almost never the people who watch the advertisement i ,10
13213, ask myself what these advertising should be about for children at the age of two years they wouldnt even understand any adverstisement i found that they are way too young at the age of two to really understand what an advertisement is about or they would get it the wrong way for the people who make those advertisements it is ,16
13214, a good invention because children are very quickly excited about things so ,20
13215, they see a new thing made for them on television most of them would get their parents to buy it on the other ,3
13216, young children just watch some series or movies made for children because with advertising ,6
13217, for a new toy the child wants all this stuff and has high hopes but in realitiy a majority of them wouldnt get it in addition to that the advertising could ,0
13218, be used for bad with that i mean that there may be a new product but it is ,23
13219, not good for the environment or the childs health ,4
13220,"television advertising  is a very controverse toppic there are many pros and cons
on of the pros that can be mentioned is that the kids can see what kind of toys there are but they are too young to go and get it ",14
13221," its not like they go to the store and waste their parents money on something unneccessairy this shows that there is no actual damage caused by advertising  
a con is that they might see something on tv that they really like but their parents cant afford it if they go to kindergarden or daycare and see an other kid having this exact toy they might get jealous 
on the other ",2
13222, be seen as a pro because it teaches children that they dont always get what they want which ,8
13223," encourages them to maybe ask a friend who has a toy they like if they could play together which can help to improve childrens social skills
the negative ",8
13224, to this is that childeren with rich parents or spoiled children ,9
13225," might have it easier to become popular because they have all the cool stuff the other kids want but again this is only directed to children from the age  and kids that young dont have an exacty defined social order like older people do
the most important positive ",24
13226," is definitely that if a kid sees an advertisement on tv that leads them to do something else but just sitting around watching television all day it definitly influences the kid positively
all in all i can say that ",14
13227, tv advertising  young childeren is not needed to be forbidden it is the parents decision if they want their kids to watch tv and see those advertisements or not even ,14
13228, i cant see a real ,18
13229,in todays world the different types of media are well discussed and almost everywhere we look we see advertisements wanting us to spend money on something also a critical ,10
13230," is the right way to educate your children so what if those two things came together do commercials have a negative on young children
advertisements are a way of fooling people but what ",14
13231," does this have on our kids

to start off the ",8
13232, that is has become normal and acceptable for children aged between two and five to sit in front of a television regularly is pretty much the cause of this questions because of the new technologies and differents ways to take care of our kids letting them watch something on tv is a difficult offer to refuse moreover the advertising showing up in the middle of a smurfs episode could give them some ideas to put on their wish lists for their ,14
13233," birthday 
however advertisements have been proven to have a big influence on the viewers psychologie and it should be put in question whether it is good for these young kids to confront such conflicts at such a young age kids at such age do not really have an independet character ",0
13234," making them vulnerable to such adverts some critics even say that the five minutes of commercials are a way of exploiding the childrens minds by taking control
another ",0
13235," that speaks against advertisements at such a young age is the future image of their lifes most kids that see those many teddy bears board games princess dresses and hot wheel cars being offered on the screen see it as a necessity to get them this leads to an ungrateful and spoiled boy telling his mom to buy him the newest batman costume just because or even worse it can make them feel disappointed if the toy they received in the mail is not exactly what it looked like on tv 

getting to a conclusion i believe that it would be smart to ban the television advertising for these ages as they trick you into seeing a fake reality kids should not have to be treated like clients in a material world as they cant even buy the products themselves ",14
13236, that this kind of marketing should not be allowed ,23
13237,the television is nowadays a comman way to show advertisement you can project short clips oder just an advertising sentence or picture this way it is a very simple one for producers to spread their brand new products but there are many other options ,10
13238," as the newspaper the radio or the cinema television advertising reaches out for everybody who is sitting in front of the television also the kids at a younger age this is what i talk about in this essay

in my opinion it is an easy and uncomplicated way to advertise things that have just been launched it attracts people during their freetime ",10
13239, they enjoy watching it some advertising clips are very colourfull and accompanied by beautiful soundtracks or music therefore it is quite interesting and exciting watching this advertisement ,11
13240," for toddlers oder babies they dont really understand what the television is saying or what the message could be but they like seeing this spectacular play of colours and music so they stick to the display and enjoy seeing it this is the funfact about it they are happy they see things they would like to play with and go to their parents to ask if they could get it so they can communicate their  needs they start learing how to express their needs at a young age this is good for their future 

but there are some ",17
13241, too sitting in front of the television is not really healthy for young kids they stick to the display ,17
13242, playing with toys or outside in addition to that they get influenced by the advertisements the kids know every new toy ,24
13243, it gets difficult for the parents to show their kid something that it doesnt know ,24
13244, they will claim about not having the newest toys of the advertisement further a twoyearold gets to know all these products olthought its not even necessary at this age they do not just see the advertisements of toys ,20
13245, stuff that arent made for eyes at this age its a bad influence that has ,4
13246," for the behaviour of the kid 

in conclusion i say that it shouldnt be strictly forbitten for young children ",12
13247, it is the parents duty to look ,12
13248," they do not always 247 watch the television advertising
",11
13249,"
nowadays many kids watch tv ",17
13250, parents want them to be quiet with television advertisement economic manipulation starts in a very early age this is affecting children and with them their parents one can argue that this is just how our society is treated and lets itself treat,7
13251," why should this be prevented for kids

one main reason against television advertising s young children is that they are affected way more emotionally and cannot think of anything else than this one need raised by an advertisement this hinders them from playing peacefully and learning important skills
an ",14
13252, against any prohibition of television advertisement is that parents can decide from what age on their kids are allowed to watch tv if they dont want their child to be influenced by television advertisement they can let them listen to cds or read stories to them ,13
13253, placing them in front of the tv further it is impossible to prevent children from advertising influence as this is everywhere on the streets on posters in supermarkets toy stores and ,14
13254, on everyone of us has come across the situation in the supermarket where little children cry for drink or cereals which include a toy or is packed targeting kids the parent cannot ,9
13255," promising to buy this certain product the child desires

in my opinion television advertising should not be forbidden because i dont think it would change anything neither for kids nor for their parents as 
",14
13256,television advertising  is very difficult because the kids do not watch many channels ,14
13257, than a long period of time all that makes it not easy to direct only children but ,7
13258, of a play they want to have it and that is very difficult for parents because they do not want to buy new things for their children all the time that is why ,20
13259," with the satement 

an other reason is that the children see every day a new advertise and they want all these plays after it is very difficult for parents to say no because the others of the class get this new play when the parents have more than one child it costs a lot of money and they have too much plays at home also ",24
13260," the parents are not as rich it is too expensive for them to buy every week a new play 

additionally the children have to learn to be contnet with the plays they have already they do not understand that their parents work for buying the plays and that the plays cost money but ",24
13261, they are adults they have to earn their own money ,9
13262, buying something new that is why ,18
13263," that it is important to understand that already as a child that you have to earn money and and that plays or stuff like that are expenisve

at least ",8
13264, television advertising  from two up to five years should not be allowed it is less stressful for the parents who have not to spent a lot of money and ,13
13265, for the children who do not want to have the newest plays all the time ,6
13266, the advertises are not allowed,11
13267,"in our every day lives we are confronted with advertisements probably more than we are aware of 
unconsciously we lean towards brands we have somewhere seen in an ad appearing ",11
13268," we have to take a decision but what we do always have is the decision to buy whatever we want the ads only try to influence our will in some way no matter if its a child teenager or adult 

some parents think their child can be protected from the big dangerous world until they one day turn into adults and can make their own senseful decisions this protection may be possible for a little ",16
13269, where the child eventually will want to step out out this protected world out of pure curiosity the parents no longer have the control to decide what the cild will see and not see the ads we have around us will maybe influence us somehow but we ,7
13270, have to learn how to control our minds on our own and ,7
13271, we do not learn this from an early age life will not necessarily become easier a child who really wants something will not want it more just because they liked the ad ,2
13272," much
somehow it does sound unfair to do ads for an age group who is not even able to earn their own money to make them convince someone else in this case the parents to buy things for them because they sound ",16
13273, excitingchildren are very vulnerable and may even think their life is not complete without this one thing ,8
13274," them being upset at their parents doesnt sound pleasent for anyone except for the shop who maybe benefits from it later 

shortly summarized we arent able to protect children from the society and its norms ",9
13275, it would be an ideal thing to do it is the attitude of the child that has to be worked on not the restriction of advertisements keeping them away from the world will not make it easier for them in the long run ,16
13276,these days these is a lot of televison advertisements some of them interesting some funny some just straight out lame and some of those advertisements are s young children should these advertisements be allowed many young kids mights find that advertising is boring and they dont really pay attention but ,14
13277, thy see toy advertisements or something similar in that way they completely fall in love with this toy or whatsoever and they want to have it ,20
13278, bad witch results in them asking their parents for the toy and if the parents tell them no many kids snap and make the lives of their parents a living hell by criing or screaming around and constantly asking them again and again no loving parent wants to see their child sad or they just cant stand the screaming anymore ,20
13279, they end up buying this toy from the advertisements and this results in children getting spoiled and a spoiled child can be a bit of a problem this is why many parents dont allow their younger kids to watch television at all because of these advertisements buts this might not be a problem at all ,2
13280, parents are strict and are consequent in their decisions if these parents can stnd tough and dont budge under the weight of their childrens constant pleases they should not be worried about such advertisements because if your child know it cannot get what it wants through screaming and crying it will stop on its self and give up all you need as a parent is a bit of a cold heart and some discipline they need to learn to say no to their sweet little children ,16
13281, that television advertisements s young children should not be banned because its not the advrtising that is doing anything wrong its the parents and parents saying that such advertisements are bad and should be banned are those kind of people who dont have a lot of control over their children so ,13
13282, that banning tv commercials for young children wont solve anything ,13
13283,first of all it is a common topic that the tv shows much advertising and that they all have ,10
13284, on our lives an example is a little child sits in front of the television and is watching his favorite tvshow after half an hour the ,6
13285," advertising shows up most of the children think as soon as they like what they see they have to have this product so they run to their parents and show them this thing that they really need 

parents can react differently to this situation they can say to their child ",2
13286, they clean their room or ,1
13287, they get good grades they will get that toy this way those television advertising has a positive ,20
13288," so the child has a goal that it wants to reach everytime he looks at this toy in the tv again 

secondly it is good for those who sell these products because such young people dont really think about what they really need they only look at this product and ",20
13289, it has many colours around it and ,18
13290," they see that others have fun with it they want it too and the parents cant always say no to such a cute little child that askes with big cute eyes if they could buy this toy for him or her

but ",20
13291," the televison advertising towards young children make the parents buy more and more just to make their children happy especially in the young age the children dont think about what they really need or what they could really have for a long time so they just see the product that is shown in the tv and already want it and it is clear that those who invented those kind of advertising use this kind of people to sell more products

secondly the more the little toddlers want the more they think about what they dont have ",14
13292," what they have this could cause that less children in this young age are satisfied with their childhood and we all know that this is the age where you just dont think about problems or got negative thoughts so this should not be changed by this television advertising

to sum up i think its important that the television advertising should not be made for such young people and more for those who already can see the difference about needing and wanting and ",14
13293, it is better to look at those things they already have ,19
13294, wanting more and more so this is ,18
13295, the key to a wonderful childhood without any television advertising that only uses these young audiences,14
13296,television advertising is a well known possibility to make great business by introducing products or showing a typical ,10
13297, of view that the company stands for i mean who hasnt watched a advertisement and was inspired to buy the product afterwards we see often large companies like niike coca cola or nestle  advertising in television for a new product because they can afford the costs because television advertising is a very expensive thing in my opinion the advertisment has ,11
13298, not a big impact on me some of them are done very well that i even like to watch them but others are just complete bullshit ,6
13299, the young years of life specificaly the years in between 25 are very important ,8
13300, that the they shouldnt sit in front of the television advertisement is not usefull for a young child the child cant do alot with it maybe it can ask some random things like  what is that daddy but thats not even that interesting for a child in his young years a child likes to move and to play with certain stuff in these ,0
13301, years it learns to balance to walk to jump and to think in a way to create relations between objects or things he knows and ,8
13302, advertisment has nothing to do with all of that i can imagine that advertisment could confuse a child because its very random sometimes i wouldnt prohibit it but it is not necessary,16
13303,"the question that televsion advertising should not be allowed for children at age  years shows up many pros and contras 
in the one ",13
13304, tv advertising may confuse children for example ,14
13305, they are watching their favourite programme and suddenly it disappears children may be sad or confused another reason is that almost every child is very unpatient ,24
13306," they are bored so they always need to be entertained and should never be interrupted

in the other ",3
13307, being honest children at this young age do not really notice ,24
13308," an advertising appears they probably think that it is part of their tv programme furtermore advertising is not here just to annoy us people make much money out of it 
children ",20
13309, at this age should take breaks and should not rest for hours in front of a television they should move their body enough and play outside ,1
13310," just be lazy at home and this is exactly the reason why advertising is important for example a child needs to pee but his programme is much funnier and more interesting than the toilet a child will never come to the idea that it should stand up and do whatever it needs to to so a tv advertising is just like a reminder for the important things in your live

to sum up ",1
13311, that advertising should not be prohibited because there are many reason against it maybe this people who are responsible for advertisings should shorten it a little bit but never prohibit it completely,15
13312,a child aged  isnt able to make the right decision for themselves often they arent even allowed to do things or buy things without their parents permission furthermore shouldnt children of this young age be confronted with consumption of any manner moreover its bad for their developement if they think that pretty much everything can be bought with money on the contrary is a child no matter which age a human being whos allowed to have toys to have clothes or eat the candy they want ,2
13313," why prohibid the advertisments of these kind of stuffs
furthermore children nowadays are being spoiled from their parents with gifts and stuff much earlier than the last generation used to be so if the parents decide wether whats good and whats bad for their particular child theres no problem helping them with it an other ",2
13314, is that if parents let their children watch television at this age its their resposibility of what their children actually get to see and advertisements are just part of the television business ,14
13315, there is worse stuff in television children could get to see than an advertisement towards them which would be toys and stuff furthermore just by seeing an advertisement it doesnt have to mean that they buy it use it or consume it most of the kids in this age havent even got money ,14
13316, in their parents hands and if those parents feel pressured by their three year old kids ,7
13317, that it influenes their idology of how to grow up ones one kid ,7
13318," their just useless parents 
so to sum it all up ",24
13319, that unless its a sextoy advertisement on a child programm theres absolutely no harm of directing toy advertisement and similar advertisements to young people whose parents ,13
13320," are the ones taking the shots 
",19
13321,"
today advertising is an importent part of our lives and ",11
13322," for the companies witch bring them out there have been many studies about how publicity influenc our daily live in scool we talkt about witch advertising is better and why is she better than others so there are many different opinions about thsat theme
if a child is in the age from tow to five somebody could say that they see the advrtising but they dont pay attention to it but perhabs it does something with them in the subconscience its the same thing with the grownup persons ",0
13323, they couldbe influenced from a very young age up it ,7
13324," plays a rolle wicht kind of publicity is that if its for a toy they perhabs realiced it and walk afterwards to the parents and ask them if they could buy it
people ",20
13325, can say that its not good to show children advertising because they get early in that flow of buying allways anything if they have money or and thats an other ,16
13326," they dont have enougth money its easyer for them to make a lot of problems with money 
we ",3
13327, could say that showing pub to them heps that they could better understand the word of commerce and ,23
13328," they could learn not spending to much moneyone things they dont really need
so they are many different ideas and meanings but ",8
13329, for the negative sight on this problemits not necessary to show them advertising because they dont have to be influenced in such a young age they can not protect themselv from this attacs in the subconscience and that is ,16
13330,the open market worldwide is booming and every company needs to claim themselve just because the companies need to make advertisements which are shown in the tv ,23
13331," young children aged  have this awweffect which attracts the potential clients attention maybe he remembers the advertisement and thats exactly what its company wanted to reach in this way television advertising is a good support for the economic growth 
but who thinks at the children who are effected i mean who is able to make serious decisions in this age perhaps later these grown up children regret what hey did in the past in some way its there parents fault they were the actors who forced there own children to be in a television advertising just because they are soooo proud parents who always wanted the best   ",0
13332,"television advertisment 

everbody knows it every body hates it 
and young children shoudnt watch it why

so i dont know why not because if they watch television with two years its bad no matter if it has television advertising in it or not its just stupid young children should play with things with friends go out in the nature etc they will watch enough tv the rest of there lifes but back to the advertising you could say that maybe they can watch sextoils advertisment or sth but look that wouldnt be bad because they wouldnt get it they dont understand all of the advertisment maybe these about chocolate but okay they watch a chocolate advertisment whats bad about it whats could be bad about a chocolate advertisment but not about a serie about a mouse and a frog i dont know children doesnt need to watch the serie about the mouse and the frog and they dont have to watch the advertisement 

you can think that my opinion to this is that television at all should be forbitten but thats not i think its your choice what you are going to to with your children i dont like television and stuff like these ",14
13333," no i wouldnt put my children in front of a television with the age of 3 but it wouldnt be really bad if you would do it its just not really healthy because you dont walk and dont smell the free nature you get really faul if you look to much tv so go to the scouts its great its better than watching tv you make friends you are outdoor you are getting a better imunsystem and lot more so dont watch tv you are getting poor eyes 

so my end is dont watch tv it makes you faul and stupid  and it doesnt matter with or without advertising its stupid 
",14
13334," go and search a hobby for your child 
 ",1
13335,"is that good for young children to look televison

my ",6
13336, oppinion is that young children shouldnt look too much television because they should ,17
13337, be in their garden and play with their toys and friends but ,1
13338," loved to look my series
so ",18
13339," the parents precise a time in which their children can look tv and the rest of the day the boys and girls have to find other occupations it is very important that kids arent addicted to the television
and than it depends ",17
13340, what the young children look if they look things too violent films with murders and wars that isnt good at all in this age the young children learn very quick and are imrpessioned by many tings so if the parents show them bad films these young kids maybe dont understand that the scenes that they see arent good and than they will imitate this bad things with their friends at school or maybe they are afraid and make very bad dreams so ,6
13341," that it is important that the parents show their kids films which are appropriated too the childrens ages  

so the ",6
13342, is that parents must give their children a fix time for televison and the ,17
13343, ist that parents should control what their children look the oportunity is that children arent adiccted and can have fun with other things healthy things like playing football go swimming be with their friends to be social and adventures  ,12
13344,the question should advertisments which are directed  between two and five years old be allowed is a controversial question because the children could suffer from the adverts ,13
13345," not advertised properly

for example if children see a childfriendly add in which they need to download a game which many children can do nowadays the game could be locked behind a payment that payment could be extremly high and the children manly because many cannot read or do not know the value of money ",16
13346," would accept it therefore the parents would recieve high accounts and the game manufacturer would become wealthy for using childrens inexperience 
however the addvertisments could ",12
13347, show children a toy which they ,20
13348, could wish for for birthday or christmas the parents ,18
13349," dicide if the toy could help the child in which case they would say yes or not and say no 
finally an advert which is for a museum is helpful for the child and could ",20
13350," awake intrest for something the child did not know exsisted like dinosaurs or deepsea creatures this could help the child in its future career 

in my opinion advertisments can be accepted ",0
13351, there isnt any moneymaking scheme behind the advert furthermore if the child experiences harm during the advert the advert should be recalled immediately but if the advertisments are for enlightening the childs intrests and could possibly help him in the future ,16
13352, choosing a subject to study they should be allowed to broadcast ,12
13353,"television is bad for your eyes
thats a common sentence used by parents to draw their children away from the tv maybe its just a fairy tale made by concerned parents or maybe watching television really has become what most parents fear addictive
but what about the advertsising dont we all hate it these breaks between our beloved television shows or even between a really good movie but what about children arent they in danger of a bad influence made by ads
well its not that easy to say we could say that advertising really has become a big thing ads by mcdonalds or the new doll that every young girl needs to possess
ads always give us this feeling that we miss out on something they give us the feeling that we need something even do we cant afford it or we know that its not going to have the effects we want it to have
children between the age 25 probably see flashy colors in front of their eyes ",14
13354, a catchy song is playing but its hard to believe that they actually understand the content of an advertise they are ,11
13355," young and the brain focuses on diffrent things than advertising
also we could say that most of the children dont really spend their time in front of a tv most of them are playing outside during the day in the evening they go to sleep early anyway 
also most of the time parents are pretty strict about the tv rules and most of them dont allow their children to watch tv ",14
13356, we cant deny that young children are naive and can be influenced very easily we may not notice it at the ,7
13357, glance but isnt their always a child that wants a new doll or a new plastic boat thats probably not even good in quality but why is that ,20
13358," is it because of advertising in television 
even ",10
13359," i said earlier that the probably only see flashy colors and cant remember properly they are always in a learning progress and if they see something they want it 
its easier to get a childs attention by using an ad because they cant read and sometimes its easier to just give them pictures to look at
also the ads are catchy and most of them are promoting useless toys that cant even be used properly some of the ads even promote an unhealthy lifestyle ",0
13360," mcdonalds with his famous happy meal and food is as we all know something that holds us together and it doesnt need much words to say that youre hungry and that you want a happy meal

so should we cut the access to ads for young children ",16
13361, the ads may be made for them but as i can say from my own experience that its pretty much useless i dont remember most of them anyway and if i have seen something on tv and want my parents to buy it they would be strict about it i mean its ,0
13362," the parents choice what they buy and dont buy for their children
",9
13363,television advertising is something completely normal nowerdays  advertisments are used to convince the people of specific products often they are  because if they like it and they see the product in the ,10
13364," shop they are going to try to convince their parents to buy it often they have a bigger chance of succes than the original television advertisment thatswhy the people in this business  directed it towards them but should that really be allowed thats the question discussed in this small essay

it is obviously a little sneaky what the advertisment people do to convince as many potential clients as possible but does it really harm the children it is much easier to convince little children of a product you just need a funny colourfull little clip that somehow speaks to them and they will do the rest maybe not even knowing what theyre doing the will recognise the product and will want to have it that really does not seem to be too bad children are very influenceable which makes them to easy victims but they are ",0
13365, in a stage of learning so you ,18
13366, indirectly convince their parents you ,7
13367, make some potential future clients what they see in their younger ages and what their parents use they will remember later and are going to use the same thing you dont really give them the possibility to choose they are not ,8
13368, but their makes does the choice for them making the children want something that might not even be good for them but ,7
13369," the parents which can influrence their child and simply say no if their children want something stupid      

also making television advertsing  already asumes that there will be children watching it an advertisment does not work if nobody is going to watch it so young children are already supposed to sit infront of the television which is really sad considering people that young should ",2
13370," go outside or play with friends 

",1
13371, it should not be forbidden but it is ,12
13372," not very good in the end it is thou the parentsthat influence their children the most 

",7
13373,television advertising  is a controversial subject while some peoples opinion is that it has a bad influence on young children some others claim that young children dont get harmed by television advertising at all in the following paragraphs ,14
13374," with television advertising that is s very young children

first of all opponents of television advertising argue that children this young are influenced very easily by their surroundings amongst other things this can be their parents friends they play with and ",14
13375, television if they are being exposed to television advertising critics say their personalities cant develop ,17
13376," as if they werent because advertisements are always very persuasive and try to change peoples opinions which is not something a young person should experience 
second some people say that young kids should spend their time on more useful things like playing with their friends or crafting ",16
13377, all day in front of the tv by allowing advertising s children companies are more likely to try to persuade parents to let their daughters and sons watch television more often ,17
13378, they can possibly make profit out of it this is a trend that is not beneficial for the childrens brain development ,12
13379," passive activities like watching tv dont create a lot of connections inside of the brain 

on the other ",1
13380, supporters claim that television advertising is actually beneficial for children they say that the advertisements are designed almost like any other show for kids friendly colorful and underlined with fun music and ,14
13381," cant be harmful for young individuals 
furthermore they say that the advertisements never promote anything harmful for kids but new toys coloring pages or similar instead they think children even children as young as a twoyearolds should be informed about the things they might like and maybe even get an idea for a birthday wish out of it 

in my opinion advertising for children on television is not something ",14
13382, or am particularly fond of ,18
13383, that its beneficial in any way for the children and just another way for companies to generate more revenue i ,12
13384, think that it can have an unhealthy effect on very young children who are to young to tell the difference between reality and fiction nevertheless ,4
13385, that not all advertisements should be banned but instead watched evaluated by experts for human brain development ,13
13386,"television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed

the television is a media who is very common and important in our life
between films or tvshows is mostly a break for the advertisement
thats marketing in our modern world and thats an important part of the business of many organisations and labels
but is it really important to refer television advertising direct toward children

first of all there are labels which refers ",14
13387,  for instance barbie hot wheels playdooh and ,20
13388, sweets who are made for children so you can say that the children are ,8
13389," group for this label but who thinks that the children buy all the stuff on their own the parents have the money and the parents buy the stuff for their children
so why do the labels dont make the advertisement for the parents for examplehappy children and happy parent as a slogan

for a ",2
13390," isnt it morallly wrong to refer the advertisement direct toward young children
they should play they shout learn and they should grow up but they should not be the victims of the desire which is always hidden in every advertisement
 
at least the children should not be part of that society which thinks just at profit and the money they made they should not be consumers they should ",16
13391," learn what is really important in their life befor they think about other stuff

as a conclusion ",7
13392, that television advertising direct toward children should not be allowed because children are too young to think about all these things and they should basically learn play and have fun,13
13393," children between two and five shouldnt look that much tv that they have to look the advertisings between the movies or the serie
but okay in our time nearly all 10 minutes is a break between a serie and ",17
13394, there are advertisings for young children ,16
13395, because the company has to mark themself ,23
13396,"
so it would be kind of hart ",18
13397," you would them not allow to do their marketing

but children have not in all cases not a big known and not ",16
13398, much experiece in life when they see these advertisings which seem to present the coolest thing in the world ,11
13399," they want the product which they have seen they dont know that the products in reailty are sometimes not that special

but would it be fair to disallow them their advertisings
no i dont thnik ",11
13400, this is kind of a job from the parents to look that they learn that not everything what it seems to be is what it is when the parents let their children watch tv for the ,17
13401, times they should maybe sit ,19
13402," to them and explain them the situation
because not every advertising is a bad one which tells them a fairy tale when a child wants something for christmas or hisher birthday tv adverstisings can be helpful

and ",0
13403, you wouldnt allow their advertisings athor advertisings should be disallowed ,11
13404, because there are a lot of adults which fall for the advertisingtricks ,16
13405," and in difference to the children they gonna spend their money on the product
",2
13406,nowadays there are many parents who do not care how long and which kind of tv channels their children watch this could have big ,17
13407, for their education but do the parents have to forbid to watch tv to their childrento my mind there are two ,17
13408," of view to this question 

first many parents let their children watch tv to entertain them ",17
13409, they are not bored for me this is not bad because i learned a couple of ,1
13410, by watching tv furthermore the producer from the kids channels ,6
13411, had the aim that childrem can learn from its series in addition our generation is very influenced by the internet or the tv ,6
13412, it is good that the children learn early what tv really is and what sort of channels are there and they ,17
13413," able to learn the language better 

to the opposite many parents do not let their children watch tv and they somtimes do not even have one they only let their children play outside or to play with toys they have the ",8
13414," that there is only rubbish in the tv which make their children stupid i am not saying that this is not true but it is to abstract 

to sum up i totally understand ",3
13415, of them are right all in all all is a question of how much and what kind of tv channel it is in my opinion it is not good to let the children watch tv everytime but the ,17
13416, is not to just forbid it because lots of children like to watch tv and ,17
13417, it is cold outside the children are glad to watch tv ,1
13418, they can pass a little time and it is ,19
13419," they are able to sleep longer

",19
13420,"television advertising  young childern schould not be allwoed

in our society in europe it is nothing new that television contain a lot of advertising it let the people think that advertising is something normal something taht a lot of people is not even more questioned in our society in europe it is ",14
13421, normal for a child to look a lot of television they grow up with television and ,17
13422," with advertising in what a society do we live in and more waht happen with the childern who look advertising every day

first ",11
13423," adverstising should not be banned it is a part of our societyi dont say that it is a good thing but childern have to know for waht advertising is existing it is existing to make the people buy a lot of things advertisinges are never or mostly not critiqual it is up to the human to find out about advertising if the want to

in the ",15
13424," it is important to learn how to live with advertising if i walk through the roud i always see advertising not always just in the television childern have to learn how they can protect themslefs of the world of advertising 

in the ",15
13425," place im anyway against things adult people wanne forbidden their childern i mean they live in our wolrd they grow up in it they should now in what for a wolrd they are living in and from where should an adult know what a child should see and what not

in conclusion ",12
13426," it is important to let the childern now and letting them making an own opinion about advertising not an other person from outwhere 
basicly because he is not the same person
 ",16
13427,advertising is always communicating with us in many different ways either ,11
13428, we are walking down the street or ,18
13429, we are sitting in front of the television at home there are always advertisments which are trying to get in touch with us advertising is a personal thing as it can be seen on facebook where it is tried to do some commercials which perfectly fit in our interests this leads to the question are there any moral stops for advertising advertising companies are entering more and more our daily life and ,15
13430," started to do advertising for young children

young children cant have an own understanding of life they try to act like their parents and ",16
13431, own interests if advertising interrupts these processes it obviously stops the children from growing up the companies try to influence the children to buy their products and to be a customer who only buys their products nestea ,2
13432, is a big company that produces lots of baby food a few years ago scientists had shown that there are food extras in these products which makes the babies like their other products in the future also the parents wont like that the big companies are already influencing their young children the kids want to have products like lollies or drinks ,23
13433, they do the grocery shop with their parents but not because they need them they only want to buy them because the social stereotypes are telling them to do they see other children walking around with their lollies and they see the advertisment ,2
13434, they want to have them too a good example to support my thesis is the well known kinder suprise egg as i already the children have no chance to create their own interests ,9
13435, which game they would like to play the communication of the advertisment tells them what they want to have and what they like this is ,11
13436," proved by many scientists

in conclusion it can be clearly said that the advertising tries to influence the young children to make them dependent to their products this is not good at all because we all are being influenced by something we dont want to which is sort of doing harm to someone the young children cant do anything against this process and ",0
13437, the profitorganized businesses should stop,23
13438,btw im tired and hungry ,18
13439," dont expect anything

television advertisements are a thing every television watcher is exposed to from a very young age to uneducated and older people advertisements can be very manipulative and almost brainwashing ",10
13440, a majority of people think that advertisements to small children should be banned in this essay ,13
13441," figure out wether or not this is worthy my time or not

on one ",18
13442, they are ads and people who put their two year old children infront of a television ,11
13443," know that they are confronting their children with ads and dont care or if they dont know they are probably too dumb to have children anyway

also how are companies supposed to sell their products if they are not allowed to promote their products every big company we know got their name off of marketing ",2
13444," coca cola or mc donalds they will make no to little profit and stop selling products s young children

on the other ",23
13445," children are easily manipulated and an easy target for any kind of ad or propaganda they can bevery stubborn in what they want and they dont fear the ways to prove this

to conclude ",7
13446, say that all parents should be aware of the ,12
13447, if they dont want to confront their children with ads etc they can buy them dvds and download movies because free telelevision ,1
13448, needs a way to earn money and stay alive therefore i think advertisements in any way should not be banned,15
13449,the question of whether or not television advertising  should be allowed is quite difficult but important ,15
13450," the early years of childhood shape us as humans 
it goes without saying that children are easily influenced parents might want to protect their children from an exposure to advertising ",2
13451, they fear it could be harmful for their mental wellbeing when children see something on the television that is clearly marketed towards their age group they may suddenly desire these things that theyve never really thought about ,14
13452," and that they dont really need this could lead to a materialistic world view that lots of parents disapprove of 
if the parents spoil their child the child could become greedy and keep on demanding new things this can easily become a nuisance for the parents but punishing the child by not allowing them to watch television anymore doesnt seem like a good ",17
13453, the damaging adverts are not the childs fault ,16
13454, all but how can parents keep their child from becoming obsessed with expensive toys especially ,20
13455," they arent able to afford the things advertised on television it may lead to conflict within the family 
children dont see advertising as something artificial they dont recognise the presented scenarios as fictional and romantisised if a child on tv can have such a good time playing with these dolls ",2
13456, why shouldnt they sooner or later children have to be made aware of the reality of advertising and its purpose some people might say that if the child is used to seeing adverts it doesnt really pose a problem the sooner they learn to recognise advertising the better but ,16
13457, parents should introduce their child cautiously to the world of advertising and forbidding advertisements aimed directly at them could be a huge benefit because the child can learn about adverts in a more removed distanced way,16
13458,it depends what kind of ads the kids are watching first of all a young kid like that should only watch specific series for children on channels like kika that are designed for kids i dont know if its ,14
13459, i was fifteen years younger but at my time i never felt the ads to be distracting or manipulating me to really want an object and ,11
13460, a kid gets obsessed with an item in an ad they couldnt buy it by themselvs and would need to beg their parents for their desired object obviously the responsibility lies in the parents hands they need to teach their kids that they cant have everything that they see in televison and ,2
13461, observe what the kids are watching im not quite sure if there are even companies that have a specific programm to manipulate kids through advertiment because ,16
13462, thats worth the ads are like they are for adults to show their product and perhaps raise interest of course little kids me aswell back in the day want many things they see in television but if the parents just accept that and buy everything their child wants they are guilty ,0
13463, their kid becomes a crybaby ,9
13464, they dont get what they want in my opinion it would be a waste of time to ban ads  because it is not as important than that the parents watch ,13
13465," their child and control what they are watching until a certain age where the kid beginns to think rational and starts to know by his own what kind of stuff they are watching


",17
13466,nowadays even young children watch television quite often as a consequenze there are more adverts ,14
13467, that they know what they could set on their ,3
13468," birthdaywish letter

firstly it is not possible for these young children not to see any adverts although you can ban telvision advertising they ",16
13469, are confrontet with adverts for older people adverts on the street and adverts in different shops they have an effect on them ,11
13470, no matter where we are there is always some kind of advertising in spite of this ,11
13471," there is no ability to ban television advertising for young children unless advertising is banned at all 

secondly if there is an influence toward young children their parents will have the power to say no to the wishes triggered from the adverts furthermore they cannot allow their children to watch television the children might learn how to deal with it and they learn to decide what they really need and what they should not buy during the time ",13
13472," most children watch tv one could ban adverts which work with psychological tricks to make the children buy their product
in conclusion tv adverts do not have to be banned o",13
13473,"television and other medias like the internet are a huge theme in our society there are many pros and contras but should young children have already contact with it is the influence positive or negative
our world is full of medias and there can be found things to every theme you ever want is this good for young children it can not be some people are saying there is to much that this young eyes shouldnt see television should be forbitten to them children should play outside and not sit inside in front of the tv
but computer and things like this will be very important in their life ",17
13474, they should grow up with it to understand it and in in this young age they wont understand much they see ,24
13475," it isnt important to be afraid that they could be traumatized or something like this its a part of our life why it shouldnt be one of the children life
the decision if children should watch tv or not should be a thing of the parents they know whats the best for their children i dont like to say anymore ",17
13476, stay and snore tv is rubbish id like more to have a fish they are much more interresting to watch than television with promotion of swatch,1
13477,"the tv is not a new thing anymore basically every family has a television at home and watches the tv there is no television channel without advertising thats not a problem for adult people but what about children can they really understand the advertising shown in tv is it necessary and what woul change if the advertising towards young children was forbidden

when i was a child ",14
13478, that i watched tv until i was six years old and even ,6
13479, i wasnt allowed to watch alot of tv i used to watsch from 7pm to 730pm the sandmann which came on the children channel or sometimes i was allowed to watche barbiefilms in the breaks during the film came a lot of advertisings to be honest it wasnt a problem ,17
13480, or my family i could ,18
13481, grow up like a normal child ,8
13482, i saw some advertising at the television i am sure that times changed and my childhood was different than the childhood children have now i used to go to parcs with my parents and friends and i used to play alot outside i know that nowdays we have the problem that children watch alot more tv and they dont move alot but i dont understand why the advertising should be a big problem it is more the fault of the parents alot of parents are scared that theire children break a leg ,14
13483," the play some wild games and prefere that they stay at homewhere the are save but thats not a good idea 

so i do not allow with the statement written above the problem is not the advertising itself the problem are all those parents who dont want thire children to go out because its too dangerous parents often like to turn on the tv because they want that theire children have something to do and watching tv is something they can do without any adult ",14
13484, that the advertising is dangerous ,11
13485," it is advertising which is adopted to children it is clear that children shouldnt see advertisings which are scaring but most of the children channel are aware of this

",16
13486,television advertising aged  should not be allowed there are many ,15
13487, that it shouldnt be allowed it isnt good for the children to watch much television in this age because they are to young and its bad for their development before children have to go to school they shouldnt watch television because it is prooved that children who watched a lot of television arent as good in school as the other children if it is bad to watch television in this age it is bad to make television advertising for them also children in this age are easy to manipulate and if the advertising tells something is good they will believe it and ,17
13488," they want to have it  if they want something they will find a way to make their parents buy this things people who are older realise that in the advertising the product seems to be much better than it really is in this young age they cant see this 

there are ",2
13489, the proposers of television advertising they think it should be allowed because the company can sell a lot more than they would do without television adertising so it is good for the economy they ,15
13490, think why should it not be allowed if they wouldnt make the advertising there would ,15
13491," be other advertising young children could see 

",16
13492, it isnt the best thing in the world and maybe it would be good if it were forbidden but i ,4
13493, think it will be difficult to make a law which says television advertising should not be allowed ,15
13494," it should be forbidden but i dont think that it will be forbidden we have a lot of other problems which we have to solve and this isnt that important 
",19
13495,"in my opinion you have to separate two different types of this advertising there are often some who refere directly  but the most of them are just for the parents
so they want that the children can see all the amazing toys and article the children really want these toys and ",0
13496, it has only an effect on the parents they can buy them what they want or they can just say no the most children aged  havent money to buy them these things by there own even if you have to separate ,9
13497, it doesnt matter if the television advertising is  or for there parents because the resault is the same maybe the children react more to the advertising ,14
13498, the parents because they are way faster faszinated of it the parents are already used of all the influence of advertising ,2
13499," often they do not even realize or they just dont listen to it 
in general ",3
13500, it shouldnt be not allowed but ,12
13501," a show for children in all the breaks of shows for children aged older the five it shouldnt be a problem because ether the children dont watch these shows or the parents could switch the channel if there is to much advertising
my conclusion is that it should be allowed with some rules or laws at the end its anyway always the decision of the parents if they want to buy the advertised article or not if the parents would have a problem with all the advertising ",14
13502, it would anyway be much better no to let them look television aged this young they should go outside and do something active ,1
13503,the question if television advertising for young children should not be allowed is a question that concerns many people there are parents who do not want their children to see it because if the children see those advertisements they could be influenced in a way they dont even understand ,13
13504," they dont realize that in advertisements everything is showed that it looks more beautiful as it is and that mostly the product isnt as good as in the advertisement 
but another question is why shouldnt it be allowed because young children shouldnt be watching television all the time because its not good for them a child should be outside playing with other children to get more social ",14
13505, the advertisment in the television shouldnt bother them at all because they dont see it ,15
13506, often but sadly it isnt normal that a child isnt allowed to watch television ,17
13507, its a reasonable doubt if they could change their behaviour or something else because of the advertisment ,11
13508, the main problem is that the children grow up as careless consumers ,2
13509, they see it a consumer that doesnt care if he really needs the product or not and in the world there are enough of this specific kind of people for example a child sees a machine that can make bubbles and is ,3
13510, fascinated of it that it wants the machine no matter what of course the child is too young to think about the money that it costs and the water that it consumes but ,8
13511, if a child is used to get things without thinking about the reasons to get it or the use it has it will have the behaviour ,7
13512, is that the parents could be even more stressed because their child wants all the things he sees in the advertisement we can all imagine a young boy crying on the floor because he didnt get his water pistole he saw in the television and if this happens a few times in a week because the boy sees another thing he wants in an advertisment it could be really stressfull for the parents but there is ,0
13513, a good thing that advertisments for young children can do they can show products that are healthy ,0
13514, a snack made out of fruits if a child sees this he might change his preferences in eating and ,4
13515," eating a chocolate bar hell eat a bar made out of fruits in a time where there are a lot of people with too much weight this is a good way to change the eating behaviour in the young ages
in conclusion there are a lot of negative ",4
13516, in advertisement for young children but there are positive ,16
13517, they are really usefull because all they do is create a society that consumes too much and ,23
13518, they can create problems between the parents and the children but ,12
13519, thing is that a child isnt at home all the time watching television because the social contact is really important in this age,17
13520,"since a child of  cant buy something itself theres no danger that a child buys something it shouldnt buy but the advert can make the children want the product
the content of the advert plays an important rule  when theres any kind of violence sexism or racism in it it should be forbidden but ",16
13521," it shouldnt be allowed anyway for everybody maybe an advert about a videogame which is not dangerous for an older child to see but a younger one shouldnt see it because it cannot differentiate between reality and fiction that the most series and movies for children are fiction the question comes up if watching television should even be allowed to a child aged under five but thats another question
  
the most adverts designed with the goal to make children desire their products are about tools to play what bad is about that is that the child wants something new even it mostly has enough things to play with that supports the consume society and probably the child was happy and content ",14
13522," but now it wants something more that it doesnt even need when a child is bored it makes up its mind and thinks of other things to play and to do and a child always will find a way to pass the time senseful adverts that promise happyness and lots of fun with their product only limit the childs natural ability to make up very creative things to play with

so ",20
13523, the advert isnt helping any child or parent but the decision what to buy make the parents theres no need to forbid the advertisment,16
13524, can sometimes be something really powerful our world is full of it ,21
13525," in the television different companies try to sell teir stuff to a various amaount of people for example an advertisment for toys is directed to a specific group of people the childrenwho are going to play with the toys but is it alright to show the advertisment to these young people 

children change their opinions every day they are trying and seeing new things every day they evolve for this reason they need an idol someone who shows them the world in a right way they should learn from their own experiences not only the parents friends or other relatives may be a huge influencetelevision advertising is ",14
13526," but is this advertising influence a good thing its not because often you get a wrong picture of ethic values for example there are rarly children in a televison advertising with black complexion and if there is one its mostly in the backgroud and not the main actor
secondly the children are going to think that they need to buy the toys andare going to ask their parents if they are going to buy it for them so basically a company who directs the television advertising toward the children are only using them to make profit 

on the other ",14
13527, children get the option to see what they could buy ,20
13528, or what they could want for christmas also they can get inspired me ,9
13529," didnt always buy the toys i wanted sometimes i made them by my own

in my opinion advertising  shouldnt be allowed the influence that it takes is just to big children have other options to get to know the world and see whats out there ",2
13530, with this statement for the following reasons reason number one is that i dont believe in capitalism meaning ,21
13531, it should be allowed at all to make advertisings in televison but thats an other discussion to discuss this topic we ,15
13532, have to make clear that i would never allow my children to watch television at the age of  with these believes i cant really ,17
13533, with advertising directly towards children ,16
13534," as young as the ones we discuss 
advertising and ",24
13535, towards children is against all of my morals and with that not enough i believe that its a crime to make profit out of naive children for example ,12
13536, that if you ask anybody on the streets if it was alright to sell something more expensive than 10 dollars to a child under the age of five that not one of the asked would say that this is morally correct thats because of the brain we human beeings have we have to learn ,12
13537, not like deers which are born and ,19
13538, can survive throughout our lives we learn and at the age of five an human beeing hasnt learned ,8
13539," what value is or how much value something has 
in conclusion everyone should ",21
13540, with me that it is wrong to sell objects to kids and even to advertise directly towards a child is unacceptable also someone who lets their children watch television at the age of five or under must be crazy,13
13541,"some people might say that directing adverts to children should be forbidden 
however why would it be bad for kids who do not have any money to buy something to see an advert about a toy it might make them want it and what is ",16
13542, bad about that in my opinion the adverts are probably not even adressed to the kids ,16
13543," they get inspired what they could give their toddlers for christmas
",20
13544, kids are confronted with advertisements too early they might get as consumption needy as our society but as i see it there is no escape out of this mentality because we are their idols and ,14
13545, we do not change our way of thinking there is no way that the ,21
13546, generation grows up differently so if you do not want that our children grow up with the same mentality as we have you could say we should ban adverts from the television ,13
13547, but what sense would that make i mean most of our companys rely on advertisments ,11
13548," they can sell enough products by banishing adverts we would just ruin most of todays factories
as i see it the only reasonable ",11
13549, for people who want advertising s kids not to be allowed anymore is that they should not let their children watch telly this might be harsh but ,13
13550, it is the only option which would work for most or ,18
13551,"who really raises the generations that were born in the era of computers roboters and selfdriving cars 
this is a good question to start to analyze the given quote
the quote might be very controversial to some of us ",8
13552," there are people who are more interested in the economy than with the education of young children 
obviously television advertising is a good way to boost the economy thanks to the big influence that the media has over our society many young children will be watching television and if children see the ad they might want watever is shown in there many parents will give in to spend money for them 
for me there is an issue with television advertising that targets a group of such a young age advertisements are not meant to support whoever is watching them but are purely selfinterested as we all know advertisements are full of details that crawl into our minds and get stuck there to manipulate us 
so if the ads are s such a fragile audience they will have a big inpact on them the ads might not just make the children want something but they might start to shape their personalities and the way they reason the children will be used to have the same opinion as the advertisements 
to be honest i strongly ",14
13553, with the quote manipulating people that cannot ,21
13554, have a real opinion is just unfair and kind of corrupt,21
13555, most of the people i know would ,19
13556, with this statement because they are afraid of electronic technology like some day the whole system could be controlled by machines which are humanmade but lets be honest television advertising  has ,10
13557, for example get those children used to systems like tv and are faster to lern new things in technology than adults who never had something like a tv in the west world electronic technology is used in nearly every activity ,8
13558," if you watched tv at a very young age you may understand better how our technology functions because in television advertising new technology is often used
otherwise it dosent seem to be good for their future the media influences people on a very high level with photoshop showing only things they want to let the people know and other ways to hide things of the real reality people who watch too often tv or children who are directed to television advertising only see the opinion of the medias they dont have the knowledge to do things by themselfes because they saw it in the tv but they didnt tried it by themselfes they possibly ",17
13559," forget to think by themselfes and realise that tv doesnt show the reality
in my opinion televsision advertising  young childern shouldnt be allowed because like this people dont do any ",14
13560,television advertising one of the most annoying things in the world whenever you are watching a movie you can be sure that in the middle of the most nerveracking scene there will be a commercial break but what happens ,10
13561," companiess direct their advertising towards a new younger age group 

honestly ",16
13562, that advertisement s young children should not be allowed i ,16
13563, with the statement above first of all i do not see the problem that should be caused by advertising secondly  ,11
13564, it does not matter whether young children see a commercial for a new toy or not because their parents are the ones who can decide whether their child will get it because they have the money to buy it and ,2
13565, i do not understand what could possibly be ,18
13566," bad about these commercials because if they are s young children they certainly have to be suited for young children

of course i am not a parent ",16
13567, i do not understand their ,3
13568, that it does not matter if companies direct their advertising towards a younger audience and i certainly beleive that this is not a controversial topic,13
13569,the advertisings have been increasing over time ,11
13570, that they nowadays they are really specific for each mankind when we talk about tv commercials their way havent change much for ages however one can say that they have ,10
13571," increased often there is a 15 minutes commerical break between the tv programms the commericals target the certain viewer the question here is if its moraly supportable to have advertisments for children between the age of  

children around the age of  are the most influentable in their early childhood they are learing to talk walk and ",14
13572, learing about their surrounding they dont even know what is good or bad ,7
13573," the law even declaires that a child only knows to judge situations around the age of eight that means that the toddlers cant jugde whether a product is good or bad for them considering all of these factors there shouldnt be any advertisments on the childrens channel but the sad truth is those childeren are the main target of the big companies a companies main goal is to have loyal longlasting cunsumers they simply dont care if the children can decide whether something is good for them or not the companies know that the children tell their parents about that new toy and they somehow persude their parents to buy it the families who can affort them spoil their children with all these goods

concluding ",14
13574, the childrens channel shouldnt have any commericals because they aim to manipulate the children with those advertisment the children face our cosum oriented society and ,14
13575, they shouldnt have to cope with that an average child between the age of two and five loses their ability to judge situations ,7
13576, they are confronted with commericals on a daily basis adding to that ,11
13577, tv advertising should be banned ,15
13578,nowadays television has a huge impact in our society the television is one of the biggest massmedia that control our society it has a huge role in our decision making and influences a lot of our actions and ideologies the biggest group that is affected by the television advertising are young children they see something in the ads  espacially toys and immediately run to their parents and want them to buy it this trick of advertising their products towards children is used by companies because children ,10
13579," young children are the easiest to manipulate 
i ",7
13580, think that the companies are faceless because the use the innocence of the children to make them believe that they need their product this is one of the reasons why children nowadays own ,2
13581, many toys because the are heavily influenced by the big toy companies and buy their products not only do they ,20
13582, own something which they dont really need but they sink into this spiral of consuming more and more especially in the virtual age we live in the children are able to purchase products through inapp purchases this leads to that the children dont realize that they did even spend the money and keep on spending more money on the companies products which ,9
13583," lead to a big surprise for the parents because they do not know about the spendings of their children on  the internet
to sum myself up i ",9
13584, think that television advertising or any sort of advertising s young children should not be allowed these children do not know the value and importance of money and dont know how to control their spendings on the internet,13
13585,"television advertising  should not be allowed

is it fair or not to include young children in television advertising are they able to realize what advertising is doing with themselves

",13
13586, it is simply not fair because young children are not able to see that the toy industry just wants to sell their products and dont care about them at all it is ,20
13587, impossible for them to see that the things showed in advertisings are not as nice in real life as they are in the aderts just because they dont even think about it they just see a toy they like and think that this toy will make them very happy because the child in the video is ,2
13588," very happy with his new toy 
but let me ask another question ",20
13589," why do we even include children in these adverts they cant buy things by their own anyway so theyll just annoy their parents the whole time until the parents are willing to make their wishes come true 

why include children out of this business if its the parents who decide to buy it ",16
13590," the adverts just show children the latest toys in the end the parents decide if they want to give a certain product to their children or not 
on top it would be unfair against companys who sell products for children all the other industrys are allowed to make their products look nice on television it is just normal to use adverts to sell your products in our society if we want to fight against things that are bad for children we should start in closing mac donalds 
and burgerking because these fast food restaurants are far more dangerous for young children they make them believe their food is good and they make their restaurants very attractive for young children in having playgrounds a clown and toys inside the happy meal this kind of advertising is worse because it destroys the childrens health and its not television advertising there are ",16
13591," good things in television advertising directed 
",10
13592," the aim of commercials is to have an effekt on the person who is watching and to create a desire to be in possesion of the promoted product but should commercials generally aim for young kids aged 

kids  that young can not decide themselfes wheater to buy the product or not still the commercial can achieve  that they wish for the product and to convince their parents to buy it

a child that is completely dependent on their parents it is in a stage whereit has to learn many new things so it is used to observe its environement this means it is way easier to influence than older kids
 
considering that ",0
13593, that television advertising  children aged  is a good idea and ,13
13594,the advertising toward young children like the statement confirms shouldnt be allowed because children are very easily manipulated the children will manipulate the parents which they see in the tv the parents to buy theme children can influens the buycomportation and choose with the parents in which mall they go the children influens ,16
13595," one below the other by seeing things that other children have they want theme too 

on the sight of the commercial this strategy will work for his buisness and he will gain much money by influensing and manipulating children they will buy his products 

my personal opinion is that the children shouldnt be influenced by this kinds of things ",0
13596, it should be a low ,18
13597, that the children are save to influence young children isnt a good thing and i wish that the state will do something against this but ,12
13598, that it will be some change in the ,21
13599," years 

but the adults are influenced too may be that no one cares otr other think that it isnt true but ",7
13600," it is because i see it by myself too 

",18
13601,in our society today we have the disadventage or the adventage of having ,21
13602," many medias already young children want to know things about them and want to use them now we have to think about it wheater it is good or not 

it is not good ",17
13603, children watch the hole day tv and forget their real life it can happen ,17
13604, their parents put their children in front of the tv to get them quiet children will not go out and enjoy the nature this can lead to a problem ,24
13605, they get older but we can not forget the adventage of televison and our modern medias you can watch documentarys and learn many things in school it sometimes is ,24
13606," used as a media to teach kidsbecause some people can learn much better in the visual way

in my opinion television is not a very bad thing you can learn many things from it but it can ",17
13607, teach you stupid things or it can give you a strange way of our reality because there are humans who do not understand that about keeping up with the kardashians is not much real thats the main problem ,6
13608, it would be good if it was not allowed for children in this age because they can not separate reality form tv i have to add that ,17
13609, the limit of five years is not enough a good way would be that children are allowed to watch tv at the age of 8 years and ,17
13610, this age they are allowed to watch tv ,17
13611," 30 minutes per day but their parents check what their children are watching 

to sum up ",1
13612, it is a good idea no to let children watch tv in this young age,17
13613,advertisement has become more and more popular recent studies showed that the average american watches several years of tvadvertisement in an average life thats a lot of time and ,10
13614," it is absolutely worth discussing witch tvavertisement should be allowed and witch ones not

13615, toddlers are great persons what a child beleves it its heart will stay there very long and it need moch effort to make the child think diffrently they beleve what you say them ,8
13616, it might not be true furthermore we live in a free country where basically every tvspot is accepted ,10
13617, it is not violating any lawsand exactly that ,19
13618," is important for brands and firms they need to have the possibility of being diffrent

but as metioned ",23
13619, toddlers developpment is to little to make a difference between real and fantasy if you let the thinking of the more i buy the luckier i am succed in them they will pobable never loose it again in addition to that they dont have any relationship to money witch makes them beleve that they can have everything ,20
13620," their parents do buy it for them that is not true but nether is it true that consuming maokes anyone happy in  the longer therm

in my oppinion tvspots for toddlers are somehow immoral and should ",2
13621, not be seen on tv it is a sign of weakness if a firm nedds to manipulate the smallest of our society just to survive or even make profits small children are worth being protected and ,12
13622, be possible for them to be educated by their parents ,8
13623," than by unperonal lying tv
",10
13624,television advertising has become quite a common way of introducing new products to the population nowadays but should young children already be confronted with such ads on the one ,14
13625," children of the age  shouldnt be watching too much tv anyways as it isnt ideal for their age group it is the parents responsibility to monitor their childs television consumption and decide if its good for their well being or not if they notice that the televison advertisements directed at their spouses isnt benefiting them and their behaviour is changing it is their job to find new activities for their children
on the other ",17
13626, some parents dont have time to constantly watch over their children and might allow them to watch short sequences of tv daily as children can be influenced very easily and are usually persistent in what they want it doesnt take a lot of advertising to plant and idea or a certain product in their head parents usually have enough to worry already  ,14
13627, they shouldnt have to be worried about advertisings changing their childs mind aswell also it can be annoying ,16
13628, children start whining about wanting something they saw on tv our society is already very fond of consumerism which i ,2
13629, find shouldnt be encouraged even more ,19
13630, not at such a young age it will make them materialistic ,24
13631, they grow up and ubable to spend their own income a reasonable way at this ,9
13632," the government should take some precautions and responsibility and stop persistent companies of directing such commercials at children 
",16
13633, such crommercials as i find them wrong and terribly bad for the mindset of such young humans it doesnt benefit very many people ,10
13634, the parents decide what will be bouoght and what not children should be able to form their own opinion about something ,12
13635, constantly having advertisements telling them what is best for them ,11
13636,"should television advertising  not be allowed

nowdays almost everyone has a tv in their home children grow up with them and can not imagine a life without a television there are a lot channels for different aged children of course there are ",15
13637," a lot of advertisment we can not imagine a channel without that so is it right to make it direct toward young children

if you watch tv and swich the channels often you will see that every ten minutes you have to watch advertisment about everything and not surprising it is everywhere the same at children channels there are ",14
13638, a lot advertisment about children things like toys and ,16
13639, on they need to do that ,19
13640, those people can make them intersted and ,19
13641, they go and buy it this is the ,3
13642," of advertising the children will get a view about things that exist and how they can have fun with things they do not have but it is important that they do not make pressure that the kids think they have to buy those things or they can not be happy it should be childfriendly that makes them happy so they should give them an oppurtunity to learn new stuff

but if they sit 24 hours in front of a screen and they can not have enough the situation can escalade very quickly the kids trust them and think they have to get all those stuff so the parents begin to buy it but they never have enough and the kid want more and more poor parents it is import to limit the quantity that the kids and parents are happy so tv advertising should watch that they say and do the right things

to sum up ",14
13643, it should not be permitted to advertise direct toward young children but we have to look that we show them the right things and do not esagerade those kids have to learn ,16
13644, much things give them the freedom  ,21
13645,you often see young children on televison they look cute and impress the people is this ,6
13646, a good experience for the young children or will they going to have problems later television advertising directed torwarted young children between  should not be allowed there are many ,16

the negative site is much longer children aged  are to young to understand and to decide that they will be seen by the whole world oftens the parents would like thaht theirson or daughter will goining to be a star they push their children all the time and forget that the children has to be protected by the parents the young children should enjoy their young life without any stress and strict plans it is ",24
13649," dangerous to present your young child on television because there are nearly the same problems like in the social network it could be that the child later get mobbed by ohter children

they are clearly more ",17
13650, against advertising direted torward young children in my oppinion it should be not allowed because it is to dangerous for such young children and they could not decide by themselves,13
13651, we have to ask ourselfs what kind of advertisement we want to forbid is an advertisement in which small children eat cereals ,13
13652, an advertising toward young children because adults could eat these cereals to ,0
13653, or do we want to forbid only advertising for toys or things like that which are clearly only meant for children actually ,16

13658, be influenced pretty well by the advertisements but its not really the same as a small child youre like a sponge everything what was told to you you immediately believe same is it with the advertisements if the clown in the tv tells you that this specific toy is the ultimate thing youve got to have you want it so this is kind of unfair because basically you can sell every kind of product to a small child because it just has no clue if its good or not it just believes you ,0

the pro ",13

13679, that television advertising  should be allowed because i believe that the final dicision is taken by the parents and if they think that there child should not have this game or something like that they should not buy it as a parent you have to stay strongly by your opinion because if you do not defend your on decision you will have lost all your impact on your child ,13
13680,television without advertising seems utopian you can not even watch half an hour ,10
13681," getting irrited by high volume and special effects ads who want you to buy a specific produt but what about ads towards young children should it be banned

some people argue that those ads should be banned because they harm the cildren in different ways one of them is ",16
13682, that those chidren have no option to realize if a product is healthy or not or if they are any ,23
13683," is that a study has indicated that children are getting focused on brands and their products like passivly manipulted they even buy this product probably more often than others others arg


all in all this is a very controversial topic personally i understand people who wants this ads banned but i ",2
13684, think that a well educated child should be able to manage their income and nutrition by themselves ,12
13685,"televison advertising  children should not be allowed

in our socity the televison is a commen thing who dont have a televison at home anymore 
a study shows that in switzerland 80 of the people had a televison at home also much more children sits on the coach and watch tv the televison ",14
13686," a lot of advertising  children aged 
now we have to ask us if this should be allowed or not

if kids see advertising for children they could not know that advertising is often just for making money for the companies and often what they promise in the adverstising is unreal so they get a wrong view 
also ",16
13687," the children see all the stuff which the companies want to sell they want these things too but the family cant effort all these things the children get an unrealistic expection from the reality

but they could ",2
13688, dream a little bit of the things they see in the televison advertising and that could ,10
13689, televison advertising  should not be forbidden ,15
13690, the children should have the opotunaty to dream of the things they see in the tv but ,17
13691, that it should have less advertising in tv  children because it shouldnt have too much influence in the lives of the children,13
13692,if youre a parent you might have cought yourself watching a kids tv show with your kids maybe you ,6
13693, comapred your childhood to your childrens childhood and you probably came to the conclusion that you didnt have any tv shows at all or if you did ,6
13694, they were more fun out of your ,18
13695," of view  however many people often think that todays tv shows which are created for children are not as good anymore and dont have much meaning in the stories like they used to have

coming from a childhood with way less technology around than today and having all these memories where you played outside all summer with your friends it can feel pretty unastisfying seeing children today hanging on their parents phones tv shows make children feel attached to specific characters in the show what makes them want to watch it everytime it comes on but is there any space left for their own fantasies if its always already kind of premade because if parents or family members dont interact enough with the child it wont ever get the chance to have a chance to speak their fantasies out loud reading a story to a child would be much better than n just leaving it sitting in front of the tv because ",6
13696," stories are read to the child there is way more contact between the child and family member also the child can get used to seeing letters and how theyre pronounced an early contact with written words will help children to learn how to read much faster
on the other ",8
13697, theres shows that are considered to be not funny or without meaining for any age group ,6
13698, why not for young children ,4
13699, parents can always check on their children for what show theyre watching and even make a list of tv shows that the child is allowed to watch and ,17
13700," forth 
something that comes with watching tv shows on the tv is ads and as we all know many brands chose to have some kind of animal that is their brandanimal it has been proved that ",10
13701, brands chose an animal to be on their packages or ads people will feel more comfortable with the brand because it seems like you can be friends with the animal which ,11
13702, leads to the end product that you are more likely to keep this particular brand in mind now think about what happens ,23
13703," you show these kind of ads between tv shows that are for kids they are even more likely to be influenced without them noticing obviously

in conlusion tv show dont have to be a bad thing if it isnt consumed too much parents can make sure that the children are only watching shows that they have seen themselves or which they of that theyre not bad",14
13704, this theme verry difficult to discuss because i havent really a opinion ,21
13705, that a tv programm shouldnt have many influence of the kids because it is difficult to find a ritght programm so it is verry dificult than the televission advertising can have wrong influence to a kid so i can agrre or desagree because ,14
13706," it is a theme which i never discuss with myself 





",21
13707,it should not be allowed because television adversiting is made by psychologists and theyre aiming at manipulating the consumer a young child has not developped his mind enough to recognize the manipulation and ,14
13708," it has no chance to defend itself from the adversiting its very unfair towards the children because as they grow older they are kinda drilled to consume the products from the adversiting as an example we could take coca cola coca cola highlights the bottle by making the picture black and white and only the bottle colourful a young child only sees the bottle its focused and the child has no idea why so thats where the manipulation starts if the child sees this picture over and over again it will get used to it and see coca cola as something normal something that belongs in his life something he has discovered and heshe now loves it 

on the other ",2
13709," you could say that its necessary for a company to manipulate its consumers if theres a lot of other companies dominating the market its a strategy to get the consumer used to its products and gain profit

in my opinion it shouldnt be allowed the idea of gaining profit and manipulating consumers only to achieve something thats motivated by the human greed isnt going to bring us any ",23
13710," its an idea straight from the capitalistic economy structures it doesnt learn our kids anything they even want our kids to be not thinking consumers so why should we let the companies manipulate our children 

",12
13711," that nowadays television advertising is a normal thing everyone who watches television gets in touch with it but should it be allowed to be 

television advertsing is a popular way to catch our attention young children ",15
13712," watch television which is why they get confrontated with the advertising too this is a good thing for the people who advertise because if children see something they like they tell their parents and the parents buy it furthermore they should get in touch with advertisments because if they want to watch television they have to watch the advertisings too 

on the other ",0
13713, it is not good if children see an advertisment for things like chocolate or any other kind of sweets because they would want to buy it ,16
13714, it is not healthy for them advertisments often do not tell the truth ,11
13715," kinder schokolade they say their chocolate is healthy because it conatins milk and nuts we know that it is not true but young children believe what the advertisments tell them and get fooled 

in conclusion ",2
13716, that it should be allowed because ,21
13717, it is a normal thing they will get confrontated with it anyways ,19
13718, why not at the age of two they can learn to not believe in everything the advertising promises and the earlier they learn it the better ,2
13719, that if they watch television they should ,17
13720, they grow up there will be television advertising directed to them too,24
13721, something bad the only reason they were created was to increase the comsuming society the persons who make those thing want to see their production growing up and thats a normal thing in the world we live the problem is that they are making advertisments for the kids too its not something that is acceptable the kids are to young to realize that what is on the screen isnt real if only they could do realistic advertisment it wouldnt be ,2
13722," bad but everything that we see on these short videos are wrong maybe not completly wrong but they make the thing better and nicer that in the reality the kids could be influenced by such a thing they began to think of things that arent real they look at and they want those things just because it looks cool or because the video was funny they cant have their own mining about it 

those advertisments are just a lost of time and are dangerous for the childrens 


",16
13723, that television advertising  should not be allowed becaus ,15
13724, i think a child in age of two dont even have to look tv second a child in age of two plays one day with a toy and the ,17
13725, day it isnt anymore intrested parents dont have to buy toys becaus their children saw it on tv a little girl wants everything that is pink doesnt care what it is little children dont know what is good for them and waht not their parents have to say what is good for their children children in this age have to play outside and creat their own toys with their friends in the tv looks everything much better its expensive and not good quality one week is a barbie in the television advertising and in the ,20
13726, week a ball witch can change the collors and the barbie is already history the childrens cry for the barbie to get it and ,18
13727, the parents finaly buy it they dont care ,9
13728, a few days if there would be no television advertising for young children they wouldnt need this things becaus they never heard about it the children in age of two cant buy the toys becaus the have no money ,20
13729," their parents have to buy it if the children cant buy it the advertising shouldnt be for young children they should go out and play with trees animals nature and their friends children should learn new friends knowand not seat in front of a tv
 ",2
13730,"actually the advertising for products which are concepted for these young children is not for these young children its for their parents the children cant buy the products anyway because theyre too young and dont have any money or anything so why would someone say that this type of advertising should be banned
i have two ideas either the children shouldnt see these advertised products because the parents will get annoyed by them wanting all the new stuff they saw in the television advert or the children should be raised without having to watch all these dumb adverts because they may influence them in a bad way
but ",13
13731," bad because if you are a parent not wanting your children to be influenced by all these adverts you should just stop them from watching tv advertising its very simple 
there are many strange things being advertised in the televsion nowadays and it would be unfair if firms who make toys and other stuff for young children would be banned from tv but all these perverted dating sites have no trouble at all the advertising is for the parents anyways because the children cant buy anything in the ",16
13732, why ban something that harmless or if not harmless that easy to avoid as advertising for children in a world with ,16
13733," many much more fucked up things 
i think this question is of no importance seeing ",18
13734, many much more horrible things going on on the planet than advertising for young childrenits like comparing a death of a close friend to a spilled cup of tea,16
13735,the television and the big concerns use promotions and television advertisings to get the attention of people the promotions show the product and for what it is used for they are often loud coloury and catching ,10
13736," you want to have the product too but should televison advertisings directet toward children be allowed 
adults if they se a promotion know what they need what it is udes for and if its unnecessery for their life they have expierience and can decide if they want to spend their money on this product or not 
kids or children dont have this expierence they want to have things that are loud funny and coloury so they feel very attractet to things wich are promoted in the television espiecally things to play with children dont know what it means to earn money and to have the contingency to buy things you like 
they are bored with old things and alway want to have new things and ",14
13737," if they see a product they want to play with they are going to ask their parents for it if it isnt a big thing the parents would probably say yes to it but if they feel like its unnecessery they will say no the kid is going to be crying and disappointed 
so the concerns used it to lock the childs attention and the feeling to play with it the concerns dont care if the parents have money for it and if the family has a good wealth they want to earn money and thats it 
",2
13738, promotions for things like musicals festivals films etc are allowed because its more easily to decide if someone likes it or not but promotions for kid products usally dont tell the truth they are over produced and just use the naivity of children   ,16
13739,the television a place infron of which a lot of people spend their freetime not only adults but young children too these minors sit infront of that evolutionary box because their parents placed them infront of it ,17
13740, they were too busy to look ,19
13741," their own kids 

adverts something that influences mankind strongly not only in their thinking wise but in what way they handle stuff and in what they say you dont only find adverts in newspapers and on billboards but on tv too advertising changes your state of mind and persuades you to buy things youve never planned on buying but mostly television advertising  children are about toys so if a child sees a new lego car in the tv it naturally will want it because it looks ",0
13742, cool in tv and everybody has it at least thats what the advert says the kids will beg their parents to buy them the new oh ,20
13743, cool toy and they will cry over it for hours until ther parents ,20
13744," cant hold their cool anymore give in and buy the thing their child wants 

so this brings the following question upon us sould television advertising  young chidren aged  be allowed or not  

in the last paragraph i told you reasons why it shoulndt and ",13
13745," it can be said that companies try to sell their stuff even already to kids their manipulation is already  people of a young age but thats what the selling business relies on manipulation into buying more and more things 

so ",2
13746, im not completely against tv advertising  children aged  adverts are something todays market relies on and the adverts ive been talking about might be seen by young children but ,16
13747, they are mainly meant to influence the parents so if this kind of advertising would be prohibited ,16
13748," all kind of adverts would have to be forbidden and thats just not the world live in the economy sector would not work without advertising
",15
13749,"television advertising toward young children

young children are learning a lot in early years they basically pick up everything they see and it stays in their memorys so is it really a good idea to let children watch advertisements on television

as told ",14
13750, young children learn very cuickly and ,8
13751," it comes to languages 
so hearing lots of speaking would possibly help them with getting more confortable with speaking their language 

depending on the education they receive of their parents children can be tought that they wont get everything they want from seeing all the advertisements for example ",0
13752," a child sees lots of advertisements of toys and it wants them all it is the parents task to not buy them everything 

buying the children all the things they see in the advertisement leads them to be spoiled and you later may recognize that as a bad ",2
13753," of their characters 

an advertisement that shows stupid content can ",11
13754, influence children in a bad way they cant decide ,7
13755, what is true and what is wrong ,21
13756, they may believe wrong content which wont help them ,7
13757," it comes to education

in my opinion letting children watch advertisements isnt the best thing for them watching television ",13
13758," has to be done in the right measure if they spend to much time in front of the television they wont learn some really important things like knowing the nature
i am lucky that my parents always told me to brush my teeth during the advertisement shown in the serie i always watched ",17
13759,"television advertising for children could be a way to more independence and responsibility or it could be a bad influence for them

firstly television advertising is a method to influence people into buying something so that means you need money now if you make television advertising  you want them to buy something right but ",14
13760," they would have to understand what it is about im not sure if a two years old undertands that even if the child would understand it how will it buy the product it cant the parents would have to do that i dont believe parents would want to buy whatever the child wants

secondly ",20
13761, you have money to buy yourself products you are more independent if we could and would teach this earlier to our children maybe they would use their money more responsible later on they would learn how to use the money given to them and not to throw it out of the window ,9
13762," using it for drugs alcohol etc it might help them to focuse on other things and not to feel controlled all the time by their parents 

in conclusion they could turn out to be more responsible but if they have that much independence early in life they wouldnt get to know the limits they just learn how to buy things whatever they want its a possibility to get addicted to this and ",4
13763," that parents want shopaholics as their children

in the end i do not believe its a good way to learn how to be more responsible with money children that little do not understand all that is going on in the advertisers and they could not buy the product the possibility of them getting addicted to shopping or just being irresponsible with money is just to high of a risk ",2
13764,everytime we are watching tv there is some advertising we all know the situation ,10
13765, the film we are watching is interruped on its best scene just for about ten minutes of advertisement but we are adult people ,6
13766, we are used to it but it really shocks me ,19
13767, i see my little child watching tv an ,17
13768, there comes a advertisement for caprisonne and the little girl there tells her dad that she wants to go to school as supergirl so her dad agrees and gives her a caprisonne and ,18
13769, time i go to the market my daugther asks me to buy her caprisonne ,9
13770," that she can go to school as supergirl so is the advertisement towards young cildren a good idea
no it is a bad idea in this world advertisement is everywhere so the earlier they get used to it the better because ",0
13771, they can lern that it isnt all that correct what they tell in advertisements and anyway you can not avoid children to see them because they are a part of television nowadays you would have to create a law that forbids advertisement in the tv shows of children but that would not be a guarant that they do not see any of those because ,13
13772, they are watching a film with their parents they may ,1
13773, see some advertisement so we should ,11
13774, decide a law that is forbidding children to watch tv what i think is as complicatet to do as the otherone ,12
13775," i dont think that the people  would ever confirm to such a law
they are ",19
13776, learning to not believe all the things that are said in television and to think more critic about our world that could ,6
13777," help us to grow a more critic generation who is able to create a better civilisation
yes it should be banned because these advertisements are telling the young people how to live and ",15
13778, they are not open to find their own way anymore because they always see some hetero peoples and ,3
13779, they think that they have to be just like them and ,3
13780, they do not even see the gayway of live it could ,19
13781, developp eating disorders because the young gils want that bad to be like th ones in the advertisement that they start to maybe throw up ,2
13782, havin eaten or to stopp eating anymore so these advertisements are killing our young generation and we as the generation of parents schould do anything we can to keep them save ,13
13783," i say it would be alll correct to bann the advertisement s children
my own opinion is parted because ",16
13784, that it would be helpfunl to bann,21
13785,"should television advertising be  aged 

television advertising is advertisement on the television which can be broadcasted any time a day advertisement is used to inspire people to buy things or to react to politicsor ",15
13786," children at the age of  are not able to build up their own opinion because their to young children do what they want or what they are told to in these young years of their lifes

advertisement is only good if the content is ",2
13787," helpful for these children for example what every parent wihes for is an intelligent child so if the kid watches television and an advertisement for a laptop comes on and they see how much fun these children in the atvertise have they want to have it too what the child doesnt realize is that the laptop has the function to teach how to count how to read and has games to train addition of numbers in 
the best case the child goes to the parent and they buy it

but as you can tell in the former example the child just wants to have it because he sees how much fun other childern have with it and not because of its functions and thats the problem cildren at the age of two or five can be easily influenced by the background of an advertise they just want to have what looks fun so ",2
13788, a laptop which teaches you useful things it ,18
13789," could have been a violent game

",19
13790, children shouldnt be watching a lot of television they should be out and play in the sand and their friends children shouldnt be influenced by andvertisement ,14
13791, young first of all they need to learn to have an own opinion,7
13792,"television advertising is for this technology world we live today completly normal the most poeple even dont know how it was whithout advertising maybe its okey that we elder people see advertising daily because we are already grown up and can decide on our own how we react about it but is it good that we try to manipulate young children with television advertising 

first ",14
13793, have a look at the ,18
13794," its time we lose for making advertising for children because they dont understand the message of the advertising
we talk about very young children aged  ",16
13795," just this statement is sick 

of course childre are easylier to manipulate them with ",7
13796, children dont see the television advertisings as we see them they dont know if its true or false what they say in the television and because they believe it all they want to want to buy the barbie doll witch you can feed ,2
13797, they have 3 others at home or ,19
13798, youre in a store and your child wants to buy the chocolate chip cookie instad of a healthy joghurt because they saw it on tv  so that the television advertising  have a big influence in the life of the children and ,0
13799, parents because they have to pay it ,9
13800," 
also small children cant see the difference of a television series and a televisoin advertising they think the film or series is ",6

so that they become to new targets of markenting every company does them and tries to get you tu buy their product in our capitalistic world you have to do this to survive as a company but ",23
13802," children should not be part of this because they want to get to the money of the parents and the children are just a way to get to it  
also i have to mension that parents can control it in a way they can do rules ",12
13803, that the children do not watch television all day long and ,8
13804," they arent effected by the television advertisings 
so that ",10

young cjildren are growing physically and physisch not just their bodys develop themselves ",13
13807, their brains are in one of ,19
13808, process of life children want to explor the world they are  fascinated of the environnement and animals they love to play with other children outside spending time with their parents and siblings is such an important thing in their lifes which should be saved fot the rest of their lifetime so why should their be any advertising  ,0
13809," they arent used to watch television
 stay at home  ",17
13810, watching television isnt that good for children  ,17
13811, for the younger ones in reality is this the most common activity of younger children why parents let their kids doing something like that isnt understandable maybe they are to lazy do play or entertain them or just havent any time  the problem is that children who watch television soaps are doing nothing  they are inactive and are just consuming stuff the affecting of childrens from all this consummed television shows is giant they influence them in their opinion and in their young  personality as usually children want to improve the big ones they want to be like their parents neighbours  just like any older person which are included in their life children arent abel to see the diffrence between good and bad personalities it is not a bad thing at all but it shows as how important it is with whom children are going through this very sensitive part of life advertising will creat desires we can not say if they will affect the little ones good or bad ,14
13812, but we can expect most of the people would say they will not and ,19
13813, i parents should decide what if their children are needy and what exactely they need to can not live whitout it advertising just make unimportant desires,2
13814,first of all im not sure if children aged  are even interested in television commercials ,14
13815," they just want to watch their childrentvseries and nothing else
for the case that the kids would pay attention to the advertisingsthey could get manipulated very easy because young humans always belive everything without doubting it if there is a superman commercial which tells yout that this plastic superman has superpowers the children will believe it because they dont know how to separate reality from fantasy or imaginations after the little kids have watched like five different commercials they want to have all of the toys and stuff that they just saw on the screen in this case parents would be pressured by their respective children to buy all those things immediately so the parents are know struggling with themselves wheter they should buy all the toys for their kids and make them happy even ",2
13816, they know that they dont have enough money or that their children will lose their interest in this toys ,20
13817," maybe just one month of playing with them or dont buy all this stuff and make their kids crying for days and being called rude parents in the entire neighbourhood
because of the ",20
13818, that the parents of young children would have such a dilemma at home ,9
13819, for myself that television advertising should be forbidden through out daytime broadcasting in my opinion the television channels could be allowed to present children advertising during primetime broadcasting because at this time there are just older people watching like adults and teenagers if they would see a good children commercial they could find an idea for a birthday or a christmaspresent for their little children whitout being pressured from all possible ,13
13820,"television advertising  aged tow of five should not be allowed

children in age of  do not know what the advertising in television want all what children see in televisison they want to have but it can not be not allowed for companis because afterwords we do not know which new toys there are and than no advertising should be allowed and not just advertising for children

first of all they are to young to know why companis make television advertising it should be not allowed because companis know how to make children that they want this new toy as an parent you can not say no because there children sees other children how have this new toy and they do not understand why that they do not can have this

altough we all felt in a advertising once we can not say the companis that they it is not allowed to make television advertising also adult know the feeling if they see something new when adults eat something new they want to know how to cook it so it is normal that we always want the new one but without advertising there is no market so we can not not allowed it if we have a compani we ",13
13821," want that others buy much of our stuff

to sum up i think it is a problem from the parents they should look that there children do not watch as much television that they see ",17
13822, look that there children appreciat what they have but not just children should be careful ,12
13823, adults have to be careful to not fell in ba an advertising,16
13824,directed advertising television toward children is not that bad because in their future they will be watching the televisions ,14
13825, they cant help it but see it in their young age espacially ,3
13826, their older siblings are already watching the television so ,1
13827, they come by and see them doing or better watching ,3
13828," to them and watch with them because i think older siblings are like idols for yonger siblings 

although those positive ",1
13829, i think it should not be allowed because children in that age are exploring the world life and starting to question everything but ,12
13830, their in frot of the television they might think that the answers that they get from the television might be right well very often those answers arent right because its the television and they often say a lot of things that arent really rightjust to earn money as everyone know well every adult because they already experienced a lot of thing in their childhood and that wasnt from the television that they get to know all that stuff no from playing in the garden get hurt ,3
13831, think that it shouldnt be allowed because they could watch things that they shouldnt see like prostitution or more vulgar movies or series so they start to question it and i dont think that it is a good age with  to know that stuff there are ,12
13832, a lot of movies where an age is ,6
13833, says if you can watch it or not like it says 16 ,6
13834, you have to be sixteen to see it and i think thats a good thing ,6
13835, it is unterteilt in certain sections but a really inportant ,21
13836, is that children aged  cant alway read of corse there are some kids that can but practically always they cant so perhaps their parents or older siblings arent at home and ,24
13837," they will see those things because they couldnt read the warning
so what i would say to the parents of young children parents always be there for your children",12
13838,young children are very naive and dont have their own opinion ,7
13839," they have to get some things teached befor they are ready for this world and they have to get a certain amount of maturity but until they have this maturity they are very influencable influencing a child in a bad way is wrong but isnt this exactly what tv adds are doing

well it depends on many factors first of all is the adversment influencing the child in a wrong way influening s child isnt allways just wrong you have to influence a child somehow  most people call it parenting that isnt wrong you have to influence a child to teach him whats good and bad so if the add doesnt infleunce the child in a ady way ",7
13840," its totaly okay 

but adds arent allways good for a child getting a kid to buy toys just because it was super cool in the adversement isnt right and brainwashing them with some propaganda adds political adds is even worse 

in genereal the lack of expirience and the innocents of a child shouldnt be used against them you cant ban all adds from tv but you can ",14
13841, young children cant be influenced in a bad way and if you cant do that because of the freedome of speech its allways the parents decision if their children should watch tv and see these adds  ,13
13842,"should television advertising  be illegal

13846, they are not watching it there is no problem what ,19
13847," say with that is that parents are responsible what their children are watching 

advertisements should be s adult people anyways these people are the one with the money and the one who will eventually purchase a certain item or tool so ",13
13848, it is a clever move to make advertisements directed to adults ,16
13849," than little children but it shouldnt be illigel to make advertisments for children

im not a big fan of too many prohibits and advertisemetns are not harming anyone the only problem i see is that the children will start to complain that they want a certain game they have seen in a specific advertisement but good parents will get over this situation 

",16
13850,today it is normal that television advertising is commmon and in every break of a film ,10
13851," there are a lot of advertisings for some people it is interesting for other just disturbing but how is it for young children do they look interested to them or dont they understand anything therefore should they be forbidden for them or not

first i want to talk about what the television advertising contains some are just about clothes or some new eating stuff the producer make this kind of advertising to get as much as possible publicity ",14
13852, they can sell the new stuff to the people thats one of the easiest way to get to the peolpe other advertisings are about new store which have to get public than there are ,11
13853, advertisings about health they tell you about how you can live as healthy as possible or the advertisings talk about health asegurations then there are the advertising who want to show you how thin you can be or how you can find the love of your life and ,11
13854," there are the disgusting one this kind of advertisings are about strippers sex or sextoys

do the parents want their children watch this kind of advertising
",16
13855, luckily most advertising that are disgusting came late in the night ,11
13856," the children should be sleeping thats why theres no problem if the young children watch advertisings theres nothing dirty and they dont understand most advertising
but because of advertisings the children could get a bad immage maybe ",16
13857, they see every time really thin models in the advertisings they want to be ,3
13858, they grown they dont know nothing else they learn ,8
13859," a lot of wrong stuff and honestly advertisings are unusable they dont make you more intelligent they just manipulate you

thats why ",11
13860, that for young children should be forbidden to watch advertising they manipulate our children from the ,13
13861, no matter if they understand them or not because passing the time they will understand them but they wouldnt see that theyre getting manipulated in my opinion advertisings are somesting for adults and they shouldnt be shown in children channels,16
13862,advertisements can be utterly exasperating ,11
13863, watching ones favorite tv series but ,1
13864, we might think they have no effect on us they fill us with considerable subliminal information that influences our ways of seeing this specific product and other daiily life matters ,11
13865, and if it does that to us adults and teenagers we can only fathom the effect it has in our youngest generation my personal opinion is that children in such an early stage in their lives should spend as less time in front of a rectangular screen as possible and figure out how everything works be it a toy or their own body now coming to the matter of television advertising directed directly toward children of that specific age group such ads can have a ,14
13866, negative effect on the children they see some older kids playing with toys or presenting the product of the ad and they crave ,0
13867, very same item children can become extremel spoilt once they see children slightly older to use the product in the ads or even worse ,2
13868, they see that even their friends now bought that very toy if the parents dont ,20
13869, on buying it the child will be offended and it influences their character in later life id ,2
13870, have the chlildren find out where their interests lie gaining a few experiences that makes it clear to them what they like and what they dont and knowing that ,8
13871, deciding on their own what theyd like to buy ive seen plenty of children on which such ads have had enormous effect on how they act and think and i feel like we should move towards a world in which we try to prevent such things from happening what parents could do now is to lessen the amount of time their child spends with the television maybe even let them watch dvds ,14
13872,this subject had been often discussed if young children should watch television or not ,17
13873, it depends in wich country we are in some countries there isnt a problem with that in other thats a big problem first of all ,19
13874, the young children have better things to do than watching television the time youre spending on the television is a time wasted the young children should go out and paly with other children when i was young i always went outdoors and played with the children in the street the chidlren who are ,17
13875, much time on the television an other suspect is physical i mean the young children they watch tv ,17
13876, close on the screen and this isnt good for the eyes they are really fragile and its not worth to damage them because the chidlren want to watch television for example a friend of mine in the young age he had really problems with his eyes and his parents didnt know what it was  ,1
13877, they went to the doctor and and ,18
13878," five minutes  the doctor said if my friend would watch a lot of televisionbecause the lightning of the screen isnt healthy for our eyes since than my friend really stopped watching series or something else instead he went more often out with his friend or he read a lot thats why he became today a very good writer maybe one day hes gonna be a very good journalist like i mentionned the young children coud read books and do something in their lifes which they can profit of 
on the other ",6
13879, the children can learn from television it ,17
13880, depends what youre watching or which serires for example there is one serie it called dorie and there can chidlren learn speaking english or some sentences so it doesnt have to be always bad for the children and ,6
13881, just the parents have to look ,9
13882, their children that they have ,9
13883,when youre watching television you often can see spots or advertising with children where they have to present a product this can start in a very young age ,0
13884," with two years athough it looks very sweet is it good and fair for the children
when a child is ",9
13885, young it cannot decide whether it wants to do that or not the parents think they know what good for their child is and say what it has to do it doesnt matter if it wants to do it or not the children which have to be part of a spot arent often happy with doing it but they dont have a choice critics say it isnt good for them ,4
13886," they have to do something they dont like to children should do what makes fun and shouldnt be working in a studio for someone they dont know
in the television you cant see how it really is you just see a perfect life and moment but this isnt real in reallife the children arent happy with it and must do it ",17
13887," they dont want to its just a fake image in the television advertising which persuade people to buy something they dont need
the good thing about it is that they get many experiences by doing it they can do such cool and funny things and not just very normal and boring activities they do the rest of their time for the person who wants to sell something its very good because a lot of people which see the advertising think its very sweet and usable ",3
13888, they buy it you can get a lot of money ,23
13889," you sell something by using a sweet child 
",9
13890, definitive with the statement that this advertising should be forbidden for me children with the age of  are to young to be in the television and to work in a studio when i was a child i enjoyed it to be outdoor or to play with someone else in my age i would never like to make advertising or do whats other people say i should do the television should definitive stop with showing their audience a fake world where everything is ,13
13891, perfect in reallife the things arent ,18
13892, perfect and peaceful and the children arent ,19
13893," happy with it and do this voluntarily
children should have fun and play something and shouldnt do advertising because it isnt good and enjoyable for them",16
13894,the influence of advertisment on kids ist horrible you can really controll their opinion ,16
13895, for trend wishes and shopping wishes thats how the most kids trends began and this trends are allways huge thats the same ,20
13896, why u should allowed to show the clips the kids are an importent market to sell when thy grow up with their mind spread with those things there used to it and dont want live without that thats why the stuff will be long on the market and a good selling thingfor the one who sells the things with those clips its important that it stays allowed to show advertisment for the kids and their parent it make to go shopping ,16
13897, much harder if the kids are really in the stuff you cant bring them away from this ,9
13898, advertisment is usefully for the stores but not fair for the kids because they cant diffrengiate the advertising and what the seller want they just like it and want it and thats really really dangerous because we dont know why the stores exactly sell the stuff to kids and maybe they do bad things to them thats why ,0
13899, advertising should be not allowed,15
13900,"should the television advertising  be allowed 
this questions is very tricky to answer because there are on ",15
13901," for and against the advertising
if a advertsinig with young children should gets directed ",16
13902, you need the okay from hteir parents and if they ,9
13903, with the plans of the directors there should be no problems but it ,19
13904, can be that the parents have not enough money and dont want it but have to  and ,9
13905," there are huge discussions
on the one ",21
13906, is an television advert with babys more cute or brings the message for a product more to the customers ,0
13907, just a slogan but the baby knows at that time not what its going to do and this is a very important ,8
13908, for this discussion the parents must give the okay but do they really know that their child is going to be exposed for all people around hte world who do watch this advert  but i ,16
13909, think that the adverts with babys are no danger for the childrens future because they just walk around and look cute ,16
13910," not that good as other ones
im not an expert in television advertising with young children but in my opinon this television advertising shouldnt be taken that serious as the critics do at the end no one gets hurt and everyone gets their peace and ",0
13911, this television advertising  kids should stay like it is now and shouldnt be changed because the way it is now is a good one,13
13912,"television advertising for children between  

every kids teenagers and the rest of the people love to watch television and on the tv we dont only watch movies and news there are ",14
13913," advertisment so should children between two and five years old watch advertisment

firstly watching a food advertisment makes a child to eat somethingfor example if there is a new lindt chocolate advertisment on tv and your son or daughter is watching it i am sure that this child has appetite to eat one of these chocolates most of the kids are starting to cry because they want a chocolate right now and that is a problem

secondly most of the advertisment are about toys while the chiildren are watching tv the parents be sure that their child want to have one of these toys for example ",14
13914, you are going shopping with your child your child will  see the teddy bear trom the advertisment by the way children have a very good memory as ,20
13915, the child will pick the teddy bear and ask daddy and mummy if they could buy for him most of the parents will say no how will the situation looks like this child will start to cry and makes a lot of noise in the shop so you cant slap your son or daughter ,20
13916," you are forced to do something 

finally there are ",19
13917, advertisments which arent thought for children for example an advertisment about how to shave your legs why should your child look this advertisment my friends sister i think she is four years old once ,16
13918, the parents went to work the girl was alone with my friend at home while my friend was in her room the girl went to the bathroom and took the racer out of the cupboard suddenly my friend heard that something fell down she run to the bathroom and the she saw her sister with a racer in the ,18
13919," and the racer gel on the floor 

",18
13920, kids watch advertisment they try things out and get in trouble which isnt nice in my opinion all children ,2
13921, 5 years old are allowed to watch ads but under the age of ,16
13922,"today we ask the quesion should tv advertising towards young children be forbidden 
a fact that is for this statement is that young children should be involved in such things ",13
13923," young children can be easesly manipulated for someones needs and advertising could be seen as something similar to manipulating the main reason of advertising is to convince the consumer to buy their product so children could be heavely affected by this and because many parents often try to fullfill every wish of their kids they are affected by it too
a point wich speaks against this statement are the basics of economicliberation almost every western country has free economics you cant just forbid the companies to make advertisments its clear that the companies have to let their costumers know what products they have and convince them in every way possible every company has to do that for surviving and that the economic system can work
we ",16
13924, have to talk about the actual problem of this topic the problem isnt the ,21
13925, that there are advertisments for children the real problem here is that parents let the kids get affected by something like that because they let them look tv too long we wouldnt have this problem ,13
13926, parents wouldnt let their chilren look tv all day long so its nonsense to sarch the ,17
13927," in the companies 
and the last ",23
13928, states my oppinion towards this topic when parents complain that their children get affected by tv advertisments too heavely its just pushing the debths from them parents should just reduce the tv consume of their children and the problem would be gone so in my oppinion the question should be different and the ,14
13929, to the problem should be searched elsewhere,18
13930,advertising is a common thing on all platforms ,11
13931," on the web on television or even in real life with advertising platforms can offer more to a cheaper price everyone gets a piece of the cake advertisments always reffer to a certain ageclass even advertisements directed  are common

young children look tv solely to be entertained and not to be advertised advertising uses people for their purpose ads wants people to buy children do not know what they are watching they dont know that an ad is an ad so they get brainwashed in a way these children ",2
13932, ask their parents to buy so in a way the ads use the children to make the parents buy stuff all this could lead to a bad relationship between the children and the parents and even to ,0
13933," the child could start to feel alone and might grow up in hatred just because of advertisments

",16
13934, with the statement television advertising shouldnt be allowed to be s young children because they are not old enough to understand what advertising is about and how it works raising up a child is already hard enough for the parents and it should not be influenced by others,13
13935,if young children should be the target of advertisments is a very crucial and debatable topic people that are against it tend to say that already at an very young age children get influenced by big advertisment companies the children can often be easily manipulated and the resulsts are that the parents need to spend money on products that the children mostly dont need and the joy wont even last for long cause these children same as the adults will fall for newer and better products ,16
13936, they come out and they wont be able to have enough and wil never stop craving for bigger better and newer products children shouldnt be influenced and manipulated at this very young age they should be playing outside socialize and being educated and not a consumer victim at the age of 5 by not knowing what exactly it means to buy spend money and own a product those children that are targeted will get a bad understanding of earning owning and buying on the other ,2
13937, we live in a consumer world where our needs get mostly fullfilled by products which is debatable if its good but thats how we work so shouldnt those children be confronted with the true world at an young age the learn how to live with it they could develop skills and a feeling at an very young age what advertisments really are and getting a better understandning of products and advertisments in a faster grwoing world it seems logical that children should be confronted with the ups and downs and start to learn about them and how to  live with them nevertheless children should be allowed to be children to play learn and have fun and not being influenced by big companies at the age of four what those companies do is brainwashing by using nice colors sounds and children to play in the commercials at this young age the children dont have an understanding of what theyre watching and that what theyre watching should make them buy stuff because of this and many other reasons i highly discourage the advertisment of young children aged ,2
13938,in our generation social media television and ,10
13939," with all that advertising is very popular companies target diffrent age groups depending on the products they are trying to sell it is a very popular buisness nowadays should it tough be allowed to target young children with television advertising 

with technology always progressing and nowadys in many families ",14
13940, parents having full time jobs it is quite comman for young children to often sit in front of the television companies can easily profit from a situation like this and advertise specific products directly to the interested children i seems perfectly planned out the parents have very little time with their full time jobs ,14
13941, it would be ideal for the children to choose their own toys and items that they want ,20
13942," they can be always be intertained

many ",19
13943, believe that television advertising is very bad because it would prove and  show that in our society more children are sitting infront of their tvs all day this would make them a perfect target for advertising parents do not have the time to intertaine their own children ,14
13944, the television does that for them many ,3
13945," fear that television advertising could expose children to certain topics far to advanced for their age and knowledge 

i ",14
13946, believe television advertising is not per say bad i do believe ,15
13947, that perents have should have a strict overview of what they let their children watch i ,12
13948, believe that this topic just show how little time pernts have for theit children and how little attention they give them so personnaly television advertising wouldnt be a topic it perents would just do more with their children like ,14
13949,television is a big part of our childhood and ,17
13950, is advertisement parents hate it because it causes exhausting fights against crying children wanting that one product they saw in tv but is it reasonable to not allow advertisement  every parent taking part of this discussion would be screaming yes loudly heavily relieved if they let their children watch spongebob they always have to check wether the ad is already over or not to avoid the exhausting drama of kids wanting new stuff all over the time it would be ,14
13951, much easier without this stupid ad but lets be honest we live in a world full of advertisement the tv is only a small part of all those firms wanting us to buy their stuff wherever we go theres always ad and we are ,10
13952, used to this that we dont even look at all those placards writings and short video clips its an illusion if you want to bring up your children wihtout the affection of advertising and i know it might be very hard for parents stopping their children from wanting everything but its ,16
13953, the tv that is the main problem if you take your child shopping once it will be horrifying to walk past all this choccolate without buying any ,20
13954, everyone stares at you because your child screams loudly we live in a generation of consummation and one of ,7
13955," things to teach our children is how to deal with all those amazing things you could buy everywhere
if it was forbidden to publish ad  kids you will have problems to deal with them screaming at the age of 10 there is no tv without advertisement as they grow old we live in this world and thats the way advertisement tries to trick us all ",0
13956, we have to teach our children the ability of saying no and being capable to not buy everything that seems cool from their very ,2

13958, there are ways for them to avoid this and if you really want to do good to your child dont even let it watch tv too much  let it play in the woods,17
13959,"statement television advertising  should not be allowe

this is a very important question ",15
13960," with pro and contra opinions and it could be a very intresting disscusion between some parents and teenager 

first of all i think the children are ",12
13961, young and movements are very important for their body they need to go out and play with some other children they need the fresh air and they have to have fun but the parents have an important rule they decide ,24
13962, they go out and play some football they decide ,19
13963," they stay at home and watch some television

but actually to watch some television isnt ",1
13964," bad you can learn some great things for example there is a show in which a little girl explanes some things in english or sometimes they show how to life in the television they are always friendly happy helpfully and they have fun so the little children can learn something but they have to know its not real 

the fazit is the children have to move but its ",17

13968, comes those advertisingbreaks in between and thats what ,11
13969," be discussing today furthemore the statement television advertising s young children aged  should not be allowed

lets ",13
13970," with this statement is that children in that agegroup are very impressionable and are influenced by the things and people around themtelevision marketing is one of them i used to always want the newest barbie displayed on tv and used to beg my mom to buy it

another reason why ",2
13971,s that it prolongs the time of a movie or a tv show ,6
13972," the child spends more time overall in front of the tv which could be used more produvtively by playing hanging out with other kids or doing sports

another reason why ",17
13973,s because this supports consumerism and the need in children wanting new toys or snacks ,2
13974,s because people are usually always surrounded by advertisments wether it be on the street on youtube or at the cinema and at one ,11
13975," or another you have to learn to handel that and not always be seduced by advertising for example pretty much every website has some ads on it nowadays

a reason to ",11
13976,"s that tvshows need to make money somehow and the way most of them make money is through advertising whithout it you wouldnt have as many free tvchannels

in conclusion ",10

13978, thats best for the children ,12
13979, as their parents and their wallets as shown by the ,9
13980,there is a great deal of advertisement in televison programms all over the world showing the greatest newest and best things we do not know we want ,10
13981, these advertisements influence us on a subconsces level and ,11
13982," change the way we live should it be allowed to manipulate the youngest of our species with these advertisements that show ous heavly photoshoped images of a world we live in
our society is programmed on being consuming as much as possible we always want to be up to date with the newest trends and do not want to be left behind this is how capitalism works
to get such a well trained society companies realised that they would have to influence the youngest members of our society the childrend aged  there is no morning programm for children without advertisements of the must have dora the explorer writing book and matching to that the new backpack that will ",16
13983," make you the coolest kid in school every mother or father that does not allow his kid to buy any of this marchandise sure has to be evil and not loving his or her child in the eyes of the companies and the children themselves which demonic parent does not want his child to be accepted and tollerated in school but children do not have a good sense of distinguishing between necessary and useless things in life if they do not get there seventh action hero doll that now is able to handle one weapon more than the old one they do not understand the world anymore and get angry
 therefore we should protect them from the companies that only want profit no matter what and bann advertisements directed  in televison",20
13984, that is perfectly fine its good to raise the hole world to a hoard of consume and profit seeking bastards as the most are now the best would be to advertise about weapons how they could improve the amount of co2 emission or how cool its to be gay maybe you could ,11
13985, advertise the new beaty clinic they opened some villages away ,18
13986, yall are some really ugly bastards and the way to real beauty takes a very long time ,18
13987, toddlers age you often find advertisments about fast food thats actually not very good ,16
13988, fast food gives these children the idea that you had to have something food like to get your toxics and chemicals thats very unefficient they should advertise for lolipops ,2
13989, lolipops maybe not with some flavours like cherry strawberry or apple but maybe e110 e140 or maybe you could even get some sort of starter pack where you get everything from e100e180 and ,18
13990, they could sell e181e200 as an expansion or a dlc but no one seems to see the actual problem how are these kiddos gonna buy some stuff if they dont have credit cards or something the advertisement companies should provide a system where childern 25 could give their stroller or things like that as an insurance ,2

13992," now you gave away the stroller for your sniper riffle but no one told you that you may need hydrochloric acid or a good shovel to hide the body

when there is advertising in the television young children cant think about it and just want to have the advertised product because the advertising says if the little child has the product it will be happier berfore and ",2
14016, such a little child would like to be a little be happier and if the product makes the kid happier what else does it need a little kid hasnt a reason like it gets ,20
14017," that it cant think about the product and if the product is really as good as shown in the advertising

in ",23
14018, there is a risk for parents by letting their children watch tv because if their children want to have absolutely a product ,17
14019," watching television it is the own problem of the parents if they get angry because their child wants to have something absolutely


all in all ",17
14020, it is the own problem of the parents if they let watching their children tv in such a young age my opinion is that it is risky to let children watch television in a young age because ,17
14021," they dont have to think by themselves and they just sit on the couch and watch straight forward this means they could get physical and psychical problems what could be incorrect

but if the parents let their children watch tv it is their own problem if they get problems with their child because it wants absolutely to get a product this means that ",17
14022, television advertising s young children shouldnt get unallowed because ,13
14023, the television is a product made for a little bit older people and the tv programs are free programs and they can advertise whatever they want except of bad advertising so if the children see something on the tv what they would like to have i thik they can get it if they want,14
14024,"these days much of the television advertising is s young children and many think it is wrong but is it really that bad that it shouldnt be allowed

first ",14
14025," that advertising s young children is a bad thing because children are very easy to convince to do something or to buy a certain thing and the companies who are making this television advertising use that to sell there stuff

in the other ",14
14026," if a child want something it doesnt mean that it would get it automatically because the parent wont buy something or do something just because there children have told them

but even tho the parents wont buy or do it it doesnt mean that they wouldnt buy or do something if the children want it really bad

at the end ",9
14027," that even young children arent that stupid to buy or want anything what they see in the television

to sum up ",8
14028, that telivision advertising should be allowed because it is not that worse at all it doesnt harm young children and i ,15
14029," think in some cases it could be very handy
",4
14030,"television advertisings can be really brainwashing to be honest if people see a product over and over again they start to think that this specific product is actually good but do young children even care or does the brainwash affect the children even more


children do watch television and most of them do like watching tv ",14
14031," but do they really think about those stuff if young children watch cartoons about cowboys shooting each other the child wont go out with a gun and shoot people a child at age four already knows that thats not a normal thing to do and at the age of four he will already have experiences about what he can do or cant do
but on the other handsite a tv advertisment is a different story if a child is that young he looks up to people to his parents ",14
14032, to superman i mean who doesnt want to be like superman and ,19
14033," how should a young child be able to differentiate between his father who says vegetables are good for you and the guy in the tv who says these toys are good for you 

not only young children get brainwashed by television advertising ",2
14034, do adults it happens all the time peopel buy those silly things like a new little handy machine which helps you burning fat people believe it because all humans are lazy and thats a proofen ,19
14035, which explains that the thirtyfour  year old guy who sits infront of the television all day is to lazy to go to the gym ,19
14036," he just buys the machine thinking that hell get ride off those insultings about him beeing fat if the thirtyfour year old guy doesnt see that the products are just useless how is a four year old kid supposed to see
instead of not allowing televison advertisings which are s such young children i would ",2
14037," allow it but teach the kids how to detect the useless things which the companies want you to buy 

so my opinion is to let the companies do their television advertisments toward chidren but the parents or even better the teachers should show the kids how to use television advertisment the right way ",14
14038, theyre like aged  and they obviously cant afford those things by their own they should get to know what they can use or really cant use because it is just useless and a waste of money not everything in television advertisments is crap but most of it and the children should start already at a young age detecting the wrong things,2
14039,"televisioin advertising  aged  should not be allowed

there are a lot of difference ",15
14040," for this thema

as example is it good for the firm because the children in the age of two ",9
14041, five years are good to become they belive all what the television or the parents said when the television said that in the aged of four years every boy have a carrera cars and every girl mus have a barbie ,24
14042," every boy and every girl want that because they havent it and all the others have it
a ",18
14043, for the television advertising is that it is allowed to have a advertising for some plays in the television the firm can show us what they have and wehn the children have birthday or wehn its christmas its good for the parents ,10
14044," they have presents

but at the other ",18
14045," it isnt good because the children want all these thnings they sit more bevore the television and watch it
an other ",17
14046, because the television advertising for young children should not be allowed is because the little children cant know what they need the parents want to do all perfect for his little child and ,13
14047," the child want something he become it this is like a manipulation for the little children but they cant understand it

my personality opinion is that it should be allowed because each firm must do advertising for his own things and ",16
14048," the firm sold things for little children they should make this advertising

",16
14049,television advertising  aged  should not be allowed this statement shows us the situation of the children today in richer countries where more or less every family has a television and every child grows up with it what frightends parents is not ,14
14050, food or homelessness it is ,23
14051," the television

from a very young age children are watching television and do not play outside however with this situation televison have a huge impact on our children and ",17
14052," on our and their futur the television companies are aware of this and know how to use their influence on todays children with hidden messages they can get into the brain of our children and make them think what they want to think them of course this statement of mine is quite hard but i believe that watching television as young children can have a very bad inpact on their lives

however in the last few years in which television got more and more popular the population has changed in an very early age children are confronted with pictures of cruel murder or pornography through this the children today are more violant and have sometimes a strange behaviour ",17
14053," sexuality

to sum up all these ",21
14054, lead to the conclusion that tevelevison advertising  should not be allowed because it has an influence on our futur and the futur of the world we should protect our children and should not allow television advertising toward young children,13
14055,every day 365 days a year there are television advertising they should influence us to buy something but young children watch ,14
14056," television but they cant buy anything because they havent any money is that good for the children should the television advertising not be allowed or do the children not understand what they see

first the advertising isnt good for children because it influences them they dream about a lego toy or a car they will live in a fictive world in a world with all these beautiful toys in a world in wich they could have what they want but the real life isnt that easy who has enough money to buy anything 

an agrument against the ",14
14057," is that they cant think right in this age the cildren would forget all the advertising two or three years later
a ",11
14058," is that people shouldnt watch a lot television to live in a fictive world you must watch a lot more hours television than an average man would
a ",17
14059," a young child would watch a lot television a day there should be a ban on watching television and not to the advertising
a fourth ",13
14060, is that a television concerne couldnt exist without advertising,10
14061,young children shouldnt even watch television or ,17
14062, they watch television they should watch something that has been created for their age and on a programme for children there shouldnt be any advertising young children want almost everything they see and for parents these advertisings for children wouldnt be good at all ,14
14063, their parents could say no but most parents just want their children to be happy so for the family and ,9
14064, for the children it would be a bad thing ,12
14065, because if they can watch television they cant watch long time most children at this age i think and ,17
14066," the film or series would be distracted by some advertising 
but ",10
14067, for the people who want to sell something for children something like a game or maybe even clothes they would make a lot of money i think because children arent ,20
14068, smart at this age and they believe what the advertising promises its much easier to convince children than parents or generally adults the programme would ,2
14069," make a lot of money because advertising isnt cheap and they can decide which price it will be 
",11
14070, that this statement is right and we shouldnt allow advertising on television for children aged  it isnt nessecary to advertise on television children ,13
14071, look at stores they wouldnt earn much more money and ,23
14072, im thinking about the poor parents whose children just want the game that was on television i fell with them but most important ,9
14073, young they should go playing outside and if it would be like that we wouldnt even have to think or debate over this maybe these young children dont even care if they watch advertisings but maybe they do ,16
14074, nobody likes advertisings in the middle of a film and ,11
14075, we shouldnt say that its okay that our children have to watch it,12
14076,young children aged  should not watch television it is proved that children who watch television ,17
14077, the age of two later will have a lower intelligent quotient that children who play with dolls ,8
14078," but there are a lot of children who watch television anyway and are confronted with television advertising 
firstly television toward young children influences them in various ways if they see a girl wearing a rosa dress and playing with a doll they may think girls have to do that so they learn stereotype behaviours
others may say that television advertising has not that much power more important is the behavoiur which children observe of  their parents or of other children if they see the girl with the rosa dress but their parents show them that they can play with dolls or cars in most cases they will be influenced by the parents and not by the advertisment
secondly if children are confronted with advertisment they will want things that they do not really need they just want it because they have seen it on television and think



",14
14079, that television advertising toward young children should be banned generally because ,13
14080, they do not affect the children badly but ,4
14081," that it is important that young children dont watch tv it is important that they play with other children and that they go outside
",8
14082,in my opinion the question we are asking ourselfs is what influence do these advertisments have in our lives or the lives of our children if there was no efect whatsoever we wouldnt be concerned about our children but what effect does it realy have it increases our desire to buy things we dont need or only buy to fullfil our desires mabey it creates desires we werent aware of or didnt even existe bevore we saw the manipulating add the possible consequense is we cant controle our desires and just go on to buy loads of stuff we dont need but ,11
14083, this isnt very likly to happen to children ,4
14084, theyr lac of financal independance especialy from age  you are not old enough to buy whatever you want and whenever you want without your parents consent as long as you have a parent who is able  to tell you that you cant have what ever you saw in this television add but by this i dont mean that it schouldnt be allowed what i am trying to say is that i dont see any reason in makeing adds for kids becose most of those adds ard for things that cost money and kids dont get to deside what to do with that moneyits theyr parents desicion if they wantto spendmoney on the things promoted in the adds made for theyr children but that leads me to the question why would we even show adds for things that cost money to people who dont have any they will just now what they could buy if theyhad money witch they avent so i guess ,2
14085, on the television directed directly to children becose it will onlytresult inthem whining aboutthings theyll never have and woulnt even know of if it wasnt for the add ,6
14086, whenever parents wand to treat theyr children they can go toa toystore abd the kids can chose from whatever toys there are in the shop they visite in my opinion you shouldnt make those adds becose kids evenmore than adults or teens dont have mouch feeling for what tey need and what thes just want,20
14087,first i need to say that children between two and five arent able to decide whats best for them they probably just want to have everything that is shiny or supercool if they could choose between something they could use for the ,20
14088, hour that would be absolutely fun and something they could use for the rest of their lives that would be extremely helpful for their future they would probably go with the ,1
14089, possibility that shows that children just want to have fun and thats absolutely no problem at all but its clear that kids cant know whats best for them thats the job of their parents children dont have a clue about money but i guess that ,8
14090, they see an advertisment and they would want this superhero or this barbie it would be better if they choose otherwise their grandmother buys them something else but they didnt even want that because they were dreaming of this advertisment further ,20
14091, important that children can play and enjoy their lives without any sorrows they just have to be youngeven ,8
14092, those advertisments can cause a lot of trouble if a kid wants one of those things its parents sometimes get under pressure what if the parents cant effort that thing for their daughter or what if the son comes home from kindergarten and one of his friends has this superhero from the advertisment this son wants the same but he gets into an ,0
14093, with his dad because his wish is too expensive an other ,18
14094," is that children shouldnt watch too much television they should go out and play with friends this defenitely is possible even without any stuff from an advertising
this discussion is really difficult because it sometimes gets hard to see into children but ",13
14095, its better to not allow advertising directed to young kids,16
14096,televison adverts for young children should they be allowed children ,13
14097, young shouldnt be watching that much television to be influenced by its adverts ,14
14098, children at that specific age are most easily to influence so now ,7
14099, bring up some pro and con,21
14100, head to head to see which of the ,18
14101, young children are very easy to influence they believe in a big man with a big belly in a red coat and perfect white hair who lives in the uninhabitable place at the north pole with some flying reindeer one of them with a big nose and many elves who dont do any other thing the whole year than making presents for the whole world so ,7
14102, they believe such a story ,19
14103," they are going to believe every word that is said in advertisments
on the other ",11
14104, much  but are happy with ,18
14105, i was a child i wished for the whole kidoh cristmas catalogue because everything looked ,20
14106, cool in the end i only got ,18
14107, little or nothing from the catalogue but was ,18
14108, amazed by the other presents i got so the small children are going to want ,20
14109, much but are only going to get ,18
14110," little

an other reason to forbid television adverts addressing  our smallest is that some mothers cant handle it ",13
14111, their children cry because they cant have something ,9
14112, they buy their children everything ,9
14113," they just throw their money out the window for things their children play with once or twice
but how would the television companies not declare bankrupt if they are not going to get all their money from the adverters which is their main source of income 
also do children learn that they cant get everything in live they want ",17
14114, they dont get anything from those cool looking tv adverts this ,10
14115," only works if the parents are strong and not just give their children everything they want

in my opinion television adverts for small children can be allowed if companies want to invest all that money ",16
14116,commercials have companied our society for quit a ,10
14117, now and there is barely a place on earth where you dont walk pass a commercial at some ,11

there are studies that have already shown that comercials may there message reach you consciously or not have ",16

14122, adverts have an impact on us thats joust how society works advertising is not just something modern its been a mean for companies to sell there products for decades now ,11
14123, why sould theyr impact on us randomly increase further on is neither a danger for adults nor for kinds especially kids dont even really understand the meaning of the comercials its just colours and catchy kids songs playd on a ukulele ,4
14124," in every other kids programm 
kids may not understand everything they see but that dosent mean that they dont somehow recieve the message said in the commercial also at that young age kids are more likely the remember what theyve heard than adoulds and ",2
14125," a kid hears the same jinge more than twice it can sing along by heart
critics could argue the messages in kids commercials dont ever contain any violence or other themes that could have a bad influence on children
another thing is that what ever is presented in the commercial its not really up to the kid to buy it is it so kids commercials are a wicked way of bringing parents to buy things through there bagging kids who have seen the ad
against that you could ",0

14140, its clear that i wouldnt allow television advertisement toward young children they cant really think about which toy they want to buy because kids get easily influenced by cute or funny ad so its not fair to lie to them with cool shots of a toy which the thing cant even do as shown in the tv ,13

14143, our society is one thats all about consuming products there are many advertisments that secretly tell you to buy stuff that benefits their sales to make money so why not start at a young age these kids dont really understand what theyre seeing and because of that they can easily be brainwashed while using a nice and soothing voice in their campaign theyre telling kids to buy these certain things suddendly ,2

 well the television industry generates thousands of jobs in every country of the world to keep those jobs channels have to make money there are some national television channels in many countries which dont have to make advertisment breaks because they are financed by some kind of tax from the inhabitands but most channels are private and rely on advertising brands in the breaks channels for children ",14

at the moment there is a big discussion in television advertising towards young children should be allowed one ",14

on the other ",19

so my personal opinion is that the advertising s young children is not that bad they dont get influenced by many commercials and the parents ",14

otherwise there are a lot of funny and entertaining advertisements in the tv to make the kids laughing and show them funny games to play or toys which promise a lot of fun for young children these advertisements with a clear message without a potential to be missunderstood should be allowed because theyre simply entertaining for the young kids

television advertising  should not be allowed

many people think that television isnt really good for young children some think that what young children hear or see on tv can be understood wrongly by them or can influence their actions and thoughts for example ",13

14275," in this age you shouldnt watch very much tv an better go outside with friends or play games read books if a children watches tv and see an advertism they wanna see more of them an their parents begin to have troubles with allowing watching tv in my opinion its not fair for the parents because kids are always fascinated by the things who are showed in tv and they can be easier manipulated with good advertism
the ",17
14276, problem could be that poor parents cant buy their children the toys which they see in the television and ,20
14277," the parents can begin to feel bad and the children thinks their parents dont like them because in this age they often dont understand what poorness is 
an other problem could be that the children always want to have the newest toys and that they never will be happy with the toys which they have because it always exists a new toy its not possible for parents to buy their children always the newest toys because its too expensive and it exists always a new one 
in advertism are the toys often showed better than they are and be too expensive for the quality that they give
",20
14278," the magazines of toysrus or franz carl weber are enough for the kids and can show them the newest stuff
advertism is not bad but its bad for children aged  and not necessary in the television they show too much advertism and often bad advertism
so my opinion is that advertism shouldnt be allowed for children aged  or even for children aged two to ten",14
14279,there are some good and bad ,4
14280," about television advertising advertising is like making people do or buy something by presenting the product or whatever it is this should influence some people and let them buy or do these thhings if that happens we know that the advertisement was successful

it always depends on what kind of an advertisement it is but its important to know that young children are very influencable television advertising can infuence these children better than adults and like i said if these advertisements are specifically made for children these children would want to have these things ike toys
nowadays there are these phases where a specific toy is the best toy and every kid wants to have this and that makes an entire group get these things
well thats the case if the advertisement presents toys but its the same thing if the advertisemnet is about an activity it well may be positive ",0
14281," in that case it depends on the content of the television advertising
",10

but ",16
14283, that they only see whats on the screen is another negative ,3

that statement above is generalising the advertisements i can say from my own experience that not all advertisements have a bad influence to children ive seen kind of advertisemnts that tell young children to go to bed early to play outside and more

because of that i believe that it really depends on what kind of and televisison advertisement it is more importantly what and how it represents so i cant really say that ",14

14288," paragraphes

advertisments can be helpful if your watching tv and an advertisment is comming up you can see what products on the market and decide if you need them there might be a porblem with young children watching those 
because of their young age they arent mature enough to consider if they really need the product who popps up on the tv parents may than be confronted with a lot of wishes from their children
there is ",0
14289," a risk of creating a fake or unhealthy perception of the world watching tv advertisments in a younf age young girls will unconsiously save the images of beautiful slim and tall girls in ads later in life they have the need to become similar to them 
children in young age it they watch tv ads will be indirectly confronted with our capitalistic system  
so new generation will be used to this society structure ",14

in my opinion tv ads should not be allowed to yoz",15

14293," seeing the commercial you may crave one this is how advertising influences our subconsciousness 

the aim of commercials is to make create a potential customer who is paying money for this certain product that is being advertised
however children from age  neither have the money nor the possibility to buy this product they have to show their interest to their parents ",0
14294, saticefy their needs advertising could lead the children to be interested in challenging toys and games ,0
14295, memory games or puzzles in contrast ads ,11
14296, could seduce the children to wish for dangerous toy like toy guns or little toy that could be swallowed toys and games ,20
14297, have an psychological influence on children whose brain is ,7

14299," a perfect face she may develops a low selfesteem because she keeps comparing herself to her barbie doll boy toys that immitate shooting could lead to aggressiveness in the adult age 

so toys can be very important with the psychological and characteristic development of children 
they ",20

in my opinion television advertisement should be censored and approved by authorities ",14
14301, television advertising  could influence them very bad if for excemple children would watch advertisings about toys they see how happe the children in the advertising are and how funny it would be to have the same toy maybe they start to finde their own toys borring because they are only concentrated on what they dont have and if they would get something new this would get borring too ,20

14307," be a possibility to show the parents toys which could help the children learning new things or toys which could suport them in some situations

14313,many commercials are made for a specific group of interest the question ,11
14314, essay is wether advertisement for the age group of  should be allowed first of all it is important what type of content is presented to the children it should not be legal connecting cigarettes with a mickey mouse logo you ,13
14315, have to keep in mind that children at this age are not fully able to comprehend the value of money this is not a big problem ,9
14316, they do not get weekly or monthly cash from their parents but ,9
14317, the children are seduced to spend there money in a not wisely way the group of  year olds is a big consumer group and very important for economic reasons and ,2
14318, they get interested in a particular product they will be trying to get hold of it very powerful we all remember the awkward situation in a toy store ,3
14319, a child screams and shouts to her mother because she really wants the new lego expansion pack and altough her needs are declined she ,20
14320, tries to manipulate her mother to buy it im convinced that the television is a pretty important medium for many companies to sell products to the little ones and advertisement does not always has to be a bad thing you get exposed to unwanted rubbish aswell as really interesting stuff you should take into consideration ,2
14321, that many television programmes for little children would not exist without commercials because there would be no selling ,13
14322, in showing them and for my part i loved to watch cartoons and television shows made for my age group in conclusion ,6
14323, there is not a big problem in showing commercials to children ,14
14324, they are reasonable and not graphic or offputting,18
14325, television is great i like to watch tv all day long its a amazing way to calm down and to relaxwhy shouldnt it be allowed to watch tv advertising hows directed ,15
14326, youre  years oldi mean you have to start early learn a correct way to use television and co and alot of television programs are made for children ,6
14327, should be used in advertisingthere are a lot of toy producers they want to show theyre stuff to the children on tv so if television advertising is not allowed for children to watch tv shouldnt be allowed to because there are alot advertising how dont have a direction like ,14
14328, food ad event ad or ad for the newest movie at the cinema children are around ads all the time not just ,16
14329, they watch televisionso my oppinion to this its there are advertisting around children anyways if they are directed to them or not so i think its up to the parents if they let theyre children watch tv ad or not and parents ,14
14330, should decide it they allowed theyre children to buy that stuff from the tv or not,2
14331,imagine you are  a four year old child and you like to watch television before your favorite program starts there is an advertisment which shows you exactly what you want if you are boy it could be a giant fortress made out of legos if you are a girl you may be shown the barbie doll you desperatly want after the advertisment was shown you run to your parents and ask them if you may have the shown product probably they will not buy it instantly but ,20
14332," of complaining and crying they may consider buying it just to shut you up

this situation is nothing that i would have wanted to ever exist sadly it partually became reality with companies whose advertisements are  these children are heavily influenced by those ads and they make their parents buy stuff they dont need many parents dont have very much money to spend on such things if the advertised product isnt bought because of one of many valid reasons the child will be devastated if it is bought the parents will often have a bad feeling about it as the product is almost never a necessity not to metion that the advertisments are s children because the parents wouldnt have bought them if they saw the advertisment the child probably doesnt know where and under what circumstances the product was made and what materials have been used the product may have been made by children in asia and the materials used may be toxic the child probably wouldnt even care it only sees the product of their dreams these advertisments open up the opportunity to sell products that couldnt be sold differently and probably shouldnt be sold at all

in conclusion ",2
14333, it is clear that this form of advertising should not be allowed as it influences the children in a way they dont even notice and if one of the products gets bought not everyone will be happy,16
14334,"many young children watch very often television should it be allowed or not
the most of the children who watch televiosion watch a movie or a serie but there are good and bad movies for children or movies whitch arent for children by some movies the children will learn something ",17

but what is ",24
14336," a child watch a movie or an other thing in the televioson whitch isnt good for children maybe they have later a problem or are scary from things they saw in the television 
an other ",17

14340, the little children should more play and be a child in this age without watching television or playing videogames or sometihnig but in this poin the parents play a important rule they have to say if its okey ,24

",17
14342,when i was a child id loved watching tv ,17
14343, the advertisements between two films i dont why maybe the reason was that i knew i wouldnt ever get anything of this things or toys they showed me in the tv so ,20

14345," i would be this girl or boy who could play with this toys

in ",20

14347, want to get this of course ,18
14348, were older we know about the conditions for buying something and we know how hard it is to earn enough money to get everything we want to have but the mood to get something new is ,20

of course the advertisements shows every child what it could but doesnt have but is this something bad we must learn to say no to something and be happy without it why shouldnt we learn to do this at the age of a child

whats better to learn things early or late

this is a question who everyone must ask itself there isnt a correct response for everyone

firstly kids shouldnt watch tv ",17

secondly for the parents it could be helpfull but only for the bad ones we shouldnt support for example ",12
14433, they have no idea what their children like for christmas or birthday they could get inspirated by the tv spots but the kids could ,2

another ",20

so ",21

a big disatvantage of watching tv in the young age between two and five is that televisions arent helping the children to build a progress in their brains as its important in this age a creativity for exmaple is not here if a child is watching tv everyday for a long time a child can get some diseases like it cant talk very well for a child at its age the disease can be worse ",14
14457, the child has to go to a logopedical therapy where it can make a progress in its brain to ,8
14458," go to a primary school and educate itself
my personal opinion of the theme is that good parents wont let a child watch the tv too long in this young age ",17
14459, there will be no damaging effects of a tv and the advertisements in it advertisements should be allowed because they dont damage anything and are more there for fun to that children are watching wathever they think its interesting ,14
14460, ive never seen children in this age watching an advertisement because they are not interested at it ,16
14461,many people watch regularly television ,10
14462, young children many parents let their children in front of the televsion ,17
14463, do something else the question that ,18
14464," discuss in this little essay is if television advertising should not be allowed for young children aged 

young children learn a lot of things through televsion there are many series for little kids in which the producers are trying to show them the world they learn how to count how to spell words etc 
they use television to make up their minds 

many parents use television to have a little pause from their children they do not have any patience left and ",14
14465," they let them watch tv to make them quiet but is it really good to let the young children watch tv just to let them be quiet 
",17
14466, that it is good that young children are sitting in front of the television we are living in a world where the media things are getting bigger and more important for everyone and ,17
14467, that this is a good thing we are complaining about the social media and things like that but we are letting our children sitting in front of the tv and letting them watch tv they are our future and ,17
14468," we should try to make out of them the best they could be
watching television makes ",1
14469, really agressive this is something that has been showed you may ,19
14470," lose the connection to reality because you might like live in the television and do not forget that a lot of kids just started watching television because their parents wanted them to be quiet
 
it might be that there are good series for little kids that show them some important things but ",17
14471, that it is good for them they should go out and play in the green with other kids they should enjoy every ,8
14472," of their childhood playing crying smiling fighting and not sitting in the house in front of the television 

as there are ",1
14473, of letting young children watch tv ,17
14474," that it should be allowed to let them watch tv they should go out and explore the world they should enjoy their childhood 
living is the best option for learning if you are living your life fully you are always learning something
 
",8
14475,advertisment is a part of our daily life as the day passes we see uncountble ads on streetsigns our computers and the television it ,11
14476," affects the smallest in our society the 25 year old kids do they really need to bare this constant flood of advertisment 

when we watch a commercial on television we often think about it for a ",14
14477, or two like do i need this or where could i find this small children do not think much about their actions or anything that happens around them they live for the moment so wehn they see an advertisement in television they do not waste another ,2
14478," on thinking about it

though how often does a kid that age really see an ad in television they play with their siblings parents or other children of the same age every day they live is a new adventure to them so why waste any of this precious time watching television they do not spend hours a day looking at a screem ",14
14479," they would not really be affected by it

if they do spend hours and hours in front of the television and see a lot of advertisment directed to them they could not do aynthing with that information ",10
14480, they do not have any money to buy something they would start to ignore the commercial like we do every day so it would ,11
14481, help them for their adult life ,9
14482," harm them

small children do not watch a lot of television and if they do commercials do not have the same effect on them ",14
14483, it has on an older human so why bann commercials for children that age if they do not even work the way they were supposed,2
14484,monica a three years old girl is sitting in front of a tv her mom is cooking and her  dad ,1
14485, at work suddenly an advertising comes on the tv its about a barbie that in the advertismet evreybody popular in the school has monica herself is not really well liked and popular ,11
14486, she decides that she relly needs one of these barbies she talkes too her mom that she really needs this barbie ,20
14487, her mom says she wont buy her one but ,18
14488," moniva startes too cry her mom agrees and says that she will buy her one this example lead to the question if its appropriate to direct television advertising toward childred in a young age or if this should be banned 

in the case of monica the advertising should be banned because the industrie uses the anexiety of an young children and says with a materiel thing that she would be happier thats a wrong way to think and if children already think that way in a young age they will end up being a shoppaholic ",2
14489," they are going to be older and having a hard time they always will be thinking that buying a lot of trendy and exoensive things is what makes them happy 

but ",24
14490, you could say that tv itsself isnt good for the right development of a children in a young age so it doest matter if the children are watching dump cartoons or advertisings were at least a few people can earn some money so its overreacted ,14
14491, for exapmle parents are making a drama out of advertisings ,2
14492," their children are sitting 2 hours per day in front of a tv because if the advertisings really would distract them they just could take the children to a playground or even just watch a dvd 

we can see that we cant just say no or yes to advertisings for children but what ",14
14493, is that the development of a child is not being supported with false images of what is important in life and what not but ,7
14494," could use that as a chance to make a change in the world because to be real mostly evrey family nowdays has a tv  and television is watched from time to time so why not use this as something good just make advertisings were children can learn from and it wouldnt be a problem for anyone anymore 

",17
14495, it is not very good making advertisements like that lets give it a look from the psycological ,11
14496, young children get influenced very fast and that by nearly anything at that age that is probably even a scientific ,7
14497, big toy companies can aim ,20
14498, age with some advertising and hook up the children with their goodlooking toys this may sound pathetic in a way but it really is children in that certain age are not mature enought to handle money with the same value as to an adult and if the companies dont mess up the ad they can really inplant the wish ,20
14499, toy in a childs mind that sounds very negative ,20
14500, but it can definitely cause some harm for example a poor family is watching tv ,4
14501, there is that ad about what not of a toy and the boygirl is totally into that they want it at any circumstance but because of the familys lag at money they cant afford it that is unpleasent for the child and for the parens ,20
14502, i was watching tv as a child the stereotypes girly stuff is totally covered in pink and the boys stuff is full of manly things or styles i can understand why companies make that but it is not helping children getting along eachother better than without toys as an example i can take my childhood there were some cool toys for girls and i really liked them because of the pink package pink manual pink toy itself tho i never really wanted to get them its kind of a little detail but ,20
14503, there was something you liked and it wasnt for your gender it was not really acceped by others profit is the companies goal and im totally fine with that but the companies have to spread the awareness about their products ,23
14504, a profitable thing to do and ,23
14505," there was something i was looking for and it was mentioned in an advertisement i was happy 
basically ",11
14506, be allowed but regulated by some laws concerning the psycological ,12
14507," write is the television advertising towars young children and if that shouldnt be allowed 

one reasen for arguing this these is that the raise of the children at this age should fully be under contol of their parents it is very dangerous showing children stuff on television because a lot of children do what they see ",13
14508," if there is someting showed on televison it must be sure that children dont come on stupid ideas 

on the otherhand if its something about food for children or something like that i suppose that it ",6
14509," would be okay perhaps not an advertisment about a fast food restaurant or unhealty food at all 

advertisments can ",11
14510, be thaughtful and can wider their knowledg ,3
14511, showing parts of the world or things on the hole which they never saw ,18
14512, there are always good advertiments ,11
14513, some years ago there was one from coop with the singer stress he was talkingsinging about our world and that was the ,18
14514," time i was thinking about our world and that our world has to be protected 

but most of the companys which make advertisments on televison for their product just want to make money and that has most of the time not such a good influence on the children who are looking this advertisments 

to conclude ",14
14515, it would be better if there arens special advertisments directed  it is to dangerous and to be honest children at this stage of life shouldnt be watching television ,17
14516, soesnt make a lot of sence ,18
14517,"more and more companies use television advertising to speak directly to their audience young children aged  they want to spread their products for childs and influence them but is this a legit method to sell more product should television advertising toward young children not be allowes
critics say that there is always a free market even in advertising for this reason companies should ",14
14518, be free to make advertising to young people another ,11
14519, is that with ads speaking to the children they can ,16
14520," learn something about business that really concern them otherwise they just see ads for adults which they propably dont understand when watching tv they get into a world that made from adults for adults and that may propably influence their innocent childhood negatively
supporters of a ban have opposite strong ",13
14521, they say that children in this age are too young to have an own opinion if they now see an advertising where something is promoted as a incredibly good and cool thing they automatically want it even its nothing they could use or have pleasure on if children now want such a product its hard for parents to deny it this decreases parents autority ,2
14522," to the parents that tells the children what to do
in my opinion this sort of advertising should be prohibited as it may harm a childs own world which is to protect with all available forces it is better to speak to parents ",16
14523," there is to sell a product for children because they have the risk for their children and they are old enough to decide if they want to buy a product for their sons and daughters or if they better leave it
",2
14524,"television advertising

nowadays television advertising is an important topic with those ads people get manipulated to be better consumers children are an important group of custmers because it is easier to catch them with advertising and they do not really know that there is some advertising company behind who gets all the money the youth of todays society should not be more interested to consumption than we already are children should ",14
14525, be cancalled as an important group of consumers if we do not intervene children will more and more just care about money and consumption like that they would lose other kinds of values ,2
14526, liberty friendship privacy and happiness and ,21
14527, on they would be educated just for buying more of a particular good nowadays every data that is given by us is collected because of the huge surveillance we got this together with the advertising is used to get to know what people want ,23
14528, make them better consumers i ,23
14529, think we should definitely not let this happen to our kids in my opinion the world is already more than keen enough on money ,12
14530, we should not never allow television advertising which is directed  this would be even ,15

14548," sell alot and make lots of profit they have to have a wide range of demographics to cater to this is how our economy works children love toys and their parents often fullfill many of their wishesso there shouldnt be a big deal that businesses take this opportunity and profit from it childern want everything they see   it doesnt have to be from an advertisement particularly it could be a toy another child in kindergarten has or even adult things like clocks oder laptpos it is the parents who have money and because of that they are responsible for what they buy for their child it is their parenting that makes the child thankfull or greedy

but advertisments to manipulate is which could be seen as morally wrong even ",0
14549, we might not believe that we could be that easily manipulated it is mostly the case we might not want to buy the product but we do remember the brand as an example you might see an advertisement about x brands hair dye you might think at that particular moment that you dont need hair dye but later in time maybe weeks or months later youll be in the supermarket looking for some hair dye and ,23
14550," you cant decide which one to get you suddenly remember this advertisement you saw a long time ago and unconciousley you take x hairdye and buy it so if it can manipulate even us adults who can reflect on information advertisment must have a big affect on gullable little children
in todays world society has already gotten very materialistic we want a lot and we buy a lot often times unnecassary things isnt it our duty ",2
14551, to protect our children from this materialistic world ,8
14552, possible a child could be happy with just a stick as a toy but as soon as he sees all these advertisement promoting plastic guns dolls tablets etc they get brainwashed into thinking that they have nothing and need more toys because of that they get unsatisfied and angry which could lead to even more tantrums ,20
14553, toddlers already do and to spoiled children there is no reason a child between the ages of two and five should be want more than basic supplies it needs to live at that age they cant even comprehend their surroundings ,9
14554," why fill them with all these false desires and corrupt their vurnerable mind

my opinion is very clear todays society is really materialistic and ",3
14555, its disgusting how corporations are now catering  instead of spending quality time with them more parents leave them alone with toys most of the time technology like tablets and phones there is no need for children of that age range to be confronted with advertisements,2
14556,today most of these children are watching tv or playing games on the ipad every day so they are confronted with advertising in different ways i dont really know if they recognize it truly ,0
14557, they play a game or watching a film but the advertising has not to be an advertising aged for older people they shouldnt see any advertising which they dont really understand but ,0
14558, it shouldnt be banded because everywhere are advertising messages in your life and older people are confronted too with them why not young kids too its not anything that hurts or makes your stupid its just a way get more customers for this product some could say you should not manipulate such young kids and its horrible for the parents ,12
14559, their kids want to have all these toys or other things which theyve seen in the television ,20
14560, those kids could go in the city and walk into a store and see what they really want to have not that they are at home sitting on the couch and drinking a soft drink ,9
14561, they see what they want to have also young people are interested in many different things ,3
14562, if they see a teddybear they wanna have it or if they see not real money to play with they ,3
14563, want to have it too for the parents its not everytime easy to complain why they cant have all those toys and things theyve seen on television i cant really say if it shouldnt be allowed or it should be but the number and the kind of it does really matter ,12
14564, today the social media is an important part in the life of these young children ,24
14565, you cant live without advertising on television the best thing would be ,10
14566, the parents set a time of watching tv probalby one hour per day the rest of the day the kids should go outside and play with their friends in the garden or going in the forest because ,1
14567, you dont have these problems at all children are just playing and having fun with each other and the advertising on television isnt a problem ,14
14568,today most of the children aged  arent interested in playing outside because they prefer watching television ,17
14569," thats what most of the people think now a days but is it better to forbid the tv
i see the ",17
14570, about the missing time outside playing with other children running around in summer building snowmen in winter or playing with animals its very important to children to make friends but without going outside it isnt possible but why forbid watching tv at all i mean ,17
14571, i was little i was allowed to watch television but i had a limit and thats what children today need too when the have a limit they can go out too and make their expierences in the real world by the way not all shows in tv are dumb there are some really good shows ,17
14572, dora the children are learning english ,6
14573, watching the show also children can learn much about freindship helping each other or being courageous some people think watching television is bad for the childrens eyes well im not a doctor but ,17
14574, its that bad one more ,18
14575," against the forbid is its the todays world the world is full of tecnic so children should be allowed to live modern too 
",12
14576, my opinion about that statement is clear children should definitely be allowed to watch tv even in young age as long as its not the whole day i cant see the problem,17
14577,everyone saw advertisements for sweets and toys in television every company has the sweeter swts or the better icecream now theres the question if its fair to use unknowing children to sell their products in the following text ,16
14578," talk about this

adults are responsible for there child for there education and their consumation of modern media like television they have to tell their children tha they should not belive everything they see or hear in tv
if the children want to buy those toys they should do it otherwise theyll never learn ho to properly deal with money and our free market system in our capitalistic world
otherwise a child should have other problems than having to save money to buy the newest vidiogame represented as ",2
14579," calling good for them they should play outside and meet friends and play with them 
therefore its ruthless to start propaganda that five year olds always have to eat unhelthy stuff and play with rubbish produced in china

after all children shouldnt be an advertising target they often dont know how to deal with money or are to naiv to get the ",2
14580, that they get used for profit modern media shouldnt be a crime,15
14581,"everything has an effect on small children they want to imitate their surrounding it doesnt matter if its their parents strangers they meet or television advertisment all in all they are very easy to manipulate

14582," dont know what they really need they just want everything they see and dont have thats why advertisement directed  is very effective and commonly used

in america ",3
14583, only one out of 200 food advertisments on television is for healthy food but the other 199 are for sweets and fast food children will think that fast food and sweets are the main nutrition if the parents allow them to have these kind food ,2

14586, that bad television advertisment directed  should be banned but ,15
14587, all bad advertisment shouldnt be allowed for children not just television advertisment with bad advertisement i mean everything that doesnt benefit the childs life but good advertisement like the healthy food one should be allowed because it shows the children how to live a healthy life ,13
14588,when you watch television there is always that little thing disturbing you it is called advertising a couple of adverts take young children to sell their product a lot of people think that the use of children in television advertising is bad according to these people the adverts show a different image of the reality yet there are people who support this idea ,14
14589," they say the children only do it if they want to and if they have fun whilst doing it

many companies try to sell their products with the children playing in the adverts they want to show that the product spreads happiness and joy kids are a good way to express that they are happy about the little things in life and they dont think too much about an issue therefore i understand why they use children ",2
14590," buy something much more if the adverts shows happiness if the kid is having fun during it why should it be bad

unfortunately there are ",16

14592," the children not enjoying it anymore in addition sometimes the kid has a lot of pressure by his parents which want their child to become a star

at the end ",24

14604,nowadays television advertising is becoing more and more important as lots of people own such a device and use it daily with such a great popularity it is inevitable that the little children are going to watch tv from time to time ,14
14605," always want to make the biggest profit possible make use of this and develop advertisment specifically  the young children but should that really be the case

young children are easily influenced by their environment eventhough the tv advertisment isnt always showing the reality the children might perceive it as real life and ",14
14606, it doesnt turn out as they expected children between the age of 2 and 5 years dont think rationally ,7
14607, once they see something they want they wont think of anything else they consider neither the price nor the usefulness of the wanted thing another good reason to prohibit tv ads designed for young children could be that it wont even be the children who are going to decide whether to buy the product or not the advertising companies put a great pressure onto the parents who more likely will purchase the product ,14
14608, being begged by their kids ,9
14609, than watching another advertisment on the tv without the advertisment the children probably would not devote as much time to unoriginal merchandise of their favorite movie character or ,0
14610, children should not have everything they want just layed by their feet but ,9
14611, fight boredom in my opinion childdren should enjoy building a hut in the forest with their best friend much more than playing with the lates barbietm dolls their parents bought them because they coincidentally watched the ad out of boredom tv ads dont do any good to todays youth and if an advertisment has to be diredted to the children it should maybe be more like a pep talk to go out and play and not to buy a consumer product therefore ,0
14612, it would be justified if tv ads  should not b allowed,15
14613,"there are many advertisments s young children those usually include adverts for kids tv shows preschool necessities and toys the question of if it should be allowed or not is debatable

with advertisements directed at kids it is usually meant to give them more incentive to ask their parents to buy it for them people in marketing know that parents usually cant say no ",16
14614, their daughter or son is begging them for whatever it is they saw on the television the only real loss of this is the money that the guardians of the child spent but there are other ,9
14615, of advertising for children if kids see more of what they enjoy being displayed on tv ,14
14616, they will be more likely to watch more of it the concern here is that young children should not be spending a lot of time in front of a screen because their minds and bodies are ,17
14617, developing if we take that into consideration ,21
14618," there should definately be some regulation on advertisments for children

on the other ",16
14619, people have the right to advertise their products on television ,15
14620," they are for young children if the products were harmful to the children it would be something different but all that the toys and other products do is give children more entertainment since young kids are known for being hyper active and very easily bored this is very benificial to them

in conclusion i see no real reason why advertisments directed at children should be strictly forbidden i could ",16
14621, see the logic behind regulating them to some extent ,23
14622, that kids do not feel the need to sit in front of the tv all day,8
14623," the best way would be to have a nice mix any child should be able to watch a few minuets during the day his or her favorite series its not just that series make dumb there are a lot that actually really help children to learn something the child during the age of  has the most cappacity of learning something so if a child watches a show like dora where they are learning words from english why should that be bad 
there acutally have to be some boundries because if you let your child watch too much television it will become addicted and will forget about hisher social live that would probably be the worst because every kid should ",17

14626," just say it should immidiatly stop the child will become angry and begin even maybe to cry thats why there should be some boundries maybe one houre per day is enough
one other thing is that if you dont let your child watch any show it will not be able to talk with friends at school about any show and ",17
14627, it could become bullied by the other chidren,19
14628,"essay advertising 

many people think that advertising  influences their minds in a very negative way some even say its illegal manipulation because the mind of a small child is very fragile everything a young child sees influences his way of thinking his memorys and his habits for example if a child sees a spot where other children in his age violently destroy a doll the child autamatically wants to take part in the shown activity advertising becomes reality you could say 

first thing to say is that it wouldnt be fair for all the advertisement corporrations and industries its not possible to forbid it because everyone has the right to produce and show commercials no matter to whom plus at the end you are the one who decides what kind of programms your children are allowed to watch on the other ",13
14629, there would be a big ,19

14636, would be to specifically watch episodes of the childs favorite tv series on the computer there might be some commercials aswell but at least you can install an addblocker or something like that an other ,1
14637, of this methode is that you can control and therefor reduce a childs watching time so ,17
14638, you cannot forbid some kind of commercials and leave the others untouched there should ,15
14639, be a huge change in advertising or nothing ,11
14640,alright thats a really difficult statement to argue about so ,21
14641, lets find out what this statement means it means that young children between two and five years shouldnt be influenced by the television ,17
14642," they shouldnt watch tv 

if we say a child cant watch tv it plays with other untechnolized products which arent as dangerous as technology to find out some things a children shouldnt or to see something which can dramalize a young child but television canals mostly have some shows which are made for them and are helpfull to learn about our earth our world and the life which is waiting for the young guys
but a bad ",17
14643, of the television nowadays are the propagandas for all new playproducts a child can always see other cool and interesting things to play and cant see how much he already has at home so watching tv makes ones child unthankful and it wants always more they want some things which the parents maybe cant afford and as a gift for for the last christmaspresent they have a sad or angry child at home they shouldnt get ,17

in this reason it should be forbidden for the children and ",17

but if ",9
14647, ive manchened whatching tv shouldnt be forbitten but it should be in the sight of the parents ,17
14648, it wont be too much a day the parents should be aware what their child is doing and what hes watching,12

first of all young children shouldnt watch television at the age of  they should play around learn how to go learn how to speak and many more its not good to watch television or play games like our generation is doing at these days nowadays you see often children with iphones or ipads they waste their childhood with these electronic stuff as i was a child i played around with my sister or played soccer with my dad
but ",14
14651, good television programmes to learn english like dora or there are nowadays ,6
14652," apps on the television to learn to speak english or something else parents should only allow their children to watch these stuff and not stuff like normal television programmes with all these television adverts
producing television advertising ",17
14653, a money waste i dont think that they are going to understand a lot by watching these adverts because they arent ready to go on with what they see at this age but it ,0
14654, can be that they only recognize what they see for a example they see chocolate or something else ,3
14655," they consider on that thing to buy it but they do not recognize how bad it could be for them

in my opinion television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because the hard ",14
14656, is that they just should not watch television at this age the producers want to manipulate the brains of this young children with this adverts but i think its a money waste and a thing which makes no sense to me generally they wont understand anything or they just recognize the pictures and ,14
14657, that they consider to buy that what they saw because they dont understand if its good or bad to them,3
14658,enterprises do absolutly everything to sell more products one way to do it is by showing ads on tv there are advertisments on adult channels but there are ,11

mainly because the kid isnt aware of his behaivour ",4

young children can very easliy be manipulated with one way beeing television advertising if children constantly are spolied with adds of some toys ",14
14665, they most likely want their parents to buy them that specific toy this    ,20

also children often dont even think about what they had just seen on television and its likely that the advertising has hardly any influnce at all 
in my opinion television advertising  isnt dangerous in any way therefore ",14

besides that ",21
14696, putting up laws against that kind of problem seems to me like a waste of time and resources which we should use on more important subjects i belive that we should trust our society enough to let everyone deal with that kind of problem on their own ,12

we are living right now in a technical world and in the wealth areas of the world is a living without electric issues not possible or just not to think about the children nowadays grow up completly different than i did and ",14
14698, my parents didnt allowed me to watch lovely episodes like biene maya or pumuckel ,6

14700, because watching tv was always a time to relax but the films i watched were ,6
14701, lovely and there wasnt any violence to see but that was because we could only watch films and not surf through several tvchannels and thats the big different between these days and the old days these days its ,6

14703, they are theoretically able to watch the biggest bullshit in the tv and this could be very unhealthy for her mind the tv can have a lot of bad influence and im ,17
14704, glad that i dont watch tv anymore ,10
14705, the kids should play outside than sitting inside and watching tv or playing with a smartphone otherwise the kids cant build up a relation between themselves and the nature they dont get confronted with the reality and they will be allergic against many things of the nature but ,24
14706, a rule like this is coming up it should be controlled in a good way otherwise there are gonna be like two groups of children the ones who never watched tv befor and the other ones who are always talking about series and stuff,17

14708, it seems that its normal for usi could even say that it would be ,19

so back to the statement there is a lot of television advertising ",11

14711, young children see the advertisment they likely want to have this exact toy but ,20
14712, this is a good thing for the parents if they dont know what the ,9
14713," birthday present should be they can easily decide with these advertisments the children help the parents and give them some hints i used to do this with my parents too i told them what i saw on the tv or in the shops and they used to buy me the toy
 
on the other ",20
14714," it could be that the kids want lots of things and they dont stop complaining about it they get angry and sad and the parents cant find no other escape and they have to spend a lot of money for every single product which was shown in the tv that often happens today i see that with my neighbours daughter she gets everything she wants because she doesnt stop complaining about it

another negative ",2
14715, is that the children watch too much tv they want ,17
14716, see every new thing which is out on the market and they keep watching and watching they spend too much time watching tv than going out and playing with their friends i can clearly see that with my sister and her friends they would ,1
14717," watch some advertisements than going out even on a sunny day 

still many young children ",16
14718,  dont have a chance to go to a shop and look at things and buy it themselves they are too young and maybe the parents dont have much time  so the television advertising gives them a good possibility to see whats going on in the shops and on the market and they can make their wish lists for christmas much easier so its ,0

i ",9
14720, with the statement above because ,21
14721, television advertising means no harm to anyone every company and every shop needs to find a way to sell their products further ,15
14722, that they brainwash the childrens mind ,7
14723, the children got used to it and they dont even notice the advertisement anymore its ,16
14724, an easy way for the parents to find an accurate present for their children ,9
14725,"the young children should go out and play with other children they should discover the world and not wasting their time at home staring at the television because if they dont learn to go out that will never change human beings arent made to stay only at home and thats the biggest danger for the young children 

and ",17
14726," the uvrays can be dangerous for these we all know that the technology isnt very healthy for us thats a reason why we should short the using of technology

of course there is ",4
14727, a good thing of looking television ,10
14728, for kids so they can learn something new young children aged  are in the phase where they ,8
14729," must learn the language so television is a good thing to learn a lot of new words 

so im not definitively ",6
14730, with this statement it should not be disallowed but the parents should take care of the young children that they dont stare the hole day at the television,12
14731," with this statement 
tv adverstising  should be illegal young children cant buy the product the adverstising is for anyway so the advertising should be s their parents and not towards them this can be very problematic for the parents ",13
14732, they dont want to buy a certain product or cant afford it nowadays children are exposed to advertising everywhere so ,2
14733, tv should ot support this and make it worse ,10
14734, young children are very important customers and many factories produce tons of toys clothes and food only for them but ,9
14735," it should not be allowed to make advertising for someone who isnt able to buy something on themselves 

the tv advertising mostly shows things which kids dont necessarily need but it manipulates them ",13
14736, they believe they need it and they could make their parents big problems ,7
14737, begging for a toy or whatever tey saw on tv there could be a damage done in the happy family life ,20
14738, parents and children are fighting over something ugly like this ,9
14739," protect the family advertising should not be allowed
dependig on what the advertisement is it may ",13
14740, be unhealthy for a kid for example if its for sweets or games the young child wont understand this and be mad at the parents who are only caring about their child what im trying to say is that advertisment could make it difficult for parents to raise their kid the way they want and buy him or her the things they think it needs so ,16
14741," that the tv adverstisement should be  parents and not toard theit children



",13
14742,"now our days the young children watch a lot of tv and there are more and more television advertising  them which influence does it have of our future generation should we bane it

at ",14
14743," young children take example of what they see if they see other children playing with lego they want to do the same so they ask them parents to gave them one for their birthday or for christmas but no all parents have the money to buy what thier children ask to

on the other ",20
14744," if the television advertising is good it can show the children what they should or should not do for example an advertising showing children eating fruits and legums in this case it is good thing that the children do the same

nevertheless a young child has not the critising sense if he does not have the toy he saw on tv he would be very sade because in the television advertising the children were happy with this toy and he would think that if he does not have this toy he could not be happy

to conclude ",14
14745," we should bane commertial advertising directed to young childen on television
",13
14746,my personal opinion on this subject is that it should not be forbidden ,12
14747, its a good thingyoung children ,4
14748, from the ages  are easily manipulated once they see something in an ad they instantly want it this can be extremly annoying for the parents of these children as often the minors dont need the advertised products but they feel like they do many parents arent financially able to buy there kids everything they want and many ,2
14749, believe the dont need it ,19
14750, is that you can not forbid advertising for such a specific target group if you want to ban advertising for younger children ,13
14751, you have to ban advertising completly ,11
14752, it would be alright if some broadcast companies decided they dont want to show ads for minors becasue of their companies morals ,13
14753," that they should not be allowed completly the whole idea of advertising is to influence people and motivate the viewers to buy the advertisers products if anything advertiments for adults should be banned as theyactually have the financial power to buy what ever they want or what ever they think they want and what else shoud be shown on television channnels dedicated to children ads for shaving equipment tampons and washing powder no children should be allowed to watch ads directed at them 
bi ",13
14754, i was younger that i liked to watch ads ,11
14755, i knew i could never have the desired product kids like to dream and imagine and part of that is fantasising about birthday and christmas presents and of toys they will never have you could ,20
14756, argue that these young children learn that they cant have everything they want in life and it ,7
14757, forces the parents to be a bit stricter with their children and not give in and buy them everything meaning it teaches ,8
14758,"advertising  has been a critical topic for years it is a powerful meaning to speak directly to children and make them want things really bad that they didnt even know about five seconds earlier

but ",0
14759, arguing about whether advertisement is good or not ,11
14760, you need to make a difference between advertising for things that dont do no harm to children ,16
14761, toys or events for kids and things that really are bad for children fast food chains ,2
14762," like mcdonalds or burger king

since children dont have much experience they do not really know what is good for them and what is ",2
14763, unhealthy so if they see a funny advertising of mcdonalds in tv that overall even promises them a toy delivered with their happy meal they might feel the need to eat unhealthy things which is ,2
14764, bad children are easily influenced ,7
14765," it could be seen as dangerous to advertise for children

on the other ",16
14766, people so wouldnt not showing advertisements for them mean to kind of disrespect them moreover tv advertisements can have a good influence on children for example if you advertise a sports camp in tv that children all over the country can go to you motivate children to stay active and be healthy also toys arent ,14
14767," they dont have anything to do with people fighting and hurting each other

",21
14768, that advertising for children is a really difficult and complex topic there are things being advertised that at least ,16
14769, children should not be confronted with at all but they can ,12
14770, influence kids in a positive way ,8
14771, would be to simply decide for each advertisment whether it influences kids in a good or in a bad way the positive ones can be played ,0
14772, negative ones should be banned from tv but ,15
14773," who is going to decide which advertisements are good and which ones are bad


",11
14774,mom there was this super cool advertisement about the new lego police station can i please get it we have all heard children asking there parents about productspresented by advertisements television advertising toward young children is a big topicnowadays so the following essay is going to be about the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed  there are many pro and many contra,13
14775," end this essay with a conclusion

firstly you have to think about the strength of these advertisements they are in a way comparable to probaganda if a young child sees a advertisement by watching televicsion the ",11
14776," thing it is going do is to ask its mother about buying the products it has seen in the advertisement for instance the example in the introductiory part toy advertisements will lead the child to go and ask its parents to buy these presented toys the problem is that the child does not care about the financial situation  or the company that produces the toy so it can not set its own mind

secondly you have to think of young children watching television the problem is that it can not take up all the information seen as fast as adults do so if you have a toy company the best tactic is to show the costumers the product by advertising it so why should a toy company not show advertisements in the television of the products they sell to their customers compared to advertisements for unintresting products for a child for exymple a car it is nothing but fair that companies who sell product for children are allowed to place advertisements as well it is nothing but clever for the company because in one of five cases the advertisement will lead the parents to buy the product

summed up you  could say that television advertisements for young children are not good nore bad its a question of perspective on one ",0
14777, the company needs these television advertisements to sell their products on the other ,11
14778, it is not nice for the parents because the child wants the produts it sees by watching television ,17
14779, that television advertisements are a two sided story because for the companies they are needed to show their products but for the customers they are most of the time annoying ,10
14780, that young children better shoukde go outside and play,8
14781,television is good for learning things you can learn many things from the television but it matter whitch tv programm you are looking at it there are some tv programms which are good for learning things like galileo but there are ,6
14782, other series like kã¶ln 50667 which arent that good for the kids because they have many problems in this series when they look series like this ,6
14783, they think this is normal what they are doing in this series     ,3
14784, that young children shouldnt look television they should learn things from looking at the real life and outdoor in the nature its important to be in the nature with children because the sun and the air of the nature is very good for their health in young age you learn many things from looking at something ,8
14785," its better that the children learn from their own mother or father and not from the television because the parents of the kids can controll the things that they are making and in the television they cant 

so today its easyier to show the children tv programms ",17
14786, going out in the nature with them when you want to go out with the children it needs more time and today some parents havent enough time ,1
14787, so they show them the tv programm and havent to be ,3
14788, to their kids and looking for them ,19
14789,"most of the television advertising that is directed to children aged  is about toys unlike adults most children enjoy the advertisings between the shows as much as the tv show itself but is it corect to direct advertisings to little children 

a colorful and funny created advertising can influence a child a lot ",14
14790," a child in such a young age those children will beg their parents for unnecessary toys make their parents buy them realize that playing with those toys is not as exciting as shown in tv and beg their parents to buy them the toy in the new advertising it becomes a vicious circle 
additionally the child possibly enjoys those advertisings ",0
14791," watching those funny advertisings becomes more exciting than actually playing with the toys this could make the child want to watch more and more television and can lead to antisocial and lazy or even obese children

on the other ",0
14792, those advertisements have no direct harm if the parents can control the amount of their childs daily or weekly hours of television watching there is no risk of addiction for the child plus the advertisings are ,14
14793," a help for the parents to know what goods are on the market and which toys can actually educate their child for example the colorful pianos that have numbers and letters and each tile and make a sound with each button pressed help the child to learn in a funny way 
toy companies want to make people buy their toys ",20
14794," where else should they show their advertisements other than on childrens tv channels

all in all ",16
14795, it depends on the parents if they manage to control the influence the advertisings have on their children their shouldnt be a problem advertisings can ,16
14796, help the child and the parents to learn things or to know with what object the child can learn efficiently as long as the advertisings are appropriate there is no harm in entertaining little kids,0
14797,the intention of this essay is to say if television advertising  aged  should be allowed it is ,15
14798, watching television advertising always interrupts the best part of a film but what happens ,10
14799," children see direct advertising should there by a law for what they are allowed to see

on one ",16
14800, we all know that children are influenced by everything and quickly convinced about doing something they are even influenced by hidden intentions some of them better or even worse the tv industry is of a course a good media for advertise s the young people and can have a really bad influence on their habit as ,17
14801, the duration of watching tv through the day there should not be any erotic advertising on the television and ,15
14802," no war scenes in them
on the other ",19
14803," young children should not be left alone and their parents are responsible for what they are allowed to see it is not possible or at least not a good idea to control all the channels on tv because they have an intention that is definitely not always a harmful one additionally young children do not really care about what is on television between their favourite series even if the see an direct advertising most of the time they do not really understand  

to conclude from my ",17
14804, of view you can not control who will see the specific advertising and ,11
14805, it can not be prohibited in addtition parents have got the responsibility for their children and ,12
14806, for what they are allowed to see,12
14807,television today always includes advertisement which influences a human beinig in one way or the other to change his oppinion on certain topics ,10
14808," buying the newest gamebox or playstation in mediamarket should our youngest ones be influnced by this 
well as we all know children at that age arent capable of deciding what is correct or not they just believe and do everything you say without thinking about the ",2
14809, of there actions if a child gets provoked various times that it should jump out of a window because it might learn to fly like a bird at some ,8
14810," it would try so advertisment can be very dangerous 
but thank god at the moment ",11
14811," i know there are no such adverts 
what does appear on tv are toy adverts the kids program will be interrupted at one ",16
14812, and the kid will be shown an image of the latest toy often the same ad will reappear various times and with every ongoing one the child will be more and more influenced by it and the image of this specific toy is burnt into the childs memory so ,0
14813, this toddler goes shopping with one of its parents it will definitely ,9
14814," at its memorized and now recognized toy and will start demanding for it the child will make a fuss and not seldom the mother will give in and will purchase the demanded toy 
so the combination of a child watching a lot of television and a inconsequent mother revolves in loosing a lot of money
this might be called the downside of this argumentation
the upside or pro could be if the ads producers would remodel and ",0
14815," recreate the whole sense of an advert it could even be helpful for the parents
it could teach the children not to jump out of a window but well ",0
14816," it isnt an advert anymore i guess

my oppinion is that children at any age ",16
14817, young children shouldnt be  advertsing advertising is something for people over the age of 10 because they can make their opinion and dont just watch it and think this are nice people in this this promotion of a product young children ,16
14818, they just wanna have the things from the advertsing ,11
14819, their parents always have to say no its not chrstmas or your birthday but ,9
14820, there is the problem that all parents want to be good parents and often give the children the present ,9
14821, that is fine for the children and ,12
14822, for the company where they bought the product from but for the wallet of the parents its not the best thing a big problem is ,9
14823, the young chidren cant separate from the reality or from the advertising young children ,8
14824, think everything what they see on television is true but the company behind a promotion is often work with tricks because they know exactly that they can manipulate young children and that is the ,2
14825, where i think its not ok because young children get something like a brain manipulation from the television there is probably one ,17
14826, where i think that is ok ,18
14827, they promote something like a fun arkk ,18
14828, it is ok because that is not something materialistic it isinsteadsomthing where the whole family can have fun a theend i think advertsing is bad for young children but there are ,16
14829,"advertising

im absolutely not ok with the ",11
14830, much ads in thelevisions for children and ,16
14831, it would be absolutely ok if the gouvernment would forbide that its really a shame that such young children are confronted daily with televisionads that want to influence them to want ,12
14832, this new baby born or the fastes toycar children cant decide whats necessary or good for them they just see that ad and suddenly they want this new thing really bad on the other ,2
14833, we could say that were living in this new kind of world and that were confronticed with these kind of things on a daily bases is just normal so because of that ,21
14834, it should be much more important to inform parents about these subjects when we have to accept the worl as it is its much more important to make a change there where it acually helps there are a lot of parents who leave their children expecally in the holidays for hours in front of the television this is probably the biggest problem because ,17
14835, they wouldnt do that the children wouldnt be confronted with such television ads and ,13
14836, probably the producers would stop to produce ads for children because none of the chidren whold watch them so maybe its not the right way to forbide these ads but change our habits and expecially help the parents who just dont know it better than leave their children in front of the tv ,14
14837, these would be absolutely the better way maybe it could ,19
14838, of them when we could minimize these ads and ,11
14839, help the parents to be with their children and go outside with them to do things together and things like this would probably be the best ,1
14840,"i understand that companies make advertisements to reach more people and sell more products 
but ",11
14841, i once watch a great movie on tv and there is constant advertising it takes away all the fun and the tension of the movie when i see advertisement it has to be really great to make me consider buying the product this mostly isnt the case advertisement towards really young children is bad the advertisement doesnt even have to be good ,0
14842, it shows a toy and what can be done with it its enough for the children to want it young children are easily fooled by whats portrayed on tv i ,20
14843, believe that this should be forbidden kids should walk into a store and get the toy they like most just based on colors appereance and pictures ,20
14844, that it is really their toy and really something they want they shouldnt walk into a store and look ,20
14845," exact toy theyve seen on tv they might not even like the toy too much but if its shown on tv its cool and will probably make the other kids jealous 
in todays world were ",20
14846, easily manipulated by what we see on the internet and the tv ,7
14847, its a shame to start manipulating people from such a young age thats why i really am against advertisement towards children but not just towards children aged  ,16
14848, advertisement towards children up to the age of ten should be forbidden or at least reduced that might be a bit harder to control because children that age might already watch programs that are not s such a young audience ,13
14849,children aged  are learning the bases of their life ,8
14850, knowing wether something is good or bad advertisments could strongly influent those bases and ,11
14851, it could possibly change the childrens behaviour its impossible to avoid advertisments and because of that advertisments should have to go through several tests ,16
14852," even advertisments which target an adult audience can sometimes manipulate children

one main reason ",16
14853, is that the statemens would only forbid television advertising but social media is way more dangerous there are many five year olds who know how to use ,13
14854," they could possibly see things  advertisments which arent for their age those pegi 18 or fsk 18 messages wont help parents should be forced to turn on a child safety mode and companies should be forced to supervise their ad system

the worst thing that ads do is that they transmit subliminal messages young children cant really think for themselves ",16
14855," they try to copy things around them and because of that they are greatly manipulated by such messages

sadly im missing too many ",3
14856, to give a more in depth explanation but i know ,21
14857, that there are many studies out there aboubt manipulation through subliminal messages subjects were shown a movie wich had some frames containing a bucket of popcorn here and ,21
14858, and their lust for popcorn was way higher than ,19
14859," watching the unmodified movie

summary
i ",18
14860, advertisments even with a target audience  should not be forbidden just more supervised the statement should ,11
14861, include every kind advertisment not just the ones being on television  ,11
14862, in my opinion television advertising for young children isnt neccessary at all because it would be better for them if they would play outside and dont waste their time in front of the tv another negative ,14
14863," is that it has got some bad influences on children f ex if they see an advertising about a cool toy theyre asking their parents if they could buy it 
",2
14864, it would be a lot better if the parents would give them some magazines with toys in it first of all it is much more natural ,20
14865, advertising in television and the parents know what they are looking at the worst ,2
14866, about advertising in televsion is that there are ,10
14867," many new toys and each of them is presented in an advertising video this causes that kids want all of them which could be very annoying for their parents 
back to the option with the magazine if the kid sees something interesting it could ask their parents if they could buy it now there are two options for the parents ",20
14868, going to a store or buying it online the ,18
14869, because the kid is having a real life experience if the parents order it online it is kinda lame because the only interesting thing is that there is a package in the briefcase but ,20
14870, that ordering online is the best option for young adults and adults because its much more flexible ,23
14871," going to stores every time 
me as parent would allow my kids to watch tv for 30min a day which ",1
14872," is pretty normal this time another option is to buy them something like a gameboy or ipod on which they can play games without advertising 
as i mentioned ",24
14873," the best option is to spend time outside with his kids and not let watch them tv allday long
",1
14874, with the statement that television advertising should not be allowed by young children at ,13
14875, that children at the age of  are too young to know many things about the world they live in a world full of many other children and they have no idea what is really going on so ,7
14876," they should do other things than beeing in a television advertising they should go outside play with friends and have fun 
everytime i look tv and i see young children are in a television advertising i ask myself if that is you what would you do ",14
14877, i would never be in a television advertising ,15
14878, young children should be free and they have to enjoy life to the fullest because ,12
14879, you get older you will go to school every following day at the afternoon you have to learn and you have to do your homework when you get older you have to work harder you cant play with other children the whole day and there are many other things that arent really great ,8
14880, youre older and you would like to do other things than going to school or going to work you can decide if you want to be in a television advertising at the age of  you cant decide if you want to or not ,14
14881, at this age the parents decide what things the children are doing because of these examples i have written i say that television advertising  young childred at the age of  should not be allowed,13
14882,everybody who have a televsion knows it how it is ,10
14883, you will watch a serie or a interesting film and every thirty minutes it comes a advertising about three to five miunutes that can realy goes on your nervs but it is allowed is it ,10
14884," a good idea to screen adversting 
the young children are in this age in the part where they get away of their parent they bigin to distance to their parent and are more and more independence for example they can walk alone eat alone and speak this time they want to explore the life and make a lot of new experience when they watch television they cant unterstand everything but ",17
14885, they get older they unterstand more and more so ,24
14886, they see an advertising and it looks pritty they realy want it so they have desire for the birthday present or for christmas an other ,3
14887," is that they see new things for spending their time for example a new game
on the other ",3
14888, easy for the parents beacause ,9
14889, the advertising is very pritty ,11
14890, the children want it and asked everytime their parent to buy it so it can goes realy on the nerfs a negative ,20
14891, is that the children dont realy know what it is but it looks nice and on the adverting it looks very funny ,20
14892, they want it they realy get manipulated they dont realy follow their own interest you should ,3
14893, take care if the adversting is for the age of this children or not dont forget that some children get bored very fast ,24
14894," they see often advertising an not the serie or what they want to look so they easy make stupid things

all in all it isnt easy to say if it should be allowed or not it gives alot negative ",15
14895, but without the advertisig the television would have problem with the finance because with the advertising they can pay alot of the cost and for the people it is less expensive ,10
14896, it should be a bit less advertising but n,11
14897,"advertising on television is a huge deal it is really useful for enterprises using this offer because they get the possibility to reach hundreds of people to convince them to buy exactly their chocolate their toothbrush or their chair

at the age of a child your ability of learning things is the biggest ",0
14898, advertising to children is very useful for example the kinder surprise an ,0
14899,that is made of chocolate with a little toy inside actually the perfect combination first eat the chocolate ,18
14900, build your toy of the parts that are delivered and have fun mc donalds uses this kind of advertisement in the exact same way in its happy meal you find some fries other food and a drink and probably most importantly the toy food is not the only way to advertise children but ,0
14901," it is he most likely way the most important thing is that children see some funny thing a big amount of colors and characters no matter if they are real or invented having fun

advertising to children is bad children get to see some products that they instantly want to buy you might wonder why children watch adevetisements they are probably not allowed to switch the channel because their parents told them not to so the little boys and girls are sitting in front of their televisions watching the advertisesment and storing all the information in their heads when they go shopping the ",0
14902," time they kick up a fuss if they do not get what they want

the problem is that without advertisements television channels could no longer exist where would they get their money from in my opinion advertising directely to children is a very mean thing but there is no possibility to stop it it would make no sense do advertise shaving utils coffee or cars on a childrens tvchannel if an enterprise did that they could equally just heat their headquarters burning money so ",14
14903," advertising to children is part of the business its a bad part but unfortunately an irreplaceable part
",16
14904, young children return from school the ,8
14905, thing they do is to ask mum can i watch tv pleeeaaase nowadays as there is a tv in almost every house children are used to spend a  lot of their time watching tv and ,1
14906, advertisement now one can ask if advertising shouldnt be allowed as young children are very in fluencable of which many advertisments take ,16
14907, which support the opinion that children shouldnt be allowed watching tv advertising ,13
14908, the age of five as many parents tend keep them busy by letting them watch tv and ,24
14909, that they have some time off to run the houshold or make a break additionallynowadays one cannot watch tv without simoultanously watching advertisment young children are very easily influencable and it is later noticable in their shopping habits ,1
14910," they spend a lot of time watching advertising
on the other ",10
14911, which claim the opposite oppinion for instance if the children have never been allowed to watch tv advertising ,13
14912, they tend to get addicted to it ,3
14913, are as five years is ,18
14914, very young they might be that fascinated that they only want to buy the things advertised and at a age of five children might convince their parents buying the things at an age of two they are not as the parents can tell them off and they get used to dont get everything they want to have further in this time now the media plays a bigger and bigger role when the children are used to it and its influencing qualities ,2
14915, a very young age they wont have much problems coping with it later in addition advertisement toward adults would be ,24
14916," allowed which can be very disturbing for children
in conclusion ",12
14917, it is not too cruel or exaggerated and wont harm the children mentally ,8
14918, that the children can get used to it and wont be too much influenced later on but as a parent you should limit the time a child spends watching tv,17

banning advertisement targeting toddlers

lately there has been some controversary concerning advertisements which target children aged  since it has become a daily routine that from a young age toddlers watch television they cannot get around watching advertisement but how could this affect those children and does this even influence them

it is commonly known that these days television overall has a big influence on young children there is a risk that they will not able to distinguish the invented world from reality that means that as soon as they see an advertisement trying to sell toys they will think it is essential to have one ",14
14920, in a way companies can use advertisement to manipulate the viewers but that is no new thing the difference to adult advertisement is that parents these days are often spoiling their kids if a toddler comes and asks them to buy a toy they will be more willing to do ,16
14921," than to buy themselves a pair of trousers or a new television

another ",3
14922," worth considering is that in advertisements everything tends to be depicted in an almost perfect way if a young child sees this and compares it to his enviroment he or she might realize certain differnces and start preassuring the parents another possibility could be that it starts to feel uncomfortable and unhappy with the living conditions studies have proved that unhappyness and a demanding attitude at a young age can 
make the child depressive during adulthood and prevent it from performing his or her function in society

to summarize the problem it is clearly visible that advertisement can have devastating influences on a toddler however it is ",2
14923, very dependent on the amount of time it spends in front of the television and how closely it is under the supervision of the parents banning advertisement targeting young children probably would not solve the problem ,14
14924, affected by those who have adults or youngsters as a target group,7
14925,every child starts to speak at the age of 2 ,24
14926," why it should not be allowed to watch advertisment which are dedicated towards the young among us they can improve there visual and speaking skills through those interesting advertisment

 it does not seem like that they were capable to buy stuffs or even advertise for it at this age in many cases children are ",13
14927, trapped in a social media world every child nowadays has more contact with their tablets as with sport materials for long periods it could ,24
14928, effect the brain and nerves they will get quick furious and nervous if we would ban to watch televison or play video games for a loner period it could ,4
14929, cause many diseases at this young age many of them will suffer from brain and nerve diseases those are really rare cases but its ,4
14930, possible advertsiments are good prepartions for school they can expand your vocabulary and your memory skills will increase in those advertisment streaming time children ,0
14931, have the possibility to got to the toilet or help their mother ,24
14932," otherwise they will stuck with the sofa and wont let their concentration rubbed by anyone they will recognize something at the grocerie store  that they saw on tv and wont let go until you will buy them whatever it is 

in my opinion we should not ban the advertising for children at the age of  because its unnecessary to do it and let them look what they want your job is to entertain them nothing else in this century we do not know ",16
14933, the world is gonna end ,18
14934, let them live their live we have other problems to look ,19
14935, all i can say is sip some lean and chill it will take time to find back,18
14936,"many advertisements on daytime television are s children whether it is the newest nerf dart gun or a hot wheels toy car track the same childrens adverts are broadcast time and time again on various channels in an attempt to persuade children to persuade their parents to buy a certain product however is it really fair to direct advertisements towards very young children 
a giant portion of the toy market exists because of television advertising many toy companies ",14
14937, nerf or hot wheels practically only exist and can only sell their products and stay in business thanks to their success in advertising these particular advertisements are mostly s older children aged approximately seven to ten years old however there are ,0
14938," ads with a younger target audience they are similarly successful and help to support a large part of the market for childrens toys the market for young childrens toys is very large and it requires the demand caused by ads
however the method by which these adverts are successful is not entirely ethical  they take ",0
14939, of young childrens gullibility and make them believe that they absolutely have to have the product being advertised  needless to say over time it can become boring and annoying for parents dealing with their children constantly begging for an overpriced piece of plastic which will be used once and ,2
14940," put on a shelf for the rest of its existence if the parents relent and buy their child what they want once it happens again and again  the child gets used to getting what it wants and the parents waste their money
advertising s very young children itself can ",20
14941," be a waste of time and money  at the age of two a child can barely speak let alone understand a television advert and convince their parents to buy them things
in conclusion television advertising  takes ",14
14942, of the childrens naã¯vetã© and even ,8
14943, doesnt always reach its target audience that is why i believe that it should not be allowed,15
14944,young kids are easy to influence if you tell them something they will most likely believe it so you can tell them they will never have real fun if they dont get that toy they will want it even if they dont really like the thing they want the fun they see in the advertisement so they will go to their parents and ask for it if they are lucky they will get it but the dissapointement is big ,20
14945," they realise that its not exactly the same as the tv showed them so advertisement for toys for children at that age should not be allowed

producers use tricks to get the attention of the kids children like bright colours music and loud enthusiastic voices so the producers just have to make a really colorfull advertisement to get to the children even better is ",0
14946," they use a personifcated animal or character they can identify themselves with we can see manipulate children isnt that difficult and the question is do we really want our children to be manipulated this way

the concentration of little kids is not realy long they focus on something but it gets boring very fast its more contraproductive to buy a child everything it wants ",2
14947, it plays with it only two times another case is food advertisement for kids like juices or things like that if we buy this the thing we buy will be consumed ,20
14948, its not just lost money if they like it great we can buy it again but if not the kids will know it ,9
14949, they see the advertisement the ,11
14950," time and dont want it that bad anymore they may just enjoy the advertisement

so for my opinion advertisement for young children should only be for food ",16
14951, the children can really play with things they have fun with and not just play with something someone told them it was fun the food is not a waste of money and the chance the children can get it is bigger and if they dont like it the parents just dont buy it again if a kid doesnt like a toy they will have it and wont play with it anymore ,20
14952, we can say that that is a waste of money toys can be seen at toystores where they often can try it and see if they like it ,20
14953,television advertising is often an issue ,10
14954, it is  some people argue it shouldnt be allowed anymore others ,12
14955," and which is the right way to go a search for answers in form of an essay

young children are the most vulnarable human beings in our society since they dont have a value system or a guiding vision ",7
14956, they are in danger of being manipulated too much by television advertising this because they do not know what is right or wrong they are ,7
14957, building up their value systems if now advertising tells them this is good for you you must have it they could just believe it  without being aware of the ,3
14958, risks and meanings of buying that product this may on the ,23
14959, glance does not seem to be a very disturbing thing but what if the children are manipulated with longterm effects what if they  ,7
14960, theyve grown up   become easymanipulatable adults who are just part of a consumptionsociety which  unaware of its doing  is just ruled by advertising and media the way to go is a law against advertising towards too young children affected are anyways just children aged 25 ,16
14961," it is not a very large loss for advertisers

it is inappropriate to claim for a law against advertising children aged 25 do not watch tv the entire day and ",13
14962, they do they just watch childrenseries those series are designed for children ,6
14963, is the advertising it is harmless for children it ,16
14964," shows them interesting products and the wide world and anyways if the governament prohibited advertising for youngchildren how should they control if children watch tv with adultadvertising or not a law against children advertising is notpracticable and useless it even would cost jobs

",14
14965, it is right that one can no,21
14966,advertising is something that we are confronted with every day of our lifes there are posters at the trainstation people that call us to ask if we want to buy their product and ,11
14967, there are countless spots on tv in between shows and movies short videos promote products and tell us why we need to have them most ads are about cars laundry soap or shampoos but there are ,11
14968, toys or stuffed animals that are shown in these little clips this kind of advertising is  there are ,20
14969," for and against tv advertising toward young children

young kids do not really have an idea of how those commercials are made to influence them children usually just see something on television and if they like the product that is advertised they want to have it regardeless of how much it costs they do not know that the commercial is made to make them want a product and that often these tv spots are really exaggerated kids are not aware of how much a television ad can influence them 

also businessmen are taking adventage of this group of young people we all know how children can be ",14
14970," they want something at the grocery store they sream at their parents and throw a fit because they dont realize how much things cost and how important it is for parents to mange thir budget even if adults tell them that something is expensive they can not understand why they do not just buy it for them so tv commercial  is not fair toward the parents really 

kids ",2
14971, already have to take in a lot of information from the media they have an information overflow everyday from their phone tablet or television so tv commercial s them makes it even harder to deal with this overwhelming amount of infos it is hard from them to know what is real and what is a commercial and not to be taken ,10
14972, kids will be confronted with commercial their whole lifes it is ,0
14973, important for them to learn how to know the difference between a commercial and a tv show ,0
14974, when they see advertising from a young age it might make it easier for them to see how the commercials influence them at a later ,0
14975, television commercial toward young children should not be allowed ,13
14976, they already have an overflow of information and with televison advertising this overflow is increasing ,10
14977,"heres my overwhelming essay on advertising for young kids fasten your seatbelts and be ready to read my opinion

so here we are discussing whether television advertising  children should be allowed or not obviously children of the age  couldnt really understand what advertising is they cant even understand it because they mostly not even know how television really works ",13
14978, that children of the age of five years or younger souldnt even watch television ,17
14979, going outside and explore nature so the advertisment for the little kids would only aim to the parents ,0
14980, they buy the products for their children ,2
14981, that television advertising as a whole should be minimized and maybe even should be forbidden for fucks sake do we really watch tv for the advertising to see what i could buy if i wanted to or even better what i should buy because without it i cant really enjoy life as i could with this product no this is ,15
14982, the main reason why i barely not watch tv at all the advertising is annoying as fck and in the news they only talk about famous people doing shit about i dont fcking care so back to the youngsters i dont think its a good idea to make advertising for little kids only ,16
14983, the parents are more or less forced to buy that new super mega magnificient marvellous product for their young kids for the only reason that they can see its nearly the same as all the others because i have this kind of ,2
14984, of view on tv and advertising i can only say that i dont think advertising is needed at all either we need something or we dont the only thing advertising os good for is that we buy things we dont reeeeeaaaaalllyyyy need to so we spend money on things we dont need to impress people we dont like with money we dont have ,15
14985," you should spend our money on the things we need to life a good life and not this kind of stuff we dont even have a use for and if you should have to much money why dont invest it in investment goods like in stocks houses or even just simple trade market buy things and sell it see profit sometimes i see things in advertisments or in shops and think by myself who the  would buy such a s advertising is needed because if someone doesnt suuport advertising his product wont be that succesfull so he wont make money out of it so he has to g with the flow and advertise too the amount of money spent in advertising is ridicoulously high and this for the use that people can see what brand is in trend right now rest in piece capitalistic world nothing against capitalism but this site of capitalism is really useless you spend money as a factory on something that doesnt pay off 
nonsense 

it was me a pleasure 
",23
14986,"someone gave us a statement to comment and you wont believe what happened
scroll down for the whole stroy no clickbait

























televison advertising is a major concern in the last few years ",10
14987, it has evolved quite strongly for example are nowadays ,21
14988, descreet messages to be found in advertising accordion to certain groups this is very harmful to children between ages two and five this text will show a some counterarguments to that statement ,16
14989," better buckle the fuck up motherfuckers and be prepared for this boredominfused lit af writing extravaganza

a major concern is that children exposed to advertisement directed to them will create whishes which can not be always fulfilled by the parents this pushes the cildren to spend more money as soon as they have some to spend ",14
14990, the want to fulfill all the wishes their parents could or would not fulfill ,9
14991," concer may be that toddlers are easily influenced by televisiion and advertisement

the problem wiht banning television advertisement for toddlers is that one cannot define clear borders for directed content and even advertisement directed to adults will most certainly influence children aswell now they could say that ",14
14992, ads on childrens tv programme should be banned but ,13
14993, the question arises how the channels would make money ,10
14994, keep the service going furthermore will the improtance of television advertising fall ,10
14995, the importance of the television fall and even young children will ,17
14996," grow up with the internet than with televisions therefore we could say that banning television advertising directed to children aged  is not the best we can do to protect our children from advertising

in the end we could say that televison advertising to children has a influence on them but its influence is falling and we should ",13
14997, concentrate on protecting our children from harmful advertising in the internet or ,13
14998, in modern mediums in my opinion the supporters of the ban have a ,12
14999, but they focus their concerns on the wrong medium ,3
15000, tvs have lost in importance as seen in one south park episode where cartman becomes a internet star and there is a christmas special to do something and one of the kids stars a petition to save the televison ,10
15001, thats what brought families together the best,1
15002, with this statement one reason for this probably the strongest reason is that children are more oblivious to the marketing techniques of brands and companies they cant ,2
15003, grasp what is true and what is a lie and ,21
15004, what they want and what they dont children that young usually dont have a sense for the worth of money they just see it as this awesome paper stuff that you trade in for things you actually want lacking that feel for the worth of money theyll spend all of their pocket money on useless junk or nag their mothers and fathers or other relatives ,9
15005, matter to buy this garbage for them this could lead to parents hating a brand or company because they would associate it with the annoying and embarrassing times ,2
15006, their children wouldnt stop nagging them to buy something in the supermarket ,9
15007," that is something advertisers should consider

another reason to why television advertising shouldnt be targeting young children is that the brain of those young individuals ofthe human species ",14
15008, have a relatively neutralunopinionated shapable and absorbing brain theyll take in any sort of information like a sponge absorbing water thats a good trait for learning languages but a terrible trait considering advertising as theyll get hooked to a brand at a very young age the brands they learned to love ,8
15009, wearing diapers would be like demigods to them whilst any other brand would look like a twolegged donkey with leprosy this would eventually lead to only a few companies dominating the free market and any other company to go bancrupt those monopolies would allow companies to manually and artificially inflate the prices for their goods which itself would probably lead to a mass starvation in the entire western worldas nobody would be able to afford the cost of food anymore ,23
15010," leading the world into an age of darkness and throwing our society into an apocalyptic state of anarchy

alright maybe ive exaggerated the impact a bit but to my excuse i had to come up with something more to write to get up to 300 words",21
15011,many young children aged  watch a lot of television because of that some companies started to focus their television advertising directly to this young children this started many discussions about advertising and our society should the gouvernement interups  stops these type of discussions should it forbid television advertising  than ,14
15012, the problem and the discussions are away however is this the right way that are the questions ,21
15013," look at

it is absolutly true that television advertising  is profitable not many parents can say no to their children if they want something new to play like a new barbie or a little car ",14
15014," if the children wish that for christmas or for their birthdays

however that ",9
15015, for example that the children want to many of new things to play or if they want something which is not good for them but the advertising said it is good that is the thing ,2
15016, look at in this paragraph young children can be easily be influenced and they change their opinion rapidly when you use something they like as a help ,7
15017, a comic figure like olaf from the movie frozen you can sell everything with this help to children parents use this method ,20
15018," their child does not want to eat broccoli but it work with everything

when the gouvenement forbids television advertising s young children than the companies will search another way to contact these children because they do not want to lose this financial source of profit",2
15019, the television is a normal thing today and it belongs to the childhood so it isnt an good idea to take this away its just good if the children learn how to deal with things like this we live in a world where the people have to accept the developement of new things and this will ,17
15020," be an important thing for the future 

television advertising should not be allowed because the skills of young children could become worse television makes children unconcentrated and nervous so in school the children cant make good marks and their future is in danger

but television advertising isnt that bad if you have some laws over a short part of time it havent any bad ",15
15021," it helps the children to develope their minds and creativity they get new ideas and learn how to put them into reality

another ",8
15022, is that the health could become bad the eyes are an important area so in the worst case the parents of the children have to buy some glasses or the children have to go to the doctor this have ,4
15023," for the future of the children

so as a conclusion ",8
15024, that television advertising toward young children isnt that bad but we have to take care of our children because everthing have ,13
15025, for their future so its our task to make laws and to control the consumation of television of course its important that we have a look on what our children are watching and in which amount,17
15026,television advertisements can manipulate those who believe everything they hear and dont think by themself that is exactly what children are because the hippocampus in our brain evolves only in our teenage years and thats ,14
15027, we learn to think weigh out ,18
15028, make decisions and take responsibility for ourselves or even for others so a pro statement is ,21
15029, that children can get easily manipulated to buy stuff or even to do things and that television advertisements can be dangerous for them and by saying they get manipulated to buy stuff i mean that they ask their parents to buy stuff and they will probably buy them becuase they want to please their children and make them happy another ,2
15030, is that irony and puns are often used in advertisements and young children dont understand these jokes and could think that it is meant in a true way for example there is one television advertising where a man hits every guest at his grill party because they say something he doesnt like this is meant in a funny and sarcastic way but children who see this will think that hitting other people is fine or a advertisement that probably everyone knows the one from snickers where someone is a monster or a diva and ,0
15031, they eat a snickers they become a normal person again children will take this ad literally and maybe think that ,2
15032, you eat a snickers you will become magically something else than you were ,18
15033," with the example of snickers this taking everything literally is not dangerous but i believe that it could be dangerous in other examples of advertisements 
as the contra part of the statements there is one that shouts privacy and another one shouts self developoment of personality you could say that it belongs to the term of privacy that every parent can decide whether they want their children to see some television advertising and learn to outweigh the truth of them by themself or if they dont want to show these dangerous puns to their children until they are old enough to outweigh it and some may believe that its the best way to learn how to get puns and to develop their personality for their child 
but ",16
15034, about it i cannot remember any advertisements from tv channels for children in switzerland i believe it should not be allowed to put advertisements on channels for kids between the shows and movies that young children watch but ,13
15035, you watch tv as a parent or an older brother or sister and a yound child is watching too you should pay attention to the ads that show and that you tell the child what is exactly going on there ,14
15036,"advertising 

nowadays you see advertisment everywhere on billboards in the streets in newspapers and on television youngsters aged  are in an age where they play with dolls cars and many other different things when they see something they like they will not stop asking their parents to buy it until the parents give in and fullfill their wishthe problem is that children this young do not know what is necessary to have and what is not  often the brandnew bought thing is cool for a week and ",2
15037," it lays around in the childrens room and is not noticed they do not think if they could need it they just want it or not

",20
15038, that it should be forbidden to direct television advertising to children because it will only remind them of what they do not have ,13
15039, what they have it teaches them not to be thankful but to always want more and new things ,3
15040, the old one probably would have ,18
15041, functioned suddenly everything they have is not good enough anymore unfortunately the new thing once ,19
15042, will be too old or not useful anymore ,23
15043," newer version has to be bought it is a circle of buying being satisfied for a short period seeing the advert of something new wanting that and buying it and it will not stop as an adult maybe you think that if you buy this one thing it will make you happy but the truth is that you will never be truly happy because there will always be something better

it is an ilusion to think that it is possible to ban television advertising for children but a step would be to not let ones children watch to much television and ",2
15044, go outside with them to play soccer or hide and seek as a parent you should teach your children to appreciate ones ownings and not to buy the newest stuff because as a parent you are a rolemodel and your children will mostlikely treat their things similar as you do built a tree house with them or anything else because selfmade things are much better than if you always ,1
15045,"a lilltle child is sitting on the couch and is wachting tv on the tv comes a tv ad which shows us a fat lady who drinks a cup of a protein shake after one week she is slim like an model so the child asks her mom to buy her the same because she want to be like this lady so the ad has a big influence on the cild is it positive or negativ for thechildren and for the society

the ",0
15046," for this statement is that the children would  be influence by the ad actors and the theme of the ad for exemple there is a ad with for a video game when a child watch it he would be subborn and would ask his parents to buy him that ofcoure its a profit for the company but for the parents is acutally a loss because they will spent their money and the child will only play the video game and wouldt concentrate on anything which can lead to medical problems like problems with eyes and pyscology problems

the thing is that in the tv ad they praise the product which is their job and the quality would be shown as high but ",0
15047, we buy it the product would be awful and low market the children would be very excitied to buy the thing but ,2
15048, the bought it they would be disappointedfor exemple the mcdonalds ad the burger looks ,11
15049," we go to the raustrant it wolud look deadful and messy and the childer will be adicted to these ad they belive all what the admakers say 

the contra ",16
15050, is that the children will have a picture of life it means they would improve their general knowledg so ,8

15052, we stop the children by watching adsthey would build a curiosity to know what it actucally is this would lead to many problems for exemple the children would get curios for everything they see which is some time very difficult to controll so ,14
15053," we let them to watch itthis problem owuld not be here

so i would say that we schould allow childern for watching tv ads but there is a limit i wouldnt permit the children to watch awfull ads but i think by watching ads the childern would learn somehow little things but i will definitly say that allowing children to watch ads is a very good medicine to build their general knownledg and they would get some freedom by that and would feel controlled  ",14
15054,with the upcoming digitalization and the frequent use of television and the internet it is normal for children even of a ,24
15055," young age to watch a lot of tv they might be enjoying a cartoon but the frequent advertisement pauses will eventually be s them in this essay it will be discussed whether television advertising toward children of the ages  should be allowed or not 

firstly if parents let their kids watch television programmes by themselves it can not really be controlled whether they are exposed to and influenced by television ads parents would have to be with their kids ",14
15056, watching television and not let them see the advertisements in between the actual programme to avoid that their children are influenced however one could argue that if parents let their kids watch television in the ,17
15057," place they must be okay with them being influenced by different advertisements 

another ",11
15058, that one might bring up is that the advertisement probably isnt s the children but towards their parents in other words are children even affected by seeing the advertisements in tv it is said that children can not possbibly be influenced because they are not directly the customers of the stores and brands placing the adverts opposing to this one could say that children who see an advert in television could be telling their parents to buy or consume whatever was shown in the advertisement which would ,13
15059," indirectly lead to the parents being influenced by the television ad 

in coclusion it can be said that parents ",0
15060, as the adplacing companies have an influence on whether children are affected by the advertisement or not in my opinion parents should pay attention to what their kids are watching but it is not really necessary to forbid television advertising completel,14
15061, children play with ipods ipads iphones or if they look tv all day in live its better and in school ,17
15062, children should go out and play with other children in nature hike and seek is much bether for the growing up of children ,8
15063, looking tv if the children are always looking tv ,17
15064, they dont learn anything countable for their later life shortly said they get worse playing games like monopoly or memory on a ipad is not the same like playing the real game with real figures television adverstising is not forbidden it shouldnt be forbidden but it should give a maximum of time where children can use it the time should be limited because to much of television advertising is bad for children a pro is that children can learn from it but its not the same learning process like ,17
15065," you learn it by doing also the contact with other children could get lost because you dont actually need other children to have fun with a television you dont need stron books
",17
15066, television advertising should be allowed for young childrenaged but it should be limited because with books you learn better and quicker ,13
15067,it is a well known ,18
15068, that advertising a specific product will boost sales and ,11
15069, increase profit at big events ,23
15070, the superbowl companies fight over advertising space and time they know that be able to advertise during such events will profit their company because of this they are ,10
15071," willing to pay a lt of money for just a few seconds on tv or a little space in the stadium the following text will discuss if television advertising  should not be allowed 
the ",15
15072, that advertising towards adults increases sales shows that adults are not resistent to the manipulation advertisments bring with them if only children would be manipulated by advertising ,16
15073," companys might not advertise anymore because if would not be profitable anymore 
however the main difference between children and adults is experience and rational thinking because of this you could argue that children are easier to manipulate meaning that companies would use childrens innocence to make a profit 
but you shouldnt forget that most or even all children aged  ",16
15074," live at home with their parents and do not have a lot or even any money young children will always have to convince their parents to buy them something so in reality young children can not really be manipulated into boosting sales for companies
in conclusion i believe young children and ",2

i havent seen much television advertisings ",15

15081, we see television advertisings which are shown to children on programmes made for children and there the children normally watch without their parents in this case it depends on what kind of advertising it is when its advertising for a toy or a new serie on the programm ,14
15082, its not that bad because the children can learn to know knew things and they arent influenced that much it becomes more dangerous ,4
15083, there are product placements shown on television there are some big industries ,10
15084, mc donalds which want to influence the people by a very young age to buy their products ,2
15085," they are older

to sum up ",19
15086, television advertising for young children should be allowed but song,13
15087,i bougth allot of toys because i have seen the publicity on televison so televisons influences children but is this really a bad thing  in this essay ,17
15088," write about this subject
one of the biggest problems is that espacially children get adopted to watching televison so there are a lot of different series that are made for children and were children invest a lot of time to see each part of the serie children ",6
15089," give up reading because they prefer watching televison and that is bad for there creativity and languege skills 
but ",6
15090, if there is a serie about dinesaurs children become interrested in dinesaurs and start to read about them or they ,6
15091, go to museum to see the bones of a dinesaur or maybe theres a serie about the univers and ,18
15092," the children becoume interrested in astronomie so it can aslo inspire a child to read more about a speciall suspect
a big problem nowadays is that a lot of children do not even go outside because they have to watch televison so the real life is ",6
15093," than a fictional televison serie
but ",6
15094, each child in the modern society watchs televison today ,17
15095, if there would not be a speciall program for children they would watch other things and maybe they would watch things that should only be watched by adults ,6
15096, of view television espacially for children can ,17
15097," protect children
as i have allready mentioned in the introduction the televison can ",17
15098, influence children and push them to buy something ,2
15099, this aspact is a really important ,18
15100," because children do not understand how the get influenced by the publicity and maybe they create there own opinion about a suspect based on something they have seen on televison 
so based on all this ",7
15101, i have mentioned i have to say that i would not forbid televison espacially for children but ,17
15102," to much television is not good for a child so i think that it is a task of a parant to observe the own children and to regulate the consume of televison  

 ",17
15103,a human being of the age  is a very sensitive creature in the ,18
15104, called sensitive phase people are like sponges we take in every information possible from a certain topic ,3
15105, the language many of these sensitive stages in our lives happen as a child therefore children ,8
15106," young children are very likely to get influenced by television advertising but could it almost be considered as brainwashing or just a great way to find new potential customers
first of all are children customers of today and for the future once they are stuck with ",14
15107, a brand of cereals theyll buy them and maybe other products by the same brand for quite some time and maybe one day for their own children too another ,9
15108, why television advertising is a great way to reach out  is that its very eye cathing and can be made very funny and colourful and may ,10
15109, create a bond between a character in the commercial and the child and because children are attracted to these kind of commercials they are very easy to impress and influence so this leads us to the ,0
15110, why television advertising should not be allowed in most countries people are considered adults by the age of eighteen which menas only ,15
15111, are they really able to make their own decisions children of the age  are not they arent sure ,7
15112, what they want and what they needthey ,3
15113, need to learn whats good and bad for them clearly children are taken ,12
15114," of by companies they take what children like and put it into a commercial it doesnt even have to relate to the product
in conclusion i find it kind of disgusting that they use innocent easy to be influenced young children only to make money and to benefit them",2
15115,"advetising is amazing in our country because we should do anything advertising is good because the owner of the programm in the television raise money to pay for the movies or pay for the work to make a soup or anything a lot of young poeple watch very often tv because they do not have other things 

firstly",10
15116, there are not very advertising for young children nevertheless there are advertising for sweets or something like this but ,16
15117," the young children do not understand if the young children understand the advertising they will go to the parents and say that they want this thing however the parents can say no because sweets are very unhealthy

secondly its normal to do advertising for young children because they want that the young children watch the soup or the movie the advertising for children soups is very friendly and not bad for the young children sometimes there are great advertising for young children because the advertising explain a very good thing that the young children have to learn

at the end ",16
15118," it is allowed to do advertising  the young children because they have to make money that they can pay the television programmalso the young children do not know all about the advertising the parents have to explain to the young children and if the parents do not want this they will not do

",14
15119,"even young children these days watch tv a considerable amount of time while some watch films from dvd others enjoy the different programmes on tv and there is the problem on tv there mostly are adverts some of them even directed directly towards young children should this be allowed 
yes ",14
15120, one could say there are adverts for good things like educative games or toys a child could see a game for learnig to read and ,0
15121, get interested in reading they would ,19
15122, ask their parents if they could buy it the parents ,9
15123, have the opportunity to say no but this way their attention is drawn to something that they had not known ,3
15124," 
one could say that adverts directing towards young children should only be allowed for a certain product it makes sense to advert for an educative game but it is ",16
15125," harmful to advert for sweets or other unhealthy stuff the children could get the impression that everybody eats a lot of sweets and they are the only ones who are not allowed to they could get a wrong impression of what is normal or what other people do 
there are strong ",16
15126, in favour of  restriction of tv advertisement children and even more young children aged  need protection they cant decide what is good for them themselves as already mentioned above children could get a wrong impression of their surroundings as they are very young they would ,13
15127, adapt to these patterns and get used to it this can have positive effects but eg regarding sweets ,18
15128," lead to problems like overweight 
personally ",4
15129, tv advertisement directing towards young children should not be allowed it influences them in a wrong way ,13
15130, companies are mostly interested in making money and not necessarily in the wellbeing of children anyway young children should not watch that much tv they should ,14
15131, go outside and play with other children ,1
15132,"children between two and five usually watch a lot of television regardless if television it self is damaging to our young children or not is it good to show our young kids advertizing
for a lot o companies it is hard to advertize products directed to younger children unlike children adultes are constantly confonted with advertizements during their regular day but as soon as you need to get the attention of a young child it can get harder companies had the idea to embed their product advertizement between childrens shows these companies benefit a lot from these ads and ",14
15133, using them however is it really that good for children to be conronted with advertizements at this young age younger children are usually very oblivious and i can remember from personal experiance that it was not hard to persuade me to buy something from the toy store showing young children that advertisement is good would just make them buy more unnessisary products in the future of course companies trying to sell as much of their product as possible are happy about this but should think more about the damange they are doing to these young childen watching television of couse each individual will have a different oppinion about this topic but a little bit less television or advertisement for our children cant hurt anyone,14
15134,"manipulating the youngsters

many people say that advertising s children should be forbidden but is it really that dangerous is it dangerous at all what does television advertisind do with our personality

advertising is always manipulation ",14
15135, it is a manipulation for adults too additionally the decision wether something is goint to be buyed or not is ,9
15136, in the hands of the parents they should be able to tell their kids a simple no sure its hard but its ,12
15137, necesseray and a part of the maturing process children are ,8
15138, a part of the society ,21
15139," why should they be excluded from the television commercials

as written in the ",15
15140," advertising is always a sort of manipulating the people they should become a feeling that they need that product in their life but a young child cant separate as good between i need that or i dont need that as an adult so one can say that the mainpulation is much bigger for the young children as for the adults 

in my opinion television advertising shouldnt be forbidden but it should be reduced because ",14
15141, much input but they get to know new toys and the parents havent to spend much time with always saying no to their childs,8
15142,a big pro of this idea is that the children would spend much more time outside and not in the house because most of the products which are promoted in television are things for playing in the house when they promote food or drinks for young children in an advert this products contain often much sugar which is unhealthy but this does not matter for the children because they do not know about it  even sometimes the parents do not know it for example there are some adverts in the tv that ,14
15143, you go to a fastfood restaurant the children receive a free gift or something like this a child normally do not know the rules of economy and it maybe thinks that the company wants to be nice but ,9
15144, the company wants only to sell something to earn money often parents give in to the wishes of their children and buy the products on the internet or in a store sometimes they dont know what are the needs of a product but the child says that it is a cool product ,2
15145," the parents buy it without thinking about it

without advertising on the televison the profit for big companys would fall if the company does earn much money there is a possibility that the will fire people it would be ",10
15146, a difficult situation for the legislation because as a company i could say that their products are for higheraged children but actually their products are for loweraged children another big con is that normally the parents are responsible fot their children and not the companys so if the parents let them watch tv in this young age they should be aware of the ,13
15147, that many tv channels use advertising ,10
15148," that the reception of the signal is free for the customer

",23
15149, that this statement is a good idea because today i can see many adverts on tv which are for young children there are often ,13
15150, many lies in the cotent and the companys sometimes say that their products are the best and the children believe this but ,2
15151, that the parents have a high responsibility for their kids so the best idea would be that until a certain age you do not let them watch more than an half an hour tv per day,17
15152,children cant buy the stuff without the parents they just can go to them and say i want this i want this if the parents dont want this thing they shoud not let the children watch tv the adversiting is often ,2
15153, good for the parents for christmas or birthdays they know what they cant buy the little kids ,20
15154, they see the shiny eyes of the childrens ,8
15155, they get the present they want its true that the children often gets angry if they dont get what they want the adversiting get an effect on the little gets that they mean that they have to have this thing anf  cant life without that even it is just a toy that can drive the kids crazy and the parents often ,20
15156, get crazy about the kid ,18
15157, the buy the stuff and it doesnt matter if its is expensive or if it is cheap they buy it just for calming the kid and that isnt the goal parents should do the kids should learn that thy have to deserve a present not every day or any day they should be happy ,20
15158, they get one once a year and not more ,19
15159,television advertising is an effective way to get people into buying new things things they might not even need small children aged  might watch shows like teletubbies or the mickey mouse show inbetween they need small breaks ,14
15160," let the previous information and morals from the show sink in but should those breaks be filled with adverts for them

young children  ",6
15161, around the age of two maybe wont let the adverts affect them too much they might not really know what exactly is going on they beg for their mothers to carry them around and they love their old little teddybear who would belong in the trash bin because it is all chewed up they live very much in the moment they get affected by emotions and their environment ,24
15162," they might not feel heavily related to those ads 

however at the age of five they sure know what they want to have and they begin to be thoroughly influenced by the fun little adverts it is ethnically not correct because the parents are the ones who pay and the young children longe for the toys in a manipulative advert these advertisements often make people conditioned to an excitable unconcerned feeling because of a combination of something enjoyable ",0
15163," a summer partywith the product they are trying to sell fiveyearsolds might get envious of the other children playing with these fantastic new toys on the market they want to have what they dont have at the moment 

adverts that relate to these young children are effective furthermore we should ask ourselves if it is a correct way of influencing those young children it is possible that they dont necessarily care as much as we might think because they are too focused on living in the moment however psychologists found out that those little children are very much influenced by their surroundings and in my opinition we shouldnt confront and them with the marketing world of todays society as it is manipulative",0
15164,"children can be manipulated easy if an adult or an other person tells them something they believe it they ask but they dont think they just believe it childrens want to learn about the world so they ask a lot about random topics it isnt good for them if they get false informations because they wont think about it if it is false they think its right because they think it is always right what other older people are saying they think we know it better

but it is hard to say that television advertising is bad for the children its all about the kind of information the television is telling if it is about a shampoo advertisement it wont damage the children they wont care about topics like that it isnt interesting for them if it is an racist advertisement like the shampoo cleans a black man and he gets white we cant tolerate that the children wont really think about it but in the backest corner of his brain he could think black people arent beautyful 

advertisements are made by adults the advertisements arent a big problem it is just about the person who makes the advertisements if he wants to make racist advertisement he can make racist advertisement there are a lot of people you cant understand why they are doing this but not all kind of advertisements can be send out in televisions there are rules and nowdays nobody can make advertisement like that ",14
15165, you are saying one thing is better ,21
15166, television advertisement arent bad for childrens,14
15167,"young children between two and five years often watch television because they like the little cartoon series or are fascinated by the moving pictures the bright colours and the funny music when an advertisement pops up they often dont even understand what it means and what it wants to sell
when i was a child i was always really bored ",17
15168, a tv show was interrupted by an advertisement i often just walked away from the television to play with my toys ,10
15169," the break took and i only returned to watch tv if the advertising sequence had stopped 
i believe many children feel and act the same way as i did ",14
15170, it comes to television advertising ,10
15171, nowadays wher kids are bored ,1
15172, that companies normally advertise a product to a specific age group because they want to sell it to exactly these people but ,2
15173, a toy children cant buy it by themselves they ,20
15174, would have to convince their parents and only if the parents ,12
15175, they maybe receive that specific toy for christmas or as a birthday present companies ,20
15176," shouldnt advertise their products to little children because they cant afford to buy them anyway 
television advertising for children aged  cant be efficient ",16
15177," dont think it is appropriate to advertise during a childrens movie or show because children shouldnt be used to gain even more profit by advertising to them they are just too innocent and shouldnt be waisted with such things
so i totally ",16
15178, with the statement but we wouldnt have to argue about this if children would just play outside in nature ,21
15179, watching television if they were doing this they wouldnt be a target to many companies   ,10
15180,today nearly every swissfamily has its television it is common that children start to watch movies and series on television ,17
15181," go to kindergarden or even earlier with this in mind the idea of creating shows for children is obvious and not very far from the idea of television advertising  them

young children probably do not really understand television advertising but it is a matter of ",6
15182, that they are pretty open for it on one ,19
15183, that children are too young to understand what television is able to do should support the thesis that television advertising  them should not be allowed an other ,13
15184," is that it may makes children sad to see what kind of intresting things other kids have but they do not
however there are ",24
15185, some reasons which speak against the statement on one ,21
15186," the parents can decide by themselfes wheter or wheter not they want their kid to sit in front of television they know that there will be some advertising and they know best how their kid reacts if it wants to have something
on the other ",14
15187, kids often are not really interested in advertising which makes them go away to play something else and if they do not they may even learn something new ,0
15188," watching television advertising

all things considered ",10
15189," that television advertising  should be allowed but the parents should keep it in mind
no matter if or if not there is advertising ",13
15190, the statement that young children should not be allowed to watch television,17
15191,television is today normal and not think away of many children grow up with it especialy young kids spend a lot of time in front of the tv parents should controll them ,17
15192, that their kids dont spend to much time at the tv the television is a good way to learn the own language and ,17
15193, other foreing languages ther are many series for kids which animade them to be active as long as the children watch series or movies for their age its okay when they watch movies for adults horror or criminal movies they get bad influence when the parent watch films which the children should not see they have to look that the children arent looking with them young children should be allowed to watch tv but it must be for their age they should watch teletubies ,17
15194, the statement that television advertising  shouldnt be allowed the television gives us many opportunities and for children a good way to learn many things in a fun way the children have to be controlled by their parents ,13
15195, that they dont watch things they shouldnt see and that they dont spend to much time in front of the tv,17
15196,television advertising is a common marketing trick among big concerns especially the younger generation is very easy to convince of a product in our digital century more and more young children are watching television and ,10
15197," concerns are using this to promote their products but should it be allowed 
it is ",11
15198," much easier to convince a child of a product if it is colorful and fancy and the child sees other children playing with this toy it wants to have it immediately 

in my opinion it shouldnt be allowed because children arent watching television to get to know the amount of new toys on the market they just want to watch cartoons and animal shows through the advertising children are getting more attached to material things they want to be owner of all the toys and fancy things showed on television but cant appreciate them of course ",2
15199," the parents dont want to buy all the useless advertised things

for concerns the child himself is the best promoter it sees the advertising and convinces its parents to buy the advertised toy if the parents would see the advertising they would be far less likely to buy it its ",2
15200, the only oppertunity to adress an advertising directly to the child because it isnt able ,16
15201," to read a newspaper or other advertising platforms

i would definitely avois the television advertising  because they arent able to make decisions on their own ",10
15202,nowadays there are many different kinds of  television advertising they can be very special with many computer effects or just one sentence and every important ,10
15203, is already said advertising are mostly directed to adults but there are ,16
15204," advertising which are directed to younger people between the age of two and five should it be banned to produce advertising  this young children 

since there is being produced a big amount of diffrent toys for children the toys ",13
15205, have to be made public and charming to the potencial buyer this potencial buyer are parents but as they are toys for children the advertising are ,20
15206," directed to children because they have to feel attracted by the toys and not the parents 

watching television is nowadays a very big part of a childrens life consequently they see a lot of advertising which are showing toys or food or something else what is made for children in addition it is known that children always want the newest gadgets however the children may like or may dislike the product shown in the advertising but if they like it they are going to ask their parents to buy it for them so this might could lead to arguing between child and mother or father 

in conclusion i have to ",14
15207, with this statement the advertising kind of have to be directed to the children itself if the advertising are directed to the parents the children would not be that much attracted by the gadgets and maybe they would not even want to possess it ,0
15208,"today alot of young children watch a lot of tv the tv channels of today show a massive amountof ads and everybody knows that young children are easily manipulated bythese ads so this isnt a problem if a 5 year old boy sees a ad about a new couch but if he sees ads about all these toys available nowadays this hasto affect him so should you show ads 

",14
15209, that this would be a great idea beacause young children are the future of our civilication nobody expect some companys wants that young children grow up with this much advertisment if our all people in the future had a childhood stuffed with all these ads big companys have some loyal customers now yout think whats the problem with loyal customers i can tell you that this wont come out well if companys have many loyal customers they canactually do what they want if the company is ,16
15210, popular nobody can bring a company to fall ,23
15211, they had done some terrible things you could say that those companys influence your children like nobody else its like these companys got ,7
15212, much power with these ads it cant be good if companys whose main goal is to make as muchmoneyas possible got ,11
15213," much power 

so with all these beautiful ",18
15214," against advertising toward young children its clear that im fully standing behind this idea prohibit these commercials would be a good step against the overwhelming capitalism in our society
",13
15215,"in this text we speak about the two sights if it should be allowed to advirtise  on television or not 

on one ",10
15216, it should not be allowed to advertise toward young children because they are too young to really understand what it is if they see something on television when they see another child enjoying something they want to have it too it is ,13
15217," they see all they could have and do not have then they already start in young age to be material directed

on the other ",3
15218, it does not matter if you advertise  or not they anyway do not really understand anyhing also if the parent do not want that their child see advertisement ,16
15219, they just can not allow them to watch televison and  maybe just put a movie on or record the sope their child want to watch and ,17
15220, has to be sayed that if a child sees something on television and ,17
15221, want to have it it is simmilar as if he see something on hes friends house and ,18
15222, want to have it too another ,18
15223, is that it does not matter in which age they are they anyway see advertisement towards their age ,16
15224," why not already in young age

in my opinion it shout be allowed to make televison advertising toward young children they are ",13
15225, many ways to go around advertisment that if you do not want that your child watching advertisment you can stop it from doing it ,16
15226,"when i go to our neighbours for babysitting they never really want to watch televison which im glad for still there are many families where the children sit in front of the tv all afternoon they see adverts and want their parents to buy whatever is shown there it would probably be better if these ads were forbidden

television advertising is made based on information about who is watching which programm if there are many children watching the advert is more s them because it is ",14
15227, easier to make a kid enthusiastic about something ,8
15228, they want to have and ,3
15229, buy it than an adult a parents ,9
15230, instinct is to watch out for his child and its happiness ,9
15231," its not hard for this child to convince his parent to buy something he truely wants or at least thinks he wants this connection should not be abused by big companies for their profit

however just because your child wants something doesnt mean you have to buy it evedy kid should be thaught by his parents that one simply cannot have everything they want if they are not there will be ",2
15232, later in their life and they wont be good if the parents treat and teach their children right there should not be a problem with a television advert foridding them would be of no use also a well raised child doesnt spend all his time in front of the tv ,14
15233, there would not be a problem ,19
15234,"

to sum up advertising in television s children can affect the parents to buy something but if we want to know the reasons we have to look at the raising of these children and their parents especially ",14
15235, youre young your parents have a very big influence on your life and if they would teach their children that they cant have everything they want an ,9
15236, much time in front of the tv there would be no problem at all adults dont buy everything advertised in television ,17
15237, an dif we wanted to ban advertising s children we should ,13
15238, ban advertising s teenagers and adults,16
15239,"in todays television programms there is a lot of advertisment of different products and for different ages a lot of people are watching television and all of them have favourite channels there are hundreds of different channels and every person can decide which one she or he wants to watch there are channels with less advertising and some with more 

there are channels for  year old children but even there advertisment is shown little children do not understand how advertisment affects them they just watch it and ",14
15240," if it is something they do not already have they want it 
that is exactly what the companies look for they want smaller children persuading their parents to buy it
if companies want children to have it ",2
15241, the advertisment cannot be brutal or with violence because ,11
15242, the kids would be frightened and they would not want it anymore that is why they make it funny happy and colourful ,20
15243," it is not bad for children

in my opinion it is not good that the companies use smaller kids as clients i would prefer it if they would direct it direcly to adults because they can decide wether it is useful for them or not and if they want to buy it smaller children do not have the thinking to decide if it is good or bad and it is always the parent who buys the toys or the other things their kids want",2
15244,in my opinion television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because the children can be manipulated ,13
15245, that the children want something that isnt necessary but ,9
15246," a child at the age of two doesnt understand what is going on that much and the advertises are usually going to be about a toy for children

children want allways something they like on television they see many different things and if they like something and see it in a shop ",0
15247, they throw a tantrum because of how much they want it and if advertisements are  children the parents have to deal more with the problem that their child wants something ,2
15248," badly but they dont want to buy it

a child that watches tv doesnt understand what he sees he just can deside if he likes what hes watching or if notfor example if a three year old boy watches tv it wants to see its favorite show and not some advertisement about some special dolls so it wont even look at the advertise

the companys have to think about how to advertise their product towards young children they know that children dont care about school stuff or a new chair but they know that children always want new toys so towards young children they have to advertise mostly toys 

there are some negative ",14
15249, to the advertisement toward young children in my opinion television advertising s can be allowed because ,13
15250, that the advertises are going to be bad for the children the only problem is to resist the needs of the children ,16
15251,"in the last years the amount of people who watch regularly some pogramms on the televison has increased nearly every household has one at home and no matter which age there is a good programme for everyone we are all used to the adverts in the breaks but should it be allowed to direct them  aged 
the biggest effect of those adverts for children will be on the parents imagine during christmas time ",14
15252," they see their funny toys they would like to have everyday in the television if they dont get it on christmas eve theyll be very disappointed for the parents its difficult to enhance the children to play with their old toys because they can see everyday the new toys 
on the other ",20
15253," for the shops who sell the toys from the adverts theyll be able to sell much more of them to the customers they can increase their gain with television advertising they can talk to much more people than just with some adverts in the streets  
there might be ",0
15254," for very strict parents they can show there children that they cant get everything they want but children who are only aged  might not understand this
the question we have to ask us now is if its okey ",12
15255, we allow this just for some economic reasons in my opinion its much more important to protect the children from all those technological stuff ,12
15256, that they can grow up in a safe environment when they get older they will make anyway enough experiences with all those advertisments and in the other ,8
15257, im sure that if this would be allowed there are going to be a lot more spoilt kids in the end ,12
15258, it shouldnt be allowed to direct television advertising     ,15
15259,nowadays television plays a big role in everyones life young and old the main thing we all encounter ,17
15260, watching tv are advertisements advertisements make certain products and services attractive for the general public and a tv is one of the best places to put out advertisements as most people watch enough tv to come across these advertisements it is expected that through advertisements the product or service being shown would be purchased or used more often usually there are different target groups depending on the productservice being offered however are advertisements shown on the television necessary if they are s young children aged  ,14
15261," children that young get an insight into the adult world with such advertisents by this i mean that if they see a toy being advertised which they really like and want to have this could prompt the parents  to give the child pocket money by saving pocket money the child already gets an insight and an idea of financing and how money works 

however for children as young as  pocket money would not be a discussion as they are only ",0
15262," to talk

this in turn could lead to advertisements for children that young being a problem for the parents if they are in an unstable financial situation since kids which are ",16
15263, young do not understand much they will not be able to understand if their parents are not able to buy the newest toy which they saw on the television on the other ,24
15264, a lot of parents would not want to spoil their children ,9
15265, want to make their child happy however to make their child happy they will need to buy certain things that are wanted by their offspring if they cannot manage this ,9
15266, a tight budget they may feel under pressure and as if they have disappointed their child all of these problems would ,9
15267," the advertisement on television 

in my opinion ",11
15268, advertisements for kids that young are unnecessary as all they can do are cause more financial problems for families children at such a young age are mostly interested in cartoon shows and might ,16
15269, not be interested in the advertisementas they are just learning the language and all the pay attention to are the pictures on the screen so ,11
15270, advertisement for children between the ages of  are necessary and ,16
15271, should not be allowed in the ,12
15272,"television adversiting is often discused because there is too much of it or its just unsuitable this discusion is concerning small children too should they be affected by television advertising

on the one ",14
15273, television advertising can be seen as a part of the childs learning process the child has to make contact to his environnement because ,14
15274," it can grew up and face to those problems itself if this learnig process is skipped at low age there will be more serious and wide problems in the future
so television advertising is an opportunity to learn and control oneself but ",14
15275, it can try to manipulate the the grew ups in ,4
15276," this is a serious problem which faces parents too what should they do if their children ask for presents they see at televison all the time 
but television can be used as a source of informations from this ",17
15277," of view it can give useful informations about different products what makes the choosing of presents easier

in conclusion television advertising can be seen as an opprtunity to learn and to get informations but manipulation of children has to be seen too in my opinion we should allow the advertisement but we should control it",14
15278,the television an invention that has changed the life of many people one ,10
15279," of the economy since the television has been invented there is a new way of advertising millions of people are able to see ones product in the television a completely new strategy to reach the customers with something that is more than normal in nearly every house of every family in the modern world


no matter what the ad is about they all follow the same goal the producer want us to buy the new table or the pretty bed or whatever today its more than usual that the people who are conected to a television become younger and younger because its a normal thing today even two or three year old children can see advertisments

that is the ",10
15280," d like to discuss children with that age cant build their own reason they think about what they like or what they dont like they dont really know that its just an ad that they probaably get pranked or that everything in the ad is a lie they just want that little toy because they think its something really cool and if they see something they are really proud of the walk to mom and dad and want them to buy it if they do the producers win because their strategy was succsessful

",2
15281," because of the statements i gave in my text there shouldnt be any ads for children who are younger than five or six years old they cant do any desicions about a toy or whatever in an advertisment of a producer who only wants to sell something to earn money of course the strategy of the sellors is brilliant making ads for people wyho cant decide if something is good or if something is absolutely rubbish


the tv shouldnt be used for ads who are directed at children who are under five years old",14
15282,"if there is no advertising there is no market where toys and stuff can be sold and buyeda company always has to advertise or no one knows about their newest products and if no one knows about new toys the company has  to close their doors there will be unemployed people and its actually a big business because everyone wants to see their kids happy and if you think about unhappy kids who have nothing to play withand to be honest how sould they control if a kid of the legal age is watching the advertising and how should the kid know whats the newest toy if there isnt any advertising on television

kids shouldnt watch television advertising for their age because they always want more and with these advertisings they get inspired slowly the kids are getting materialistic and they only think about the newest hottes trend they saw on television and thats what companies want to reach because children are ",14
15283, easy to influence and if the kid always has these new wishes the company never stops producing unneccessary stuff made of plastic and other chemical substances mother nature has to keep suffering because ,2
15284," they grow up or the trend is gone they throw it awaywithout feeling sorry 

in my opinion there have to be companies who produce toys which includes advertising they have to make money somehow but ",20
15285, they really influence kids in the way they advertise the child comes to the idea that he has to have it they dont have the chance of really being a kid without adverts to care aboutin addiction ,2
15286, it would be better for our environment it wont leave ,19
15287, much trash and the kezo wouldn have ,19
15288,in my opinion television advertising  should not be allowed ,15
15289, it is not fair to manipulate such young children for the enrichment of the advertisors because ,16
15290, early how many things they could have they are not going to be happy ,9
15291, they are older they are going to want everything they see because they never learned to be happy with what they have so we see that the adverising has negative affections of their ,3
15292," life which is not fair
on the other ",21
15293," for the advertisors it is a good thing to direct their advertising towards young children when they see something they like in television they are going to ask their parents for buying what they saw and children this age usually keep asking until they get what they want so it is a good strategy to use children for advertising they do not think of money they just want what they like
so we see this statement is not just right or wrong there are always two ",16
15294, directing television advertising towards young children the behalf of the children is more important than the money the advertisors earn so ,13

15298, a happy film there follows a advertisment for puppets or other things to play for the children so these children would like to action and buy those things mostly the parents of the children will have to buy these stuff it should be allowed because ,20

also its the parents who buy all the stuff for the kids it wouldnt be much of a gain for any company to target young kids because they will probably spend more money on making and broadasting the advertisement than making profit out of it

in my opinon the television advertising for kids should not be allowed because the industries are taking ",13

15332, very young it is the reason why more and more commercials are s children ,24
15333," but are theyt acually only directed to children and should they be forbidden

acually it is true that there are many advertisments witch are made for reaching children but most of them reaching the parents ",16
15334, what i think is the main reason they do it an advertisement does only work because the customer gets to know the product and later ,11
15335, he is at the store he will probably choose the product he has seen ,18
15336, in the commercial if you directing advertisments to children and ,16

on the other ",9

in my opinion its not nice to manipulate children but ",2
15339, children shouldnt be watching tv at such very young ages ,17
15340, these advertisments should be forbidden because its just an advertisment as every other one furthermore id say the problem arent the advertisments but the parents if the parents would stop letting their children watch tv the commercial toward children would stop ,16
15341," because why should they reach children if there arent even any watching tv 
in conclusion ",17
15342, these commercial should be forbidden at least it is your own desicion what your watching and its your own responsability what your child watches,14

this days many joung children who are to joung to go to school spend their freetime by watching tv because their parents do not have time spending time with them or they do not want to spending time with them while they are watching tv they see a lot of advertising toward children in this essay i will give some ",13

in general i think children aged  should not watch tv in their freetime but if they do watch tv i think television advertising could be a way to encourage children to spend their freetime outside with their friends because some advertisements shows specials toys which can only be used outside for example waterbombs waterslides",0

in conclusion its a question of culture and moral values if one needs the children to persueade of a product by television advertising to sell more products there are pros and cons with different ",14

15355,today children are watching television several hours a day because their parents are stressed and have no time or energy for them the simple ,17
15356," is to put them in front of the tv
what the kids see there are advertisings for toys and other stuff which children love but should such advertisings  be allowed

for the industry of these toys and other playing stuff it is important to promote their things in the television to find new customersthey know exactly that the kids are watching television and ",14
15357," advertisings the customers are the parents of the kids which have seen the advertising they go and buy it because they want their kids to be happy maybe they do not buy everything but often they cannot refuse them and buy it a good way to get new customers

for the parents it is not easy because there are ",0
15358," many different advertisings on television which their children see and they cannot afford to buy all these things but most of the children will not stop asking for the toys  until they get what they want the advertising  causes this problem the parents have to spend the money for such things because the advertising supports the children to wish these toys

in my oppinion the television advertising  should be allowed because the parents have to raise their kids tough enough to say no to such things when children always get what they want there is a problem in how the parents raise their children another problem is that the kids do watch too much television and this is the main problem in my oppinion the reason why the industry has ",14
15359, many advertisings s children is because they know that the children watch tv the most of all people ,14
15360,who doesnt know the moment ,18
15361, you turn your tv on in the early morning to watch something i always notice that there aro ,10

",17
15363, television advertising toward young children is something good there are ,14
15364, many things that they can learn just from seeing it visual on the tv but ,6
15365, there is no garanty that these kids can learn from it because they are just to young to understand some things happening there in these series it is possible that all they see are some pretty coloured characters that are doing something without getting the message they want to give these children still ,6
15366," kids may improve some cognitions like being helpfull to other people or how to face different problems in some situations with watching television 
we all know that young kids are difficult to handle ",8
15367, they wake up in the morning they cry a lot and are in a bad mood therefore it is a good thing that it has specific tv shows for kids in the morning it is a great benefit fot mothers while the kid is calming down with funny stories for children in the television the mother can do other work and finish things like household chores it can save ,6

15372, many things from it these tv shows are s young children ,6
15373, you can be shure that everything that is going on there is made for their age ,24

for young children there are alot of tv series programms and advertising which help kids to learn new stuff or the language so it has a good ",17
15375, the kids could learn the language faster and easier by watching television with animation and sound and ,6
15376, they would be better prepared for the school the cartoons which are made for children are ,6
15377, very funny and great for them because they show them how to do things right and whats wrong and theyre ,6
15378, cute so it pull up the kids very quick but if they watch to much television it could damage their eyes the kids would just stare at the television and nowhere else they wouldnt play with toys or go outside they would just watch tv and wouldnt learn or do other stuffs also the communication get worse the young children get isolated with themselves and would not communicate ,17
15379," with their parents they just want more and more of the cartoons or other programms and they would become connected with the television 

there would be a ",17
15380, how to allow it without damaging the young children the parents could make a plan or just say that the child can watch tv for a hour and ,1
15381," that they have to play with toys or do other things they shouldnt allow the kids to watch tv by themselves 





i understood the statement wrong and noticed it at the end ",1
15382, i hadnt time to change it first i thought it was that young children shouldt be allowed to watch tv sorry ,13
15383,television is nowadays like any other social media program a huge part of our society there are many shows films and ,10
15384, advertises we get influenced by them every time we watch tv and ,10
15385, we do get influenced the young children do ,7
15386," too but is it really right to allow this influence should television advertising directed  not be allowed
i ",15
15387, think that it should be allowed children get influenced in ,12
15388, many ways not only by their parents or their teachers they get influenced by everything they see might it be a television advertise an advertise in a magazine or just a simple story they got told and nobody can stop this ,7
15389, it would not make any sense to not allow tv advertising toward young children because of this big influence ,13
15390, their parents adults who can not be manipulated that easy can raise their children in the way they want ,7
15391, they can tell the child their opinions to advertises or just not allow the child to watch the advertises or tv ,13
15392, children of that age should often be watching television ,17
15393," it is a personal decision and up to the childrens parents to do what they think is the best their kids
another reason ",12
15394, is that people in our society have the right to say think and publish what they want i truely believe in this right and because of that i do not see the ,21
15395,today advertsing is one of ,11
15396, for the success of  companies or for someone who offers something on each corner we colud find an advertisment about a product or service the advertisment on television has much influence on the people who watch a film series or an other show there are advertisments about every things and for each age of a person the television  advertising  should be allowed often the young children couldnt buy the thing in the advertisment on his own they dont have enought money or they are ,15
15397, not able to buy it alone so the televison advertising for the young children are more directed to the parents of them and they can decide if they want to buy the thing in the advertisment or not the people dont need this sort of advertising because young people dont watch that much television children  see an advertisment on television about a toy and ,0
15398," they really want it and thats annoing for the parents 

",9
15399, television advertising  children should be allowed it doesnt hurts someone sometimes it could be annoiny but it is ,13
15400, legal and the people who dont want to watch it can swap to an other channel   ,10
15401,"in the last years the time children watch tv consantly increased because of that children are more often exposed to advertising s their age but should advertising s children aged tow to five be allowerd there are different perspectives that have to be considered to get e good picture of this problematic
 
first i have to mention that young children can get influenced very easily ",14
15402," the society should be careful with whatever they show them under the impact of advertising children can get a wrong image of things which can have a harmful effect in their future 

otherwise big companies live from selling thigs and they want to sell as many products as possible with their advertising they can reach as many people of different age groups as possible  from young children to old people  and everybody sees their products 

on the other ",14
15403, children nowadays watch too much tv ,17
15404," they are exposed to a very big amount of advertising if they watched less tv the impacts of ads would not be as big as it is today children have to learn how to deal with technology because it is  developing consantly

the last important thing to keep in mind is that companiey want to find future clients they attach young children to them ",14
15405," they are older they will always buy their products it is all part of a selling strategy

in conclusion i have ",3
15406, parents and companies have to try to minimize the problem personally ,9
15407, that there has to be a special childrens channel on tv where no advertising should be allowed with this changement the advertising ,13
15408, on other channels could be without any restrictions,19
15409, first of all how can you make that children dont see an advert you cant write age 5 ,16
15410, every advert second of all why should a television advert harm a child aged plus 5 ive never seen an advert that could harm a child and i ,14
15411, think that children on that age wont even know the meaning of an advert well maybe that could be the only reason why they should not see an advert there may be some adverts that dont really direct to the meaning of the product but those adverts wont make a child go crazy or make them stupid there are even some cartoons that are ,16
15412," television adverts but no one bats an eye to that 
also many tv canals wouldnt allow such a law because they would make less money and the people whod like to advertise wouldnt want to do ",15
15413, anymore for example toy adverts how could kids know about the newest toy on the market kids ,0
15414," have wantings and we should not take that away from them 
",3
15415," the laws for an advert are even too strict sometimes people always want to go stricter and they are triggered by every little thing but why are they like that i really dont know

",11
15416,television advertising  is a common topic there are many ,10
15417," explain one or two
the people that are against advertising directet toward young children argue that the influence of young kids is enormeous because they cant triage the informations so they want to have all of the objects they had seen on tv but there are as always people that are in favour to tv advertising toward young children because the children learn how to handle the source of advertising and learn that they dont need all what they saw in tv 
my opignion is like the ",13
15418," that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed the kids shouldent sit for a long time in front of the tv they should go out in the nature and play games if the kids are out they can not watch tv advertisingso the problem is solved
so ",13
15419," with the statement




ps if the children went with their parents to the supermarked or to an other shop they want to have all the things they saw on tv ",2
15420, its quite a hard job for the parents to change the opignion og needing that,9
15421,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

first of all theres a difference between adult television programms and children programm so you have to define about which programm we are speaking 

when we talk about the adult programm ",13
15422, with this hypothesis there are to many commericals and things that isnt for young children eg there are a few commercials where women and men are half nacked when children see this commericals they maybe think what the commericals shows is real so their sexual behavior will be an other as the sexual behavior of the children who didnt see the commericals in young age there are ,7
15423," too much movies with violence eg war films like hotel ruanda or american sniper this movies arent good for the childrens mental 

but ",6
15424, we talk about the children programm i mostly ,8
15425, with the hypothesis the programm is made for the children the aim of this series is that children learn and see new things ,6
15426, its really important in this world that you have a big knowledge and the easiest way to learn is ,18
15427, you do it in young age children can learn eg how to act with teachers or with other children they see that theres more than just the house where they live and the family the learn that there is more than a cat or a dog or there is more than their mothertongue otherwise its really difficult to learn children something that they cant see its really important for the developpment of the tolerance maybe they never saw a black man ,8
15428, they see one at the ,19
15429," time the maybe think that this man is ill or something like this 

in my opinion the parents have watch something children friendly ",1
15430, their children are around so the children can learn something and ,8
15431, the parents can maybe learn something ,9
15432," with this statement
i dont have a problem if companies want to advertise for themselves with short television scenes i just think that they just have to stay fair
often if a little child sees a television advertise it really wishes it could have this stuff the parents often suffer of that and calm the child if a child knows that isnt allowed to have something he or she starts crying and screaming the parents have to handle with that

another reason why ",14
15433, that should be banished is that if a mother wants to purchase the whole food of the week in the supermarket their children often have to attend them until theyre not in school during shoppinng the children are bored and often just start crying because of very small things for exampe the child would like to have the delicious chocoloate which he or she saw in the advertising the child doesnstop crying ,12
15434, he or she doesnnt get it the mother is annoyed or just feels ashamed and because of that she purchases that chocolate for her kid that she can ,9
15435," with her purchase

in my opinion the companies just want take ",23
15436, out of that they know that if a child really want to have something they often get that ,7
15437," a certain time
in my opinion children shouldnt be influenced by anybody in their chosing of stuff for playing they should could deside by themselves without any influence of television advertising a child should listen to its own real desires

on the other ",17
15438, i have to be honest and have to say that i understand the companies not only the adults are their customers ,2
15439, teenagers and little children they want to sell as much of their products as possible theiyre often not the only company which sells products for kidsso they have to advertise for their product as good as possible small kids often watc television series for the companies it is the best place there to reach the children and advertise as good as possible,0
15440, children may watch the tv but of corse just at a strict time my cousines ,17
15441, 3 and 5 years old watch every evening the sandman and ,6
15442, they have to go to sleep theyre happy with that and my aunt can do the kitchen in this time but i ,1
15443, know another exaple the brother of my friend 5 years old may watch the tv ,1
15444," he has done his homeworks he sit infront of the tv and watch untill the dinner is ready sometimes that are 3 houres or more and that is to much for a child you have to be strict with your children and show them how to acept your rules
in my opinion a child have to play outside  in the garden or in a park  that dosent matter but its not good for the kids ",1
15445, they just sit in the house or in the appartment they must have fresh air and sunlight but ,1
15446," its to much to forbidden the tv
so i ",17
15447, children may watch at a strict time thats good like this they learn how to acept rules,12
15448,children watch television almost every day it gets continously more and more daily to watch tv ,17
15449, going to bed or in the morning ,18
15450," getting up should television advertising  not be allowed

one ",15
15451, that it should be allowed is that children can create a bigger fantasy with the things they see in the ad lots of children dont know any of those things ,16
15452, they go to a supermarket with their parents they will get to know these products ,9
15453, without any ad with the countinously higher usage of internet and social media its not possible to stop advertising tv if it would be stopped the children could ,14
15454, watch the ad in the internet or like 10 years ago in a newspaper or a magazine this ,11
15455, belongs to a time in wich the media wasnt developed like its now with television ads children could tell their parents what they wanted as a christmas or as a birthday present easily nowaday the internet can ,20
15456, give them ideas but a few years ago the children fetched their ideas from tv spots and every time they were repeated they screamed that the parants came to watch they learned the melody or the text of the spot by heart ,8
15457,"

an arguments that it shouldnt be allowed is that the children cant build their own fantasy without the televison especially two years old children wich realise things in tv for the ",17
15458, time and can keep them in mind could be scared from tons of new inputs in their brains they could be overused and cant handle all those things another ,3
15459, is that children get addicted to ads because they want the things they promise to them or because its ,0
15460, fascinating for children from age  lots of children watch a lot of tv during the whole day an ,6
15461, against tv advertisment is that children keep staying in the house to watch some spots wich fascinates them so they stay in the house and dont realise that the nature wich is very good for children to learn new things waits outside with this the children stay much longer in front of the tv than years ago this is very unhealthy children need to move run around play with others and discover themselves and the world around them ,14
15462," a fictional tv world

my opinion is that televison advertising cant be stopped because of the continously higher social media amount if it could be stopped i would stop it ",10
15463, its very important to play in the nature with the little children if i was a mother of a two to fice year old child i would control their usage of tv i would tell them that they can watch tv ,17
15464, in the evening for a half hour and in the rest of the day my children should play in the nature they should discover new places new friends and new animals they could paint a picture or other things but i wouldnt let them watch tv the whole aternoon ,1
15465," the tv advertising makes lots of children lazy and addicted in social media i hope the media revolution is not growing up as fast as it did in the last years 
",14
15466,"at the moment the television is a big problem for the most children so some people think that is better to not allowe the television advertising

first the television isnt helpful for the children because the childeren more like to watch televison than play with other children the social contact with other children isnt importent for the children the biggest problem is that they havent any idear what to play in the nature and what to play with other childs the children should have the option to be creative the social contact is ",14
15467, importent because they should learn how to handle a discussion for a discussion they have to form an own oppinion and this is important for the graduation an other ,21
15468, is that a television is expensive an not everybody can buy one ,10
15469, the children become jalous of each other finally ,8
15470," the television isnt longer allowed the children could play more outside and with other children

one desagreement is that the televion shows ",17
15471, good things from which the children can learn something on the television are ,6
15472, documentations which are very useful for everybody another ,21
15473, is that the televison brings up a lot of jobs every program on the television needs people who produce the series the news the shows and the documentations one least ,10
15474," is that the television shows the news and the oppinion about diffrent subjects

",10
15475, its importent that the children play with each other they could learn ,8
15476, the look where and why they live but ,19
15477, the television is another world where the children can dream and do something else than everytime think and learn so i thnink the television adverising should be allowed ,17
15478,"television advertising  should not be allowed

first of all its clear that television advertising isnt the best influence for young children with exiting colourful and loud advertising for toys clothes or food a childs attention is easily catched they now have the impression that they only want this one thing in the advertising and beacuse children are ",14
15479," naive they believe everything what is said in the advertising
on the other ",3
15480, children should learn how advertising companys trick customers because ,16
15481, they dont learn those things as a child they have to learn it ,8
15482, they are older and thats as bad as ,19
15483, business of the parents if they want that their children to see advertising or not ,16
15484," it shouldnt be a law or a rule about it but let the parents decide whats best for their own children
besides ",12
15485, it would be better for children to play outside and be creative by their own ,8
15486," watching to much television and if they dont advertising cant have a bad influence on them 
however advertising isnt always a bad thing children can learn that the sometimes want things but it isnt bad ",14
15487, they didnt get it or they learn that they have to wait for something and the cant just always ,3
15488, with their finger and their parents get it for them with this they are not going to be spoiled ,9
15489, nearly impossible to ban advertising from television ,15
15490, if advertising shouldnt be allowed televisoion advertising  you cant let them watch television anymore and ,15
15491," advertising should be allowed for young children i just think its important that parents know how much television their children are watching and that they have some rules about using the television for their younger children 
if that happens ",14
15492, advertising can have such a bad influence on the young children ,16
15493, i know that advertising has an influence on us,11
15494,a child which is aged  years old is a young child a young child who should playing with other children in the country so they have connected frienships and be outside to be outiside is a important ,8
15495, television is a electric device that is coming soon ,10

15499," they looks horror films or other not childmaternity in this aged the child is in a phase that they learnt much of things which is very important for live play with children have friends be outside with a lot of nature things etc

my mind of this statement is that child which is aged  years old is a important age to connect with other friends when they playing with neighbours the child is outside should connect friendships with other children and a good way to have a very well childhood for me children shouldnt shows television in this aged maybe a little childhood serie at evening for sleeping   ",24

because of the television advertising spots a kid comes in contact with the modern ways to communicate its maybe easier to understand and the kid learns the easy to speek

the way a kid speak in their freetime depends on how much they watch tv

the television adevertising influence the mind of a young kid a kid at this age should more think at themselve it cant be the right way to manipulate a kid 

in my opinion kids aged  shouldnt watch tv the television advertising influence their mind we should let them be kids with their own mind and opinion they should play outside with friends

15502,the term advertisement is mostly seen in a negative light especially ,11

15511, it is that big of a problem if ads are directed to them i certanly dont think it is very healthy for a kid to watch alot of tv anyways but im torn about the banning part in the end we all are overthrown with ads anyways and it is ,14
15512, the decision of the parent whether they want to get their child something or not,9

television isnt good for young children because it can destroy their eyes more children suffer on shortseeing and they need glasses to correct it the children dont learn of the television the television is only used for the entertainment of children maybe the social contact is reduced because the children dont want to play with their freinds anymore because to watch television is more important

15518," they arent afraid or feel bad afterwards

a ",3
15519, to talk about is the time how long should a child aged  whatch tv per day or week ,17
15520, its quite difficult it depends on the special caracter of a child but at least the parents should not allowed their children to whatch more 30 minutes tv each day its more important for a child to play with friends or do some creative stuff ,17
15521, drawing it could be possilbe that to much tv could  change a childs caracter when they cant play outside with friends maybe the woul not play outside if they are older so they are often alone later then they could get into a depression or something like that so if they watch 30 minutes or less each day and a series expesially created for children its okey to let the children watch tv but not longer because it could be bad or not helpful later ,17
15522, that television advertising  should be forbidden because the children betweent two and five are too young and advertising has a bad effect on them i definitely ,13
15523," with this statement 
first of all i have to say that children in this age are influenced ",7
15524, easily they believe every thing somebody tells them that is the main problem in this topic when children see something in the television advertising they believe it if it is true or not that could have a negative effect because children think that this is the truth and they want everything they shown on tv when i was young my parents only allowed me to look films because they did not like tv very much they said that the advertising is boring and i should not watch it ,14
15525," they said this because they thought that it could have a negative effect on me 
an other ",19
15526," is that children can not make a difference between advertising and a serie or film for them tv is tv and they do not even now what advertising is so how can they understand the use of advertising they only see it and think that this is the real life and that they want the same thing like the person in the scene 
",14
15527," there are many adverts which want to direct  because they think that this children are easily influenced it is easier to reach children than their parents or other adults so they try to reach the adults with using their children many parents make everything for their child and like this it is easy to influence the parents with the young children 
",0
15528,have you ever noticed that ,19
15529," your children watch television they are confronted with a lot of advertising
when you let your kid watching television you know that it will see adverts too you accept this ",14
15530, by allowing your child to watch television by itself companies search for young customers who could buy their products or beg to their parents to buy these ,2
15531, this strategy is allowed young children should ,12
15532," get used to watch comment and think critical about an advertisement

but young children aged  are ",16
15533, very sensible and believe all or a lot of the things said in tv and as the advertising directly thought for these children are sometimes very convincing the children are manipulated we should not allow the manipulation of our kids even the adults are a bit manipulated but they have experiences that the things told in the television are not always as they should be children nowadays are ,17
15534," confronted by advertisements in the streets in magazines or even in the internet but it isnt possible to remove all these adverts there is too much lobbying of the companies 

for me ",11
15535, it is clear that i dont support this kind of advertising but i ,11
15536, think that young children should not watch television too often and if the parents look ,17
15537, their children they can switch off the television if a manipulating advert appears in the ,10
15538, line experts say that watching television is bad for the children for their eyes and their brain,17
15539,in a free but regulated market companies have the right to advertise to any target audience they please ,11
15540," maximizing their surplus value why they havent stopped at children doesnt seem all that surprising considering the strategy they do business with this stategy might seem a little ignorant because many are arguing that children should not be influenced by commercial advertising at such a young age 

scientific studies have proven that children pick up a lot of information from watching tv which obviously includes any advertisements cereal boxes now contain superhero figures every film has its own merchandise and every baby has at least a few corporate toys lying around the house somewhere the strategy targets children because they do not generate their own surplus neither do they earn any pocket money at that stage ",2
15541, their imagination welcomes said smart advertising this causes them to put pressure on parents which causes even more pressure as every parent now has the job of proving to other parents that they buy them toys just like everyone else if they target the parents far less shortlasting products like toys and gadgets will be soldbought because its far harder to convince a parent to buy something if all you have to do is convince a child to convince its parent which in turn accelerates the speed in which products are consu,2

some advertisings are psyhologically wellorganised and as kids who are easylyamazed are watching tv ",14

in sight of a parent id say it should noot be allowed if they see the advertise they want to have it immediately and try to get it this can be really annoying and ",16
15545, to this statement is that they always got showed what they dont have they may feel sad because they know they cant afford it third the kids should learn to live with less so many spoiled kids dont learn how to deal with money and will have problems ,9

but there are ",19
15547," which show that it can be allowed but it isnt really necessary 
for example it is the child who decides whether they buy the toy or whatever the parents decide and they should have enough confidence to say no if they dont want it

in my opinion it should not be allowed to direct advertising  it is causes unnecessary problems kids should not be influenced by advertising otherwise they start to measure themself with other people and with what they have and what they dont have ",16

which ",15

first of all it is true that publicity affects children and adults ",7

in conclusion there are positiv and negativ ",17

 ",24
15573,watching television has become part of our daily life most households own a television and most people enjoy watching films series or the news on it ,17
15574," every channel has an advertisement break these advertisements are directed to many different people the subject to debate is about whether television advertisement s young children aged  should be allowed or not

advertisement for young children can be a good opportunity for them to get hold of what is going on in the world or whats new for them on the market they can form an own opinion on what theyd like to play with and if those advertisements are proved parents dont have to look around themselves anymore ",14
15575," theyd have more time for other things
furthermore all channels on the television get interrupted by advertisement if channels for young children dont show advertisement that is safe for children anymore parents cant let the children rest in front of the television anymore because they have to make sure it is safe for them all the time but with advertisement for children parents could let the children watch the television ",14
15576," the household which would be a great relief for them

however if there isnt a regulation for on which channels those child advertisements should be shown olderchildren and adults would probably get annoyed very fast from it
in addition to that it is not healthy for such young children to watch the television although something might seem harmless to us children can get scared very easily advertisement for children would promote children watching the television

in conclusion ",14

15581,this essay will be about the topic of advertisments s young children it is a very controversial topic and there are valid ,16
15582," for and against those commercials
the biggest problem ",11
15583," is that very young children cant correctly judge if they need something or not because of that they can very easily manipulated this is a big problem because companies can design certain types of advertisments to specifically target those age groups at this age they cant already realise what they really need and what they dont because of that the children might want something very useless and the parents who want to do their children a favour give in an buy a lot of unnecessary stuff 
on the other ",2
15584, people say that it is the parents responsibility to not let their children watch television at such a young age this is not good for the development of the child anyways also it is the parents who might buy those things for their children not the children themselves this ,17
15585," says that it is the parents fault if those commercials work on their children 
it would ",2
15586, be problematic to prohibit such advertisments how do you prove that an advertisment is specifically targeting children that are below ,16

although ",9
15588, that children are easily manipulated and it is not a good thing to exploit that ,7
15589, that commercials like this should be prohibited in my opinion it is the parents responsibility to protect their own children from such advertisments every parent has the possibility of stopping this ,13
15590, by not letting their child watch television or by not giving in and buying unnecessary stuff,9

first of all for the advertisers children are the best victims that means ",16

for the ",0
15594, from above in a negative form children can be influenced very well when they see something in the television they want it for the parents its not easy but children dont see only advertising for children there are many advertisings that in my ,14
15595," of view are critical for children for example advertising for cigarrets or alcohol or maybe advertising with sex the children are too young to be confrontate with such things
in my opinion the advertising shouldnt be that much it isnt a crime to show advertising for children but ",16
15596, the people should be aware of dangerous things like alcohol in generally children shouldnt watch ,12
15597, much tv it isnt healthy the whole system of media is like a brainwash and children are victims ,17
15598,first of all you need to specify what adverts directed to children are and ,16
15599, its  children making adverts for products that are likely to be liked by children are  children but ,16
15600, they are watching tv any advert is for the eyes of children cause they are watching it anyway to not allow those adverts you need to exactly specify what those are but ,16
15601," its not possible to effectively do this forbidding them becomes hard too 

an aspect of this problem is that young children that can be easily affected by adverts shouldnt ",16
15602, get in contact with them cause parents have the responsibility to decide what their kids should watch and what they shouldnt watch and even ,1
15603, they get attracted by something theyve seen in an advert the decision to get it is mostly ,3
15604, at the parents in this case advertisings  are ,16
15605, directed to the parents who cannot be influenced that easily if you take in consideration that children in the age of  hardly get attracted by pornoraphic adverts its not bad for them if they are attracted by things they want to play with another ,16
15606, forbidding adverts  children is that those who produce stuff to play for the childs they have a ,16
15607," in competition and cant make publicity for their products
on the other ",23
15608, children at this age actually can be influenced easier by things they see and they learn quicker from them so if an advert says that the product they have is the best to play with in the world its more likely that the young children believe this ,2

in the end because adverts that are  rarely have something really bad in them they shouldnt get a ",11

on the pro ",16
15613, the companies have to decide on their own if they want to abuse children like this at last it is their product and at the moment there is no real reason for them why they schouldnt advertise it but ,16

15615, they only want to sell their product it doesnt always be a bad thing ,23

",23
15621, its very controversial to make advertisements s young children those companies often just aim to make profit and dont care what impact that could have on younger people,16
15622, these adverts shouldnt be allowed children at this age are easily influenced and it can make raising a child even harder if it is constantly exposed to all the cool new stuff that you definitely need  imagine if a family wants to raise their child without the use of modern technology or keeping it to a minimum now theyre watching a childrens movie thats beeing aired on television if there suddenly pops up an advertisemet which talks about a superb new laptop for children the kid would naturally want it and now try to explain to your child that these things are completely annoying useless and a waste of money ,16

on the other ",21
15624," it can help if you want these kind of products for your kid picking out a gift for a small child can be extremly hard to do it would be that much easier if you knew what the kid wants because it saw it in an advert and told you that it wants it

all in all i suppose its really about the amount of advert and what is advertised you could probably accept it if a new flavour of ice cream is advertised or the brand new hello kitty school bag is presented but as ive said all the computers smartphones and tablets for children are just awful and can destroy a kids early life so based on all ive said now there would have to be a ban on a specific kind of advert the problem is that the modern day capitalism wouldnt allow to give an unfair ",16

15633," childrens tv or advertising for said age group i am not too sure if there is a substantual amount of advertising for children that could be banned  in this case banning an nonexistentual thing does no make sense another important question is if children aged 2 to 5 really are more influenceable by advertisements than any other age group at this stage why not ban advertisements for everyone adult humans are much more in danger to act the way the advertisement wants because of the factors money frustration boasting and greed 

advertisements for children ",13
15634, does not benefit them but if we allow advertisements for any other age group ,16
15635, be allowed for children what is important ,12
15636, is that children should be taught on how to process and react to advertisements s them if they can be taught to ignore the effect and make advertisements redundant ,16
15637,should the television industry be allowed to influence little children in this essay ,13
15638, consider about the influence of little children by the medias ,7
15639," the television and if it should be allowed

that the adults are influced by media isnt a secret whenever youre listening music or watching the news theres a direction which tells us something about the writer of the music or television program so is it even possible to isolate a little child of all the influences of media maybe the different opinions or messages help them to think in different directions and to consider all different views
in advertisings the technology industry suggets young children that they need a mobile phone or another gadget to have fun on the other ",17

at one ",20
15647," advertising is good to know the world so the children see what there exists like toys or movies and can start to have an own opinion for example they see a lot of ponies in television so a young girl can start loving horses and want to learn horseriding she starts to develope an own character

at the other ",0
15648, television advertising can make that all children love the same things ,0
15649," they watch the same advertisement so pherhaps most girls love playing with barbies and had many of them if a girl doesnt have a television or doesnt see this advertisement shes automatically an outsider

its easy to make children in this age believe that what they see in television is true so big companies can sell a lot of their products if the children want their products and if they dont get them theyre unhappy

children in that age are supposed to be playing outdoors or learning to walk ",14
15670, having to deal with the manipulative effects of television advertising that being said i do ,10
15671, not oppose to advertisements be that to children or to adults alike in todays world being able to resist the seductive effects of advertisements becomes increasingly important since we know children learn easier than adults the sooner they get into contact with ads and the sooner they learn to resist them and make choices for themselves without being influenced the better  ,0

in my opinion ",2

15683,     televison advertising was always a reason to discuss one of the things that were discussed ,10
15684," was antiadvertising this kind of advertising isnt allowed anymore nowadays another thing that is being discussed is the television advertising  the question of this discussion is if it should be forbidden or not
     one of the things about advertising  is that the young children go to their parents ",13

15686, is a good thing for the companies because sometimes the parents are going to buy it but theres ,9
15687, to look at this advertisements often show something that isnt about their advertised product or they promise something that isnt real the children will often believe this and than they have a wrong picture of this product another good thing about the advertising directed  is that the adults dont have to watch it and they wont get angry about it this isnt even bad for the companies because the children are going to tell their parents about it and theyll probably find it entertaining too another ,0
15688," have to earn money they can just 
      in my opinion it isnt really a bad thing to do advertising directed  ",11
15689, the children get a wrong impression the parents should just tell them about it and ,12
15690, they grow up they probably wont be even remembering this,24
15691,nowadays advertising in television is a big part of advertising and marketing for companies of any kind with television it is possible to reach a big audience and timed at the right moment  ,10
15692," during a particular show  it is even possible to direct advertisements towards your targeted audience this applies for audiences at any age including children 

directing advertisements towards children is a clever move ",16
15693, children are easily influenced and get overly excited very quickly so for companies that produce let us say toys it is a good idea to broadcast advertisements on television channels with a young audience ,0
15694," the disney channel this might lead to a boost in sales and will support a flourishing economy 

from a moral standpoint it is a bit difficult taking ",12
15695," of children who are  as mentioned above  easily influenced is pretty ruthless children might pressure their parents to buy product that their families do not need or  even worse  can not afford

but does a ban of advertising s children aged  really make sense children from five years and upwards are neither harder to influence in some cases it is even easier ",16
15696, peer pressure nor are they more conscious of what they need also there are a lot more children watching television above the age of five than ,17
15697, most of the parents  will not let their children watch television too often ,17
15698," they are in their early years 

so ",24
15699, that a ban of such advertisements would not really make sense beacuse not that many children aged  watch television a regulation of some kind would make sense ,13
15700, because morally it is arguably wrong to target young people who are easy to influence and do not really have a sense of what they can or can not afford or what they really need ,12
15701,"televisions are something very common in our modern society nearly in every house is one or are more than one televisions everybody loves to watch tv because you do not have to think for yourself a lot of businesses use it to make adverts the question is should this be forbidden for young children 
there are two positions to take one is to allow this because as a mother you can put your children in front of the tv and they are happy you can do something on your own maybe they even learn something especially series only for children can be useful 
on the other ",17
15702," that it should not be allowed to much tv on each day can damage a brain very bad the children do not have to think on their owns the get a wrong image of the world even their fantasy can be blocked because they do not think and they never have to invent something during playing in the garden many relationships can not be developed because they do not interact with other children at worst case not even with their parents the can not get some faith or believe in their family how should it work that they can become a good person they will have many problems in school even during adulthood 
another negative ",4
15703," of advertisement is that they give a wrong image of the world with advertisement you manipulate the people they want to be like the pretty people in the clips they want to buy the products and even they want to be like this people especially for children it can cause diseases for example anorexia and others like this they are not very selfconfident 
my opinion about this topic is very clear ",11
15704, young children should not watch tv the better are movie on dvd or blueray because there is nothing else than the movie ,6
15705, are plays or playing with other children in the neighbourhood probably a babysitter can help to do something on your own for half a day relationships are very important without a family or frineds you can trust in you are nothing in your life  ,1
15706,if you turn on your television in the morning you will most likely see a show for kids like dora which teaches children a foreign language but as the show ends commercials start and youll see ads for toys dolls etc if your kid is watching this with you he or she might get very excited and will want you to buy the item for them but all you wanted to do was for the kid to get some education ,20
15707," being entertained now you ask yourself should television ads s young kids be prohibited

in switzerland freedom of any kinds is highly valued freedom of speech particularly as one can oppose what the government says openly now if someone wanted to air a commercial they have the right to do ",14
15708," by prohibiting television ads towards young children this would definitely be a violation of the freedom of speech one of the main values of the western societies 

in western societies another main value is critical thinking and developing an own opinion this has to be taught at an early age or the kids will not have those skills by watching commercials directed at them they get ",13
15709," easily influenced in liking or disliking something that they dont really develop their own opinion they just follow the people and things that seem cool or trendy but dont try t analyze whats happening to them when those kids grow up they believe everything they hear they dont think twice about anything this is exctly what has happened in the usa where everyone believed all the fake news in the internet which lead to the election of donald trump

is that what we want for switzerland the election of our own donald trump for me the answer is a clear no and the ",7
15710, thing we can do against this future is prohibiting commercials on television s kids they can be ,13
15711, easily influenced and in the time of fake news and alternative ,7
15712, it is important from a young age on to be able to think critically and develop ones own opinion,8
15713, was invented it has always enjoyed a huge number of viewers the new technologie is constantly developping and becoming of great importance to the society we live in today one could claim it is supportive and gives us the oppertunity to establish things we couldnt ,23
15714, and it is a way to entertain us in a world where nothing else seems to be satisfying enough and lets not forget about all the money companys make over a year our children grow up in this technological world learning to use all these computers and spending most of their time in front of the television is it ,10
15715," really okay to advirtise directly toward these young users

in their ",16
15716, years children learn a lot about themselves and about others they see how this world works and adapt to the casualities in it it can be good to show them the reality ,8
15717, they can start to get used to this world one way of doing ,19
15718, is to advertise directly  as they watch television they develop their own opinion about what they like and what they dont like later it will be usefull to have its own opinion ,10
15719, they can stick up to it and get what they want and this way they learn fast to seperate important information from ,7
15720, informationinformation that interests them from information that is uninteressting to them the children learn how to cope with the pressure of wanting something ,8
15721," not always getting it

on the other ",18
15722, this advertising could lead to more spoiled kids pressuring their parents to always get what they see in the advertisement on the television and if they dont get what they want their unpleased with their parents ,0
15723, their parents are unhappy about the behaviour of there ungrateful children in the length this sort of stressful conversations can affect the familysituation because it puts the parents under extrem pressure and teaches the children to go on about things they wish to have ,7
15724, a declination not only the parents suffer from the constant wishes they cant always allow ,9
15725, the children grow more unhappy ,7
15726," they realise that not everthing is just like in the advertisement perfect and always available
another bad sideeffect is that children are too young to seperate reallity versus virtuallity they dont recongnize ",2
15727," they are being fooled by one of this promising pictures this could lead to false interpretation and naivity for promising offers in the television

finally one must say that we should let children be children let them play without being confrontet with our adult world to early and this adult world ",6
15728, includes advertisements from the television,10
15729,today advertising is part of our everyday life we cant watch television without being distracted and interrupted by adverts for adults these are simply annoying but ,11
15730," it comes to children it gets problematic

children spend much of their time watching television ",17
15731, it is inevitable that they come across advertising they are easier manipulated and believe everything they see or hear the parents want to make their children happy and are often forced to buy the advertised products for the companies this is a huge ,2
15732," they can sell more products and make more profit so it could effect the economy negatively if these adverts werent allowed
but children shouldnt be manipulated at such a young age what they see on television isnt how the real world works and it might give them wrong ideas they arent able to differentiate between reality and advertising one problem that might occur is how to control the regulation it is very difficult to legally fix what belongs to advertising  and companies may find a way to outgo this law

i believe that children shouldnt be exposed to advertising mainly because it effects their view on reality in my opinion the companies should find a way to make their profit without manipulating children it would be a relief for the parents and the children",14
15733,you could say that in todays society it is important to go with the trend even with childrens toys it is early developed wether your child is liked by other or not which often is connected on what toys they play with if a freind of your child has the cooler toy your child wants it too and if you do not buy it the friend maby does not want to play with your son or daughter anymore because his toys are boring so not buying advertised toys could cause bullying in early age but i ,20
15734, with this statement beacuse advertisments directed to children do not have a serious effect on the amount of sold products advertised the children aged  are not old enough to understand whats going on they do not understand that this is an advertisement in the end they like the product but it is their parents who get to decide wether they buy the product or not also children aged two to fie should not watch tv ,13
15735, not children younger than four they hardly learned speaking and understanding what the people say ,7
15736, swiss children who grow up speaking swissgerman until thei go to school mostley the children aged two to four do not even understand the language used in tv as it is in german not swissgerman and if they do not understand it why let them watch it so the advertisments are uneffectful unless the parents decide to buy the product which isadvertised,14
15737,"this essay is about television advertising  it will be talked about if it should be allowed or not
television advertising is a common topic nowadays there exists a lot of differences in opinion about what should be allowed and what not advertising toward children is a good way to get their interest for parents it can be hard to get their childs attention to teach them useful learning games with letters and numbers but ",14
15738," they see it on tv they often think its super fun and they often ask their parents to get it for them as long as the commercial is appropriate for children it should be considered something positive 
television advertising should be allowed ",2
15739, its content is appropriate for the age of the children and ,6
15740, it is advertising something useful as soon as it gets to toys or games that a parent doesnt want their 4 year old to have it shouldnt be allowed to be advertised on tv it is important to consider what comercial is shown ,16
15741, a tv show there should simply not be any comercial about aggressive computer games ,6
15742, a show that is watched by little children at the same time ,6
15743, it is each parents responsability to be aware ,12
15744, of what their child is watching and ,7
15745, that commercials arent always made to be seen by everyone children ,0
15746," the younger ones that are only about two or three years old dont care what they watch often you can turn on any tv program and theyll happily watch it children that young dont get what part is the actual show and what part is commercial in a tv program it is almost impossible for a television advertisment to reach young children 
in the end my opinion is that television advertising should be allowed and its each and every parents responsability to let their child watch shows that were made ",14
15747, age and to be aware that there can always be advertising that is not appropriate for the age of their child,16
15748," many different advertisement airing on television every day every ad is aimed to attrac a specific group of people especially in the afternoon there are various ads that are directed only toward young children aged  these advertisements are very controversial because it promotes materialism and kids learn the wrong ethics thats why those tv advertisements designed to attrac kids only should not be allowed

advertisements that are  kids teach wrong ethics to a child every ad promotes a product and makes you want to posess it immediately kids learn through advertisements that material things can make you happy and are ",14
15749, things to have in life but this kind of thinking is wrong ,21
15750," we should be happy in life without money and our possessions and appreciate our family and friends and other things that cant be bought with money advertisement teaches kids materialism and a wrong definition of happiness

in controst one could argue that advertisement help the economy without advertisements nobody knew about products on the market and nobody would buy them because through advertisment you get an insight on what is offered on the market the companies wellbeing and wealth depend on their sales of the product if a company couldnt advertise their products anymore the sales would drop and the company could run its business anymore but a good economy is dependant on companies and competition

children at a young age are very easily influenced and fooled if they see an ad about a teddy bear the instantly want it adults can be influenced by ads ",0
15751, but the difference is that children cannot understand at this age that you get everything you want in life the ,24
15752, is that they will cry for the teddy bear ,20
15753, the parents give up and ,9
15754, buy it parenting is very ,9
15755, in those situations because in one way the parents cant stand seeing their kids cry and being unhappy but they ,9
15756," dont want to spoil their kids by buying them everything they wantthe companies that are advertising the teddy basically exploit families 

i ",9
15757, think that advertisement designed to attrac only kids shouldnt be allowed anymore because our children shouldnt live in a materialistic world where everybody needs to possess the better car bigger house or ,16
15758,there are many advertising in the television which are only directed to children often they want to achieve children which are  years old because they are easy to influence these advertisings often show many kinds of toys and cool stuff for childrenin this essey ,14
15759," discuss if advertising  children should be allowed or not 

i really ",16
15760, this statement television advertising shoundt be allowed  children in the age of  years ,13
15761, that children dont need any advertising only to see how many toys there are in this world of cours this is a good way to achieve more buyers for all the stuff that is produced in factories but ,0
15762," children dont need this in my opinion it is only important that the parents know what there is on the market or not because they know the best what is good for their children and what is not 

in addintion there are ",2
15763," many people which are poor and cant buy any cheap toys for their children in this case advertising  this children wont be a good thing children will be unhappy if they dont get these cools toys from the television because their parents dont earn enough money to buy it 

in conclusion i just can say that is isnt a good idea to bring advertising  children in the age of  on television because they dont need it their parents know the best what their children need and what is the best for them 

 


",14
15764,there are many television advertisment today which can be used for making people do something they are mostly used to make people buy something but there are ,10
15765," advertising whitch arent as usefull as u think 

young children are growing up with these advertising and not often are these advertising made for them there are different kinds of advertisng advertisment which includes brutallity and sexuallity influent the childs growth in many cases the child will memorise these pictures and perhaps will do something bad with these imaginations 

but there are ",16
15766," good advertisments whitch can help too make young child more smarter they are often related to sports ore toys young childrens love to play with toys that are made for their age not to mention the avdertisment for schools 

for me its a good thing to show young children advertisment if i was a father i would have no problems showing these kind of images to my childrens as long as they behave and wont do something bad ill stay loyal but ",0
15767, these advertisments will cross the line ill do something about it ,11
15768,"the problem of television advertising  is that in the age of 2 to 5 years the children are often overwhelmed by the television it is often too much for the children to take up and even can frighten them because they are easily scared

another ",14
15769," is that sitting in front of the tv for more than 1 hour can cause a headache and is not really healthy children in this age should go outside and play in the garden and the woods they should play things on their own to learn how to do something without being dependant on this screen

furthermore is creativity being lost if they only have to sit and get information without really doing something if a child ",17
15770, plays a role game there are a lot of ideas created and the child has really to think about what it does ,8
15771," but if it is watching tv it only has to switch the channel and not really has to think about anything

if children at this age get used to watch tv there will ",17
15772," be a lack of communication skills because if the children are sitting in front of this screen even together they wont have to comunicate or interact with each other only to decide which channel they are going to watch

but you can ",17
15773," see a possibility in the early contact to tv the chilren can learn how to go along with the electronic devices in an intelligent way

in conclusion ",17
15774, that the television advertising for young children shouldnt be forbidden but we should be aware of the problems it can cause and at least limit the hours of watching,13
15775,"should television advertising for children be allowed

nowadays there are many children who already have access to smartphones or tablets ",14
15776, they are very young television consume has got ,17
15777," in the following explanation i try to show you them

first of all television advertising can be a good thing if they show you ",10
15778, how to behave in society when they explain why you should always sneeze into your elbow or why you should always be friendly to people ,3
15779, you do not like them they can give the children tips how to survive in their ,12
15780, life they would learn those behaviours from young age on and would possibly behave like that without asking themselves why they have to do that it would ,7
15781," be a good thing for the parents because they do not have to tell them the whole time how they have to behave because the aready got drilled like that

but ",12
15782, television consume should not be allowed ,17
15783, young aged children instead they should be playing somwhere outside in the garden with their friends or exploring the nature the children should learn to beschã¤ftigen themself advertsising can be really bad ,16
15784, they show the children a wrong picture of a average lifestyle ,6
15785," the children get a wrong impression for example they could think that it is totally normal to move into their own house with eightteen and already own a expensive car those habits can influence the children really badly and make their lives more complicated than it has to be

",7
15786, it should be forbidden because children are too young to handle all those impression and the parents should teach their children on their own how to possibly best manage their future life,12
15787,in the society of today children are getting confronted with new technology without much choice of there parents or even themselves technology is all around us it helps us in our everyday life it entertains us ,8
15788, a hard day of work and as such it is no wonder that most households are in possesion of a tv nowadays this contributes to the media consumption of young children as they will be watching tv ,17
15789, many companies have realised this ,23
15790, and because of that they saw television as a possible means of advertising most television channels are getting financed by advertising ,10
15791, they are grateful to companies who will pay them to advertise their products television advertising is based on the time of the day to appeal to the audience who is sitting infront of the tv and as such advertising targeted at children will mostly be seen in the late afternoon and early evening children look at the world in a different way than us adolecents and adults and ,0
15792, its only natural that they have another understanding of advertisements than us for a kid possesions are a very big deal ,16
15793," they are an easier target if a kid sees a toy in a television ad it wont think of the price or if there really is any use in buying it a kid will just be excited and start to ask his parents to buy it for them the parents thinking a lot more rationally will probably try to explain to their kid why they cant buy a new toy they may not have enough money or they may not want to spoil the child for a kid those reasons mean nothing to them and as such it wont be able to understand it instead the kid will get angry at his parents and conflicts between them could come up
that is why ",2
15794, television advertising  should not be allowed young children do not ,13
15795, know what it means to have concerns about money or being spoilt they cant control their greed ,3
15796, which means theyll fall prey to the fun advertisements of companies promising them joy in buying their product and small children wont understand their parents and instead get angry at them all over an ad on tv,2
15797, is annoying to many people the television is fluded by advertisement and takes the whole joy of television so ,10
15798," advertisement should be minimanized

but specifically advertisement toward young children i dont see a difference to the advertisement which is  other ages because ",16
15799, this is the responibility of the parents that they teach their kids how to handle or how to interpretate advertisemen ,11
15800," it might be tempting for the kids to react like they are supposed to
its like all the other advertisements they are designed to make the watcher want to have the things which appear in the advertisement they phsycologically stimulate the brain of the consumer to make them consume
the same with the advertisement for kids the company shows them toys and present them even better than they are with effects which stimulate again the brain of the kid ",0
15801, that the kid wants the toy this is economy and like this the economy keeps going like it is now everyone has what he wants but it just shouldnt get out of ,20
15802," like its happening today with the fluding amount of advertisement there is today

another problem i see ",11
15803, the amount of advertisement is the kind of advertisement you find where and ,11
15804,"
so what i mean is the advertisement which contain sexual brutal or violent content which are meant for adults and young adults so ",16
15805," that these kinds of advertisement do not belong on everyday or comercial tv cahnnels at day time at least i even think there should be a seperate channel for just advertisements of different kinds or there should be at least a clear trigger warning to the consumer which warns or explains the following content

id say that even for all advertismenet of a similar kind there should be a seperate channel or source where you can find them
i know that ",15
15806, many channels and shows wouldt be able to afford their program anymore because the money source of advertisement is ,10
15807, they should include their product in to the show the consumer actually wants to watch like they are already doing it in some tv shows or on the internet where many video creators are sponsored by companys which put their product in to the videos of the creators ,10
15808,"

beside of the adverdisements just being annoying there wouldnt be any problems if the parents just teach their kids how to handle these things

i dont even know myself what the best ",12
15809, but it should and will be in a way how i explained it now,21
15810,we live in a world full of electrical devices they can be very helpful in different situations in life in the other ,23
15811, there are the critics and they thhink that that all this electronical things ,23
15812," the television is going to make the people dumb
in this essay ",10
15813, write about the statement if young children should not be allowed to watch tv at the end of the essay ,17
15814," write my opinion about this statement

first of all ",21
15815," that a young child has to see with his own eyes the world i mean that a child has to see the nature and he has to learn many things about the pupils life in the tv we cantt see the world and we cant make our own opinions its like we see something and we dont question about it 

an other ",8
15816, is that in the television you can see ,10
15817, many things which are  not for a child i know that in the tv we can watch ,6
15818," nemo a fillm for a child but there are films which are not for a the cilds eyes

in th eother ",6
15819, the tv has alsohis good ,10
15820, documentations about animals or other information sources where a child can learn much the child can see the world with all his beauty but the tv tells ,6
15821," of human being to summerize the tv can help children to protect the world and not to destroy it

in addition ",17
15822, it is nice to see a movie with the child ,6
15823," children love this story and they are amazed when they are a bit tired of playing the whole afternoon the whole family can watch a film to relax a bit

to summarize my ",8
15824, that watching tv has negative and positive ,17
15825, its going to make the children a bit stupid because they dont question about anything in the tv in the other ,17
15826, the tv can give us helpful information tounderstand the life now im going to write my opinion ,17
15827, that its not necessairy to allowed  young children watching tv the young children can watch tv but they ,17
15828," have to go outside to make their own experiences and his own opinion about the world

",8
15829,"in the 21th century many children are growing up with technology they use different devices even they are very young the television belongs to the favourite used divice of children they are able to watch funny stories about animals which can talk or other fairytales but in between the tv programme there is a lot of advertising too huge companies know exactly that children will see their advert for toys or other things like circuses children which see the advertisment are putting pressure on their parents because they mean that in this world today we have to buy many things or undertake something every weekend 
unconcioulsy little kids compare each others belongings and are wanting even more and more they wouldnt be ",14
15830, in love with material things ,18
15831, they wouldnt see them all the time advertising on children is a mistake because its the ,16
15832, step into capitalism they want more toys and more adventures children will automatically think that they need all these things which are shown to them but thats not reality things arent happiness and that is proved for example ,2
15833, children get what they want ,7
15834, be playing with thst toy all the time but ,20
15835," it gets boring and they are searching for somethimg new so children wont be impressed by little things and are expecting way too much
to say it a nutshell ",24
15836, companies want to sell their products but the price they pay for losing humanity is even worse and not worth it,23
15837,modern family households have changed very much in the last few years its usual that every family has a television an ipad or mobile phones at home so theres no way a toddler doesnt come in contact with the new medias the big advertisment companies have discovered this ,2
15838, in order to sell things they advertise for small children because there ,0
15839, in their learning phase a childs mind works like a vaccum cleaner as soon they can learn something new a product shown in tv will be recognised in store by the young toddler it wants to have it because its related with good memories from the tv the parents are ,20
15840," nearly forced to buy the product in the end thats exactly what the companies wanted them to do 

",23
15841, thats one of the main reasons why tv advertising on young children should be banned back in my days we didnt have a tv ,14
15842, todays kids its a shame that this is allowed because small children cant protect themselves from the big influence of a tv commercial furthermore ,14
15843, children between this age schouldnt even be allowed to watch tv because it doesnt improve creativity instead they should play with lego or with other leisure things that arent electronical,17
15844,in todays world a world where we are surrounded by technology and media seeing a piece of advertising at some ,11
15845, during the day is inevitable no matter your age location or language advertisments are everywhere from advertisements on television to advertisements on billboards to advertisements online it is impossible to go a day without seeing at least a few however it is important to note that ,11
15846, people of all ages are subject to seeing advertisements whether passively or actively young children ,16
15847, take in what they see around them problem is no one ever seems to notice and if they do they do not seem to care most children watch at least an hour of television every day ,17
15848, they are subjected to seeing multiple advertisements some which may negatively affect their mindsets and thoughts in my opinion children should not be targeted by advertisers and the reasons behind this opinion will be outlined ,16
15849," short essay 
children see enough advertisments as aforementioned it is hard to leave your house without being bombarded by a series of billboards posters and videos you could argue that ",16
15850, children are at home they are not affected by advertisments whatsoever however this is not the case for as soon as their parents turn on the television the advertisements come straight back we must consider what influence this has on little childern it may make them become extremely materialistic and greedy meaning they might value the products they see on television and want nothing but to own them ,14
15851, valuing what they already have take ,3
15852," an advertisment for a new toy which a child sees multiple times during its television session most children having liked what they saw and having seen it multiple times would most likely start to beg their parents to buy it for them and would become infuriated were their parents to refuse alternatively if their parents were to succumb to their childrens wishes the children could get the impression that what they say goes and could become used to being spoiled which would  later in life 
another reason against targeting advertising towards young children is that is simply does not make much sense a child between two and five years old would have to convince their parents to buy it for them ",0
15853," they cannot buy anything themselves furthermore children are influenced very easily and are very gullible meaning they will buy into anyhing they see or hear leading to easy deception who would want to decieve a child
in conclusion i believe that targeting very young children ",2
15854, it comes to television advertising should not be allowed or limited at the least children are already subjected to advertising everywhere else ,13
15855, why at home advertising has no benefits for small children ,16
15856, why not just leave it out entirely if you would have argued that it would be more financially beneficial for childrens television channels ,13
15857, you should ask yourself what kind of society we live in if we put the finacial wellbeing of a company over the mental wellbeing of thousands of innocent children across the globe,9
15858, write about the controversial question if television advertising which is directed  should be allowed or not first ,15
15859, and later im goint to list the negative ,21
15860," why it should be allowed is because of the economy if you show beautiful dolls or trucks kids want them and they beg their parents till they get their toys those shops can sell their products and the competition between different toy stores can be increased

on the otherside the environment would get worse because the normal wealthy countries live in overproduction ",20
15861, helping other countries with their essential needs in addition the plastic toys cant be recycled and ,20
15862, in asia they have a big sea pollution problem another  ,19
15863, is that the branding of products costs a lot and you pay more for the branding as for the product itself an example is a perfume of versace or any other famous brand the price of the production of a perfume is one thing but the branding includes foto shootings with celebrities at a nice place ,23
15864," you have to pay the photographer with his staff the celebrities and the transport to the setting and at least the transport to the stores 

according to the longer list of contras ",23
15865, the television advertising for young children anyway ,14
15866, mothers buy a lot of toys for their children because they want the best for them and i wouldnt let my child watch television because ,17
15867, that publicities not  could pop up and a child needs to learn how to spend its time with that what it has got,12
15868,is it okay to let young children watching televsion this is a question on which many of the young mothers and fathers want to receive an answer the television is a new invention and the children nowadays are the ,17
15869, generation who grows up with this invention but it is very undangerous for young children naturally is easier for the parents if there children are quite and glad if they are watching tv but there are other meanings watching too much tv can be dangerous because the children dont have enough mouvement and they learn ,17
15870, much if they are playing with other children in the house or in the garden they have to have own ideas and have to respect other people if the children are watching tv the whole day they dont have these abilities because they can determine themselves which programme they want to watch but there are ,24
15871, a lot of other abilities like motorical abilities or working with the hands which children learn if they are playing but there are ,8
15872, people who say that it is more secure to watch tv than to play in the garden ,1
15873, yes sure it is more secure it is more healthy to play in the garden probably you hit your knee but you are better protected against infections and if i watch the ,4
15874, about learning vital abilities it is much more helpful to play with other children than to watch tv but ,8
15875, it should not be forbidden to watch tv but it should be very rare like once a week or something like that ,17
15876, this is the best method to educate children instead of giving them a tv parents should play with the children ,17
15877, a memory or read a book or paint something,18
15878,"when i siz in a restaurant i often see little kids with an ipad or iphone playing a game or looking a film the parents sit beside them chatting with friends i do understand that it is exhausting to entertain kids the hole time and the parents need a break but is the ipad or iphone the best way

im just 18 but ",1
15879," the parents could do it better because there are other possibilities to entertain kids an easy way to give them something to do is to let them draw almost every restaurant has paper and pens an other possibilities is to bring some books with you to the restaurant in this ways the kids can entertain themselves

as many sientists say elektronic object can have bad ",24
15880," like cancer so why should we let our kids use these elektronic stuff i know kids really like elektronic stuff but parents should definitely avoid the contact between their kids and a television ipad iphone gameboy and other objects like these

a two year old isnt interessted in a documentary about bears in canada or something similar so they want look kids series like cars or lego movies but with this series they dont get useful informations most of these series are foulish

kids are ",17
15881," creativ and have a huge fantasy we should let them use these when they play gamse on the iphone their creativity and fantasy get lost

for me there is no ",3
15882, to support the use of television or other electronic things for kids of that young age so i definitely think it should not be allowed to let kids use electronic stuff like television,12
15883,most of the television advertising which is made for children has a funny story the producers want to make their product more interesting for children  most of this products are sweets and have a lot of sugar when the kids see this product in a store they really want it because in television it seems very tasty furthermore parents have problems to tell their kids that they cannot have every funny thing in the store in television advertising is ,14
15884, a lot of junk in addiction the children can see the same advertising hundred times a day ,0
15885," they watch television for a long time so the advertising can get boring

on  the other ",10
15886," kids can see different products they can think about the different toys and can decide which one they want so they can tell the parents what theywan for birthday and christmas moreover they learn that they cannot have everything and that they have to chose one of the toys obvisously it is difficult for kids ignoring every funny advertising and just choosing one thing

according to me television advertising for children should be alowed often it is very funny and the producers spend a lot of time and money for it the children can see new products there are ",0
15887," a lot of products that are used outside so children can see that playing outside in the nature could be nice evidently this is better than hardly watching television the whole day  when parents do not want that the children want to have everything in the store because of the advertising they do not let them watch television

",20
15888,"young children dont really know what it means to buy something they dont even know what money is
when they see something in the televison they want to have it becaus the people who are using it are very happy children cant think of the future as we can eg ",2
15889, the toy is broken or ,20
15890," they are too old for it money isnt important to them and they cant imagine what a specific price conectet with a product means wether its a fair price or not they arent able to connect all those things togheter
young children arent allowed to buy things by themselves ",2
15891," advertising s them shouldnt be allowed the parents have to buy all the things for them and they have to decide what they want to buy not their children parents have to do a lot for their children the last thing they want is an annoying son or daughter who wants someting unnecessary and expensive
a reason against this statement would be that the people who make those television advertising have to pay a lot of money ",13
15892," and that they somehow have to earn money with their business its a good strategy to advertise directly toward young children because they are easy to convince and nobody can say no to such a cute little person

as we can see are there more reasons to ",16
15893, with this statement its unfair to advertise towards somebody who cant buy it by themself and who doesnt know the ,23
15894, of the purchase i totally ,18
15895, with this statement advertising s young children is like an unequal contract and should be forbidden,16
15896,today many young children watch television one hour every day the companys make advertisments ,14
15897, the television came up to the marked to catch more people who buy this things the companies have seen that children have a big influence in their parents and if the child hava a desire the parents would maby give in so they began to advetise toward young children in the tv the children can see a toy that they want to have with some tricks the producers of these advertisments can manipulate the clip on tv with some special effects the children cant make a difference between tv and reality if they had seen a firestation made with lego which looks like the reality they want to play with this and the parents may give in in my opinion the children were manipulated only to make profits in the toy industrie so the advertising should not be allowed or shouldnt have some special effects in it but ,14
15898, its hard forbide the advertisment for children in the reality because there must be a voting about this subject and the companies would influence this votings they want to earn more money maybe it would be better if the parents would talk to their children an show them the specialeffects so the children could understand how it works in reality and maybe the parents schouldnt give in ,16
15899," easily 
but i think that we have other more importaint problems in the world to diskuss and maybe to change than the advertising toward children",16
15900,through the window i see that my neighbour child is a lot of the time in front of the televion i questioned myself is this good for this young child to watch ,17
15901," much televison this essay will show the pros and cons about letting young children watching television  i am sorry for not writing about the actuall theme

firstawfull a swiss study in bern claimed that in these days a lot of young children aged 58 are watching too much televison the light and the switching between one picture to another is bad for the evolving of the brain the brain has to work ",17
15902, much and process alll these things that ,18
15903," watching television children feel more hyperaktiv and aggressive

on the other ",17
15904, there are people with the opinion that there are many films or documentary which can educated there children they claim that young children can learn better with pictures and videos ,6
15905, about the unversium or about the nauter pictures or videos stay better in mind ,18
15906," some of physical or economical or school stuff in a video can be explained much more better or made more interesting for young children

the crician ",6
15907, full with that but their opinion is that in the televion that there are ,19
15908, much soaps and other stuff which should be shown to 5 year old children soaps where the world is made absolutely unrealistic and films with a lot of violent and ,6
15909, require that a lot of partens actually do not know what the children are actually watching ,6
15910," they are coming home form school they do not supervise them

some people require that today it is importaned for young children that they watch telvesion that they discover ",17
15911," medias and mabey relazie by themself what is actuall true or what is absolutely not realistic as well if parents do not allow the children to watch televison and all of the other school friends are allowed the children are excluded

in my opinion in every stateman there is a little bit of truth in it i totally ",17
15912, that letting watching young children ,1
15913, much televsion is not really healthy but ,17
15914, it is aobut the quantity there is a lot of really good documentary for young children to learn things about the world but there has to be a supervision of the parents ,6
15915, the youn children may accidentally watch something which is not aged for them as well ,6
15916, it is important that young children discover diffent media to learn bythemself how to deal with them so ,17
15917," it is everything about the quantity

 i discovered i read the sentence wrong  it is about advertising televsion  i just had 10 mins left ",10
15918, i just wrote my essay finish i am sorry i am really soory i did not have enough time to rewrite everything ,21
15919,there are a lot different positive and negative ,21
15920," about television watching children 

in general ",17
15921, that children in the age between two and five years shouldnt watch tv at this time because at this stage of live it is very important to play a lot outside ,17
15922, in the field or forest or to play games which you can touch with your hands a lot of studies have shown that kids who began watching tv ,17
15923, early werent very clever in their future the reason for this is that you dont have to think a lot ,8
15924," youre watching a film or serie you just have to watch

another ",6
15925, against telewatching kids is that they should better read or look at books and pictures in it by doing this they have ,17
15926, the possibility to let their parents explain different objects which are ,8
15927, against tvkids is that if they start watching television ,17
15928," early they often will have the need for this activity in their future

but there are ",24
15929, for tvkids for parents it is very easy to let their kids do something ,1
15930, they can do their own job the  years old ones are mostly happy to be in kind of dreaming world for some hours last but not least there exists ,24
15931," a lot of films and series where the children can lern something about themselves their environement and the earth

well at the end im ",6
15932, against tvkids in this age and ,17
15933,in the current world the average persons spends about 2 hours a day infront of a television every 20 to 30 minutes is a commercial break some people use this break to eat something or get a beer befor the actual programm continus ,10
15934," others wait in their chair or couch until the show or game goes on television advertising is used to influence peoples interests
in my opinion commercials targeting direct towards young children shouldnt be allowed first of all children are unlike mature people very easy to influce or manipulate using commercials to attract the demand of a certain product could lead to a obsession for a kid ",14
15935," they arent able to think critical like adults in conclusion it wouldnt be ethically incorrect to advertise direcly towards children aged 
furthernore commercials dont give a critical analysis of the pros and cons and arent reliable at all to product itself this can be often seen in car commercials where it has nothing to do with the car but the atmosphere you get with it kids cant jugde correctly ",2
15936," it would be missleading for them their expectations are emotions that the product should give for example the nerf gunvideos the commercial shows an epic fight between to armed groups in a warzone but with nerfguns
the reasons a kid buys the product ",2
15937," its an atmospere in my opinion the children would be disappointed because they thought that the product can do what they saw in the commercial
to summarise children can be extremly influenced by television advertising this leads to a big need to have this kind of product for the kid and ",2
15938, they have it it wont be good enough for the high expectations which were created by showing only the good ,19
15939,advertising is all around us its an important part of economy companies need it to get people to buy their products they often advertise on the internet or whats even more effective on television what if theres a company that is obligated to get children to buywant their products ,0
15940," a toy should companies be allowed to show their advertises which are  on television

everyone is free to do whatever he or she wants ",15
15941, its not harming anybody are those advertises harmful for young children companies have specalists which know exactly how to manipulate a kid ,4
15942, that the kid absolutely wants to have the advertised product they may want ,0
15943, theyve seen it on television but the parents have the money and can ,9
15944," decide if they want to buy their kid that toy or not 

televison finances through money they get from adversiting children tv channels depend on that money if adverting toward young children was banned some tv channels wouldnt be able to exists any longer another question is if thats acutally something bad two to five year old children shouldnt watch tv anyway it very much influences their intelligence and their ability to learn so if maybe there werent as much kids tvchannels any more kids would be more successful later in life but we absolutly have to acknowledge that there is the internet where the kids can have their harming screentime or ",14
15945," even get to watch adversiting so maybe the companies would just switch from television to the internet to make their adverises

my personal opinion is that we already have way too many laws and thats it makes no sense to ban television advertising  young kids everyone should be deciding for their own kid if one really doesnt want their kid ",13
15946, see such advertising he or she should ban all electronic devices from the ho,11
15947,"television advertising is a topic which has been well discussed throughout all ages of the society many people are under the influence of ads and many dislike television advertising if television adverstising is a good or a bad thing is debatable but there is no such thing as a perfect answer

television advertising is key to a well functioning economy of a country billboards and newspapers are ",15
15948, an opportunity for  informing the population of ones country about upcoming and outstanding products but it is the television which hasturned out to be most effective in a by technology dominated society of 2017 people even families spend a large amount of their daytime infront of a televsision watching tv whilst eating has become more than just normal many families dont eat together ,10
15949, each of them can watch their tvshow a company is eager to sell their products to as many people as possible therefore classic propaganda and mouth to mouth propaganda are essential for an industrybranch to survive within the growing markets by showing ads people are confronted with the new or old products many may think about the products later on or think of them unconciously without them noticing the best ads are the most annoying ones you for exp hear a song or see the ,10
15950, of the ad and already know which one it is you think ugh not this one again but thats the best reaction a person can have now the company knows that the ad is like branded into ones brain ads are expensive but bring in more money than they costed a world without adverstising wouldnt work and a tvstation simply cannot control hows watching tv ,11
15951," ads for kids cant be removed easily just like that

ads the word already reminds one and all of annoying theme songs and too much information in a too short amount of time so the question is are ads necessary for older people yes but for younger people ",16
15952, kids no kids often watch tv as a treat ,17
15953, than to waste time they get promised that they are allowed to watch tv ,3
15954, homework or playing outside children ,1
15955, young ones watch kid shows as cartoons or animated movies these channels are not the place for ads why would one even think about placing ads on a kidschannel as cartoon network or nikelodeon no adults watch these channels ,16
15956," its even a waste of money placing ads there kids at an age of 25 years old shouldnt be manipulated at such an early stage that ads need to be placed for adults is selfexplaining but channels which are only there for entertainment should be totally adfree

my personal opinion is that channels where the producers know that it is s children only should be aware that ads arent very effective and that they should be banned in a general statement ads are essential for the survival of an economy because withoit ads the cycle would not work the way it does and needs to and i recon that companies are really wasting their money because how many 25 year olds can actually memorize the things they see and recall them at an age of 9 or 10 ",14
15957,"television advertising   should it be allowed or not

first of all it is important to seperate the differnt kind of television advertising different channels show different types of advertising therefore its in the responsibility of the parents wich channel they let watch theire children during the day there is less danger for bad or scary television advertising but in the evening the advertising often change for example a channel shows a trailer of a scary movie advertising like that makes young children full of frigt and fear and they often get nightmares 
so like i sad ",14
15958," is the kind of channel young children watch channels made for yong people like disneychannel show advertising made for young people in this case theire is no danger to let young children watch these kind of advertising 

because of this my opinion is that television advertising  young people should be allowed if the parents controle the situation if they dont watch theire children and let them alone with the televisioncontroler it should not be allowed in real life we cant controle the responsibility of the parents ",14
15959," i can only hope that the parents always have an eye on theire kids   
     
",9
15960,first we should have a look at the word advertising ,11
15961, there are differente types of advertisements for example advertising for violence films and games who should not be watched under 16 should not be directed  they may get impressd of shooting and ,16
15962, in kindergarten they forme weapons with their fingers or take a brick and gunpoint at other children ,24
15963," the chance that they get aggressive later on in their life will be bigger than children who havent watched that type of these  advertises
my oppinion is that if you let your child watching tv where the chance is huge that they see something for what their too young you should sit ",14
15964," to them and give them the feeling that their not alone and that theres someone carring about them and their reaction about the advertising 
on tv there are channels ",10
15965, made for children it has some stuff that is addapted to their age ,20
15966, that they should only watch these things ,6
15967," they wont get confronted with things not made for their eyes  
if we talk about the sesonal advertising i cant see any problems for example ",11
15968, christmas there is shown a lot of advertising for kids these advertisings are ,16
15969, made for kids to make them desire the toy shown in the advertisement of course ,20
15970, seeing the advertisement the children want it really badly but ,0
15971," its your job as a parent to say no to them eaven if its hard sometimes but with saying no they learn that in life you cant get all your wishes  

at the end of it ",9
15972, that as a parent you should really think about what kinde of advertisement you want your child to see and if you let it watch a non ,13
15973, childrenfriendly channel you should really sit ,6
15974,i wouldnt say that television is just bad for children it really can be helpful sometimes ,17
15975, you can learn a lot about some documentaries about a specific topic but the problem is the age with an age of  youre not able to understand these documentaries ,6
15976, it has some tv programs for young children but theyre ,6
15977, in this age you shouldnt watch tv already it has many things a child could do like playing outside with their friends reading a book playing with their toys or doing something with their parents with an age of five i would allow my child to watch tv at the weekend if he wants to but not everyday and just with a time limit maybe thirty minutes on a rainy sunday i cant understand how ,17
15978, many parents let their children watch tv during the whole day ,17
15979, doing some acitivities with them ,18
15980, tired from the whole week ,18
15981, they worked everyday from nine to five and they just want to relax a few hours ,1
15982, the best way to keep your child calm is putting them in front of the tv when it happens not that often and not that long ,1
15983, its ok but only at an age of five ,4
15984, two or three is really too young to watch tv they can barely talk ,17
15985, im not sure if they really understand something as a parent i ,9
15986, would look what kind of things my child watch on tv not everything is that clever for a child at an age of  so my last words ,6
15987, say is that im not really into letting young children watching tv but ,17
15988, the time makes the big difference between the good or the bad,18
15989, in the age of  shouldnt watch television because thats not ,17
15990, good for their health they will grow up and its not good for their eyes its ,4
15991," not good because if they always watch tv they wont go outside playing with other children from the neighbourhood so why should television advertising should be good young little children shouldnt be there to watch it
they could ",14
15992, get influenced by the television and they admire the person in the tv or they want to be like them they ,6
15993," could get the wrong idea of things in the world which isnt good they should learn knowing the world by their own experiences and not from the tv it isnt the tv which is always right
the good thing is that they can learn something from watching television they can learn knowing what they want and persuading their parents to buy the things from the tv if the parents do what you want you hae them under control and thats difficult to manage you can learn it in the young age ",17
15994," little and sweet and nobody can say no to you
if the parents let them watching television because they are annoying they will see the television advertising and its good for the market many parents let their children watch some things in the television to be quiet
its ",17
15995," good for the parents the parents know what they want and they dont have to ask them all the time or find out on their own its easier for them
in my opinion ",9
15996," with the statement above television advertising shouldnt be allowed towards young children its just not good to influence such little things nearly babies they should go outside to let them play in the garden or on the playing field they can do television advertising if they want but i hope nobody sees it because they are outdoors to do better things than watching tv to see it
 ",14
15997,todays generation already grows up with electronical dewices young children watching tv gets more and more normal and if you havent seen a tv show with the age of four youre not normal but should those tv shows ,17

thodays television program does not just adress older generations with its tv shows direct advertised toward children ",6
15999, dory the explorer children are thorn towards the television and want to watch like adult do their own tv show isnt it wrong to make young children watch tv on the other ,17
16000, dory the explorer is a program in which the yung children learn something and actually have a role in the tv show they are asked to explore the world with dory which wants them to say things out loud and gives them exercises to do so you could ,6

also children in their young years have a lot to learn and the dory the explorer teaches them they often tend to just beliefe what people teach them as the adults or in this example the dory tell them but can they really just beliefe what dory teaches shouldnt the parents teacher and other people of an older generation be teaching them how to live and not a tv program also parents often place teir children in front of the tv ",17
16002, they have got more time for themself the television calms teir children and the adults dont have to take time to go to a park or do other activities with them it could be sid that today children do not learn about importen ,17
16003, of life because they just sit in front of the tv but instead my little sister 4 years old knows a lot more about how for ecample a tree grows when i was 4 years old i did not know things like that but i used to play on those trees in my opinion young children got enough time to learn ,24
16004, they go to school and should not be forced to approve such knowledge at such a yung age also they got enough time to watch tv later on in life and should enjoy their yung years in nature ,24
16005, infront of the tv they should actually explore the world and not just watch dory the explorer exploring the wordl,6
16006,"television advertising wants to influence people and show them things that doesnt have to be reality adults and teenagers have learned enough in life to know the difference between reality and fiction

young children have got the problem that they arent able to difference these two things because they are ",14
16007," learning about what reality is
if young children watch television advertising they get influenced by things that are even able to influence adults the children believe what adults or children on tv are telling them so if the men or child on tv tells them they need something thats what television advertising is all about they believe him and think this thing is importent to live
on the other ",0
16008, television advertising  is important for the marketing of these things if parents doesnt want there child to get influenced by television advertising they shouldnt let them watch tv children aged  shouldnt watch television ,14
16009," because of the advertising televsion becomes something like virtual reality for them its like an other world but the problem is that young children cant difference the real world from the world they see on tv

so ",17
16010, you cant disallow advertising television  if there parents dont want there child to get influenced by things the child cant difference from reality its their own decision its not prooved that television advertising deal damage to childrens knowledge about reality but it could have an influence,14
16011,television is not good for young children that common saying may contain some truth ,17
16012," there can be programms with learning effect

firstly the television can look ",6
16013, the children more and more ,7
16014, parents are working as a ,9
16015, their kids often the parents bring their children to an organisation where builded people looks ,9
16016," their kids and they can play with other children however some parents work at home and they have not to pay the organisation if they set their child in front of the television as a result they can do their work calmly

secondly special programms can contain learning effects for instance the children learn to count or to memorize or how to treat your friends so there can be moral learning effects too

nevertheless too much televison is not good for children moreover children should not watch dangerous series as a ",17
16017," they could not sleep well

in conclusion television advertising should be allowed to children ",13
16018, the question is what they are looking and how long it should not be an every day activity and they should,19
16019,nowadays almost every household has a television and other electronical devices that provide us with entertainment 247 the constant accessability of those devices make us ,10
16020, lazy and dependent we forget to be creative ourselves a big part of watching television are the commericals that disrupt the viewers tv shows while most adults can differentiate between what they need and want children struggle to do ,17
16021," therefore the question arises if advertising should be allowed to directly target young children

if young children learn that they cant have all the stuff on tv and learn that it is only tactics from big corporate firms it shouldnt pose a lot of problems children should learn how to deal with all this media from a young age on ",13
16022," theyre older parents should make them understand that the hard earned money is better spend on things they really need

the problem i see here is that not every 5year old will get this kind of message ",9
16023, they dont have the ability to critically question the message of the advertisement they probably see something they want and feel the urge to satisfy their needsthis scenario can be well observed in supermarkets ,11
16024," little kids throw a fit because they wont get what they want 

another reason that speaks against commericals targeting such a young audience is that puts a lot of pressure on the parents the kid  being angry about not getting those toys on tv direct their anger at the parents in general ",2
16025, it is not very wise to let the kids watch tv on a regular basis it ,17
16026, should embrace the free time for being creative and productive itself being creative ,21
16027," satisfys them in a even more rewarding way

in conclusion i must say that im against advertisment for childeren ",16
16028, because they cant handle the situation apropriately on the other ,19
16029, that they learn how to deal with media ,8
16030, isnt a good idea to  use television advertising toward such young children because at that age you arent able to judge the situation properly children often dont have a proper opinion ,14
16031, because they leak of experience thats why they often take the statements as they hear them without questioning them critically and give them theire believes just because they dont know it better ,3
16032," the children could get influenced in a bad way by advertisng they see in the television

secondly its essential to see that ones childhood plays an important role in the construction of a lifea basis the way you grow up and the particular influences like ",14
16033," family and friends have a strong impact on who youre going to be as an adult so if you get wrong ideas of the world or you learn to set your priorities in a bad way as a child it can hount you in the future even if your environment is able to build a contrast to the capitalistic advertisning a child is confronted by the tv its better not to underestimate the power of it

on the other ",17
16034, it seems important to me that parents see theire duty of having children by protecting them from bad influences like that in a healthy way even if the advertising clearly isnt a good thing but for economies it really is part of a parents exercise to watch ,2
16035," theire little children

on conclusion im clearly opposided to advertisnig which are  children it isnt human to use a childrens good belief to rise the capitalism just more its essential to protect them from bad influences like that and im persuated that an enterprise with good intentions wouldnt even think about using advertising that way",16
16036,telivision advertising confronts our whole society on a daily base thereby the television advertising is  nearly every group of age but ,10
16037, there must be some kind of age limitation for the  aged children we should not let the advertising industry use the children as objects who generate money for them it is ,16
16038, not smart to let those industries have such a big impact on a childs way of thinking it is much more important that the parents themselves take care of how their children are going to think about certain topics to give an example a television channel makes an advertisement for a new tv show that is  now the children watching this advertisement will be excited about this new show and eager to watch it the children will think the most entertaining way to spend time is watching television this is just a possible scenario of what the children will think but ,2
16039, it is important that we do not let the children think that television is the only thing that matters because children should spend time outside,17
16040,"this statement depends a lot on what kind of advertisement ist ment in general i dont think that advertisement ist something bad because without it we wouldnt explore new products which could help us much in the everyday life also children could see something they would love to play with for examle in
christmas time the tv is completely crowded with advertisement for things to play with a startup company which has its focus on toys for children would have no chance without the advertisement on the tv the negative ",14
16041, of this theme ist thet the opinion uf a child is very easy to influent the ,7
16042, of this is that all the companys produce advertisement to make the children want this specific toy which is the very best and is just a must have to be one of the cool ones in the class so these children all watch tv and see this advertisement after that they will ask their parents all day long if they could have one of these the parents may resist ,20
16043, but the longer it lasts they will buy their children this toy ,20
16044, its complete rubbish another negative ,21
16045, is that on childrens  programm there isnt just advertisement for children aged  ,6
16046, more violent advertisement for older children so these children get in touch with violence very early  ,2
16047, advertisement for a new airsoft gun at the end of this essay i think children aged  sholdnt watch tv at all but if they do ,14
16048, if the advertisement  isnt violent or shocking it should be allowed because ,15
16049, the adults get manipulated through advertisement without beeing aware of it ,16
16050,"essay television advertising  should not be allowed 

children love to watch their favourite tvshow on television but the advertising between the shows is in most cases unsuitble and just disturbing 

firstly many advertising spots are about pruducts which adults or teenager would buy and not toys or something children would like to see they have no idea for what are the producs for and ",14
16051," the advertising makes no sense
secondly children often believe what an andult said without doubt so they ",2
16052, believe what the advertising says and that is often overacted and unrealistic on the other ,11
16053, young children will not know the topic of every single spot ,8
16054," they switch off the television 
furthermore advertising is made for manitpulate people that they buy a product children are easier to influence and they believe every nonsens which the advertising says so it is dangerous to give the children wrong knowledge or destroy childrens imagination 

in conclusion i have to ",14
16055, such young children should not watch television at all it is just unhealthy and children tvshows are mostly trash but at least it should e prohibited that there is advertising on children channels  ,14
16056,"should we ban ads for kids in tv
we all would ",13
16057, like to live in a world without advertising but if that would be the case we wouldnt have any money for the entertainement we crave for but with children ,10
16058, young ones we have the problem that they can be easily manipulated so the trivial answer would be to just ban ads s kids but is this better the entertainment branche would loose the money and ,13
16059, the interest to produce quality content for children the ,8
16060, would be that there will be none or bad television for children and thats not the aim with this ban also this ban would only affect the television but what about other media like magazines or the internet where there can ,13

16065,hello and welcome to my essay which is about whether advertising s young children should be allowed or not ,13
16066, at the moment there is to much advertising ,11
16067, especially on television there is ,10
16068, much advertising that it is annoying also i dont understand why there is advertising anyway ,11
16069, almost nobody watches it when people see that on the television the programme stops and adverts start playing they mostly go away anyway ,10
16070, television advertising s young children should not be allowed spare atleast the young kids from this it really worries me how much todays world is only about money where even ads for small children are produced small children might see something that they like in the ads and force their parents to buy something totally unnecessary also i dont even know if small children aged up to five watch ,14
16071, much television that it does make sence to make ads ,10
16072, with the statement television advertising s young children should not be allowed first of all advertising is something that people normally dont like second many people dont watch ads anyway ,13
16073, they just use the adtime on television for a break and my last ,10
16074, children aged up to five watch enough television that ads can actually make the children think about something ,14
16075, that it should be allowed because it cant possibly have to many bad ,21
16076," even if those children are allowed to watch television at that young age it doesnt imply that theyll be able to buy those things themselves
 
for me its more a question of how educated the child is i ",17
16077, think that children aged 2 to 5 should not be allowed to watch too much tv but only movies adapted to their age if theyd ,17
16078, have that healthy childhood that i had they wouldnt be watching tv anyway ,1
16079," the advertising would have no effect on them

but now supposed that times have changed and young children are watching tv and ",14
16080, are affected by those advertisements what is the bad thing about it if they see a toy they like and the parents ,0
16081, to buy it everyone is happy because ,23
16082," the parents would buy toys for their children anyway why not buy them something they actually want 

also as a child i remember reading those magazines with all those toys inside them so even outside the tv children are already exposed to advertisement and i have to say that i actually enjoyed it ",14
16083, i was little although i wanted almost everything that was inside that magazine my parents obviously couldnt buy me everything ,20
16084, i had to decide on just a few looking back ,18
16085," that i learned two important lesson thanks to that experience that i couldnt have everything and to enjoy the things that i had because were is the fun in being able to buy everything and not even have to work for it 
to conclude i ",18
16086, thing that being exposed to advertisement at a young age is not much different than ,0
16087, we are older it only gives us suggestions what we could buy but ,20
16088, we can decide for ourselves,21
16089,in our days the products which are sold in the daily market are ,23
16090, seen in the televisionnot only television publicity ,10
16091, the daily mail or poster who are seen in the city are ways to support selling diffrent productstelevision advertising  is ,11
16092, the easiest way to sell a productbut it takes a lot to make the perfect publicityyou have to think about a slogan which is easy to remember ,11
16093, people have this slogan on their mind if they think of that specific produtcso the positive ,23
16094," of television adversiting no matter which age class are that the procuts are seen more often and with a good slogan the prand and the name of the fabric get memorised faster and more easily
on the other ",10
16095, why should a brand make television advertising for children who are not even ceapale to buy this product their parents are the ones who buy the procut ,2
16096, needs to be said is that not everybody watches television so if the procuts for children are only seen in television advertising,14
16097," some parent arent going to buy these procuts but some others dont even know that these products exist
 so in conclosion i ",9
16098, think that it doesnt matter for which age class a publicity in television is made it is a strong way to sell a product in ,14
16099, for parents but for everybody to watch television ,17
16100, you get a little bit an idea what is popular on themarket in the momentthe only thing you have to do is lay down and watch tv and if you find something intrestic you know exactely where to go and buy the product you wantit is an easy way to avoid the long shopping hours in the city thanks to television advertising life gets a little more comfortable,23
16101, with this statement because its impossible to forbit the television advertising for children aged  if the parents let the children watch television they can watch advertising so i do not understnd why i should write a essay about this topic children can not learn very effectiv by watching televioson ,17
16102, this wont be a problem for them and if they are stupid in the futur and ruin theier life this will be theier problem and not my problem ,19
16103, i dont care its impossible for the state to controle every single houshold if a children under the age 6 is watching a television advertising if they will forbit the television advertising they ,13
16104, should forbit the advertsising on the streets radio airplanes and others because if children were on the streets with theier family they see this avertising too and noone says something this would not make a lot of sense because if teleadvertising are not good for young children ,13
16105, the other advertising wont be good too for them so i do not understand why i have to write about this topic because there arent good ,11
16106, for or against this topic  my ,21
16107, of view is that there are no reasons against the television advertising for children under the age of six also advertising can be good for young children because young people can learn better the older people so if they see advertiing in the television as an example about condoms they will know in the futur that they will need one to be save as an other example chewingum ,14
16108, they wont smell bad if they have a date or a conversation with someone else so there is a positiv ,19
16109, for television advertising for me there are no reasons against it ,15
16110,"im definitely against direct advertisement towards young children
if little kids see advertisement for a toy they think its cool just because they saw it on tv which leads to them wanting to buy it but if a toy is shown on tv it doesnt automatically mean that its better or that each and every child should own it it only means that the company which produces the toy spend a lot of money on the ad but if that means that kids must own the toy is questionable
this leads to the little kids becoming materialistic at such a young age
young children shouldnt have to worry about what they should buy to be in but instead  buy the toys whith which theyd like to play 
the kids begging their parents to buy them a certain toy can ",16
16111," lead to unnecessary feuds at home 
to conclude my ",18
16112, im of the opinion that the governement should officially forbite advertisement towards young children ,13
16113, that they dont grow up feeling the pressure to buy stuff they wouldnt normally buy and that they dont already step into our materialistic society at such a young age,8
16114, shouldnt be allowed for small children ,4
16115, the content can be very manipulative ,18
16116, advertisements and even more if the content is s these small children on purpose if small children start watching television with a time regulation given by their parents the whole thing can be kept under control but if the children start watching tv  for consecutive hoursdays or even weeks ,14
16117, its not good for them on the one ,19
16118, the children could lack in evolved social skills if they are at home all their spare time they should really be out in the nature and making friends trying to work in groups and again learn how to socialize themselves on the other ,24
16119, they probably miss the lifelessons teached by being outside and exploring all the stuff around us it is lso proven that tv is highly addictive ,17
16120, parents should give their kid a limit in watching tv ,17
16121, prevent an addiction from happening so ,18
16122, one could say that i clearly support a ban for television advertisement addressing small children but ,13
16123, these advertisements have an tremendous impact on the life of the children ,0
16124, they are not able to buy the stuff showed in the tv but ,10
16125, it could make tv more attractive if during the breaks of some series the advertisement is addressed to small children what again leads to the ,14
16126," mentionend above































































































































































































































































































































































































this study is senseless ",21
16127,today many children want some things like toys because they saw it in an advertising between two series on the kids channel these toys arent things they really wanted to have ,20
16128, dont need but because it was ,18
16129," well shown in the advertising they think the toy is really cool therefore it would make sense if the advertising is forbitten on kids channels
the ",20
16130, is that they really dont need all the stuff from the advertisements if the kids see an advertising they think that they couldnt live anymore without having this toy they imagine how cool it would be to use it but as often the toy isnt that great in reality as it was in the advertisement ,20
16131," the child actually gets the toy it is a waste of money for the parents and the kids are sad because it isnt what they expected it to be
of course you can say that the advertising shouldnt catch the kids atention in ",20
16132," it should be a lecon for them that they cant get whatever they think would be cool it should be the parents task to teach the children it is important to learn to not get everything
but they can learn this lecon of life in an other way for example seeing another kids toys the kid really wants the toy too but the parents say no and learns how to deal with not getting everything they want
as my conclusion ",9
16133, it would be good if the advertising on television isnt allowed for young children,13
16134,it shouldnt beallowed to advertising directy to the you children because the children in young age should not watch tv they are young and have to do other thing like to play outside with other children if in the tv would be more adtvertise which are  to the young children they would support that children watch tv in the ,14
16135," of the socialism and for developping of the child it would be unhealthy how it can be healthy to sit in the front of a tv and watch them all day long neither for the children nor for the adults 

otherwise it is the job of the parents that they look how many their children consume tv so if a child with 4 years watch to much tv ",17
16136," has their parents to stop him and not the marketing of something 

even the marketing try to advertise directly the children they cant influence it a lot because the children can just wish something and not walk in the ",7
16137, supermarket and buy himself somthing what he saw it ,18
16138, in the tv the parents have again to say if the play or what else is sensful or not and have to choose if they want to buy it them child or not so it would make more sense ,17
16139, they would adevertising directly the parents they know it better and ,9
16140," time the will try to make avertything perfect for their children and buy more thing as it needs 

in conlucsion it should not be allowed to advertise directly the children it is unhealty and does not make much sense it would be better ",2
16141, they would advertise for the parents ,9
16142,"advertising

advertising is the driving force of economic growth without advertisments our economic system would not work and television is one of ",10

16144," children are the spectators

many people say that advertisement for children is manipulating the childhood parents who want to protect their children from this  manipulation should generally not allow them to watch tv but they have to keep in mind that television is not the only source of advertisement the whole enviroment is carriying advertising objects ",14
16145," brand signs or posters on streets protecting children from all advertisements is just not possible in the 21st century

the newage capitalistic system has brought wealth and power to many countries one key to this success was undoubtably television advertisment it was and it will remain one of the most popular and most direct media of communication from seller to consumer and without this kind of communication there will be no economic growth 

ptotcting children from all advertisements is not possible in such a globalised and media dependant world as ours if parents dont want their children in the age  to be exposed to telecasted advertisment a ban is not the ",13
16146, in my oinion they should not allow them to watch tv this does not mean that their children would not have any contact to any advertisement but they would be protected from the most popular and ,13
16147," most influencial type of advertisement

",11
16148,we are living in the era of technology and media the internet has grown huge and we depend on technology no matter if we want to research need to find a place we do not know or just want to watch some movies or series the children growing up in this era are as depended on the media as everyone else you can see many children with an ipod or an iphone and they even posess an own laptop no wonder they spend ,17
16149," much time on television there are series made for children to make them learn things with that comes the advertising of toys to make children buy it

adults might think that you can not use advertising on children because that is pure manipulation advertisers know how to make people want to buy their products simply by using aida they might want wo protect children of this kind of manipulation however ",14
16150, they manage to protect them now as soon as they get older they are going to watch advertisement and are going to get manipulated ,12
16151," how are you going to sell products for children without any advertising there is going to be a decrease of profit if the refineries lack advertisings they earn less money and they might need to close because they can not afford the producement the more refineries need to close the less toys are going to be there for children what are they supposed to play with 

my opinion is that there should be advertising  ",16
16152, that it might affect the children and ,4
16153, you prohibit advertisments for children there are ,16
16154, going to be some  young adults and adults which the children are going to see ,8
16155, why only not allow advertisings for children ,16
16156, that if you want to not allow it you need to prohibit advertising ,15
16157,i believe that there is nothing absolutely nothing good about advertising  which means i totally ,11
16158, with the previous statement the televisions the newspapers the socialmedia everything manipulates us to doing or being somethig we dont really want to do or be day for day all these sources make us think that we need something  that we need more that we need everything thats being advertised just because everyone wants or has it but maybe if there wasnt any advertisement about that thing and if not everyone wanted it ,10
16159, we wouldnt want that thing at allthen we wouldnt even look at that specific thing whilst walking by a window of a shop i believe children have got a whole life ahead of them full of being manipulated by the social media the televisions and all the advertisment in it ,2
16160, i ask myself why cant the world just let them be children for ,12
16161, possible children who can enjoy their childhood not needing every toy thats being advertised in the television not needing as many things as we adults need and want all the time why cant the world let children be happy by simply spending their time in nature playing traditional games ,24
16162, hide and seek why would the world want a three year old to play super mario on a gameboy ,20
16163, than to be outside on a playground in the real world with real people why would the world want a child to feel that constant pressure of needing to be trendy needing to be cool by owning specific things were all carying such a heavy weight around with us caused by all the things we own were not free anymore we cant just go and travel around the world or move from one place to another we are trapped in all the things we own all the things we cant just leave behind and that is a constant responsability lets let the children enjoy their life without that responsability for ,8

let us give them that freedom they deserve it ",19
16165,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

advertising has always been a big part of society if back in the day or nowadays there is a constant convrontation it doesnt matter if youre outside in the internet or just watch some tv we find it in all sorts of media also advertisements are espeacially made to adress a certain group of people ",15
16166," age group gender race etc we live in a world there we have already advertisements for our youngest generation children aged to five
is this even worth the money how much can a toddler actually already understand
the companies creating those advertisement definentely see the potential of manipulating a child into wanting something it doesnt need a young child is innocent and naive and cant read out such propaganda 
but not every advertisement must be seen in a bad way ",16
16167, advertisements which are made to motivate children to eat healthy and do sport activities can ,0

i ",18
16169, with that i find it justified to manipulate a human being through media it doesnt matter if it is about children or adults but we will never be able to make a total cut with advertising  but i ,13
16170, think that money invested into advertisement which ,11
16171, addresses their parents would be a more valiuable idea,9
16172,the television is present nowadays more often than ever ,10
16173, not only parents are watching regularly tv ,17
16174," children in young ages are getting used to it one thing that always has been present in the tv are advertisement but they used to be adressing older people and not young children but these young children are easy to influence whats used by the companies the question is weather televisionadverising  should not be allowed

even ",14
16175, there are many ways of advertising affecting younger people there should be some restritction to protect kids from unneeded infuence in their young age they are developing themselfe realy fast ,16
16176, get influenced realy easily thats something which shouldnt be used for the profit of your bussines or to get extra atraction they need time to determin themself and find out what they really want of course we are talking about children in the age of  years who arent going to decide realy importent things but ,7
16177, i was young i wasnt playing with any electric devices or had the newest stuff i was happy with the things i had got todays society ,18
16178," the young ones are only happy with the newest devices on marked and there is no need to help this feeling already in this young age

these are the reasons why ",24
16179,"a lot of people say watching television has a bad influence on children especially the advertisements between the programms could harm the children 

television advertising s young children is not that effective as advertising towards adults the main reason for this is the ",14
16180, that children cant buy their own stuff in the end the parents decide what they want to buy so ,9
16181," advertising should more target adults than children anyway

but the thing is that without the advertising the children wouldnt notice the product because they never go shopping or read magazines so the only media where the companys can place their advertisement to reach their target is the television

however the television advertising makes the children believe that they need what they see so they start begging their parents for it until they get it this is good for the product but the parents wont be that happy with it and the children who probably dont get what they want neither

where it all boils down to is that we just get spoiled children with too much toys who cant be satisfied anymore and for this reasons i figure that television advertisements targeting childern should not be allowed
",14
16182,"in this essay im going to write about the question if television advertising shouldnt be  first ill mention some agreements after that ill mention som disagreements at least ill give my personal statement


well to be honest im not the bigest fan of watching television but ",15
16183, in our time electrical devices including television are playing such an important role in our life and ,10

now ill mention some negative ",14
16186, of directing television advertising toward young children in some television advertising they are showing very stupid and crazy things young children  believe everything and ,14
16187," they believe everything what they saw on tv 


my opinion ",3
16188, that its very difficult to prohibit watching television advertising toward young children because on every chanel are television advertisings ,13
16189," its the parents job to prohibit their children some chanels ect all in all i think that watching television isnt 







",17
16190,the questsion whether children between the age of two and five should or may be exposed to advertising is to be discussed ,13
16191," of the pro site is that a bann of children advertising would mean less promotion for toys and other commodities for which children are potential buyers this would lead to a lower demand in these commodities ie thes firms generate less surpluses for example if mcdonalds cant direct their advertising towards small children the brand will be less popular in this age group 

a ",13
16192," of the opponetns is that directing adeverts towards chirldren is bassicaly equal to brain wash them since they are very easy to influence and eager to imitate their templates they cant realy cope whit advertising because they arent conscious that it is only an advert they take it for real and respond to it by wanting to get the promoted product 

in my opinion there arent any good reasons to not ban advertising for children the economy must not interfere whit the psyche of humans ",16

",15
16195,many young children get confronted with advertising ,16
16196, watching television wether this should be allowed or not is a controversial question in this essay ,17
16197, in relation with this question and ,21
16198," present my personal opinion

it seems totally normal that we watch advertisments on television ",10
16199, why should it be bad for children first of all most of the children dont understand some of the adverts this can be considered good or bad ,4
16200, its an inappropriate advert for children they might not mind the advert or ,16
16201," they go question their parents and theydont know how to explain the inappropriate content of the advert to a young child 
lets now take a look at normal adverts like ",16
16202, about some toys for kids advertising is an established part of the televisonal experience and children might even learn something watching them why shouldnt the children see what kind of toys exist and which they could might wish for their birthday or something on one ,20
16203, out of the view from companies who sell toys those adverts directed  are very important as they are potential costumers on the other ,0
16204," there is some sort of manipulation of these kids and they want to be part of this society of consumption
furthermore they might get an illusorical imagination of things as there are a lot of adverts which ",2
16205," show toys who come to life

in my opinion television advertising shouldnt be allowed for young children as they are manipulative and create a world which does not exist on top of that these young kids get introduced to a society of consumption which is nt good

",14
16206, that at the age of three children get extremely exploreous and start to discover new things it is a phase in there life where they catch up every movement around them and try to understand or imitate it thats ,8
16207," where eduaction starts to be important and useful for small children but what happens if their mentalities get influenced by television advertising telling the girls to love princesses and the boys to be into pirates and adventures

advertisement often has eyecatching pictures and rememberable slogans which appeal to our younger generation once they see an interesting advertisement theyll remember it because of that hence they dont really get attracted by the message that comes along with it like this new pair of shoes will make you look cool but with its noticible surroundings ",0
16208," the background music colors or protagonists in that case the youngsters arent really affected by the advertisement itself 

on the other ",11
16209, it is important to give the children an idea of forming their own opinions and discover their interests you should ,8
16210, let them play in the garden than placing them in front of a television where they get informations through pictures and stories a small boy learns much more things if he tries to build a wooden castle in the forest with his friends than seeing an advertisement telling him how amazing the new playcastle is he could wish to his ,8
16211," birthday 

so actually the parents shouldnt underestimate their responsabilites in my opinion it doesnt have to be strictly forbidden but parents should get aware of the advertisement their sons and daughters are watching allday and based on that they shoud decide on their own if they stand behind such influence by television 






on one ",17
16212, it is certainly not the best idea to let young children watch television allday ,17
16213,television advertising towards young children plays a major role in modern society ,14
16214, already the youngest and most volnurable of us are being adressed by major companies ,23
16215," make them want something or a state wants them to think something this could be a problem for the children if they are brainwashed with views that a company or a state wants to distribute 

therefor my opinion on advertising towards young children is that it needs to be regulated ",16
16216, the children arent brainwashed with ,7
16217, political statements that are hidden in the ad on the other ,11
16218, adverts s children could be a great possibility for giving children something that they can think about and ,0
16219, doing that devoloping their thinking capacity at a very early stage this means ,7
16220," ads are normaly very short they give the children something that they can think about or discuss with their parents afterwards 

in my opinion advertising towards young children should be regulated but if done right television ",14
16221, has a big potential that should be used in the future   ,23
16222, i have to say that in the age of  i did rarely or not watch tv at all there were already many situations in my life ,17
16223," some friends of mine told me about that one old series or that one old film that you should have seen and whenever i tell them that i havent seen it they are shocked they say things like how can you not know it didnt you have a childhood 
yes i had a childhood and yes it was a good one even without television i truely believe that their is no ",6
16224, in allowing your child to watch tv all day i even believe that it can cause harm to the child and his intellectual devellopement by watching things like sponge bob your child does not get any benefit i even think that it can get a little dumber by watching it well probably not dumber but im shure it gets another sight to the world it maybye believes in the pineapple house and that squirrels can live under water but dont get me wrong i like watching tv and i am not completly against allowing to your child to watch tv but please be careful what series or film is on there are beneficial series that share information and knowledge to the little ones but please be careful with this cartoon type of things and ,17
16225, you dont want to be that strict you can be careful with the time your child is spending on watching tv i remember that i watched this one series that was on every sunday morning we always watched it with the hole family because it litterly is interesting even for adults it is called die sendung mit der maus the principe of this series is that children can write letters with questions they have like what is a lollipop made from and ,17
16226, send it to them so every question will be answered the ,18
16227, sunday by following the way of a lollipop from the verry ,18
16228, so to find an end there is a beneficial way of watching tv for your children but you need to set limits and rules or even forbidden movies and series and you need to keep an eye over your children a true childhood ,17
16229, to play outside in the sun with the children from the neibourhood and having a good time without tv,1
16230,"we are living in a time of many differents ways of communication children who are watching tv with their parents get influenced easily by the huge amount of adverts on tv but we have to question the authority shouldnt your child get educated and influenced by you as a parent 


television adverts can be a helping ",14
16231, while your child gets to know television advertising and fun ,1
16232, specific adverts are nothing but support in your daily life of course not every advert should be watched ,11
16233, youre a child but specific advertising can help in the learning process whether its the spoken language the grammar or the way of talking  your child can see and hear and learn alot over the two channels seeing and hearing more information gets provided letting your child watch tv can ,14
16234, be relaxing for you your child is having fun learning ,8
16235," and you can lean back sounds perfect doesnt it 

on the other ",18
16236, you are the one who cares about your child who wants your child to learn about the important things in life and ,8
16237, theres a anonymous voice in tv talking to your child trying to convince it to do something or trying to show a specific opinion arent you failing in doing your job and here we have the worst case adverts are for the normal classic child if your child has any problems with learning it might wont get the message behind an advert ,14
16238," start worrying and maybe wont even understand what the person wanted to say at all then its again you who has to do all the work 


to conclude my personal opinion is clear nothing is better than the communication between a parent and its child people on tv are to far away and often exagurate their subject theres no emotional connection and the amout of information is huge a child learns infinite without tv and will watch enough adverts in his life watching tv shouldnt start ",17
16239,television advertising is a big part of our wold today everyone has been tricked into buying something by an advertisement ,10
16240," they were young it is a typical situation you see something on television that you really want and you ask your parents for it if they say no its a huge disappointment so the question is how young is too young to see advertising on television 

well there are many reasons why television advertising s children aged  should not be allowed it is a kind of brainwash convincing someone that small that they want something creating an artificial desire designed by professionals s children who have no idea what it really is it seems cruel to play with a twoyear olds brain in the way advertising does a child needs time to play to learn what his or her likes and dislikes are and most importantly to learn the difference between want and need showing a small child an attractive ad for a product makes them want it more than anything in that moment while it may be good marketing of the product it is not fair to take ",14
16241," of a small childs innocence in that way

as always there are ",8
16242," reasons why it should be allowed just because someone is young doesnt mean they shouldnt see what life is really like there are advertisments everywhere not just on television whats the difference between seeing them on posters on the street and watching them on tv also it is the parents responsability to care for their child and make sure they dont see things that arent good for them the people who make the advertisements are just marketing their product and what is really wrong with that if a parent doesnt want their child seeing the publicity they should monitor them 

there are good reasons for ",13
16243, think that the statement television advertising  should not be allowed is completely correct for many reasons first of all children aged  should not be influenced in that way ,15
16244, they dont realise the advertisements are meant to persuade them and talk them into annoying their parents until they buy something it isnt human to take ,2
16245, of someone that small i ,18
16246, think that with each generation we are becoming more and more addicted to media and smartphones so yes parents should be monitoring their childs usage of electronic anyways but that doesnt mean that it is fine to allow advertising  an audience that young a  year old ,16
16247, needs to learn that you cant always get what you want life is hard enough as a parent without their child screaming that they want a toy or a goldfish every five seconds because they saw it on television ,20
16248,television has changed a lot in the past decades while it served mainly as a source of entertainment for many years there are channels today that seem to consist more of advertisements than of actual content like shows or films what kind of product or thing is being advertised can differ a whole lot depending on the time of the day and the channel from beauty products to cars and ,10
16249, on the kids channels toys the latter is seen as ,20
16250," problematic by some people which creates the question should advertising  not be allowed

what could be considered as a ",11
16251, is the frustration of children of families that arent too wealthy in such a young age children often do not have the kind of feeling for finance that would be necessary to understand why mommy and daddy wont be able to buy the toy that the girl from the tv has got lacking comprehension from the childs ,9
16252, can lead to frustration on ,21
16253," 

other than that there is no visible reason why advertising could harm young children it could actually serve as a source of eduacation if you look at the advertisement from another viewpoint watching all the little clips of toys that are marketed as a must for every little carlover or your girls new favourite toy could help the children form an own opinion and even more important it can teach them a consciousness of knowing what to really believe and seeing what is just bogus surely the young kids will not be able to really differentiate at this age but the sooner a human being is confronted with a new situation the longer it has time to and the better it can adapt to it

considering that the confronted children are at ",14
16254, at such a young age they ,24
16255, wont be able to earn their own money,9
16256, they can not buy all the things they see on television ,3
16257," badly the decision is always with the parents and i would claim that they are experienced enough to know that not everything you see on tv is to be believed
 considering all these ",12
16258," in forbidding advertisement that is 

",11
16259,"television advertising  should not be allowed
in todays world advertising is an important role we advertise almost for everything ",15
16260, a specific product a shop television brandd and ,10
16261," on but should there really be advertising  some parents find it dangerous or not good for their children other may think its good for the children 

in my opinion television advertising  shouldnt be allowed because the children dont even know what they are doing i mean children aged  are not all aware of what they are doing often they just do what their parents tell them and want them to do if a children wants to beinga advertising spot it is fine but if they dont want to be in a spot and they just have to do what they are told to they shouldnt be doing it it is okay if the advertising want to get the attention of a child",14
16262, there is a lot of advertising for children in connection with playmobile lego nerf and ,0
16263," on if a child sees how good the product looks in television the child wants to buy the product
otherwise advertising toward young children can ",0
16264," bring the children to a good idea for example marc is watching television and suddenly he sees a advertise that shows a new nerf collection instead of thinking that he wants the new nerf he has an idea that he could make his own business with nerfs and build the world largest nerf business with new product of course it is just an idea but it helps the children to improve their own fantasy 
on the other ",8
16265, children get involved to the mediaworld way to early if the television advertising is  it is way too early for the children to get involved in the world of the adults what i mean is that it is much better for children to be in their own non media world and explore the world as it really is not as how the advertising is telling the children children should play with friends and play outside ,14
16266," they can because if they get older they get automatically involved to the world of advertising 

as a conclusion ",16
16267," that it is really important to let children be children it shouldnt be allowed to advertise  children because it changes the sight of how the children see the world and they get i
",13
16268,"television advertising   should not be allowed

television is full of advertising often it takes ",15
16269, 5 minutes until a film continues way to long altought its sometimes quite interesting to watch the funny advertising  clips ,10
16270," those during the super bowl they are usually annoying and distracting televison advertising is very important to finace the television and is a great help for companies to get known or present their new products of course we would all prefer to watch a film without  being interrupted every half an hour but advertising is simply necessary for the televison companies
sadly there was created an economic sector for advertising toward very young children with terrible results when children go for the ",10
16271, time to school they know around 300 brands which is nothing a 5 year old should know in theory advertising would not be that bad because it depends on the product if it is and there the problem starts a child cannot know if the product is good for him and nearly always its bad for him for example the unhealthty food that is advertised which will lead to and unhealty nutrition in the future which will ,2
16272," cause problem to the heahlt care system



i belive that televison advertising toward young children should be forbidden because it gets them on the wrong path but ",14
16273, that it will happen any time soon the interests of the companies are just to big,23
16274, that children shouldnt watch a lot of television during that age anyway because they should play with friends and be social and enjoy their time but if they watch television ,17
16275, that during that age they should ,12
16276, watch shows with crafts and do it yourselfs without any advertisement ,18
16277, their parents dont have to buy a lot of expenssive stuff from the advertisment and ,0
16278, because kids kind of want to have everything that they see it can cause some sad kids which dont get everything what they want or what they wanted as a present a lot of stuff from advertisments is very expensive because most likely big brands like ,2
16279, lego or playmobil do the advertisements and because of the price some parents may not be able to give their children what they want another possibility may be that if a child gets a gift for lets say their birthday and they are happy but ,20
16280," they see a brand new adversisement they may want the thing which is advertised and arent happy anymore with their old gift 

arguments ",3
16281, around christmas time or the birthday advertisements can be a great way for parents to see what their child likes and what it wants as the ,0
16282," gift because with that way the parents dont have to go around in the whole city for finding a fitting gift 

my final oppinion 
i thing that it isnt a good idea to spam young children with a lot of advertisement because even on the adult channels like rtl or sat1 it can be very annoying to always have to watch the advertisments ",20
16283, why should these kids have to watch that stuff ,6
16284, they just want to enjoy their show on their channel,3
16285,"we are use to see advertising everywhere our society is consum driven and tries to make money of of anything but is it moraly supportable to advertise towards young children

on childrens television channels are the commercial break ",14
16286, on channels s adultson one ,6
16287, young children can not understand the concept of money at least not utterly and even less how capitalism works so it is not fair to target children and make money of their parents on the other ,9
16288," they have to learn that they can not have every toy or everything they want when they are grown up they have to be aware of that and they have to know how to manage money and they need to know there way around our capitalistic society
this lesson can ",24
16289," be learnd in kindergarten our other places where they interact with other children they might not have as many toys as others have altought they might get confronted with com 

i can ethically not support the television advertising s young childreneventough advertising towards children should be allowed ",14
16290, the age up to five years old should be excluded ,12
16291," that they can not understand the concept of money and should not be confronted with the capitalistic greed in the future it schould be prohibited to target advertising towards young children


",13
16292, think tv advertising should not be allowed at all ,15
16293, think it shouldnt be allowed ,12
16294, directed at young children the problem with television adverts is how constant they are we dont have time to prosses what we have seen because the ,14
16295, advert is already being shown with young children this ,16
16296, is even more extrem they see a toy they like and people having a good time with it and ,20
16297, its gone and a different toy or game is being advertised who wouldnt want a toy that works perfectly  toys always work better on tv and people have a good time with children dont have the same abbility to overthink things and see behind what is being shown to them as an adult does this is a part of childhood and its part of what makes children have a great time living in a bit of a dream world but it should not be exploited by firms advertising there products making the children want something and feel like they are missing out on something if they dont get it besides that children at that age cant buy anything on there own anyway making the original idea of the advertisers even worse they count on the children wanting something and ,20
16298, going to ask there parents to buy it meaning they dont advertise to thepeople they end up getting the money from but to the children of those people there loved ones      ,9
16299,television advertisments that are s children 25 are mostly about fast food or toys they always run to their parents ,14
16300," they saw such an ad because they want that toy that they give you if you buy a happy meal in mcdonalds television advertising  children should be more controlled by the government but not completely removed
advertisments can be different things and can change the feelings of children in different ways one has to  difference between these different kinds of ads because ",0
16301," the right ads are  children why ban them
the advertisments of fastfood chains like mcdonalds or burger king should be most likely banned because they mostly appeal kids but is this appeal a good one an interest a parent wants his child to have most parents only take their kids to places like that to make them happy every kid wants that super cute pokã©mon in the happymeal which makes fun noises these companies are ",16
16302, smart that they connect with the children over the ads to make them love their toys ,20
16303," much that they want to come back again and eat there this is a bad lifestyle which can make a child unhealthy in many ways like obesity diabetes and many more these kinds of advertisments should be banned
the situation with the toy industry is somewhere in between they try to connect with the kids over television ",2
16304, but it doesnt harm them to have that cute puppy stuffed animal which can move its head the only harm there is in the parents wallet but ,20
16305, if there is too much advertisement every time a new toy comes out a child can get obsessed and always wants a new one because the other one is ,20
16306," from yesterday these advertisments should be contrlled but not completely banned 
the advertisments that include information about health ",11
16307," should be pushed to be shown and make the kids realize what a helathy lifestyle actually is most kids of that age dont care about health abviously theyre too young but the companies could at least use conter arguements not to go to mcdonalds without telling the children directly small inputs to a healthy lifestyle should be given from a very young age and in our time periode how would it be easier than educating the children over the television obviously every kid has their favourite serie on disney channel or elsewhere just put a little ad in between the episodes and they might not be really interested in it but the more its showed the more it can influence a childs life it shouldnt be life chaning things but step by step 
the television advertising for young children should be overlooked for a perfect balance it is hard to know where the cut should be made of which advertisment can be aired and which cant but if the government or a single television channel starts the movement towards the good ",14
16308, there will be ideas of what is good or bad and soon there will be the right amount of good ads to overshadow the bad ones ,11
16309,"nowadays there is a big discussion about the television advertising beeing in a direction towards young children in the ages  there is much room to get influenced by any external source of information that makes the discussion about not allowing the television advertising directing young children debatable

on the one ",14
16310," that the television advertising is known as a big propaganda like influence for all the people no matter what age that is why it is extremly important that at least the youngest ones have to be protected by this influence and that they can develop their own opinion and not the opinion they have to accept by the television advertising

but ",13

16312, about the influence by the television advertising that is why it is essential that the parents look ,14
16313," their children and protect them 

another ",9
16314, against the television advertising is that the fantasy and the imagination of a young child will souffer ,14
16315," they are watching too much television advertising that is because of the stupidity with which the companies try to catch they young children

as a conclusion ",2
16316, everyone can make a case for ,21
16317, it is clear that i am totally against the television advertising  for me ,15
16318, is that the childrem would get influenced by this television advertising too soon in their lives and that they have to build their own opinion befor they get manipuleted by this strong but smart developed system,14
16319,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

concerning the shopping behaviour children are equal to adults if they see something cool they want it television advertising  uses this but in some cases it seems to be more like a misuse according to this therers the question if this kind of advertising should be forbidden

when children see the adverting in the tv the parents cant influence what they see so the children generate wishes and the parents have no idea where they come from the problem here is the ",14
16320, much different things the result is that they want everything they see there they dont learn to see those things with their own eyes but only through the eyes of the seller the most frequent sentences are ,3
16321, you should have it or get it now the sellers calculate with the grace of parents buying what their children like to have in this case it is a kind of misuse and should not be allowed but it could have ,20
16322," o a positive effect if children see the advertising parents can act and show how to get on with that so the parents coud prevent their children in this case its equal if there is television advertising directed  or not

",0
16323, this sort of advertising is not good at all and not helpful but ,11
16324, take care of what their children watch and not let them watch anything on tv and if the children do not watch tv all the time which seems to be another problem the television advertising  would not be a problem because they have not ,14
16325, many possibilities to watch it,6
16326, about television advertising  children aged  ,14
16327, about adverts for toys the purpose of these adverts is to awaken the interest in these children for asking their mommy or daddy to buy them these toys so they begin to want to buy things at a very young age and crave for material things the idea behind this may be that companies want to integrate people into the economical system already at a young age ,0
16328, they learn how to have the need to buy things and ,8
16329, will contribute to the constant cicle of production and consumption which keeps our economy going however at a young age we do not understand how to handle money ,8
16330, we obviously always have to ask mommy and daddy to buy these toys for us this shows the importance of the parents in how they respond to the children watching these advertisements if they constantly buy you all these toys we get used to living in a world of overconsumption and the constant craving for material things ,20
16331, the economy to bloom in other words we carry a major importance of the contribution to the economy if we would not watch these advertisements what ,11
16332, it would make that big of a difference to be honest because ,19
16333," older people who didnt watch much television at a young age will consume as much as people who did
so conluding these last statements i do not see any reason why television advertising should not be allowed for younger children",14
16334,"in the media we can hear from time to time that the consume of television is not good for the developpement of young children one thing which can influence the developpement of a young child could be the television advertising

for the companies who launched the advertising campain young children are an ideal group to influence the children havent a basic knowledge about a product and ",14
16335," they are easy to manipulate after the television show the children tell their parents what they have seen and in the ideal case the parents buy the product but its clear that some psyhologes observed this developpement very critical this is positiv for the industy because more products were bought
but some psychologes are very sceptical with this developpement the young children were very easy to manipulate a child who is under five years old cant built his own oppinion about a subject and cant wage the pros and the contras of the product the child believs all which the advertising has told him
in my oppinion is that television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed because in our time a big part of the parents are working during the day because of this the children are watching television without a adult person who explain the advertising to the child for this reason the children are easy to influence
in my oppinion its nut just only the television industry who have to change theyr programm also the parents should suport the children ",14

in the following lines you are going to read about specific reasons according to the topic statement for example how television could cause an addiction and why you should not let a  years old child watch televisionâ¨

firstly your child could miss an important part of his life if it is watching television all the time especially at the age of  years a child learns a lot of things they start to ask questions and discover the world if a child sits in front off the television all day long there will not be much time left to learn new stuff often they start ",17
16337, see television as a reality and ,10
16338," they are going to have a problem later on 

according to the ",19
16339," from above children are not going to spend a lot of time with friends and other human beings they are just going to sit in front of the television and do not do anything however it is important to have social contacts and not to get isolated if a child is watching tv at that age the risk is getting bigger and bigger 

lastly we all know that watching television too often could cause an addiction lots of human beings are addicted to tv especially at a young age you should not watch television too often its okay to watch tv but you should not spend too much time in front of it therefore you minimize the risk of getting addicted 

in my opinion you should allow your child to watch television but you should definitely have rules for example not more than 30 minutes a day it is important to not let the tv educate your child you should do it yourself and show your son or your daugther how beautiful life can be ",17
16340,"television advertising targeted at children
in todays media and in television specifically advertisment is omipresent for not government funded networks it is the primary source of income and they have to rely on it institutions that belong to the government have to obey certain rules and ",13
16341, dont show any commercials like the bbc ,10
16342, or have to clearly mark the start and end of an ad break whereas private networks can incorporate advertisments even inside a show or program and ,10
16343, on childrens channels and in childrens shows ,6
16344," this is appropriate for young children for the following reasons
young children cant destinguish between fiction and reality very well ",6
16345," if the ad seems to be part of the show they might be confused and think that it is very important for them to have a certain product 
because children are usually much more easily manipulated than adults if a character on tv tells them something is a nice thing they will believe it and probably wanting to own it and many children will not stop terrorizing their parents until they will buy it for them of course the products and their ads are specifically targeted at children and cleverly made to appeal to children which ",2
16346, is wrong and exploits how young children easily believe anything adults will tell them because they dont now ,7
16347, children should even be seen as a target audience as they dont earn their own money ,16
16348, young children who most of the time ,24
16349, dont get money to spend on things from their parents ,9
16350, because they cant judge what to buy correctly ,3
16351, regulations have to be introduced to protect children and their parents from the bombardement through advertising,13
16352,as television consumption is becoming increasingly popular even with young children marketing campaings aiming at young people aged  have recently been gaining importance debates on whether or not such advertising toward children should be banned are common ,14

16356," the childrens development will be altered by direct advertising 

as people are confronted with advertising from a very young age there is a threat that even grownups could get difficulties dealing with marketing measures studies have shown that particularly on the internet many people cannot reliably distinguish between information and advertisements as marketing becomes normal already from an early age the risk of adults being very easily influenced rises

however it is the more sustainable ",0
16357, that children should learn to deal with advertising ,13
16358, trying to shield them in the adult world advertising is omnipresent by protecting children from marketing campaigns they will probably struggle dealing with ,16

banning advertising seems highly critical ",13
16360, of view from a liberal perspective it seems absurd to ban advertising which is highly demanded by the economy even as one might argue that children should be extraordinarily well protected it must be stated that advertising as such is not dangerous what can be problematic is people adults ,13
16361," who are unable to deal with marketing measures training children is the easiest and most reliable way to avoid later issues

in todays television advertising is a ",14

16363, in democratic states where the peoples will is decisive educating children is the best ,8
16364, for skilled adults shielding the children should not be aimed at as an addition schools might start dealing with advertising this way the children who have already been exposed to advertising will be provided with the tools needed to reliably deal with advertising,16
16365," television advertising by young children is a problem in our society today 
on the one ",14
16366," it shouldnt be allowed because children are weak about theyre opinion and character
so its very easy to influence them so if they see something in the television they believe it in theyre world lies dont exist caused by that the companys use the children as perfect victims thats a big problem for families so theyre children believe the television more than theyre own parents thats incredible
on the other ",14
16367, in todays economics with no limits why should this be forbidden if a family has a problem with that they shouldnt allow theyre children to watch television easy ,17
16368,"
but can you todays children taking the television away
theyll watch it anyways with friends at school 
its a difficult situation 
is money more important than the humanity of our ",17
16369," generation
do companys which pay taxes have more influence and are more important
",23
16370, which we should make clear and discuss about it in politics with families with schools kindergarden etc and ,12
16371, we can talk about the real problem and find a ,18
16372,"

my opinion is that it shouldnt be allowed at all after the age of five you will have enough time for television advertising for your potential clients and at this ",13
16373, they will have theyre own opinion so why already start that earrly,12
16374,"television advertising helps the companies to find new consumer this is good for the company and can be good for the consumer aswell because heshe gets a product they may or may not have wanted 
the problem is ",10
16375, you direct it to the children espetially the young ones around age 5 and older they dont know ,6
16376, what is really naicessairy and what not they can be easely influenced and those comercials are very often filled with sterotyps just like girls have to play with dolls and boys with cars this leads young childeren to think that they are only allowed to play with those typs of toys but comertials for two year olds are quite stupid i dont believe that they really get what the commercial is trying to say them children learn best ,20
16377, they see a person speak that is right in front of them or ,3
16378, they can touch the object and look at it this are things that arent possible with videos and ,3
16379, they get older they start to know okay the sound and the picture of the video belongs togheter and ,24
16380, they are easely influenceable but those are ,19
16381, no reasons why you should forbid the comercialsfor two year olds the parents can easaly control how much and often their child watches tv so they control if the child sees those adverisments or not and companies need to sell theyre product aswell and advertings them is a pretty good way and the adverises for two year olds are most likely designed for their moms and they should be able to decide if it is relevant or not the advertisments i would ban are those who are directed to the older children in the age 5 to 10 because they are the ones that the parents let watch tv on their own for an hour or two and the ones that can be easaly influenced because of that,14
16382, it should be allowed to direct advertise toward young children because ,16
16383, you advertise to children they always have to ask there parents ,16
16384, buy what was advertised so the question is if it should be allowed to use children ,16
16385, that they annoy there parents till they buy what they want but ,3
16386, the product advertised doesnt make any harm  it isnt different to make advertisment to older people the goal is always to sell them someting they dont really need or they didnt knew they need it but ,11
16387, you advertise  you always have a ,11
16388, instance that decides if the product gets bought or not as stated ,23
16389, it shouldnt be allowed to advertise  ,11
16390, the product advertised has any negative effects for young children for example products with a high sugar concentration but ,4
16391, theres no real reason to not allow advertising toward young children ,16
16392," why because it destorys the childrens brains
every time they watch television ads they scream and shout mom dad buy us this or that no son you have no use for this stupid shit is my usual answer 
those dudes that produce the ads are usually loosers ",14
16393," all they care about is the cash they get 
it doesnt matter how weird and pointless an ad for children might be aslong as they get their beloved money there happy now why do ",16
16394," with this because i watched lots of television back in the day and im fucking mental bibabop every time i see a rainbow i immediately think of skittleshitting giraffes
like is that normal in any way
definitly not thats why i wanna start a petition to take down those moneyhungry sharks im gonna sue them for every penny theyve made with the selling of their useless products
well anyways where was i
usually im really calm ",18
16395," it comes to things like these 
but we gotta protect our little babies right
we dont want them to have square eyes ",12
16396," all also why is it forbidden to make ads for alcohol now nobody cares about ads for icecream
i mean its not like 13 of the population is already overweight
but who fucking cares children that are obese arent affected at all later on in the life am i right
ohh nevermind they are
most of any diseases have something to do with being overweight heart failure problems with your joints later in life breathing problems even things like getting bullied because of their weight are just some of the things youre going to encounter ",13
16397," watching ads definitly those things should be banned from tv for sure no other way is possible to save the world from drowning in rainbows and giraffes and icecream 

 ",15
16398,"what is the goal of television advertisements enterprises want to get new customers which buy their products with it because this is influencing the peoples that are waching them should it be forbidden to show advertisment  
young children aged  do not think that people have bad intentions and ",15
16399," they are easily manipulated 
on the other ",19
16400, such young children will not completely  understand what is happening in front of them and if they ,24
16401," understand what they see they will not be able to remember the advertised product for long
also they arent able to buy things by themself the most parents are not willing to buy a product just because their young children tell them that they saw a thing on the television which they definitly need 
to conclude you can say it is not needed to make a restriction for advertisment  first of all they most likely will not understand what is happening in the advertisment secondly it is not worth for companies to make advertising for young children that are not able to buy the companies products by themself with this there will not be many advertisments for young children in the television anyway
 ",14
16402,television adevertising shouldnt take  because they dont understand what its meaning its the same ,15
16403, you go in e shopingcenter and somebody want to buy a little children anythink ,9
16404, that is not very intelligent from the advertising maker because they dont understand what the advertising mean ,11
16405, people begin to sell little chilrden anythink is this stupid ,23
16406, that young children dont watch alot of tv but the ,17
16407, generation is to play with an iphone or an ipad and ,24
16408, you make ther an advertising little children touch this app or something like that and by it but they dont understand that they spent money ,0
16409, why you want to speak to her children they cant spent money you must speak to her parents but at the iphone and ipad is this possible for me its ok ,9
16410, you make the advertising simple that all can understand the advertising but take not directly  because alot of the product are very bad for little children but the companys want to make money and that is not ok   ,0
16411,"should television advertising for children be allowed

as soon as we turn on the television we will see a lot of advertising they all have the same goal to make us want to have the product but that doesnt work everytime because as soon as we know the price we start to think if we really need that product but there is one group of people that cannot decide if they really need the product or not children when they see a new toy on the television they are very easy to manipulate ",14
16412, they just want everything so the question is now should television advertising s children be allowed in the following text ,13
16413," explain why it should and should not be allowed

first the counter ",21
16414, children cannot decide if they need a product or not ,2
16415, they would be manipulated very easely by the companies and the parents would have to pay the price ,9
16416, it is very difficult for the parents to work against the advertising for children to completly forbid the children the television cannotreally be the ,14
16417," the better thing would be to not allow television advertising for childrenthat are the reasons why it should not be allowed to manipulate the chlidren with advertising

",13
16418, now explain why it should be allowed firstly television advertising for children gives the companies an opportunity to make money this is ,13
16419, important for companies which sell toys because how else would they inform their custormers what new product they have when the companies sell more product the state gets more money and that will help our economy another ,23
16420, is that it should be the task of the parents to look ,12
16421, their children and buy them or not the things they want and explain why they do ,9
16422," it should be the parents who should discuss with the children if they really need that product that are the reasons why it should be allowed

in conclusion ",12
16423," it is better if television advertising for children is aloww


 ",13
16424,we all know the feeling ,18
16425, we are watching an exciting movie in the television and suddenly it gets interrupted by annoying ads but ,10
16426," we were children these ads were very interesting and we got really fascinated by them they tried really hard to motivate a young child to buy something is it correct to make a child which cant even make their own decisions buy something
at ",0
16427, i have to say that these ads can be extremly manipulating they just show the positiv ,11
16428," of the product and they never tell you the whole truth about it when we are grownup we know that we shouldnt believe everything that we see in the television but children often do they dont know the difference between an ad and the real life because of that ads directed  are very maipulating
on the other ",2
16429, i have to say that children should ,12
16430, have the right to discover new toys and games and to build their own opionion about them and an easy way to do this is watching ads on the television many amazing toys that i had ,20
16431," i was a child i discovered by an advertisment 
in conclusion i have to say that ",18
16432, ads can be very manipulating for young children they should stay allowed one reason is that childrens should ,16
16433, be allowed to discover new things and the other reason is that at the end its anyway the mother or father that has to buy the toy,20
16434,often people think that televison is not good for young children that is why parents or older person argree against a television advertising  however there are ,14
16435," people who support the tv consum by children 

in my opininon television advertising  should be allowed there are a lot of ",13
16436, mention that you can learn about many subjects with watching tv it can be a basicly part in childrens education yet there is important what kind of series or films or documentaries you watch ,6
16437, that there are a loot of channels which are really useless for a children for exemple according to my opinion sponspop schwankopf is really useless as education because you learn nothing important in this movie but there are ,6
16438, other chanels or series which are good material for education with education i do not mean only the schoolary part ,6
16439, an social education for this part tv delivers you a lot basic social morals to make en example we can speak about series like five friends there are lot of hidden scocial education to explain that we can use the example of doing something togehter they ,6
16440,"should television advertising  be allowed

this is a question which i asked myself a few times ",15
16441," i used to watch television 
advertising ",10
16442," is quite an interesting phenomenon in which the viewer is convinced through image and sound that a certain product or way of living is more beneficial or more practical than what they already own some people even call it a minor form of brainwashing
so should it be acceptable to put children of a young age under the influence of advertisement

of course advertisement is needed for a product to sell well if we didnt advertise it how would the general masses even know it existed
through advertisement and ",16
16443, selling the product capital is accumulated and ,23
16444, more of the product can be made and sold and this goes on until there is no need for the product or a better version of it has been developed this ,23
16445," furthers our economy which naturally is beneficial for the citizens

however if children get to see advertisements which have been specifically made to make them want the product ",0
16446, by integrating a famous cartoon character and lots of colours they will want to own the product because of how it is presented to them this wouldnt be as bad if the children payed for those products with their own money ,2
16447, it will be their parents who will have to pay for it ,9
16448," the children have no sustainable way of money income 

the money is not the only issue it is known for a ",9
16449, that children are more easily influenced by their surroundings than grown up or fully mentally developed people this means that they are more prone to believing in what the advertisement tells them and ,0
16450, they are drawn to it and wanting to own it ,3
16451," they dont really need it 
this is ",19
16452," of growing up knowing what you really need in your life or what you would just like to have just for the sake of owning it

it is quite difficult do decide if advertisement s children is good or bad ",0
16453, the market for toys and various other goods designed for children is being boosted and improved ,20
16454, children will have expectations of what they need to own in life which ,9
16455," is not an ideal attitude for a five year old 
this is an ",8
16456," i havent actively watched any tv in about eight years and in generall im not very exposed to advertiesment in my daily life and if i am i do not care much for them 

if we can prove that advertisements subconciously alter our ways of thinking about an object i believe that there shouldnt be such a thing as advertisements s children ",14
16457, capable of making thuroughly thought through decisions if children are exposed to advertisments too much they might even get used to someone telling them what to buy or what to do which might ultimately lead to them not having as much innovative thinking,0
16458,if you put children in front of a tv its not good itself but if they watch advertising its even worse because they get influenced by it we ,14
16459," get influenced by advertising but as adults we can differentiate between good and bad influenc and can decide more on our own if we want us to get influenced by something or not if a child watches advertising it just cant decide anything it gets inflenced and maybe it gets influenced for the hole life and will stay loyal for all his life to the product it saw at young age
television advertising is really ennoying for us adults but for children even more when they want to watch teletubbies or learn from good intelligent televisionshows like spongebob and ",14
16460," this terrible advertising sequence is popping up
its ",11
16461," really annoying for the parents who have children who always cry because they want the product they saw in the television
so what do we learn from this now at ",2
16462, advertising in television towards children is really bad for the children because of the huge influence on them second the television advertising makes the children dumb because they cant watch more intelligent things at the time the advertising is running third its very annoying for parents ,14
16463, children want products they saw in television advertising so in my oppinion television advertising towards children should be forbidden ,14
16464, our society will break down sooner or later because of too many television advertising damaged children,14
16465,television is a media thats used by many peopele in their daily life people of every age watch television and enjoy the entertaining factor of the telly because ,17
16466, many people use the media this is where advertising comes in television is an easy way to reach many people at a time with just one short advirtisement clip for companies its obviously a good way to promote their goods but is it ,10
16467, a good way for consumers to learn about those goods is it healthy to be cofronted with new and apparantly nice goods everyday ,23
16468," for young children
children of the age between two and twelve can be easily manipulated if they see something on television is it a new toy or something to eat they want  it immediately it looked nice on tv they want to have it its not in the mental capability of young children to differenciate whether they do or do not need the cool new thing they just saw in the advertisement this is why toy manufacturers like lego or playmobil strategically place their ads on special channels for kids or during a streaming time of kidfriendly content because of that strategical move they can reach a lot of children and confront them directly with the new good they would like to sell a lot of children immediately feel a lack if they cant get the good they saw on television this happens over and over and with every new good they like and dont get this lack gets bigger eventually making them unhappy maybe even sad 
therefore it would be a very good idea to ban advertisments directed  with a ban like this a lot of problems would have to be faced who decides which ad is directed ",14
16469,  how can companies who manufacture goods for young children sell their goods without advertising for them and ,2
16470, it seems like no company would ever give up their opportunity to advertise their produced good the same counts for companies who manufacture goods for children it would not be fair to ban their ads just because the audience they are directed to cant differntiate whether they do or do not need the good it would lead to a major ,16
16471, for the company and thats not fair me ,18
16472, i think it lays in the hands of the parents to communicate with their kids and tell them what they can and can not have there is no need for an advertising ban on children goods,13
16473,in todays world television is omnipresent and theres almost no household without at least one tv companies have made use of that by advertising on television as much as possible we often see advertisment s infants it is known that advertisement can influence people ,10
16474," young children but should we really in a free society with freedom of opinion forbid advertisement that is  kids between two and five years old

as a matter of ",16
16475, we can say that young children are very influencable we can ,8
16476, see this with kidnappers they offer kids sweets or promise them puppies or kittens the kids just have to hear one of these words and all they can think of are puppies and kittens and sweets almost without thinking they will follow the kidnapper you could ,7
16477," argue that a similar thing happens with ads the infants will hear the advertisement and they will accept them as truth it can blurr or even fake their view of reality

on the other ",7
16478, we live in a free society where people can have their own opinion and even spread their opinion we see this all the time with demonstrations banners with political messages satirical cartoons in newspapers and ,21
16479," on so why shouldnt companies be allowed to direct their advertisements towards younger kids it is the parents duty to make their kids immune to these kind of advertisements with their education they should prepare kids for situations like that and they have to say no if a kid wants this stupid product that was advertised for

to conclude ",16
16480, that you cannot forbid advertisement that is s young children because it is part of our free society to spread your opinion companies should be able to make use of this ,13
16481, that it is the parents responsibility to prepare their kids for situations like that ,7
16482, that the kids arent influencable ,9
16483,"young children are not able in differentiating what they really need and what is good for them from what is not useful or fun at all neither are they able to decide if buying that toy is worth it regarding to the quality 
on the other ",20
16484, children have to make their experiences in life and ,8
16485," kids aged  cannot really get what is said to them in television what happens only is that they are like oh i really want that 
children these days are watching tv more than they are playing in the woods making them seeing all these things like toys movies or something which are showed off in the best way possible would make the situation worse they may even spend more time in front of a display
but because of that trend that young kids want to watch more tv marketing functions on television 

my personal opinion is young children may should not be confronted with direct advertising we live in a time where marketing works like that ",14
16486, it is the responsibility of parents to protect their children from possible danger on television and internet as long as television advertising is not too much and manipulating it is alright with me because our system works that way the question of what is too much is hard to answer but i really think parents of their children are responsible for what their kids watch,14
16487,"advertising towards small children a blessing or an immoralic way of influencing innocent people

on one ",16
16488, of the commercial industry advertising s young children aged  is a blessing its ,0
16489, easy to influence small children and for them its very easy to influence their parents this gets clear with the following example the producers of an advertising will show a product in an mostly unrealisitc way ,2
16490, that the children get seduced to wanting this product the children will talk to their parents and their parents will buy the product for them because the children are ,2
16491," that they wont stop asking for it this example shows that commercial enterprises and product manufacturers can make a lot of money with advertising towards small children 
on the other ",2
16492," its a immoralic business small children aged  arent able to think about a product properly they just want it if they like it or if their friends like it they know nothing about the circumstances in which the products get produced the manufacturies that are mostly in china employ a lot of people in bad working conditions on top of that commercial towards small children just increases the amount of resources that we use because theres a bigger group of people that gets affected by advertising

",2
16493, that this way of advertising is a sort of immoralic business ,11
16494, small children are innocent and just dont know enough about the backgrounds of the products that they want but ,2
16495, the parents that produce these advertisings and parents need money for their children and ,16
16496, its in the hands of the parents if their children can consume advertising or not,16
16497,every time our kids turn on the tv to watch their favourite show it is likely that the screen is showing advertisements because it was turned on as the requested show has not ,14
16498," begun in that very moment those unexperienced almost naã¯ve minds are exposed to whatever is happening in front of them whether its an ad for a new toy a kids magazine supscription or some kind of candy the children suck up all the information they are being told without questioning the content now is it a good thing to allow companies to advertise their product in front of such a young audience

the reason why ",16
16499, advertising on childrens tv channels is because on one ,14
16500, children are impatient they cant wait for ad breaks to be over ,24
16501, can see their favourite superhero save the day and if advertisements roll a lot the child becomes annoyed upset or angry at whatever it is watching and that anger often enrolls on the childs parents  which brings me to my ,2
16502, its not the children who are paying for the toys its the parents if a boy goes grocery shopping with his mom and he sees this brandnew lego dumpster truck sitting on a shelf just waiting there for him to choose it buy it take it home with him and have a happy day playing with it the boys thoughts partially implied by tv ads he had seen about that truck prior to entering the store create a stressful situation for ,20
16503, the parent and the child having seen the published ads on tv the boy knows all about the trucks cool features ,0
16504, remote control that is giving him a wider range of ,18
16505, hes able to use against his mother who is just trying to buy the ingredients for tonights vegetable stew the last thing she wants is a crying son but not being willing to buy him another toy to lie unused inside his oversized toy box at home makes for an excellent base for an ,20
16506, whose possible endings most people know already the mother ,18
16507," buys the toy and is upset about her unnecessary expense and her sons misbehaviour at the store or she doesnt buy the truck and the disaster becomes even more horrifying for her having her son screaming crying and yelling at her about the unsuccessful shopping tour makes other people look and stare at her the unresponsible mother who is not willing to fulfill a sons wish

eliminating advertising for kids on tv would ",20
16508, make sense for the children as waiting times for their favourite series become shorter ,6
16509, bring relief to the parents because they would be able to avoid certain stressful situations throughout the daily life and they wouldnt have to fear about their children watching content inappropriate content for their age in addition to that the family budget would have more room for the important things like food home improvement or holidays ,9
16510, than spending a lot of money on toys and such and anyways isnt there enough stress for the parents around christmas to worry about what toy to buy for their beloved children,20
16511,"should television adversiting direted  toward young children not be allowed

we all know that the medias inclusiv the tv an enormous power has every person whos watching tv can say it has no impact on him an lie with that statement in ",13
16512," it does have an perfect example are the news in which we get constantly betrayed and lied on 

we could argue that every family should look for themselves and it is not the problem of the state for the state is it great if the kids look tv because ",21
16513, has the state a bigger affect of the youth and can more easily give the kids morals which are positiv for the state it is clear that we have a lot of privat tv and ,12
16514, this factor with the state goes away the private channels often do exactly the same ,10
16515," morals and behaviour from there 
so the parents should look for the kids and not the tv 

on the other ",17
16516," can kids learn a lot from the tv if they are watching shows with a learn basic like the animal channel or the show galileo if the children look  tv with a good content it could be great for them

in my opinion the state should not force us to not let our kids watching tv ",17
16517," they want let or not let their kids watch tv
i ",17
16518, would let my kids watch tvbut not too much and most importantlynot manipulated thing likethat with the chips imp,1
16519,my essay is about if it should be allowed to direct televison advertising toward young childern aged  ,13
16520, i tought about the statement and all i can say is that this is already happening in these days if christmas is coming closer the weather is getting colder and the nights are getting longer the televison is full with advertisings if ,10
16521," about it the advertisings are mostly directed to young childern and teenagers 
but why is the televison full with barbie and cars spots 
i belive ",10
16522," the rising cosum of this wolrd the market is looking for new and easier cosumers and childerns are really easy to confince 
a pro ",9
16523, is that the childerns can easy tell their parents what they want for cristmas or birthday the television in the most homes are in the power mood for a long time and this every day luckly parents can jsut say no and the childerns wont get their barbies or cars game so it might can be allowed to direct advertising to young childern ,14
16524," that the paretns have to say yes ot no 

my pro ",21
16525," are that in this exathurating consum of today we have to look that the youngest people shoudnt get forced to cosume but if you tell them that they have to buy everything they will get use to a consum in a capitalism way 
also childern in this age are to young for being sure if its a right or wrong thing to want whats in the advertisings 

so my opinion is clearly that it shouldnt be allo",2
16526,the topic if televiosion advertising  is e very controversial topic it gives several positif asspects ,10
16527, for the televsioin advertising is that the children can learn how to use the television in de right way also a big plus is that they can make experiences about the advertising ,0
16528," ahve to see that the parents wont buy them everything out of the advertisement for the children it is now easier to know waht they want for the negst christmas or their birthady because they see what kind of things it gives like a new doll or something like that

it gives ",0
16529, to the advertising toward the young childrenfirstly it isnt good at all that children in the age of  are in front of a televiosion this because it is biologically proofed that learning process of the children will get slower and out of that the most of them have problems with their intelligence and the school later in their life with the advertising will get the children more addicted to television because they want to know what new items it give in ,14
16530, of that they wont be that much outside and they will pass their childhood in a room in front of a tv advertising at all isnt good for the family life because some of the parents coulndt buy every new playitem to their child and mostly the child cant understand it and will get very angry also a negativ ,17
16531, is it that the children wont play with their old tings like an old lego set no they want the newest one and ,20
16532, they get it they will play for one or two weeks with it and afterwards it gives a new one and they want to have that one so ,3
16533," the families lost unneceserally a lot of money  had a lot of fights and have a lot of playitems that nobody is using

so im definitly against the television advertising s young children ",14
16534, my opinion is that they shouldnt watch tv at all in that age because they can do such beautiful other things than just hang in their rooms watching tv it is ,17
16535, very dangerous for the children ,4
16536, they see all the new things and they cant get it ,3
16537, in the kindergarden and they dont have the newest thing maybe they will get mobbe and that in such a young age and because of all that negativ ,24
16538, and that is givesnot really many reasons for it ,21
16539, with te statement in the exercise,21
16540,advertising is very controvertial topic for some people espetially directly towards young children in this essey ,16
16541," write my thoughts about it and come to my own conclusion

first what is advertising all about addvertisements are shown in the televivion to promote an article a company wants to sell companies tell you how good their product is but you never know if thats just a hoax or real because companies want to sell their goods and make profit to keep going in my age  im 16 years old  i know that companies want you to sell their product ",10
16542, they pay to show it on television but here is where many people start to get sceptical about it ,10
16543, young children are involved children mostly  aged  a ,8
16544, about children is that they dont know as much as we do about the world and can be very naiv which means if theres someone in the add telling how good something is ,7
16545, products that parents dont want their parents to have ,2
16546, their oppinion about the product knowing what actually is behind it however children cant realize that and believe what theyre told on television ,2
16547," they want to get the product and start crying to get their toy or whatever it might be as well they will start to become a picture of the world that might be unreal just because they are told on television

but if we are ralistic ",20
16548, that it is pretty exsaturated that people want thet direct advertising to children is forbidden if parents dont want their children to see those adds dont even let them watch television and how do those people want to achieve to not let children watch televison its hard to only let adults see the adds ,13
16549, my oppi nion is clearly that ,18
16550, its unrealistic to not let children watch them,6
16551," they will be excited about the bright colors that are often shown in such advertisments they will often ask their parents to buy them whatever new product they saw in the advertisment and they will often get it as a birthday or christmas present
this ",0
16552, is helpful for the companies it must be effective ,23
16553," if it was not there would no longer be advertisment  children parents will spend money which helps keeping the economy going
on the other ",0
16554, children can easily be manipulated there was a study in which they were shown a short video clip of an evil clown being beaten up and ,7
16555, the cildren would later try to hit a person distinguished as clown apparently avdertisment seen in television might cause damage to a childs mental health ,6
16556," if it contents violence or usage of strong language
however parents decide what they let their children see they should be capable of controlling how they rise their own children what they buy for them and what is not acceptable to show them parents can turn the television off at any moment also advertisments only seen once will usually not cause damage to a childs development or mental state content must be seen over a long period of time ",14
16557," cause such problems again it is the task of their parents to control that 
still children will sit in front of the television longer waiting fo the bright colors and exciting sounds to come along furthermore talking of their parents those will not be too amused about their children asking them to buy whatever new product they saw on television
however again this is in control of the parents they should be able to control what their child sees and the should be able to refuse to buy whatever product their child wishes for additionally children will watch more television anyway there are enough shows they can be excited about ",17
16558," the beauty and the beast
in my opinion advertisment towards young children should not be forbidden however parents have to be careful about what their child sees at a young age ",16
16559, it comes to violent content or similar,21
16560,"nowadays i see more and more children with smartphones and ipads at home they are confirmed with televisionthey can not go outside to play with friends the technic is nowadays a part of society the children of this generation have an issue

television is a particulary part of our society important news all over the world arrive us with tv we get an overview of the situation of the world and this is important for our education but ",17
16561, young children do not watch newsshows they do not watch them because they do not understand in my opinion this is okay but exactelly ,17
16562, children watch television shows without niveau and this is the way i see it a gigantic problem moreover they watch silly and stupid tvshows without any education ,17
16563, with this statement because think today in television we can see ,10
16564, much stupid things in this age children shouldnt see things like this i mean sure in television you ,6
16565, have some programs only for the kids but for kid in the age from seven to eleven or something in the programs for adults or teenager they are ,24
16566, many things which arent really good to see for small children ,4
16567, some pornos or warthings because ,18
16568, small kids maybe do not understand what they say in the television but they can see the worse pictures and ,17
16569, maybe it could be that they understand this pictures maybe not everything should not be aloowed because there are ,3
16570, cute things in television who are really okey for this age and this series for kids are often really short only ten minutes or something like that maybe this kids series they can help the kids to speak ot some easy words or learn some easy things in a other way is my opinion that children shoud know what happens in the world ,6
16571, if a child is maybe fourteen or fifteen ,24
16572, it is old enough to understand some difficult thingsbut not in this agesince we have this television and computer and mobilephones ,6
16573, many kids can watch tv how long they want and what they want but if you are a small kid you do not know what could be good for you or what you should not see in this age sometimes i am really shocked what ,17
16574, small kids are able to do or have if you are a kid you should go out with the kids in the forest it is not important where but you should go out with the kidslet them play outside because the nature is much better than some advertising or programs in the television how i already said ,1
16575, it is okey if children are able  look sometimes a short clip or something in the tv but not ,17
16576, often because if a family has a tv at home and the parents watch every evening tv you can not say to your child that they are not able to look sometimes as i was a child we did not had a television at home an i had t played outside or make some puzzles oo something like that,17
16577,the statement i write about in this text is television advertising  should not be allowed and i fully ,15
16578, with that statement because these advertisements are often shown on tvchannels that are for kids and a lot of kids are watching these channels of course it makes sense for the companies to show their advertisements on one of these channels because they can direct it to the right buyergroup but thats the problem are children really a serious buyergroup who can go to the store make decisions what they really need no they mostly cant in ,16
16579, they want every single product shown in the advertising so they will run to there parents ask them to get it and if they wont get it they will be sad and ,2
16580, angry at there parents but ,9
16581, they should learn that they cant have everything in life and that the job of advertising is to get you to want to buy this particular product they should learn that advertising isnt always the truth and can be misleading thats the positive ,0
16582, about the advertising that is directed direct to them because they can learn that early in life and will not be confronted with that ,7
16583," they will be older and the advertising will be directed again direct to them but not to a kid but to an adult
so ",0
16584, it shouldnt be allowed to advertise directly to children but the impact of the children depends on them and there parents h,16

16632," its just impossible to control what children nowadays get confronted with if they dont see stuff like alcohol porns drugs or voilence etc on tv its somewhere else 
last of all ",12
16633, say that tv advertising can help you to find out what is new on the market and to get inspired by ideas especially in time of christmas or easter the chanels are overfluded with advertisement this can be a help for children to find out what they want but it can be very stressful for their parents ,0
16634, thats not as worse as sex toys alcohol drugs etc  ,4
16635,the question if direct advertising towards young children should be allowed truly is a very controversial question it ,16
16636, is a widely discussed and important topic with good ,21
16637, there is the freedom of market economy which ensures companies to have certain rights and to advertise for their products as widely as possible they are dependant on a certain amount of sales and need enough income to ,23
16638," providing their product and paying their shareholders and employees
on the other ",23
16639, aged  are extremely easily influenced do they have to be protected through law or are parents responsible for what their childen watch are parents able to always watch over their children ,7
16640, they watch tv or should they just let the advertisement get to their childrens brains but try to keep their kids under control on their ,1
16641," shopping trip to walmarts
in my opinion we should protect our children from threats like these letting big companies screw our helpless childrens minds is cruel and cant be toleratd any longer we must rise and take a stand against this worst form of capitalism the world has ever seen there hasnt been this amount of psychologic violence ",12
16642, world war a battle is raging around us but we seem not to see it or dont we want to see it because we are part of the system,21
16643,television advertising towards young children leads to pressure on the childrens parents because it gives children incentives to want a specific product which is maybe not financial possible to buy for the parents on the other ,14
16644, advertising can be pared with moral ,11
16645, to teach and to create a better understanding and look for the world ,8
16646, the targeted group is very young growing up with commercials can influence a child positively it is often seen as unmoral to target such a young group because they dont have an own opinion ,16
16647, and they are not able to distinguish information correctly therefore you could change the developement of a child with advertising because the child does not know that it is just for commercial reasons although there are risks the toy industry is booming and creates a lot of jobs and strengthens the economic situation ,2
16648, in countrys like china where the production is less expensive in my opinion commercials targeted at young children should be forbidden ,16
16649, their goal is to manipulate the targeted group it should be allowed to advertise in the toy business but not to set the goal to manipulate the children and create a need for me there should be more controling and testing on effects on children this would help to rate and show the companys what risks there are and create an more sensitive understanding,16
16650,in my opinion a child aged  cant decide if an advertising is ,16
16651, s them a child has to learn that it cant get anything it wants for sure the advertiser wants that the child goes to his parents and tells them that they want to have this thing that it saw in the advertising but ,0
16652, thats no reason not to allow it but yes i think it can be ennoying for parents ,12
16653, their children do this but it can ,7
16654, for a good parenting when i was a child i was bored from advertising neither ,0
16655," they didnt influented me and i didnt ennoyed my parents too 
however i dont see the ",18
16656, to direct advertising toward children aged  because they are too young ,16
16657," its worse to direct advertising toward children aged seven to twelf in this age the children understand what they see in the advertising and they are more influentable but this isnt a reason not to allow them  

another problem is to decide which advertise is  and which not if advertising directed  would be forbidden in my opinion it isnt decidable to say if an advertise is directed for children aged five or for children aged seven ",16
16658," it would be very difficult to decide if the advertise should be forbidden or not

in conclusion ",11
16659, it may not be good for some children that companies trie to influent them whit their televison advertsing  but it cant be forbidden because it would not make much sense and would be pretty difficult to say if the advertise is directed to young kids or not,14
16660,"everytime we watch tv we see advertising it is used to promote products the product should speak to some kind of people that should be interested in for example if the commercial promotes cat food it should get cat owners to buy the food 
advertising is used for people any agebutt is ist really necessary to advertise products for kids 
what speaks for it is why not if its childfriendly children watch tv anyways the advertising industry might get a lot more money because they speak to a new group of people children can see new stuff that is on the market


but ",14
16661, children shouldnt be influenced in that early age they cant buy the products they see in tv their parents would have to buy it if they understand the content is another question first children shouldnt watch tv too often and ,17
16662, tv is not the future of the entertainment industry advertising is often not even looked at because it is ,10
16663, it is a good idea because it is a waste of money and time to try to convince some toddlers and children of a product is ridiculous they can not buy the product by themselves ,2
16664,with all the mobilephones tablets and computers you can watch television everywhere and evertime you want especially young children are likely to watch more and more televison as their parents often work full time and dont have time to play with their children but with all the television there is ,17
16665, television advertising its something no one really likes but you cant watch television without seeing a television advertising often there are always the same television advertisings and without knowing the advertising is saved in your mind young children tend more to save a television advertinsing in their mind if there is a cool toy or something they would like to have so if the children go shopping with their parents and they see this really cool toy from the televison advertising they want to have it with adults it works the same but probably ,14
16666, a toy its a new computer a new hair curler or a caffemachine and ,20
16667, we see this new product in a shop the chance that we will buy it is higher ,23
16668, we have seen the television advertising ,11
16669, this is like brain wash but thats how everything works the companys need a way to present their new products and without television advertising the television company couldnt survive i really dont like all these television advertisings and i ,10
16670, just bought something because i have seen it in the television but thats just how our society works,3
16671,"everyone who has watched tv atleast once should know about commercial breaks between the episodes of scheduled programm these advertisements range from food to toys to shampoo for ones hair but some people started asking should we show those adds to little children

in my opinion we absolutly shouldnt one of the core reasons why we shouldnt is because young children are not protected from manipiulation they dont know wrong from right they dont know good from bad young children pretty much believe everything that one tells them many commercials work in a way that exploits this weakness of small children they show a happy family enjoying a sugary snack or a child who couldnt be happier with his new toy that his parents bought him none of these commercials show any downsides of the advertised products or unhealthy ",14
16672, effects that they might bring and quiet frankly why should they theyre trying to make money as said ,23
16673, young children will believe what they are told without questioning the information if a commercial tells them that the new toy will make them smile and bring untold hours of fun they will not question this information for even one ,2
16674," in short commercials influence children who do not know any better and might lead them to some bad choices with their toys or food

another reason why commercials should not be shown  is because parents do not have any control over them while they can look up the shows and movies on tv be it with help of the internet or the papers and ",14
16675, what is playing commercials arent shown in the program imagine a mother letting her child watch a kidfriendly show like sesame street or dora the explorer and just letting it sit there ,6
16676, she cooks lunch or cleans the house and ,1
16677, suddenly during the commercial break the kid is shown an advertisement for the newest egoshooter or another brutal videogame loud noises gunfire blood and death those things will scare a young child and maybe give it nightmares for weeks and all that because the parent thought that they could do their kid some good by letting it watch sesame street and is the parent really to blame adults even those with children have a life of their own have chores to do and sometimes need a small break from their attentionhungry little miracle they can not constantly watch over a small child and cant control whats shown on tv so ,2
16678, its a smarter move to show commercials ,10
16679," smaller children probably arent watching and leave them out from the kids programm

in conclusion i think showing adds to little children is a very bad idea it could influence their young minds or traumatize them for a ",6
16680, things that no parent wants   ,9
16681,"today every management needs to do some advertising to make their porducts more attractive and to make your that the product is wellknown for exempale if adverts are shown on televison adults just skip the channel but young children are fascinated by the products and they want to have one 
exempale given in an advert a new toy is shown and because it is ",0
16682," colourful the young child wants one of these and starts screaming until it gets one some parents just buy it without thinking about it 
but isnt that selfish and disresponsible of the producer and the whole management to manipulate the kids should advertising on the television which is  even be allowed

in one way its scary that adults and kids can be manipulated that easilyi mean adults and teenagers are old enough to decide if they want to buy it or not but children are to young to understand and they cant help themselves so you could say that they are vicitms 
producer use children for expanding their products so i think that it shouldnt be allowed they can direct toward adults and older children 

but ",2
16683," there isnt just advertising on the television there are screens and other devices which show adverts so just by not allowing advertising on television directed the young children the thing isnt done the kids want be much safer

to end up you can say that producer are looking forward to expand their products and to make profit ",14
16684, that it it would be a step forward ,19
16685," televison advertising toward young children were forbidden but it want change much there are adverts everywhere and the producers will find an other way to get the attention of the children 
",14
16686, with this statement because if young children watch television they shouldnt waste time with advertises ,14
16687, that children shouldnt watch tv all day and if they do they should be concentrated on the informations that they learn with the things that are in the tv theyre uninteressed in advertises and maybe the children cant even see the difference between real tv and advertises young children want to learn things theyre curious and want to learn and understand everything they see and if they watch advertises maybe the childrens growth gets slow down another ,13
16688, is the regular tv what ive named a little bit ,6
16689, of the text young children to the age of three should nearly never watch tv and children between three and ten should have the permission of the parents if they want to watch television the consume of medias is a problem that nearly every mother and father has if children watch tv they should learn something about the world and how things are going if they have to watch advertises they might unsee the important things advertises should be only for young adults and adults because these are the people who have money to buy the things in the advertises thats ,13
16690, in this statement young children want everything that they see if its in real life or in the television and if they see a toy in tv that looks funny and the woman that representates the toy looks ,20
16691, very friendly they want it the parents couldnt and shouldnt buy everything their children wants but children dont unterstand it ,9
16692, the parents say no because they are too young for it ,24
16693,everyone knows how fast children are intrested in something in my childhood i always wanted the new nerf gun to play with my brother i ,20
16694," saw this super technology gun in a television advertisment but as we got the super new to play with we quickly realised that the gun itself isnt any good or exaiting maybe the television tricked me in believing of this super new toy and thats the topic of the following essay should television adverstisingtoward young children not be allowed
lets start with the positif ",14
16695, advertisment for children between two and five is good because they can see new things and get exited about it through  the advertisment the children learn new things can explore the world and maybe get an insparation really early on that effect them in their decision in life later on maybe lang lang the popular pianist wouldnt have gotten a pianist if he hadnt seen the new playable piano for children with different sounds and only few keys in an advertisment ,0
16696," he was a litte kid maybe messi the popular soccer player wouldnt have gotten a soccer player if he hadnt seen a new soccer ball in an advertisment this all has to be considered and can be important for a lot of people 
the negatif ",18
16697, are far more superior if all is considered most of the television advertisment tricks little naiv kids who hasnt developped a selfcritic thinking into buying stupip things first they are really exited and happy that they got a new toy ever other child has but ,2
16698, they just use it once or twice and ,3
16699, they throw it into a corner and never play with it again the children get manipulated by the advertisment which are organised ,20
16700, every child wants the thing in the advertisment there are huge parts in industries which are specialisted exactly to manipulate the advertisment and thats not correct at all and in any case the children are most effected of it and the problem here is that the childs parents dont teach the child that this exact thing isnt good yes maybe the parents are the howl problem in this case sometimes the child is ,2
16701," under pressure because every other friend of his has this new toy of an advertisment newlaunched so he wants it too and would be really sad if the parents just say no
from my ",20
16702, advertisment is bad and is really bad for young children like in the introduction my brother and i got tricked by these companys a lot i learnt to think twice about things i see in the tv and stopped hyping everything up my brother ,16
16703, the behaviour of always wanting something new and he ,18
16704, gets tricked by advertisment its not just a problem for the children its a problem for all the people with a tv in my case i cant get fooled anymore by these companys because  i stopped watching tv along time ago in my opinion every one should stop watching tv because in 90 of the content is just rubbish but this is just my opinion and i ,14
16705, think that the advertisments influence relise heavily on the people and not on the the advertisment ,11
16706,often on children channels they publish advertisements for toys or games which seems logical so ,0
16707," every person remember such a situation in his childhood where you see something shown in the tv you want to have

on one ",6
16708, for the company who sells these toys for children because ,20
16709," the children saw these toys or even worse they saw other children in the advertisement playing with these toys they want to have it emmediately so they put it on their list of wishes for christmas and the parents will buy it and thats the way the companies make their profit

but ",20
16710, exactely this example shows us that children get spoiled more and more because these advertisement put them something in their head they want to have and they will get it so the advertisements on tv support this scenario another negative ,14
16711, is that cildren in this age arent able to analys or even think about the ,3
16712," for example the price or how usefull it is they just want to have it 

so ",23
16713, its to early for kids aged  to handle a situion like that in the right way it would be more intelligent to show them more of their series they want to see but unfortenately nowadays it the other way round they show even more and more advertisments than the real program of the channel so ,6
16714, you shouldent stop every advertiment but minimize it,11
16715,"television adverising  should not be allowed this statement may shock some parents because they do this all the time but is it really bad
one opinion is that it is it is not ",17
16716, young children always sitting in front of the television it could have bad issues to the creativity of the child but it can be productive ,17
16717," because the children could learn and see things through the television that they would not see in reallife at this age
another opinion to this statement is that children should learn even in young years to deal with technique ",17
16718, they will not have problems to understand how the modern world works but they ,7
16719," do not know a world without televisions and stuff like that the children can no imagine that in the past nobody had a television or that even today not everybody has it or even knows what it is 
and a last opinion that is ",17
16720, my opinion is that parents will not do things with their children as example go out to see somethig or to a parc they just let them stay in the house and watch the television i find it terrible that the parents of today just let their children watch the television ,17
16721, the parents are to tiredor are not in the mood to do tings with their own children,1
16722,for many of us watching television and ,10
16723, seeing all kinds of commercials is part of our daily routine some are allowed to watch tv starting at a very young age and some are hardly ever aloud to watch tv at home despite the ,14
16724," that the children aged  probably dont really understand what theyre watching many commercials are s them so haow do these influence them should it be allowed

most likely many of the commercials directed  are about toys games or about some sort of drawingart utilities as mentioned ",14
16725," the majority of these children wont quite understand what theyre watching and just forget about it a couple of seconds later they dont only watch commericals theyre merely shown between series or movies like sesame street or barney and friends for kids at that age
one bad influence could maybe be that theyd see all this neat things on tv and constantly ask their parents to buy them for them for example a little girl sees the newest and greatest barbie on tv and begs her parents to buy it for her howevery her parents cant afford to buy and dont want to have ",14
16726, another toy because she keeps asking for another one every other week and its hard for her parents to say no after begging for this new barbie the parents give in and buy it for her  and thats exactely what these commericals are for its exactely what they want you to do this is how these toys and games brands make their money every child wants the newest and coolest toys and keeps nagging their parents to buy it for them and ,20
16727," most of them do
people thnik these commercials have no impact what ",11
16728, ever on these young children but ,24
16729," they make a ton of money out of these harmless commercials

so to answer the question if ",11
16730, with the statement television advertising directed  aged  should not be allowed i dont completely ,13
16731, yes many of the children constantly ask their parents to buy them these new toys but ,20
16732, theres any harm to that of course these commercials are just there to take your money but thats like that everywhere so ,11
16733, theres any harm done to these children  ,12
16734,nowdays a lot of people cant imagine their life without a television they watch films series news sports etc but there is ,17
16735," another thing that is on the tv everyday and not loved by everyone the advertising of different things toys are advertised in this way very often but is this a good way to make parents buy stuff for their children

first children are very naã¯ve and mostly want to have the coolest toys when they are watching television ",20
16736, teletubbies and between two episodes an advertising for a new barbie appears the little girls will probably get mad about it eventhough they know that they have enough barbies in their room they ,20
16737, want to have the newest things and ,23
16738," is that these television advertisings are formed very unfairly only if you have this special barbie youll have fun

but ",11
16739, the children should learn that they cant get everything just because the television tells them to buy it the parents ,2
16740," play a big role in this subject if their daughter asks them for the barbie they should be able to tell her no children need discipline and that is a good way to show them

another good ",9
16741, for television advertising is that children can decide what they would like to have and what they dont want so if someone asks them what they wish for christmas they can easily give an answer its ,0
16742, a help for the parents theyll see what their child likes and wants to have ,8
16743," buying a present isnt that hard

to sum things up television advertising can have bad impacts on the children but its the task of the parents to show them what is essentiel for life and what isnt children should see that they cant get just everything they see and that toys shouldnt be their main thought its important to learn this ",20
16744, theyll think like this for their whole life and the older you get the harder is it to just get everthing you want and advertising things can be helpful for the child and parents ,2
16745," it comes to presents and what the child wants to have
y",9
16746,why do big companies produce television advertising which is  the answer to that question is quite easy  because they know that the parents let their children watch the television even at a very young age the problem as we see are not the big bad companies who generate needs who did not exist ,14
16747, but the parents who are way too bored of their children to spend time with them and for whom it is way less difficult to just let their beloved sit in front of the tv so why would we forbid the advertising in a media which should not even be counsumed by young children why would we blame others for the faults which the parents make themselves because it is way easier to search the responsibility and the fault for our own mistakes at other people a big capitalistic company without face  that is an enemy which everyone would see as the responsible one the one who wants to let our children become rotten and who try to convince our children somehow to buy more stuff or something like that but ,13
16748, that were the case who has got the money to buy things the parents not the children if a child tries to get something which it has seen somehow in the tv or the adertising or the media or whatever it ,9
16749," has to ask their parents but it is not the fault of the people who produce the advertising that the parents are way too weak to say no to their own children who are not even old enough to go to school 
in conclusion we should bloody stop to always make big problems up which are our own faults and to understand that we  if we want it or not  ",2
16750, for those who should be under our protection and ,21
16751, not  the worlds population  or the majority of it  suffers from that many problem at the moment ,21
16752,called prolifes trump hunger war homophobes rapists pedophiles murderers diseases why do we even have the time and the power to discuss that shallow questions because we live in a country who has too much money to even know how it feels like to have real problems but yeah it is way more important to spend time with the television habbits of our children in a country where our problems get created by our own wealth so here arethe ,19
16753, get your fucking shit together do not let your children sit in front of the tv for hours and hours each day teach them how to think critically and do not let them dictate what you should buy or not because ,9
16754, you are the parent the child is only the child if you are unlucky it is probably your own and as a person of authority it is your choice what to buy and what not ,9
16755,"should television advertising  be allowed
in my opinion television advertising  should be allowed because they are not able to buy things themselves parents are verantwortlich and can deside wether they should buy the stuff or not maybe the children ",15
16756," with the opinion of their parents but its in charge of them to ceep their children calm and raise them right
advertising is more dangerous for adults they normally have noone to set them rules and they fall more often for advertising ",16
16757," there should be more tv shows without that much advertising
advertising in breaks is often built up right for the persons who watch a show for example ",10
16758," you watch gntm the advertising is about make up zalando and skin care when you watch a james bond movie the advertising is about mens shavers and parfumes
",11
16759," that childrens advertising shouldnt be banned because their parents can deside if they buy something

the minimale bearbeitungdauer is way too long",13
16760,in this times where we have many new electronic devises it is important to learn how to use them in a way that it does not damage our society for exemple television advertising must not be allowed toward young children in the folowing ,13
16761,  explane why this is my ,18
16762, start by looking at the positive thing of television advertising toward young children first of all there are many children who want to see advertising at the television because they want to know which are the new toys they can whish theirselves for exemple for christmas an other ,14
16763, to look at is that many television chanels only exist because they do advertising many marks pay a lot of many to appear for only few seconds in the television if that would not bethe case many channels would not exist and ,10
16764," that the children would be happy about that

there are of corse ",9
16765, of televison advertising children in such young ages can be manipulatet very easily and many companies do that to make money many children can not decide what they need and what things they do not need and ,2
16766, they want to have everything this is a bad thing because ,3
16767, they become older they can have same serious problems an other key thing to think at is  that in these times the amount of advertising in television is really high and ,24
16768, it hapens that a there is more advertising than ,11
16769," cartoons

to come to a conclution ",6
16770, that advertising toward young children should be banned because they are ,13
16771, young and they can be really easy influencend,24
16772,"due to the technological development  in the last decades the possibilities and varieties of advertising have rapidly increased companies can target their customers more directly more precisely and more efficently
out of all kinds of advertising television advertising has been playing an important role in sale strategies ",10
16773," of telvision

the big advertising companies have not missed out the ",10
16774, that there are more and more children friendly channels on telvision this opens a whole new world of opportunities for advertising know companies have ,0
16775," the possibillity to influence their costumors to buy one of their products they are now capable of raising their future costumers

television advertising  must be strictly controlled or even not allowed 
young children are very easily influenced their brain is ",14
16776, process of development in addition they are not ,19
16777," capable of recognising an advertisment the tend to believe what they are told 
this is why televison advertising has to be treated carefully children are very vulnerable to the companies suggestions and those companies have only one interest to increase their sales by any means possible telvision advertising is such an issue because the children are often alone in front of the screen with no adult to explain them what they are seeing 
a very good example is the happymeal mcdonalds tricks young children to consume more fastfood by advertising their happymeal which includes litte toys little children are very liklely to fall for this trick ",0
16778," the consumption of fast food has been proved to be unhealthy

finally television advertising must be controlled or forbidden  we do not want our children to grow up a customer",15
16779, a very difficult question to answer my opinion is that this kind of advertisment towards young kids should not be allowed children between the ages of two and five are not able to question things theyre told its impossible for them to build their own opinions and to see through marketing tactics in other words children are manipulated by companies at a very young age just ,16
16780, they can make a higher profit this is not just an ethical problem our society produces ,23
16781," generations will have to live with 

im sure the companies that use these sort of tactics make a higher profit but one cant just blame the companies the parents are ",23
16782, guilty parents decide wether they buy the things the children want or not they are the ones who have to acknowledge the ,9
16783, that their childrens naivity is being abused and ,7
16784," decide in their favour   

parents should be aware of those dangers and tactics marketing managers use ",2
16785, they can protect their children until theyre able to make an opinion for themselves,12
16786, young children could get irrealistic views of the world if they watch advertisements in tv ,14
16787, like the one in which a person tries to stick their thongue into a ventilator just because hes bored if a children would watch this it might would ,6
16788," try it and this could have a bad end
for us the television advertising is about unimportant things and just boring but no one really knows how it affects children the stuff they see in tv could be really important for them and if they see those things it could affect their thinking
in general the children are easily going to believe what is said in those advertisements because they cant make a diffrence between what is real and what is unreal and just acted for the advertisement because every child is kind of naiv
it could be that they react totally excited about a product theyve seen in an advertisement which isnt as good as they thought it would be ",14
16789," be extremely disgusted and sad
television advertising tries to makes us buy things we see in there ",10
16790, it isnt good for children ,4
16791," if they are in such a low age to see all those things they could own in an advertisement because they going to want them as soon as possible in my opinion we should concentrate on the things we have and learn the children to be happy about those things and not get them to want everything they see in those advertisements
im against television advertising toward young children because it could affect their thinking",14
16792,what i have to say ,18
16793," is that it heavily matters on the way and type of advertisement as soon as a kid turns on the television the are loads of different influences that flow into the childs subconciousness without even knowing it
there is a clear difference between toy advertisement of the newest lego or barbie product and ",14
16794, advertisement for guns and weapons a difficult question to this statement appears can the children make out the difference between these two advertisements from my ,16
16795, of view a child cannot handle these influences on one ,7
16796, because it is too young to understand it anyway and ,3
16797," because it cannot even buy it so how should a kid which is only  years old react to its environmental demands
the most difficult part of this statement is that the children are getting influenced and they cannot understand it if i was a child how would i handle this would i just go to a shop ",2
16798," watching television and buy the latest computer i guess the answer to this sarcastic question is obvious 
but ",1
16799, the question arises why do they ,3
16800, make this advertisement if they do not get new clients foe me it is clear that the easiest way of going onto a childs mind is by influencing their subconciousness when they see advertisement ,0
16801," they do not react to it it clearly changes their way of thinking over a long period 
now back to the question should it be forbidden to show children aged  advertisement
",16
16802," it should not there shall be programs which are only for children where the advertisement is made for childrens eyes and ears with that a kid can stay a kid and is not forced to see things which it cant handle
it would be easier ",13
16803, to just forbid all the advertisement directed to kids but what if their parents watch television they will sit ,13
16804, see it so there is no perfect ,18
16805," for this discussion but stricter regulations can help to ensure the childs mind
at the end i have to say that ",12
16806, i was a child i ,18
16807, you watch the children programs there are no heavy advertisements in my opinion it is already handled quite well ,14
16808, there is no need for a big change,19
16809,advertising is a must nowadays everyone does it even the smallest shop if they want to have costumers on tv adults and teenager get annoyed ,11
16810, their favorite film is ruined by a tv comecial but one agegroup does not get annoyed by itkids kids are easy to be manipulated and thats exactly how many companies earn their money whenever a kids sees an add for a specific toy they want it usually many of them cry and beg their parents to buy them what they have seen  we one would analyse those tv avertisment  on could see how many steoreotypes are in those comercials kids from this generation grow up with the thought of being and buying the things that girls or boys their age should be or buy televison advertising towards kids between the age of  are ,2
16811, good and bad on the one ,18
16812, kids and parents can learn about new toys that come out this is really helpful for the parents,20
16813, their kids birthday in soon and they dont know what to get them some of the new produced toys are cool and really handy on the other ,20
16814, kids get manipulated by the stereotypes the companys often create comercial that would capture the kids heart girls get pink barbies and boy get cars with a machine gun on top the kids ,2
16815, start to want things that are usually for their own sex girls only want barbies and boys want cars because of those comercials they see those kid actors on the tv who should represent the typical gril or boys with their typical toys for example my younger sister who is know 4 loves cars and ,20
16816, has some dols in school some kids say that she is not acting like she should  as a girl because he likes cars all those kis start to judge at a young age because ,24
16817, their show end the add starts without them knowing parents ,9
16818," suffer from those advertisment because they realize late that their kids were raised by stereotypes 
to sum it all up ",2
16819, that television adversting should not be banned for kids aged  if the companies start to use adverstinsment without stereotypes girls and boys could play with car if only they would let them that would help the world to stop stereotyping each other and me us more accepting ,13
16820,the media nowadays has huge power in almost every household there is a television a smartphone a tablet and a computer we are surrounded by these technologies and have contact with them every day of course companies are going to take ,10
16821," and try to sell us their product by advertising it as much as possible especially the television advertisment has a big impact because there are a lot of advertisment breaks since many young children aged  are watching tv and in these young years believe everything they are told companies will try to influence them as much as possible and direct the advertisment towards them therefore the question comes up wether to allow television advertising  or ban it there are reasons for and against the ban

firstly children aged  are easy victims ",14
16822, it comes to believing what they are told they believe everything they are told because they do not have life experience and ,3
16823," do not know that they could be lied to since they do not have enough experience to think about wether something is right or wrong they should not be exposed to television advertising

secondly the uncouncious is taking up a lot of information without us knowing it children that are watching tv ",14
16824, take up all the information they are told or they see by the advertisment in their uncouncious system and are influenced later on by it television advertising directet to these young children schould be baned ,14
16825,"

thirdly the companies have a right to sell their product therefore they should be allowed to sell it to whoever they want every person should decide for themselves wether to buy teh product or not that is a reason to allow television advertising ",15
16826," toward young children

all in all there are more reasons against it in my opinion it should be baned young children should be protected ",12
16827, they can not protect themselves ,19
16828,television advertising is a mighty  of companies they use it to gain the attention from customers and to raise needs in them the didnt knew they had ,10
16829," pretty much every company uses them 

young children can be manipulatet really good and ",2
16830, this statement is grounded in this ,21
16831," that young children can be manipulatet really good but that older people can be manipulatet really good als well but they dont want to see it 
for example
a young boy sees an advertise on television and likes what he sees he goes to his parents and sais them that he wants to have this
a mature man sees an advertise on television and likes what he sees he doesnt go to his parent but he keeps this thing in mind and later ",7
16832," he walks through the store he tends to buy it

a young child doesent has the money to buy stuff so it can only go to his parents and ask them for what it wants
in my opinion parents have the responsibility to look for their child and to decide wether something is good for it or not so it lays in their responsibility to be able to say no

",9
16833, it should be allowed like every edvertise for other ages is allowed if it would be banned ,13
16834, all the others should be banned ,19
16835,    from the passed century one of the most used inventions in western societies and elswhere must be the tv this picturefeeding box has gained a cultural status to the ,10
16836, that almost every household owns at least one what started mute and with black and white images evolved ,10
16837," a long time into full hd flatscreen television but something that didnt take an equally long time to settle itself among the standard program were avertisements the question now is wether or not such ads are appropriatly viewed by the younger generation of tvwatchers

    television can turn out to be useful for unexperienced parents because ",10
16838, such parents have trouble to find a timetable that includes watching the baby seven days a week ,9
16839," as enjoying their time off and doing their work they put the child in front of some children show the child will most likely stay there and the parents can enjoy some time off should tv get forbidden for children of the  this cant be done
furthermore the people behind the ads can too easily make use of these children being ",14
16840," young and naive they can take a certain toy and make it seem extremely fun for the targeted audience and suddenly the child knows what it wants for christmas eastern its birthday and whatever else
watching tv ",20
16841," bad for the development of an every childs brain that alone could be a reason to forbid tv at all

    and like that the answer is met such a young audience is way too young to be set out to manipulative advertising that wants their parents money and ",14
16842, children that young shouldnt watch tv,17
16843, its necessary to look at them without a doubt its not good ,19
16844, people watch tv too often ,17
16845, that they are every minute in front of the screen its necessary to controll the amount of time you spend to watch television children aged  cant really regulate the time ,17
16846, that they could spend a lot of time in just staring into the screen to watch cartoons they could become a very bad televison habit ,17
16847, they are older they cant get away of watching tv the worst case scenario is that the human dont even leave the living room and dont really care about the own health in the other ,1
16848, of view its important to watch television to learn about the technology we are in the 21 century ,17
16849, technology is a huge part of our life a tv is nowadays a basic thing in a house or an apartment we have to deal with these things because its ussual today the earlier we learn about these things the better we can handle these kinds of stuff ,10
16850, we are older there are many kids series whre you can interact with the cartoon caracter to learn the numbers ,6
16851, they can learn a whole bunch of stuff ,8
16852, watching a listening to these programms in my opinion it television advertising  should be allowed because ,15
16853, its important to get in contact with the technology in the earlier years like i said there are many good learning series for kids but the time should be regulated ,6
16854, the children dont watch tv too much ,1
16855, about a half a hour a day shold be ok,18
16856,young people are in a stadium where they are growing all the parts of their body is growing if the child looks television in his ,6
16857, tree years that has a negative effect for his growing his eyes etc if the child does not look television in his ,17
16858, years everything is good there is a reason why a lot of people arent ,19
16859, that children can watch television ,17
16860," they are a baby 
in the ",24
16861, years the child should think and imagine in his own why and shouldnt look television if the child looks television he does not have to think thinking on his own way is a good exercise if the child looks television he loses important time in this time he could play with other babys which is more important than watching television ,17
16862, i have a baby my baby isn not allowed to watch television in his ,17
16863," tree years of his life in this time he should look on pictures of a book or should play with soft balls or something like that 

in conclusion i am ",8
16864, that television advertising  should not be allowed,15
16865,to ban all television advertising directed to children this age you would have to prove that such advertisement harms them otherwise i dont see a problem why it shouldnt be allowed children that age are already able to watch television and understand what is being shown there are many shows on tv s children aged  of course advertisement is a bit different than kids shows but the idea is ,13
16866, the advertisements look just like or are even about tv shows for young children although the children cannot purchase the products shown in the commercials themselves they can ask their parents if they are allowed to have it  many may argue that airing advertisement for kids can be annoying for parents and spoil the children but i dont see how this does any longterm damage to the children the commercials should be reviewed by experts ,16
16867, it is made sure that they are acceptable for children as long as the advertisements do not promote bad things ,16
16868, violence i dont see a problem with them being shown on tv they could even promote toys with learning effects ,6
16869, television advertisement should be allowed ,15
16870," young and juvenile kids would understand the television advertising they are too young to know what they want and they would not realise that people just want to sell things but they do not know what is important in life they have no idea that they will not need the things the may want now in the future so tv advertising would catch them
kids do have too many things and plays anyway they do not need hundrets of plays they can not use everything ",0
16871, parents and friends should not waste ,9
16872," much money on toys just because they can not tell their kids that the things they have seen in television are not necessairy 
in addition to that kids should not watch ",2
16873, much television in that age they ,17
16874," much money to buy things with in that age the kids should be playing on the street with other children 
the parents who are going to buy the stuff they have to buy should see the advertising and only them childs are not mature and wise enough to decide what they really need they may react angry ",2
16875," they do not get what they want this problem could be solved if they were not seeing the television advertising 
",3
16876,get away from the television sarah its not s children aged 4 thomas sentences parents often use whilst their children watch television but ,17
16877, with the brightened up technologies nowadays there are a lot of parents who teach their kids the controvers sentences like watch and learn or even get yourself infront of the television and be quiet for at least an hour in the following main part ,17
16878," discuss this theme a bit 

watching television is a much more complex theme nowadays than hardly ever expected whilst watching television we are able to receive informations we are even able to learn something ",6
16879, cooking baking and much more there are even kidsshows ,1
16880, for teaching some lifeskills rules or how to draw an elephant ,8
16881, whatever it is it is sometimes useful but if parents let their children on their own their able to switch the channel and watch a crime scene or whatever so ,6
16882, its important that parents watch ,6
16883, depends on the duration eyes of children are ,24
16884, learning and could get injured so parents should set up a timelimit per day but ,8
16885," its everyones own choice
in my own opinion children aged newborn to five shouldnt watch televison at all there are ",17
16886, many more intelligent activities to get done in the ,8
16887, five living years children are able to learn much faster and much more intensive ,8
16888, we should teach them to speak on our own and not by television in our own words and technics we should show them as many animals as possible ,8
16889," in a zoo we should show them our beautiful nature and fresh air its all much more important than showing them how to turn on a tv 

in conclusion everybody has to find their own balance between their kind of teaching their kids and ",8
16890,nowadays many children like to spend their time in front of a television or like to watch something with their parents its normal that ,17
16891, you are watching a show or a movie an advertising shows up there are many ,11

but are advertisings in the television bad for young children should our country permitts television advertising towards young children lets explore the pro and cons

first of all lets take a look at the ",14
16893," television advertising is a good way to show the children something new so the children can see new things and are able to learn something new 
 
on the other ",14
16894, when a advertising shows up its mostly an advertising of toys and dolls and other stuff children likes the children are young and really likes to play with toys and ,0

16896," the have the urge to get this toy because parents like to make their children happy they buy them new stuff 

however ",20
16897, children shouldnt generally spend their time in front of a television the advertising is ,14
16898, bad because it influences the children and ,4
16899," the have the urge to get some new toys in a way it manipulates the children and grows the desire to have some new stuffs which not all parents can afford 
",20
16900,children in this age do like watching tv but they dont know if its good or not and that depends on the programm they watch there are huge differences between the series i wouldnt watch horrorfilms with a five years old child but ,6
16901, they can and should watch programms like sandmann or in the age of five or older they can watch series which teach you something but thats nothing for a two years old child the most impotrant decision the parents have to make is the timeperiod in which their children are allowed to watch tv a young human being shouldnt watch tv for a long time in a row its better for them to watch several times a day but always just for an half an hour or less it ,17
16902, depends on what the children do ,9
16903, they are not watching tv if they are outside playing its more normal that they are allowed to watch tv because they did enough sports and they had fresh air but if they are at home during the hole day to play video games or something like this ,1
16904, its not healthy for them maybe the parents dont realise it ,4
16905, their child is that young but ,9
16906, that it can effect the life of a child an other problem is that the children can relax ,4
16907, they are watching tv they didnt do enough sport during the day and ,1
16908," they arent tired at night so they can not sleep that well and that long 
my opinion is that children can watch tv but it has to be a programm for children and it needs to be during a realistic timeperiod and ",17
16909, is that every child needs to go outside to play to have a healthy life the parents need to have keep the controle over the tv and the programm which their child is watching ,17
16910,"should television advertising directed  be forbidden

in this time children of young ages already watch television mostly because the parents want to have a quiet minute or the kids just cry or scream to get what they want when they are watching tv often nobody is supervising them ",14
16911, they get in contact with everything which is showed days later they maybe want their mom to buy this delicious chocolate snack or the talking doll which the advertising showed in the best possible way to impress children there are even psychologist which are looking for this best way children in this young ages are very naive they dont really care about the prize the healthiness or the usefullness if the other child in the advertising has fun with it or if it says that the chocolate snack is very yummy they spontaneously feel the need for it as a ,0
16912, of that they are the best audience to merchandise something but is that fair the people should be able to do their own decision about buying something or not but children arent really able to do that on the other ,2
16913, you could say that the parents do the finishing decision ,9
16914, the children are praying to get it the whole day additionally they are responsible of their children watching television if they let them they have to be aware of what is showed and they have to handle the ,17
16915,"

in my opinion it wouldnt be correct to forbid to show such advertising advertising is ",15
16916, way for the industry to sell their products if they are clever enough to find the best way to sell as many products as possible they should have success when parents decide to let their children watch television they ,10
16917, decide to let them see the advertising and if that influences their childrens wishes they have to be consequent enough to not buy it if they dont want to,2
16918,"should television advertising toward young children age  not be allowed

children in the age  are easy to influence especially through such strong media as the television kids at this stage want every object the tv ads show them because it is set in scene perfectly for the demands of such young humans this is because the kids associate the toy with the show they are watching ",14
16919, bob the builder you gotta have this toy that always comes ,20
16920, the new episode therefore many people think tv advertising  for kids should be forbidden i certainly understand this view but i ,13
16921, think that it would infringe the capitalism and the free market if tv ads towards young people were forbidden nice conditional there isnt it we have to ask ourselves whether we want to save the children from being easily steered by big companies who just want to make as much profit as possible or if we want them to make the profit because maybe we can directly or indirectly profit ourselves maybe the father of a child who wants the new toy from the tv ad works for an advertisement company and just because the tv spot runs everyday he can make his boy happy and buy this cool new toy,13

in my opinion television advertising  should be allowed the ",14

in addition ",10
16936," young children are often bored about advertisings i know from my childhood that i was very bored about television advertising even it was about chocolate or barbie dolls which i really liked so children dont even look precisely at the advertisement
also young children learn how to react to advertisements advertisements are not just unuseful they show us new things and learn us to be critic with everything in the world

in conclusion television advertising  should be allowed beacause it doesnt really make a difference if it were not be allowed in the world there are lot of advertisings and they arent really interested in it
but ",14
16937, it isnt that easy for a child to learn to be critic with the world ,7

16939,"television advertising wich is s young children should not be allowed 

television advertising is actually a very smart thing they are made in a very smart way to make you buy things even tought you probably do not need them especially young children are very naive one can manipulate them very easily young children do not know anything about smart shopping about what to buy and what to not buy when a child sees a toy in a televisions advertising it does not think twice the child does not make any toughts about the use or the quality of the toy a young child probably does not even understand words like quality and use television advertising has no other use than making people buy things it does not show one anything usefull television advertising is using young childrens naivity the people who make these television advertisings know ecsactly that young children would want to buy anything they see on television they know that as soon as a child wants something it is going to annoy their parents till it gets what it wants and the parents kind of do not have another choice than to buy their children what they want so moraly it is not okey to use the naivity of a young child and most improtantly television advertising is a huge way of propaganda and ",14
16940," a huge waste of time people and young children are forced into watching television advertising because the television advertising always shows up in the middle of a movie or tv show

personally ",10
16941, television advertising towarts little children should not be allowed because it is not fair or right to manipulate and trick them into buying things ,13
16942," influences children at a way to young age
a good example to show this are gender and body images seeing all these beautiful people in commercials can tell children a complete wrong opinion on how to see themselves ",14
16943," others
children cant see the difference between real life and television they are easy targets for marketing companies because of their not knowing what is real and what isnt marketing companies have made this to their use with influencing young children to make them want something or to let them have their opinion about certain things that they will want to have or are tellingin the future
for example a child doesnt care much about its body and how it looks put as soon as children are in puberty they start questioning if theyre pretty or tall or skinny enough because the have had all these images on the televisionthis can lead into depression or mental diseases like anorexia or bulimia

you could say ",14
16944, that children are anyway not supposed to watch television at a young age but if their is a lone mom with a fulltime job there isnt always timeto entertain your children and ,17
16945," at a lot of households tvs are on the daily routine 

it is ",10
16946, that children are represented very badly in tv commercials in gender ,13
16947, girls always wear pink and red dresses and have bows in their hair and are supposed to put on make up on a barbies face boys ,18
16948, are wearing blue and playing with playmobil dragons and knights and have their little racing cars children should be able to play with the toys the like and not with the ones for their gender but most of the time the children just get their toys from their parents which have been influenced by television and media ,20
16949, there is not much you can do exept trying to explain to your child how the real world is working and telling them to listen to themselves and not to anything from the black screen,1
16950, its correct or even acceptable of medias trying to influent the mind of such young children ,7
16951," they cant understand whats happening on tv and why theyre being showed those toys or the other stuff that seems to be really awesome to them the only thing they know now is just that they really want to own what they saw on tv and if their parents wont buy them what they want they will probably get sad about it this could possibly lead to a dissorted way of their consumebehaviour later in their lifes so it would be the right thing to stop allowing television advertising  woulnt it

on the other ",14
16952, it comes down to be the parents responsibility to look ,12
16953, dont think its alright that such young minds who can get influented ,12
16954, easily should spend their time in front of the television ,1
16955, they should be playing outside or with their friends and family furthermore watching tv this early can easily lead to an addiction towards tvs and smartphones and gadgets like that ,1
16956, theyre a little bit older ,19
16957, those are things that comforted them ever ,19
16958," they were little

in conclusion ",19
16959, that television advertising toward children should be forbidden or even illegal i reckon that children this age shoulnt even be watching television because if the parents wont allow their kids to spend ,13
16960, much time watching tv anymore there wont be anyone left watching all those commercials,10
16961,"television adertising is a normal thing in our society but should it be towards young children the opinions are different if it should be allowed or not
why should you have advertising for anyone else than for these kids and why exactly during this age if the product is for this age you have to advertise it in this group of children they have to see it and not the children in other ages because they maybe cant relay to that anymore 
critics say that the parents should see the advertise because they are the ones who have to by the stuff so there isnt the need for the adcvertising because the kids are to young to by susch things if the children see the product ",14
16962," a teddybear they always go to their parents and ask for it maybe it could stress them and it is nerving lastly the kids during this age should not sit in front of the tv that much it is not good for them they should go out and see the world
",20
16963, as a mother of a child i would be against television advertsising but as a person who tries to sell things for the children in this age i can understand that it is important and it should be allowed,14
16964,"television advertising  is a controvers topic as it is proved that young children are more capable of learning new stuff quickly they take every new information or advert like if they were a sponge because of this ability it is very easy for television advertisers to convince young children towards getting their new toy or something else furthermore a lot of parents dont have the control on the time their child is sitting in front of the television as letting them watch tv is an easy way of keeping their child quiet and children just stay watching tv if they dont get interrupted thanks to this it is very easy to influence the children threw an advertisemt
but how should young children be informed on new toys films or new outdoor activities television advertisements have become very popular in recent years ",14
16965, the long time of people spend watching television and the abilities of the television beeing pictures with sound if young children wont be informed by new stuff over the television threw where ,17
16966," they mostly dont own a smartphone and are able to check on new releases immediately television advertisements for young children is in that sense a superb way of them getting new informations
in my opinion it depends on what is advertised for if it is just a new toy a outdoor activity or even a new way of expanding their horizon advertised for i believe it can be a outstanding way of advertising but as soon as the advertisement is manipulating the child in the slightest as maybe an advertisement towards a political party or as i like to call it adult stuff television advertisements arent helpful for young children and should be forbidden
as i mentioned in the ",14

16972," helps not having to explain to the children what a certain thing does because they have already seen the advertisement and know what the toy or whatever was advertised can do

personally i believe that television advertising should be allowed ",14
16973, it is another way the children learn that they cannot have everything they want plus they learn to ignore the unuseful things in life like ,8
16974,"television advertising is growing nearly every day a new serie come up and sometimes they are s young children aged  this leads us to the question of the essay should television advertising towards young children be allowed
to answer the question ",14
16975, use a new question are the children aible to realize that the television advertising is directed to them ,16
16976, in the age of two to three the children would not get this they are too young to realize that this kind of advertising is directed to them i mean i do not remember that i watched tv ,2
16977, i was three years old but i remember that in the age of four i watched teletabies so ,6
16978," we can say that the children till the age of three do not realize that tv advertising is directed to them so for this age you do not have to ban television advertising
but for the age from four to five it is diffrent there ",14
16979, you have to ban it because in this age they make big developpments and tv is not helpfull and if the television advertising is s them they will want to watch tv again and again for example there is this tv serie sandmã¤nnchen i watched it sometimes but i remeber that some of my friends watched it nearly every time they have to watch it to be aible to go to bed and this ,15
16980," does not help in your developpment right so in the age from to five a ban makes sense
finally ",12
16981, remark that watching tv in this age  can cause brain damages because the sound and the picture are not ,17
16982, and for the kids who have to learn the language ,8
16983, the sound and the moving of the lips is ,18
16984, otherwise they can not learn the language as good so ,8
16985," in generally that it should not be allowed to direct tv advertising towards young children
in conclusion ",13
16986," that children at the age from two to three are not aible to realize that the advertising is s them but the children in the age from 4 to 5 get this and it eeffects
",16
16987," television advertising should not be allowed is that the children learn diffrent words when the young children watch tv they make something what support the brain and they learn diffrent things about the world and whats  gat the moment
but in contract ",14
16988, the young children watch tv they learn words like diffrent cars nivea or others this words dont support the childrens communication because in one way they learn words which arent necessary in this age and in an other way they learn an other language  for example the swiss childrens are watching tv in an other language and ,8
16989, they dont learn swissgerman and ,19
16990, the children speak a language that isnt only one language but a mix of maybe two ore tree in case of this they say some words german and some words swiss german in an other view this young children should go outside in spite of watching television because in the nature they learn more than in front of tv a ,8
16991, is that children  dont understand what the peopel in de advertise say maybe the children learn words and things which isnt useful or maybe things and words that are not allowed in our world an ,2
16992, thing is that this children could make something with other childrens witch has the same age like them and ,8
16993, the same niveau this would more support the growth of their life in case of watching movies and advertises ,24
16994, that television advertising should be allowed because this young humans dont unterstand all this things and ,13
16995, that in this time in there they watch tv they could make better things like going outside or make somethings whit other childrens ,8
16996,"should televosion advertising be forbidden for young children

every day we see television and we have fun would it  we learn with tv

a reason why televison advertising should be forbidden toward children is that children should have a good relationship to their teacher

the most important reason why advertising should be allowed toward children is that they like watch tv ",14
16997,"this little text is about my opinion about the statement that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

i totally ",15
16998, with this statement because children at a very young age dont know what is good or bad they cannot decide what is better for them or worse for them even the law says that children under the age of 8 years cannot be punished from doing an illegal action because they are to young to judge the adverts show funny or happy thing in connection with the product in the advert so children think that this product is good and they want to have it however ,2
16999, that this will never happend because you cannot control what young children see in the internet children can search and find what there want because there are no age restrication that is a big problem and a reason why television advertising s young children will never be banned even on the streets and big cities are filled with adverts not all are s young children ,13
17000," the adverst for adults can influence young children

all in all i demand the government to not allow television advertising s young childern because of the reason that childer at a very young age dont have a judgment about things being good or bad",13
17001,"so today we have commercials about everything for everybody but is it correct to make commercials for young childrens
i mean it isnt allowed to make commercials about ciggarettes and tabaco bacause of the children ",16
17002," why should we make commercials only for children
",16
17003," the whole televisioncommercial industry are doing a litle bit of propoganda for there products or tv shows wich penetrade your way of thinking about things but young chidrens arent very sensitiv about such things
but how often are commercials directed to such young childrens
i mean every commerical on channels like nickelodeon or super rtl are directed to children and whats the problem about am lego commercial
maybe they need to know wich playmobil theyre going to wish for their birthday 
clearly they could go to store but parents woud never let them go alone and maybe dont have time for such things
i ",14
17004," cant imagine a scenario wich such commercials could harm or influence a child
in my ",14
17005," of view it isnt the young children no its the children between 1013 years because they start to think and refelct thing they see
they havent enough education to analsye things 
so i dont have ",7
17006," why they should prohbit avertising 


",21
17007,more and more young children are sitting in front of the television they are looking their favorite serie or film ,17
17008, 10 minutes of promotions starts a little child with his mother in a supermarket he sees a big green toy mother i want this toy and what a surprise the toy is sale just 9999 but just for a week so the effect for the young children in front of the television who ,20
17009," likes the toy is that he quickly will have this toy too

first of all in the age  children are very effected from the sociality if they are advertising directed from the televison they start believing what they say when the television shows that we all have super power and we all can fly we just need to put out theit arms they do it and ",20
17010," fall down it should be the work of the parent how they grow up their child and not from the television

secondly the television has a big influence on youn children when a child sees something that he likes he really want it that could be a big problem for they parents maybe they havent ",17
17011, much money to buy every week new stuff for their children but ,9
17012," children dont get what they want they are sad and agry

thirdly in this age children shouldnt be advertising directes from the television they are in age where they should go out to learn play with other kids this experiences are more important than stuff from the television they should make their experiences by them selves and not teached by the televison

for these reasons im ",17
17013, that television advertising  should not be allowe,15
17014,electronic rules the world more and more people are connected to electronic stuff ,23
17015," the mobile phone and television and cant live without it anymore by now children aged  are on the television every day a couple of hours but should we really allow television advertising toward young children aged  


there are a couple of reasons why this shouldnt be allowed for example it is proofed that through too much television people can get dumber because they forget to do important things like reading or learning and thi is a problem 
the most important ",14
17016, is tht these yong children dont need this ,12
17017, childhood is a time where you go out with friend and have fun and play ball or something else not about staying at home all day long watching television childhood is an awesome time ,8
17018," dont take this away from your kids

on the other ",9
17019, television can improof your brain in a good way through television kids have more ideas how to do something and it can ,17
17020, improve their knowledge depending on what they are watching galileo ,8
17021," always shows very good stuff and you can really learn from this


my personal opinion its that kids that age should be allowed to watch television but not more than half n hour per day maybe one hour on the weekend ",6
17022, it is important that those kids need to learn ,8
17023, how to grow up without this stuff electronic stuff will come into their lifes early enough ,24
17024, let them enjoy their chilhood without electronic stuff ,1
17025, the social communication gets lost with the television ,10
17026, it is very important for a children to play outside or searching friends you cant do this ,24
17027," watching television  it could be very stressful for the parents to seperate the childrens from the television 
",1
17028, a children gets influenced very easely so it is very problematic ,7
17029," the children gets influenced by the television
",17
17030," that to much television are damaging the eyes of the childrens so if televesion advertisising  did not exist less childrens would have problems with there eyes


so ",17
17031," that it should not be allowed to advertisise television  because of the bad influence it can have on the children the problems of the eyes that can produced by watching to much television 

",13
17032,"television for young children

in this essay ",17
17033, explain some reasons why young children should not be allowed to watch television an at the end my ,17
17034," opinion to this important subject


nowadays a lot of children aged  often watch a film with their family in their young life and waste a lot of time with movies or series they can ",6
17035, go out and play with their friends or do something else but not watching television it is not good for the brain generally the concentration will not be there in the school too this can lead that young children can not get good marks ,17
17036," their future will be in danger a very worse time is coming to them antother reason is that this kids do not have the motivation to do their homeworks make new friendships or even help their mother to do the household chores 

however i find that children should not be allowed to watch television in their young life although i have ",17
17037, wasted a lot of time ,18
17038," i was young my parents did not take care of me and thought that the television was good for children they let me always to do my own thing what was definitely a fault i learned for my life that the television is abad idea for young children and i would never to the same thing to my kids in future i want that my kids should have good marks and study for themselves and not ruin their life with television 









",17
17039,nowadays television has become to a need of todays society it is used for entertaining for information and ,10
17040," for advertising television advertising is directed more and more toward young children but should it be allowed to direct television advertising toward such young children

first of all children in that age do not know ",13
17041," what they really want and need they want all of this stuff they see in advertising this is all a strategedy of the companies to force the parents to buy their children what they think they want they use the children to gain a lot more money this could be seen as unmoral
on the other ",2
17042, today it is all just about buisiness where would we be without it it ,23
17043,"essay

in this essay i write about television advertising  ",10
17044," explain some pros and cons to the statement which was given us above

in my opinion there is nothing wrong ",21
17045," they want to watch their serie in the evening to slow down it is a good oppertunity to show them how to come along with the new medias nowadays watching television is maybe the most normal thing it is copmarable with other things which where unacceptable for children a few years ago but now have got a normal thing
but i am glad that i could not watch tv al the time ",17
17046," children learn more in the real world and it is important for children to play a lot an have friends with whom they can have adventures also watching television in asbolutely not necessairy especially not for children aged  they have to learn that the life is not about tv stars and shows but more about friends and living its own life if they are to often confronted with such things they can get aggressive and unsociable 
so my own children will have a fix short time ",17
17047," they are allowed to watch what is good for them

in conclusion watching television has ",17
17048, pros and cons in my opinion it is more about the question how long and what they are allowed to watch,12
17049,nowadays you find a tv in almost every living room and often ,10
17050, in the bedroom instead of going outside and playing with friends they ,1
17051," sit inside infront of the tv and watch some stupid series or play a game this makes it very easy for concerns selling toys to directly place their adverts in the childrens head i guess almost every parent was at least once confronted with the problem that the child wanted to have a certain toy and it didnt get it but is that the fault of the concerns or are te parents itself to blame for this humancaused problem
it is proofed by many studies that tv adverts influence and this is ",2
17052, a problem of the adults also children are influenced by tv adverts and this causes a new level of social inequality i mean if your child goes out with friends and this friend has the toy every child always sees in the tv it becomes kind of the must have for children and if you as a parent dont buy this toy the child only knows because of tv adverts in the worts case the child will get bullied just because it doesnt have this toy and this for from my ,14
17053," of view a very big problem
but ",21
17054, can you really say that the concerns are to blame for this isnt this problem caused by the parents and that they never have time to play with their children its easy for them to sit the child in front of the tv so ,17
17055, you start judgeing others for their work you should wonder why it even got this far if the parents would go outside with their children and play with them they wouldnt watch tv ,12
17056," partially the problem is solved
another ",18
17057," bring up is that nowadays its the only efficient method to bring toys to the children how else should the concerns show their new products if the children are always inside and only watching tv
if you really think about it you cant say that only the parents are to blame ",2
17058," nor can you say that only the concerns are to blame its like the cicle of the devil
as far as i can say you should not forbid tv advertising toward young children for me the best ",13
17059, would be if you reduce this kind of adverst and instead start working with the parents to show them that it is important to play with their children,12
17060,towadays we have become used to seeing advertisements everywhere ,11
17061," on television and as adults we are aware of their abilities to seduct one but what about children considering their limited comprehesion of the objective of advertisments should television advertising  be allowed

first and foremost a child does not have the ability to understand that advertising is just a means to sell a product and can ",14
17062, be strongly influenced by advertisements advertisments usually instill the notion that one cannot be content without a certain product ,11
17063," resulting in the child beig unhappy if it does not obtain it

another ",9
17064," agaist television advertising is that children are being conditioned to aquiring a consumtionists life style where having a few toys is not enough and children keep wanting more of what they already have it is this mind set that is destroying our environment and is being supported by advertisments s children

moreover recent studies have shown that the average child watches one hour of television a day which prooves that ",14
17065," advertisements on television can have a huge negative impact on our offspring

all in all television advertisments  children can influence them strongly considering that they are easy to manipulate at such a young age advertisments can lead to a childs unhappiness and have a negetive impact on our environment 
",14
17066,yesterday my parents and me metted  a friend  from us in a cafe  so we began to speak the person said it should not be allowed to give the young children ,12
17067, much of television advertising  my mother tought different and ,10
17068," they began to discuss should television advertising  be allowed or not

there is always advertising in tv there is some for old people and theres some for young people the guy who wants to sell the things they produced realised that children are easy to manipuate so the children wants to have these things there are many people who think that this is bad for the children but the children are growing up and they have always advertise in tv so if the children begin wth it young they have later no problems because they know how to life with it
on the other ",13
17069," could children get manipulated by this and this could be bad for the mental growing of them but if the parents look for their children and do not let them just in front of tv this should not be a problemthe children could get real damage from this and get many sicknesses ot this 

by the time i was in his age i looked as good as never tv ",17
17070, the parents should play with theyr kids or give them real things to play with it and do not let them sit in front of tv so the childs have not a advertising problems then these children who have this problems would have other mental problems because theiy parents so the key are the parents,24
17071,the modern television the gateway to all our daily information that we use almost everyday wether it is a drama movie new or documenteries we can all ,10
17072," on the television can open our eyes to new horizons in spite of that should we allow our young children exposed to televion advertising 

in my opinion young children should not be exposed to television advertising as if mind corrupt their innocent minds with inapporiate content the reason is that certain televiosn advertisiments might display inapproiate messages ",14
17073, exploiting the bodys of women and dangerous acts that the children might follow for example children might saw an advertisement showing men doing rock climbing ,16
17074," prompting him or her to immitate their actions and ultimately hurting themselves

secondly children watching too much television and television advertisment might get violent ",7
17075," they grow up as some television commercials depict violence as something cool and manly to childrens they might end up growing up with that mind sets and grow up becoming a bully in school as they think that the act of bullying is the sign of manliness and cool and others might think of the same way

thirdly young children should engage more in physical activities as play with their friends as that helps the childern to learn how to socialize with others better also ",7
17076," childern constantly sitting indoors watching televion their health might degrade and might lead to obesity during a young age and might unable to sociallize with others in school well

furthermore ",17
17077, more television commercials showing taking drugs or smoking associated with manliness and it is the mainstream of things childern might end up taking drugs to let other kids know that they are the cool kids in school this can lead to disatrous ,2
17078, as they might lead to increase of social problems ,4
17079, drug addicts further more they ,19
17080," might end up with robbery as they cannot afford the drugs because they are too expensive for them to afford

next children who grow up watching television and commercials might have worse eye sights ",9
17081, those who do not grow up with television this is because long exposure to the light emited by the screen of the television can end up damaging the delicate nerve cells in young childerns eyes and they are forced to wear glasses at a young age ,17
17082," this problem is usually found at the elderly age

last but not least watching too much television might end up with addiction certain television shows are shown ",17
17083, a series of cartoons that will cause the children to want more and in turn causing them to be addicted to television and will stop at nothing ,6
17084," watch thier favourite shows for example a young childern might start to cry and whine because they are not allow to watch their favourite show and will not stop until they get to see them

in conclusion as convinient as it is to just let children watch televion everyday ",17
17085, it is better to let children to go out and enjoy the sunshine and play with others i find it better that to let children be themselves and let them explore the world without the use of televion until they are able to differenciate what is right and what is wrong by themselves ,17
17086, that the wrong message is not imprinted into their innocent minds,7
17087,every time you switch on the television there is advertise but it does ,10
17088, make adults buy things it does ,9
17089," influence young children is it fair to bring in this television advertising 

on every chanel on the television companies are making advertise to influence the buying habits of people but ",14
17090, you have to make a difference between adults and children adults often can control themselves ,7
17091, that they know how to spend moneybut ,3
17092, childrem aged  see these toys on the television they mostly want it ,20
17093, advertise is like poison to people ,11
17094, to children but to all people when you watch television and you see a new perfume or the new summercollection of a brand it makes you think about something you may have never thought about if you have not seen it on television but somehow you can ,10
17095," learn to deal with this poison or you can be poisoned that is something you and your parents decide
but i ",18
17096, think that the problem is the way advertise is made is wrong often the actors in the advertise are smiling and they seem to be pretty happy having the product so young children automatically think that this thing has to make them even happier then they make their parents buy them stuff which in some weeks is lying in the back corner and the chilren have only touches it once spoiled children ,2
17097, do not learn how to be creative ,18
17098," how children deal with the advertise has alot to do with how they grew up 

",0
17099, it should be allowed because in that way they learn how to deal with it ,12
17100, they get older so if you learn not to buy everything only because the television say ,10
17101, you generally do not have problems ,18
17102,"television plays a role in almost every childs life also does advertising it is always the parents decision to let the children get to that or not some want it and some dont even if in todays world it is difficult to protect your child from advertising and even television so what are the pros and contras about television advertising

there could be many reasons why it should not be allowed to let television advertising get to people at that young age it always depends on the
advertisment and that is the important ",14
17103, what kind of advertisment is it advertisments that reflect social media often have topics that could be problemating like sexual content violence or alcoholdrugs these are the things parents often see as dangerous for their children but ,0
17104," even a advertisment about healthy eating can influence the childs live massively in a bad way  
children at that age believe almost everything want to know a lot and ask about everything parents who dont let their children watch television just maybe dont want to confront them with the problems of todays world that early

how i already said are children at that age very neugierig they want to know more and it that case ",14
17105, advertisments but mostly television can be the right there are a lot of programms for children all day long ,1
17106," why shouldnt that be allowed they hear and watch stories cartoons leran new things and its different from reading books or listening hearing stories 

in my opinion its barely possible to protect your child from television advertising ban it or just refuse tp do it would be unnecessary because how i already said theyll get to it sooner or later but what im really glad about are television programms for children in most cases they are exactly the right thing and influence the child more positive than negative ",14
17107, with the statement beacuse young children can easely be manipulated by television advertisement for example if a young child sees an advertisement in the television about a toy can be much better manipulated as grown people because the television shows the children a world they like to be ,0
17108, barbie and if a young girl in the age of five years see that they insist that the parents buy whatever is shown in  the advertisement but i ,20
17109, think that the parents have to protect their children of advertisements but ,16
17110, the television advertising  would not be allowed ,15
17111, young children can not say what they really want one day they want atoy and the ,24
17112, day it isnt interesting any more and ,18
17113, if it wouldnt have this television advertisement wich is  they better know what they really want and dont want a new toy each day it is ,20
17114, a problem for parents because they do not know ,9
17115, their child says he want that new toy if he had seen an advertisement and think its cool to have this toy or he really will play with this toy it is ,20
17116," a problem that the adertisement shows the children a unreal world in which they want they get in ant hey think if buy this product they will be in this world

",2
17117,"there are many advertising for toys or other things  and in many cases the children want to have the advertised stuff thats because children are easier to affect and manipulate but should it be allowed
the good thing is that children can have very fun with toys and if the companies advertise their things in television they can see it another reason is that most of the children who are between  stay home all day ",14
17118, they can see the advertisment many times per day so perhaps a child who is bored wants to watch television and if he sees a toy and his parents buy it to him he is no longer bored and plays with the toy ,0
17119," watching tv so in this case it would be good to advertise toys
but ",0
17120, for parents who are really poor this isnt a good thing children want everything and if they dont get it theyll be mad and if the parents cant afford it this could really create problems un the family ,9
17121, the young child is crying everytime another contra ,18
17122, is that childrens mind isnt clear as an adults ,7
17123," so they want really everything they see in tv even the unnecessary stuff
in my opinion it should not be allowed because children are ",17
17124, easy to manipulate with tthe advertisment and for poor parents it could really cause problems and the advertisment industry knows how to manipulate people and they will do it without any problem,16
17125,generally i really from the bottom of my heart do not like any statement that wants to ban something because ,21
17126, the greatest treasure we have these days is our freedom to do or not do what ever we want and we already have enough poeple and aswell as laws that want to tell us what to do the same can be said for this statement ,21
17127," for this one 

i get that the advertisments could influence the children in a bad way and you might think that because they are ",16
17128, young they can not do anything against this influence which you are probably right about if they are alone however the ,7
17129, make is that the parents are responsible for what their children do ,12
17130, at that young of an age that way if the parents allow their kid to watch tv they should accompany them if they think there might be controversial content in whatever their child is watching if they do this they can talk about that content might it be advertismnents or just a topic in the aired programm another thing is that i did not grow up with tv all around me because i didnt feel any need to watch tv until i was probably around 810 years old of course this is not regarding movies that i watched with friends or family therefore ,17
17131, that this is the same for most kids ,8
17132, i do not have any evidence of this and ,18
17133, it is like that there are ,19
17134," exceptions 

in the end my opinion is that these advertiments should not get banned because of personal experience aswell as my opinion that everything about media and advertisment that you can learn ",15
17135, early on is a very valuable lesson for life in modern society i ,8
17136, believe that parents should get more responsible again ,12
17137, there children are in contact with modern media,6
17138,this statement is wrong because if children get confronted with the danger of advertising really early they could resist them later in life because they know that advertising tries to make you buy something another ,13
17139, against this statement is that advertising for young children helps to get out of stress ,16
17140, birthdays and christmas children get inspired from the advertising and ,20
17141, they know what they want for birthday or christmas this helps stressed parents to know their childs wisches a ,8
17142, against the statement is the ,21
17143," adults 

otherwise do children not know that an advertising tries to influence you if they see an advertising they get trapped by it also cant children resist the psychological strengh of advertisings and as the ",16
17144," children cant build their own opinion about the product because they believe everything the advertising says they cant build their opinion because they cant imagine what it means to see a product they once saw in the television 

",2
17145, that television advertising directed young children should not be allowed because they arent able to resist and they havent got the knowledge to decide whether the product is as it is shown in the advertising or it is diffrent and not as cool as they thought,13
17146,mom can i watch tv a sentence we hear very often nowadays ,17
17147," from younger children the television is something younger children grow up with its a normal thing thing the problem is that a lot of children get addicted to it

a huge problem is the addiction of children to the television they keap asking to watch tv all the time when the parents dont allow it the kids get angry so the parents dont know what to do because they dont want any stress or an annoying child they allow the television the child winns after the child watched tv it probably starts to be angry again because it wants to watch even more tv 

another ",17
17148, which speaks against tv advertising  younger children is that they often watch stuff that isnt thought for young children they see that beating the others and stuff like that can be a ,14
17149," but it isnt in the real world especially primary teachers can see  what this kind of television does to children

a thing that isnt that bad is that there are television programs which help children to learn how to read or how to write this can be helpful ",17

another ",8
17151, is that it can be relaxing for the parents ,8
17152, they can sleep a little bit longer on the weekends ,1
17153," the children are watching tv its just important that the parents have the control of what their children are watching 

",17
17154, that it would be stupid to just forbid the television for younger children of course its very important that the children dont end up watching tv all day long but ,13
17155, half an hour in the morning on the weekend is not a problem children just shouldnt watch tv ,17
17156, they go to bed they would dream very wild and wouldnt sleep that good but ,19
17157, that the tv as a learning program is a good thing,17
17158,children are probably the agegroup which can be influenced most easily from all people they are very curious about new things and eager to learn even unconciously so television advertising is a very smart tool to influence ,0
17159," the childrens behaviour and personality but is it really that smart and what impact does television advertising have on a childs daily life and the development of their childhood

in tv advertising children learn about new things they havent encountered ",14
17160, they may find out about the different habitat of animals places in other countries or even new languages this is a very easy way to teach children new ,8
17161," about the world so why should tv advertising not be allowed for little kids

on the other ",13
17162, influence children in a bad way because most tv ads are about products often toys which only want to be sold for the own profit of companies whenever children see new toys they like on tv they want it immediately because the ads are constructed in way that people would want to buy it so ,14
17163, children would want every new toy they see on tv because it looks cool but ,20
17164, their parents wont buy them every item and this will lead to a dispute between the child and parent children at that age dont understand that money doesnt grow on trees on top of that a lot of money could be saved if television advertising for children would be prohibited instead this money could be invested ,9

in conclusion ",8
17166, with the statement that tv ads for young children should not be allowed ,13

",17
17168,advertising is a controversial topic there are different opinions about what kinds of advertising should be allowed and at what ,11
17169, it should be banned for big companies there are different methods to advertise their products one of this method is the television advertising  in the following ,15
17170," for and against these kinds of advertising
a ",11
17171, for the ban of this kinds of advertising is that the goal of the advertising is to play with a childrens feelings they give them the feeling that they need something which ,16
17172," they do not need 
children are ",9
17173, not able to understand the goal of advertising like adults do from this ,0
17174, of view the advertising  is irresponsible and ,11
17175," it should not be allowed
but there are ",12
17176," for not banning this kinds of advertising even if the children want to buy a product they saw in an advertising there are the parents who decide if the child can have the product or not
for children it is ",16
17177," important to learn that they can not have everything they want to have  
in my opinion there is no reason to ban television advertising  in the end it is the  parents job to teach their children that they can not have everything they want to have this is an important lesson in life    ",14
17178,children whore now aged  do not ,24
17179, have an understanding of the world of whats going on in it and that the people who advertise their products on tv just want their money or their parents money to be exact theyll blindly walk into the advertisements traps and ask their parents over and over again for the awsome product that they have seen on television until they ,2
17180, say yes so i assume you could say that this is basically taking ,21
17181, of the children of their i guess stupidity which is kind of a very harsh word for what ,7
17182," say and of their disability to see through the whole system the only thing the children know is that they want this toy that they can brag with in front of their friends which by the way will probably turn out to be not as cool as they thought 

now ",20
17183, all of that might be true it is ,21
17184, to be taken into consideration that only their parents would even be able to buy their children the things that they want ,9
17185, having seen these controversial commercials so basically ,11
17186, it is possible to say that ,21
17187," the kids cant form an opinion and dont know whats going on their parents will have to do the final step of buying the products which gives them the job of knowing whats going on

on the other ",2
17188, i honeslty dont know why advertising s children is only viewed negatively because believe it or not there might actually be useful products that are advertised and there might actually be honest and genuine people out there who do ,16
17189," want to abuse the system not all of it should be branded as bad

having thought about all that and knowing that if it were to be a bad product by bad people who only want to trick children and their parents into buying their stuff that it would ",2
17190, only be the parents fault and not the childrens ,12
17191, i can safely say that i would not prohibit television advertising for kids because if you really think about it the advertisers are not taking ,13
17192, of their parents disability to say no to them,9
17193,"a simple question that has a difficulte and complicate answer i tend toward the answer that such advetising is extremely harmful for young children
first of all should a child with that age not even be allowed to watch television because watching television at that age it is dangerous for the development of the language and the logical thinking of a child as a german study showed the results which were published were extremely frightening the study showed that children who watched television more than half an hour were more likely to drop out of school and only ten percent of these kids went to universtity whereas children who did not watch television at all between the age  had a much bigger chance to make it to university so watching commercials on tv at that age is automaticly harmful because watching ads includes obviously watching tv
a reason much more important why advetsing toward children should be forbidden is that young children are more likely to be influenced by ads these adverstisments are often very loud and colourful which implifies the need to buy the adverted thing a child sees these kind of ads and has automaticly the need to get one of those things so you can say that children get influenced easily by these ads the decision to want something is made by the concernes which produce the adverted thing because right at that monent as the child sees the ad it feels the need to get one of the things this circumstance is improved by the sound of the ad the sound which is often the voice of a man with a deep and loud voice is ",14
17194," a huge influence because of phrases like if you want to be cool get the superblaser 1000 this serves as an example so it is vital to say that sdvertising toward young children should be forbidden and sanctioned
",13
17195,imagine wathching tv with your little child its 6 pm and your child have to go to bed soon ,1
17196, shes wathching a good evening serie for kids after the little episode she ,6
17197," sees the advertising its about a new sinderella film in the cinema after that she just want to see this film with you but you dont like disnay movies television advertising should be allowed because parents grandparents and her childs have to lerne to deal with adverticement and her concequences 

firstly parents often dont like kids advertising on the television because kids take it very seriously they realy think that ",14
17198," the new film of sinderella is the best and they realy have to watch it they cant seperate the real life and the tv world
but how other children learn the bad absicht of adertissement as ",6
17199," parents watch advertising with their children and explain them that they cant do all the funny things in the tv because its expensice and it isnt as fancy as it is shown the parents have to show them that they cant buy all the things they want

 second it would be easyer for parents if there would be a rule to manage the advertising for children but i thing parents have to make rules for children and have to look that they dont watch the bad adavertising
 ",14
17200, its not wrong to show children televisoin advertising because it is not something who destroys the children maybe for the parents it isnt ,14
17201, good beacause if the children watching the advertising of games ,4
17202, playmobile or barbie they want this things ,20
17203," bad so they talk to her parents and talk and talk till they say yes and buy the games for there childrens

also ",9
17204, friendly television advertising because some comics and other stuff in the tv are ,10
17205," they make the childrens dumb

otherwise it gives ",8
17206, many other things whitch we should protect our childrens ,12
17207," for example the internet or the streets which are very dangerouse so i think the adevertising is the smalest problem of all 

this are the reasons why i ",11
17208," with the statement which says that television advertising  ahould not be allowed

 ",15
17209,"television advertising  should not be allowed

televison advertising is a topic over the hole world and ",15
17210," of the world can be in the  television advertising in a coutry which is thousands of miles away from it many people hate television advertising of different reasonds but should it not be allowed 

many online shopping websites have been in tv advertising and ",15
17211, if they show it  they hope that they would call the parents to show them that they want the toy so is is good for the shop young children would be directed to watch every advertising of them to remember the parents that they want that so there are ,20
17212, some children songs advertisings which makes the young children happy and ,0
17213," the parents
also there are many movie advertising on the tv and they show them a lot of on a children channel where there is ",6
17214, for teenager some series so if there is a advertising which has been for teenager the young children would ,0
17215," see it and this is not very good in some times

televison advertising could be a advertising to everything ",10
17216, i think it depends on the advertising if it schould be allowed to children or not so my opinion is if it is a advertising of a friendly children movie or a playsstore the young children could watch it but ,16
17217, the advertising is about a teenager action movie with war and blood the advertising should not be allowed ,15
17218,"television advertising  children aged 

everybody nows it the annoying television advertising but if it is a good advertisment it influences you to buy stuff and is not that the purpose of a advertisment to influence you a lot of young children spend a lot of time in front of the television and ",14
17219," watch advertisment is that really a good thing im am going to talk about if television for young children should not be allowed

first ",13
17220," define the words young children when i talk about young children in this essay i mean children aged  
to start ",8
17221," say that advertising can include violence sexism and bad language which shoud not be accesable for young children but i have to say that the advertisment on channels for children is made for children and does not contain things like violence so if the parents just allow the children childrenchannels or block the others they not affected by advertisment which are not made for them 
another ",13
17222," is that the advertising is bad because children are easier to manipulate 

in my opinion ",16
17223, advertisment shoudl be accseable for children because they may get influence but their not getting brainwashed,16
17224,a lot of kids aged  like to watch television and do this all day for some hours for the parents is this ,17
17225, good because the kids have something to do and the parents can work in this time or clean up the house but ist that a good idea in television you see not just movies or series you ,1
17226," see a lot of advertising  it shouldnt be allowed to do television advertising  

an ",15
17227, who speaks for the thesis is that kids in this age believe everything you say to them when kids hear something what people say in the advertising they think thats true oder ,2
17228, they see something stupid in the advertising they ,11
17229, believe its true because of this kid are very vulnerable and it could be that they learn something wrong ,7
17230," advertising this could change the life of the kids

an reason who speaks against this thesis is that advertisings arent bad there arent brutal or cruel scenes in it the scenes which are shown in advertising are happy and full of harmony a lot advertisings are funny and you have to laugh if you see it this isnt bad for this kids and dont harm them

finally ",0
17231," it shouldnt be allow to do this kids are too vulnerable in this age and television advertising  is unessecary 

",12
17232,"should it be allowed to advertise television s

today many children watch tv at home ",15
17233," playing outside peolpe often critices this evolution because they thinks electronic devices are not good for the young children so they think about making television advertising prohibited 

one ",17
17234, tv advertising  isnt allowed is that they would play outside because there only mord series etc on televison next ,15
17235," the children watch tv every time they can lose friend or the dont know how the real world works  

on the other ",17
17236, they have their own tv programms because if they havent their own programms they watch tv programmes for adults ,6
17237, going outside or playing with other kids in addition theres not a problem ,24
17238, parents look and control how long their watching tv young childrens should ,17
17239, know how a tv works the earlier they learn how electronic devices works the easier is it to learn and to work ,17
17240, they are adults they should learn from the ,7
17241, how long its good watching tv and ,1
17242," its enough

to sum up there are ",21
17243, televisions advertising should be allowed because children should have their own tv programmes if they havent got own tv series they watch series for adults ,14
17244, making other things so its better ,23
17245, they watch their own programmes which are done for childrens but the parents of the children must be careful about how long the children watch tv because they shouldnt watch tv the whole day they should go outside and play with other kids but a prohibition is not the right way to bring children away from the tv screen ,17
17246,"televison advertising should not be allowed if it is for young children aged 
there are two ",13
17247, for toys is something only young children are going to watch it is one way to present a specific subject over televison  the young children it can cause a few troubles for example children between two and five will most probably watch more televison beacuse it is very interesting and enyoable to see new things you maybe want for your ,20
17248, birthday they are now more infront of the television to see all these advertisements the time spend infront of the television they could play outside with other children ,0
17249," watching toys and other advertisements all day long
but it has ",10
17250, a positive factor to advertise directly  for example a family with a three year old son who is going to befour soon are looking for a birthdy gift the son watches television one hour twice a week in the afternoon one day three weeks ,0
17251," his birthday he sees this fantatic new techmobile in an ad from lego now he knows exactly what he wants for his birthday and his parents are no longer in stress to find something good 
we see there are two ",20
17252, one positive and one more negative ,21
17253, about this statement the negative is the the time one spends watching television ,10
17254, doing more things in real life the positive ,18
17255," is that children can actually find something interesting and be a bit happier in the short future beacause of advertising for them

all in all in my personal oppinion the positive factor about advertising toward children outweighs the negative if you let your child watch tv for an appropiate time and not four hours every day it can be very useful for parents and their children without stealing important time of the real world a middle way in between is the best for children and parents ",14
17256,today the television plays a central part in each live it exist many pros and cons of watching television often parents are to lazy to carry their young children and ,17
17257, they let them watch television but there exist negative consequenses of watching tv espectually advertising young children belive quite everything they see so ,17
17258, the children are watching television advertising they belive in every detail but those advertisings are often not real the producers of those advertisings only want to earn a lot of money and ,14
17259," watching the advertisement children want to buy the product

a child ",0
17260, can get addicted of watching tv and ,1
17261, they cry very often or become a tantrum and are very angry to the parents,24
17262, they switch off the television so its beter ,1
17263," the young children do something other than watching television for example young children could play a game with their family or have a nice evening with some friends

it ",1
17264, we can learn a lot from the television documentaries often shows us how something is in real also young children can learn with watching television they could improve their speaking knowledge so it helps them ,6
17265," they go to nursery school 

",8
17266, televison advertising towards young children shouldnt be allowed because young childrens belive to everything but at the end the parents can decide if their child can watch tv or not for sure its better to go outside to play with some friends than watching television or surfing in the internet but often the parents are very stressed ,14
17267, to calm down they put their young child in front of a tv for me its not bad to let the child watching television but not more ,1
17268, half a houer a day often the parents ,9
17269, they have noother opportunity than let their child watch tv,17
17270,in this generation its normal that young children watch a lot of tv all day because its the easiest thing they have something to do and dont make any noises but television advertising can influence young children a lot more than their parents because they want something faster than adults if they want something from the television advertisment the parents buy it the parents cant protect their children from television advertising and they often dont notice it another ,14
17271, is that kids often dont know what they want and ,7
17272," they see in the television that other children have something that make fun they want it too 
",24
17273, television advertising shouldnt be allowed because its unfair for the parents who want the best for their children and ,15
17274, they buy a lot of things ,3
17275, toys for them the best for the kids were that they dont watch ,20
17276, much tv and go out to play with their friends or they shouldnt put ,1
17277, much advertisment in kids programs ,16
17278, with this statement the reason why ,21
17279," this statement is that these young children get influenced by this advertising
an other big problem of this tv advertsing is that they do not learn the bolasie flick this bolasie flick is very important for the future of the childrens this bolasie flick decide if they have five star skills or not when you have learned this very important skill ",0
17280," you have more worth on the transfer market
a few years ago i was looking advertising in the tv advertising is the most beautiful part in a tv show this beautiful advertising has influenced me 
this has formed my charakter and made me to this person i am today that was my very informative essay about the subject advertsing i hope do not have a rectaldisfunktion an enjoied reading this beautiful easy ",11
17281,advertising becomes more and more important in our world but adverts are ,11
17282, dangerous because they influence us in the way they want us to think this can have a very bad impact on children ,4
17283," ads that target children between the age of two and five should be forbitten

making a child think that for eg a special toy is something they have to have creates multible problems 
one of those problems is that the child will ennoy its parents because it wants to have this toy this is ",16
17284," a problem if the parents dont want to buy the toy eighter because they dont have the money or because they dont think its a good toy for their child 
this creates another problem because if there is a group of children and some of them have this adverted toy and some of them dont the ones without the toy will probably feel bad or even be bullied this ",20
17285," creates even more stress for the parents

children are ",12
17286," more likely to remember an ad ive seen this phenomen with my little brother when i saw the ad i just told myself its an ad dont think about it to much but smaller children like my brother dont realise that my brother now knows some ad by heart which means he definetly got influenced by them

to pick up a ",0
17287, i wrote about earlier often toys or other things that are shown in an ad arent very good things for children ,20
17288, parents mostly dont want their child to have them very good toys ,20
17289," have hardly ever an ad campaign

making ads that target  years old children illegal would be a huge step in the right direction but to do this there are ",16
17290, some problems to overcome who decideds which ads are banned ,15
17291, also with younger and younger children using the internet it ,24
17292, gets more and more difficult to ban ads because on the internet goverments sometimes cant control everything,11
17293,as a componie that sells products adressed to children its quite an efficient way to present their products to children trough the television as jung children get those products presented interstingly theiy almost instantly want to get them and as soon as they have heard of such a product they run to their parents and ask them to buy this prop seen in the advertisment the ,0
17294," time the parents might resist to the demanding of the child but as it has seen the advertisment a few times they almost need to buy it to ceep their child happy

17297," they would maybe stop dooing this advertisements 
in my oppinion tvadvertisment is one of the most annoying things in the world and i would love to get rid off but i does not have to be vorbidden to make advertising especcialy for such jung children because if they do see to much advertising its ",14
17298, the fault of the companies ,23
17299, of the parents children in this age should not wach too much tv,17
17300,television advertising is a very big theme in our society today because there are ,10
17301, many psycological ways to change the wahrnehmung of the people but little children can be better influenced bey television advertising than older people because they want everything they can see and that is presented in a positiv way for example if there is a new babyborn and they can see how other children in tv play with it they ,14
17302," want this new one and it does not matter if they have already one or not they just want the new one 
another ",3
17303, to not allowed the television advertising is that sometimes there are good series or documentations about themes kids should know but every few minutes comes a short advertieser ,13
17304, the children have to watch them or they generally do not watch television but ,17
17305," do not watch the good documentations 
but these products from the advertise should have the chance to be presented and they pay to show these so maybe its the exercise from the parents to give their kids other things to do than watching television  if they do not want to show them advertises the parents can buy a film about googtoknowthemes or they can read books about interesting things or they can tell and discuss with their children so they are many other ways to learn things about life 
",0
17306," the kids learn more about everything if they do it for themself if they watch just television their intelligence can not profit because they do not think for themself they just watch something when they do not watch television they can not be influenced by the television advertising and the can learn more for themself and maybe they do something and can hold it in their memoir because if you watch television most of the time you do not know what you have watched a few days later
the thing is the parents have to know what they want for their children the advertiser should can show their television advertising and if the parents do not want that their kids see it there are many way to go around the advertise ",14
17307,"advertising on television is it really bad for young children


at ",14
17308, does a two year old child need to watch already television shows should it not enjoy life out ,17
17309, the house on the fresh air as older they get they will watch television shows and advertising but does advertising works at a such young age yes unfortunately it does the little children see something awesome they want but they do not have the money to buy it so they annoying their parents ,14
17310, they buy their child the thing it wants television advertising should be forbidden for such young age it affects the children a lot when we are young the world around us has a big influence on us so maybe ,14
17311, the children are grown up they ,24
17312," get what they want and that is really annoying for the people around that person

for every minus there is a plus sooner or later the children will see advertising in the television it is better they see it ",2
17313, they are young they learn that we can not have everything we want and that is a very important ,24
17314, in life the children have stuff to talk about they can exchange what they saw and who thinks what is cool it ,8
17315, helps them to form their identity they will recognize what they like and what not and ,8
17316," they get something that is not as it was in the advertising they learn that not everthing is like what it seems to be

all in all television advertising for young children should not be allowed the products which are presentet are only half as good as they were presented a lot of the advertising is made correctet or idealized by computer in my opinion the children shouldnt watch television that long that they could be advertising in it they should watch their show and ",14
17317, that they should do something else things that have to be advertised are useless that is an old sentens and sadly it is true,11
17318,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

these days adverstising is present everywhere it is common that these messages are normally directed to a particular client group but is advertising directed  really needed and ",15
17319," should it even be allowed

children between the age of 2 and 5 arent ",12
17320," reasonable not without any reason decide their parents most of the time for them they cant really distinguish if something is good for them or not therefore advertising directed straight at these children isnt useful
however advertising company ",16
17321," want to reach this group of people but they should direct it to the parents and not to their child

normally these children can easily get a false idea about what this product really is about their imagination is great and they believe at things which were just meant to make the advertising more interesting they are innocent victims of false adverisments if theres a fairy princess which makes dreams to become true they are going to believe it and if ",2
17322," reality came and they would become aware that this isnt true their hearts would be broken

and ",19
17323, all the parents are those who have to pay the product they are in charge for their childs health and wellbeeing and they have to say no to their child everytime ,9
17324," they want such an useless present many parents have to deal with their children starting to cry and yell because they cant have the desired thing although the product seems nice to the child the parents really know if its a real necessity to have

in conclusion these advertisings give the children a false view of things they increase problem between parent and child and sometimes they just confuse them so ",2
17325," television advertising directed  isnt for any good it just creates conflicts

",10
17326,advertisement is an intelligent mean thats being used by almost every company its very important for them to advertise their product but sometimes advertisement is ,11
17327," very manipulative for the people that are confronted with it especially children are pretty easy to manipulate so should the children be prevented of advertisements on television by a law that doesnt allow any advertising towards children
",13
17328, that its necessary to forbid such advertisements because of several reasons the ,15
17329, that supports my opinion is that companies should always be able to show theis products to the customers if that wouldnt be the case how should anybody know about the newest lego toy or the new puppet that can even eat and ,23
17330, a child has been influenced by the television advertising the parents will ,0
17331," decide if they want to buy their son or daughter the toy that theyve seen on tv
another ",20
17332, is that the children will get in contact with those products anyways for example ,2
17333, they see them at a friends house or in the kindergarten so they can ,24
17334," be confronted with an advertisement on television
it doesnt matter how old an individual is whether it should be allowed or forbidden to show advertisements or not because children arent able or dont even have any or that much money to buy things by themselves",13
17335,"whether it is on billboards in newspapers in the internet or television we cant get around advertisements
its part of our culture and our economical system were all subconciously influenced through advertisingthats scientifically proven

some advertisements may have negative impact on certain people or even society ",11
17336," therefore one might ask themselves if this is something we need to protect our children from infants and young children are in an important developemental stage and their experiences are their foundation for their future lives and leave a lasting impact

nowadays many children spend a lot of their time watching tv and are exposed to television advertising towards them some people argue that this sort of television advertising   should not be allowed because they could teach them questionable values or impact them ",14
17337," in a negative way

others say its not a big deal and its just part of our world therfore we shouldnt condemn it it might even help them to find new interests they argue

17338," its fair to say that we need to be careful to what we expose our children to and there should certain rules concerning advertising  all advertising is manipulating in some way and we need to make our children aware of this at a very young age we must teach them that in the real world things are different than on television and that values like friendship and compassion are more important than material things

 personally ",14
17339, banning advertising towards children would be necessary its just important to have a conversation about it and to be aware of what theyre exposed to,13

17343, about 9 am or in the early afternoon you have to deal with the ,18

17347," eight houres of working isnt interested in the new barbie doll 

advertisments are made for a target audience but why should already childrens by the age of two watch tv and therefor be a target audience in my oppinion parents who let childrens watch television by the age of two arent very responsible at such a young age they certainly are very easy to influence by the advertisments and the tv series for children who arent  educatif or pedagogial at all just are not worth it i ",14
17348, never watched tv as a child because we never had one i alwasy watched films and i dont feel like i missed something besides the advertisments who always make long brakes between the actual film or serie youre watching ,17
17349, that banning advertisments is the right way to protect young childrens sure if there isnt any temptation it is easier to resist but they ,13
17350, have to learn to deal with it to see something and not have the urgent need to get it and ,18
17351, being able to know that is real and what is not but the question is are childrens by the age of  already able to do that probably not ,7
17352, if parents let their childs watch telly at such a early age they have to be ready to explain them a lot and resist the crying of a two years old in the supermarket who absolutely wants that toy she saw in the commercial to be done on own risk ,17

first television advertising is mostly unhealthy for young children for example they can get very sick and they cannot get any friends if they are television advertising but there is ",14
17378," an other arguement which do not support the statement children have to make expiriences in the world and television advertising do not bring any important expiriences 
at last television advertising  aged  should not be allowed the health of young children is too important and television advertising could be like a wall between the children and the society 
",13
17379, is a very manipulative action companies use human weaknesses to their ,23
17380," making an advertisment now children below the age of five dont have any experience with manipulative strategies of companies therefore it is in the companies biggest interests to direct their advertisment to the most naive crowd but is it fair to manipulate adults through their children id say no because if adults want to buy something they should be able to make desiciones themselves companies shouldnt be allowed to target adults through their children 

i havent got anymore ideas ",16

ggez",18
17385,children are heaviliy influenced by everything they see so if they see a toy advertised in television its easy to understand that these children want to have them ,20
17386," they have no use for them

an advertisement in television can shoew a wrong image of the product but for some children television is real an adult has experience in what he can trust and what is fake children cant distinguish between what part of the advertisement they can belive and what they should be aware of most of the toys are advertised between shows for the advertiser its an easy way to get the people to buy their products they make the children beg their parents for the toys ",20
17387," the parents know better what kind of toys their children have an use for if the children see the toy in real life they may have an impression of what it does and they may change their minds but even adults can be influenced by advertisements so if  the children start early to analize how advertisement in television works they wont make similar mistakes in the future

advertisement in television can influence children but it can ",14
17388, influence adults if a child learns how to look at advertisement in the early ages it knows later how to avoid way bigger mistakes conclusion,0
17389,television advertising is nowadays exrteamly popular a couple of years ago mostly adults and adolesents watched tv nowadays there are many tv programs for children only betweeen the different shows there is alot of advertising directet toward  young children the advertising mostly includes advertising for toys the thing is most of the advertising is about toys for young children but ,14
17390, designed to adjust the parents the ã¼arents decide ,9
17391," if the toy is going to be bought or not a child under the age of five like to touch and feel stuff if they only see it on tv they cant really associate with the object so the advertising is indirectly for the parents if it is i dont see a reason why its not okay 

if you look at the moral ",14
17392, of the whole story it might be not that okay advertiser is using young children and mostly young parents it can be that a chid sees something on the tv that they despretly want so it screams and crys till they have it young parents mostly dont have alot of money because they are building a new life and have to stay at home because of the children so its not okay to missuse the need of those children ,16
17393," the parents have to buy the toy 

all in all you have to see for yourself if its fine for you or not to advertise on tv towards young children the advertising is there anyhow ",0
17394, if you dont like it dont let your children watch tv ,17
17395, its okay for children at a very young age to sit a wholeday in front of a tv it leads to stupidity and numness,17
17396,nowadays many young children already watch tv because of that they ,17
17397," are exposed to advertisements but the question is if it does any good or bad to these children
first of all advetisements do have an influence on the one who watches them especially young children can easily be influencedthis leads to the wish of needing and buying all these stuff which is very bad
another ",14
17398, is that these advertisements often are based on a joke young children wont get these jokes and can ,16
17399," be offended through the advertisement
as an personal opinion i ",11
17400," think such young children shouldnt watch tv normal dvds are ok but on tv you mostly just watch trash because of that children who should touch and feel things just sit there and do nothing all the time this can lead to serious motivation problems in their later life
on the other ",17
17401," not for children aged  but if they are a bit older thex begin to understand the use of advertisments they dont believe anymore that everything said on tv is true and this helps to develope their analytic ways of thinking
",14
17402, young children mustnt be exposed to advertisments but neither should they be exposed to too much tv in my opinion watching in these boxes isnt good for children of any age they should go outside and make their own experiences for life but ,14
17403," it is the decision of their parents and their responsibility to care good for their children


gg ez",12
17404, with that statement in todays televisionprograme there is no more chanel left who hasnt got advertisements in their breaks i understand that the people who work at the chanel need to earn money out of somewhere the simplest way to get the necessary money is by stream advertisements in the breaks of their tv shows since a few years television developed their advertising process they set the advertisings at specific times or between specific shows for example in the late evening at this time there are only adults or teenagers left,10
17405," the people working at the chanel only place advertisements for products which are used by theese kind of people or on disneychanel there are specific advertisemnts for children
",16
17406, chanels who stream children programe should not be allowed to place advertisement that could affect the children the young boys and girls might get attracted by the products ,16
17407," they start yelling at there parents and wont stop begging until they get what they want in these cases the children win nine out of ten times so the ones who placed the advertisements gain profit by influencing children thats a clever way but not fair 
",2
17408, that debate would loose at court because its their only way to make a financial gain advertising will ,15
17409, to be placed in tv ,10
17410, there must be another possibility to let children watch their favourite tv shows thats the ,17
17411," where netflix comes in netflix has a wide range of tv shows for children and as a parent you dont have to worry that your child gets affected by advertisements
",6
17412,its quite hard to define the directed spectator group of an advertisement not all people are educated like the others and not all people are in the same mental stage ,11
17413," they are at the same age as others some children aged  can already decide about some easy questions and situations others cant when young children aged  are watching television theres only advertisement ment for young children and nothing that isnt meant for them 
        young children are quite good in getting what they want ",24
17414, they can easily get the things they have seen in television advertisements  work well if they are built attractive for them it ,3
17415, wouldnt be fair if only things for older people were allowed to advertise in television every toy store wants to sell his toys ,13
17416, as every wine store wants to sell his wine if just the wine store would be allowed to advertise in television the toy store wouldnt make enough money toy stores cant exist that well without advertising because most parents dont buy toys for their children without having seen these toys ,15
17417, when young children are watching television advertisements they can tell their parents exactly what they want for sure young children are more likely to want everything they see but ,0
17418, you have to pay for it the parents can decide whether they want to buy the product or not you shouldnt be able to buy the products for young children by a phone call because maybe the young children already know how to use a phone and how to make a phone call but ,2
17419," i know products directed  cant be bought by a phone call
        i cant see any problems in television advertising directet toward young children aged  ",14
17420, it isnt something dangerous and ,18
17421, the young children cant get it without convincing their parents of buying it,2
17422,"televison advertising
in modern society media is always present it influences everybody just by the sheer presence there almost none possibilities to escape these ifluences thus the young undeveloped minds of children are ifluenced by the media probably more than we know
however the kids learn early to seperate in between what is real and what is not they may ",14
17423," get used to the devices that bring along these ads for exaple they get used to using a computer a laptop a smartphone or a tablet they will not have any problems using these gadgets and anyway it is the responibility of the parrents to what they show to their children and what not
they are confronted this early that they do not even realize that they are influenced by these ads they are not able to get an imagination about what they should beliefe and what not their minds will be influenced this much that they are almost completely controled by the media in terms of buying stuff they will not understand why something is neccesary and why they need it because in the ads everything is shown as it is necessery in life and you have to buy it to be able to ",2
17424," to life a normal life but in the age where it will be vorbidden the parants have an inormous influence on the children and their behaviour in terms of consuming ads thus it is a consequenze of parenting skill to show the children what they should beliefe and what not
in my opinion it is necessair to control the consume of young children ",13
17425, in development and easy ifluenced but as ,23
17426, everything else it is the responisbility of the parents of what their child is waching and what it should not watch,17
17427,"should advetising directed  be forbidden do they have negative influences to the developpment of the children or do the enterprises have the right to attract their costumers with advertises

young children are very easily influencable this is the reason why there are ",16
17428, many television advertisis these days directed  but many shown products are not good for the developpment of the children the young children love mcdonalds ,14
17429," because of its commercial strategy in the end the children prefer hamburgers and fries over fruits and vegetables these can be the negative influences of tv advertising toward young children brands can influence children for their hole life by using commercials so the people are unconsciously dependant on brands and their products which are often overprized or unhealthy

on the other ",14
17430, everybody wants to earn money the companys offer jobs to workers and the workers earn money for the family and there are companys whose clients are children they ,23
17431, want to survive and make their money to make more money it is inevitably for many enterprises to make televison advertising and ,10
17432," they can offer more jobs

",23
17433, this is a very controversial question every enterprise has the right to make money and they need those television advertising but they can have negative ,15
17434, the children are endangered the best ,12
17435, would be if we could forbid the commercials with a bad influence on the children to protect them but the difficulty is do define these bad commercials there will be a lot of work for the government,13
17436,nowadays there are more and more advertisements some are interesting and catchy ,11
17437," others dont really have a meaning and are bad for children but should television advertising be allowed for young children

firstly television advertising can have vulgar topics ",14
17438," it might scare children for instance a game advertising about war

even ",16
17439, good reasons to allow advertising for young children for example it can help young children to understand difficult things there are topics that can be explained in a playful way like an advertising some advertisements  adults adults themselves have a difficulty to understand ,0
17440," it has a simple meaning that children understand faster adults often think that theres a deep meaning behind but actually its simple 

in conclusion i ",8
17441, with this statement if parents ,9
17442, and dont want their kids to see it they should watch television with their kids and turn it off ,1
17443, an advertisement appears if there are vulgar advertisements there should be a warning ,11
17444, of the video sometimes young children dont even understand if the advertisements are  them they just have fun and enjoy watching television ,0
17445,tvshows or movies do have an extrem big influence on the spectaor horros movies ,6
17446, make some people cry or leads them to a slepless night an advertisement is shorter than a movie but is ,11
17447, able to influence the spactator at least this is the goal of an ad the behaviour of small kids ,8
17448," could change a lot if they see someone doing or having something even without the parental influence they believe what they see on tv is true mostly in advertisements for children a toy or something else to use is presented if they like it they really really want to have it too escpecially if all their friends have the thing the parents get stressed a lot because there is no way not to get the object of desire without getting the kids sad

on the other ",24
17449," if the advertisement for children is funny but the kid is not interested in it its a good way to make the tv more attractive besides the advertisements for adults there is something for children to watch and the spectrum of what you can watch on tv gets enourmous

another positiv thing about the advertisement for young children is that it is ",16
17450," for young children if an older one needs a gift for the sondaughter of a friend and he sees something good on tv he doesnt have to come up with a strange giftidea

but ",20
17451, it is questionable if there should be anything for children at the age of 2 to 5 on tv this doesnt really help the new generation to learn to go out into the fresh air and do something on its own my opinion to the whole thing is ,17
17452, very simple i would not allow television ads s young children or any other thing on television at all,13
17453,"television advertising

advertising is seen everywhere on the streets on plackates it is heared in the radio or read in a magazine or newspaper ",10
17454," seen in the televison or in the cinema 

companies are showing their mostly new product to get some more popularity and get more people to buy it new trailers of a film which is coming soon in the cinema are often shown in advertising breaks of films which are on the tele this is clever in reason of many people see this advert and the scale of people going to see it will be higher 
therefore will the company and the producer of the film earn more money and ",10
17455," become more popular 
young childeren like to watch television and ",6
17456, are children films often more fully booked by advertising a trailer in break time of a film more children get to see it and are ,0
17457," more likely to go to the cinema

what happend to childeren if the shown trailer isnt age right or in the shown adverise are scenes shown which should not be watched of a young child childeren can develope a fear of scary trailers in reason of that they think of it the whole day and cannot even go to bed because of their nightmears as well as it is boring for childerne to watch in between their childeren programm advertise for grown up people

in conclusion a companie is advertising to get more popular and is shown their new product if a trailer is for young childeren in aged  a cinema trip can be  glad idea for the whole family if ",6
17458, a trailer is shown which isnt ,18
17459," specificly age the children can develope a fear and kind of a trazma because of their naivity
finally i have to mantion ",24
17460, advertising hase their pro in topics of show people new products they can make use otherwise i have to say that childeren directed the advertising has to have a limite ,11
17461, on childeren canals on televisions,6
17462,i wasnt in this situation that the tv made a problem ,17
17463, but now in our time many people or almost all people have a tv for the children and young children is tv very funne because there are funny fils and series but it a ,17
17464," advertisement i have no proplems with the advertisement in tv but for young people is this not correct

young children are for all object and situations interessted television advertising can use this situation and can lead in his richtung the children can be interessted for a thing in the futere which produce a company which had made this television advertisement 

also is the problem that we dont know the auswirkungen by te television advertisement in the childhood it could be manipulatet us or it nothing happens but ",14
17465," is importantthat the parents know what the children are showing at the moment and on tv cames things thats not correct for the young people example war games and weapons

the company can make little massage for the children in the television advertisement example the state make this and say that your country need you and you should go to the army  yes is a little over the top with this example  but ",13
17466," say that people in young years learn a lot of information and the life is based on the childhood it is a good instrument for the state to lead the young generation  

that television advertisemt  should not be allowed is ",13
17467, with with this statement on based of the different ,21
17468,"when it comes to raising kids the opinions drift apart in this time watching television is on the daily schedule of almost every little child 
advertising directed to kids leads them to beg for it it makes them wanting all those shiny and funny things from the advertisment the people who pay for it are ",2
17469," not the kids but the parents that intention itself makes the company that sends out the promotion very unsympathic 
so in the family that kind of advertisment causes riots from the kids
if we have a look at this from the ",2
17470, the whole thing looks very different and clever i mean who wouldnt buy a toy for its kid if they can affort it easily and make their kid ,20
17471," much happier with it another question would be if exactly this behaviour leads our culture in a society of consume and non stop needs of material things because they may cause happiness for a really short moment but lasting happiness is a state of mind
in conclusion ",23
17472, that advertising  kids is an effective strategie for the company but from a social ,0
17473," of view very unhealthy for our future society and the consume behaviour of the kids
 ",4
17474,television advertising is something we live with in our every day life it has become something normal that we mostly dont see as an issue but ,10
17475," it comes to children more specific young children aged  television advertising may be a problem 
nowadays most of the younger children in our society are growing up with televisions surrounding and entertaining them they are being influenced by certain television shows ",14
17476, of what comes inbetween them since children are ,8
17477, growing up they have to learn a lot wich means things ,7
17478, television advertising tend to have a much bigger impact on them ,10
17479, they have on grown ups that can be a really big issue for parents who can not control what their children see on the television this means that they can not control what their children are being influenced by on the other ,17
17480, there are a lot of other things that influence children if a child is not homeschooled he or she has to go to school in school children are surrounded by others who influence them those children have a much bigger impact on others than television advertising does but children are ,14
17481, influenced by other children in ,7
17482," we live in a society where we are being influenced every day by other people by what happends around the globe by basically everything so telvision advertising does not really have that big of an impcat right
in my opinion it is ",10
17483, an issue we cant ignore just because of the ,21
17484, that there are greater issues ,21
17485, that television advertising  should be allowed because it is really not necesarry not only that ,15
17486, it would really help the children if they got confronted with television advertsising later in their lifes ,14
17487,"a mother and her daughter aged four are sitting together on a couch and are watching tv at six oclock in the evening the favorite tvshow of the girl has finished and an advertising about a princess ben shows up the girl is fascinated but forget what she saw her mother is shocked and turns immediately the tv off she is angry and calls the channel this television advertising did show a normal situation in our lifetime should television advertising  be allowed or is it just a dumb thing

first of all almost every child watches tv maybe a mother or a father is sitting ",14
17488, to them and they develop their dreams in several advertisings they see what they want and they can look forward to telling their mothers and daddies what they want its in the eye of the beholder but ,0
17489," they are learning to have dreams and to follow them 

also important is that a father or a mother can inspire itself of buying maybe a new birthday present for their child advertising can be inspiring ",8
17490," its for young children 

on the other ",4
17491, against television advertising  is that humans without children are bored if there shows an advertising for a young children aged 4 up they want to see advertisings for themselves and not one for children it ,13
17492," depends on what time it is if there is eleven oclock in the evening there should not be showed an advertising for young children

to concluse there are positive and negative ",16
17493, the positive ones do overweight and i hope there wont be less television advertising  if you come home and you were stressed maybe caused by work watching advertisings is a good thing to cool down and relax a little bit ,10
17494,today there are a lot of moms daddies and nannies who let the childrens aged  watch tv what are the positifs and negatif ,17
17495," should we stop let them watch tv
parents are often stressed and somtimes they desire to have some time to spend for themselfes so they put the tv on and let their children watch series or movies somentimes they havent really an idea what the children are watching this could be dangereous because the things they see in this young age have a great influence of their personality looking ",17
17496," watching tv can be something really interesting for chlildren and they can learn things depending what they are watching
a negatif ",17
17497," could be that the children lost their imagination skills or they get a imagine of a world that doesent exist
in my opinion it is important that the children go out and play with others it should be allowed let the children watch tv but the parents should watch with them or  they should know what their children are watching ",24
17498, with this statment because young children can be easly influence but ,12
17499,television adverts are a highly discussed topic often because people dont want to watch them however they have a big effect on us and we are greatly influenced by them ,10
17500, we dont want to admit it often these adverts are about lifestyle products or other things we use in everyday life but should these adverts ,11
17501," be used to influence small children aged  
first of all you should ask yourself if your child which is that young should be watching tv anyway but why should we show them adverts this will only influence them and they wont have a freemind as a child because if you show a child an advert of unhealthy food everyday it will remember it at some stage and will be influenced by the advert so ",14
17502," it sees this product in real life it will probably want it because it has seen it a lot 
also it is not a big use to show cildren these adverts because only a minority will remember them or unterstand them ",11
17503," if they are two years old how should they know what they are watching 
another ",24
17504, is that children at this age learn a lot ,8
17505, they should learn basic things like talking and walking ,24
17506," if they watch tv adverts they wont learn anything

on the other ",10
17507, it can be useful to show children adverts because they can ,16
17508, recognize them and want them and this is a good thing for companys which are advertising their products for example if the children see a small bike being advertised it will slowly but ,0
17509, be interested if not want the bike this ,18
17510," could lead the parents to buy it because they want to make their kids happy
also if the adverts are useful they can help the child ",0
17511," if you show them a math advert they will want to know what it is and will alter maybe be interested in this topic which is a good thing

in my oppinion ",0
17512, these adverts are completely useless ,11
17513, for the companies and the children parents because the children are way to small to recognize these things that well and if they do the companies are just using them to make even more money so i just think it is moraly not correct to show them these adverts,16
17514,television advertising can be very diverse it always depends on the advertisement itself if the advertisement contains any possibly vulgar footage it should not be allowed under any circumstancesyoung childern ,14
17515, between the age of two and five years should not be seeing those types of advertisements what ,16
17516, shouldnt be allowed is any type of vulgar or even rude language they can learn the language very fast and ,12
17517, even use it themselves and ,3
17518, advertisements with any type of sexual content should be strictly forbidden for exampe advertisments for condoms or sex toys young children should not be seeing advertisments of that type at their age now all the other advertisments like ,16
17519, a car advertisment can be seen by young children they dont really harm anyone and children of that age are not intrested in buying a car anyways ,16
17520, they wont be affected also food advertisments or advertisments for cleaning tools of any kind like ,11
17521, a toothbrush or soap to wash the dishes can be allowed they dont really harm anyone and might even be interesting for the parents the only advertisments which might give the parents a headache would be toy advertisments theres the possibility that the children see the toys on television and start asking for them until the parents ,0
17522, decide to buy them but apart from robbing the parents money toy advertisements arent really harming anyone ,2
17523," they can be allowed
in my opinion the television crew might want to sort out the advertisements a bit better ",15
17524, that the parents are able to leave their children in front of the television without having the fear of them possibily seeing any vulgar or rude content,12
17525,imagine a child it is your daughter and she sits in front of the television right now it is commercial time and they are showing a commercial of the newest barbie doll they show the barbie in a beautiful pink car and everything looks ,6
17526," real the girl who is playing with the barbie seems to be its best friend  and they talk about their holidays and do lots of entertaining things
",20
17527," in this example it gets clear that the commercial was not very realistic but your daughter really believes that this barbie doll will be different than all the others she already owns she  wants to have such a friendship and that is only possible with this barbie doll
on the other ",20
17528," the advertisement gives the girl some ideas of stories that she could expierience with this barbie doll her fantasy gets some thinking boosts and if the parents give the right direction to this fantasy maybe the girl will have much more fun playing
an other thing is that the commercial seems  to have some prejudicies because it is a girl who plays with the doll boys maybe would ",0
17529," like to play with barbie dolls but if you only hear barbie doll together with the expectation that girls play with them a boy will not play with one on his o
",20
17530, a tv commercial can have negative ,10
17531, like that the child believes all the promises that the advertisement tells and it can be very disapointed if it gets the product and realizes that it can not talk or it does not even move or drive a car the parents ,2
17532, play an important role in helping the child understand the commercial and having the right expectations about the real product,0
17533,every evening thousands of children from all over watch television there are special children programs but even on them there is advertising but why children have to watch this shoud it even be forbidden to do advertising s young chidren in the following text ,14
17534," show some pros and cons an my opinion 
one reason why chidren shouldnt have to watch it is that they even dont have money to buy something the advertisment on the television is just for adults and it is planed that the children ask their parents to buy something theyve seen in the advertisment for instance if a little girls sees an pink fluffy unicorn in an advertisment she cries ",14
17535, the parents buy it for her it is influence and not fair children shoud enjoy their lives ,9
17536, they can nobody like to watch advertisment and everybody is angry ,11
17537, it comes during a film from year to year there is more and more when it goes on like this we wont watch something else on tv and ,6
17538," even our children should have the choise watch something else 
on the other ",17
17539, later they are anyway confronted with this world it would be nice to stop the advertisment on television but it is unthinkable we live in a word full of advertisment and marketing adults and adolecent have to watch it too it doesnt hurt a ,14
17540, four year old boy to see it on the tv yes its influence and perhaps boring but not dangerous and their parents are ,6
17541," old enough to say no if they dont want to buy anything if the parents dont want their children to watch it they can forbid them to watch all kind of television 
in conclusion advertisment s young children doent make any sense in my opinon it can be allowed but it is useless ",13
17542, with the statemant there are a lotof complex problems surounding it i shall start with an example from our past in england in the 1950s television only just started gaining mass popularity at the time there were only about two tv channels to choose from bbc 1 bbc 2 and possibly bbc 3 they all were funded by the government and didnt ,10
17543, have to have advertising to be able to fund themselves this all changed ,11
17544, commercial tv station was born this was inherently a good thing as it offered another choice ,10
17545," to the bbc channels but it was a subject to heavy critisism because of the commercials people asked the same question as today whether or not it should be alowed to advertise directly to their children but there was a major difference ads were hidden directly into childrens tv shows for example you could be wathing the flintstones and suddently one of the characters would pull out a pack of cigarets and start sellig it to your children this fluid ads were quickly banned as all other ads seemed much better and less agresive people learned to live with them 
in todays age things are more complicated as many children even aged  are actualy able to buy thing on their own ",14
17546, it means using their parents phone or credit card this ,9
17547, makes the problem more important this ,21
17548, doesnt only apply to tv ,10
17549, to the internet and games aimed at children probably th biggest ,23
17550, for keeping the things the way they are is that buissnises have to somehow make money the children market is huge and advertising to it is mostly a safe bet it mostly comess down to watching over your children and keeping and eye on what they do and watch,2
17551, television advertising to children isnt good because they alsways want to have what they see in the advertising and almost it is not as good as in the advertising so parents buy things for their children to make them happy and ,14
17552, the children play once or twice with it and ,20
17553, it becomes uninteresting and boring but ,18
17554," the parents say no you wont get it we dont by this game because you wont play with it the children are angry with the parents
on the other ",20
17555," the advertising could be good for parents if theyre looking for christmas or birthday presents they could find something good because adults can more see the differences between fantasy and reality they could better imagine how the games are without the animals or faries in the advertising
some people think that television is bad for children even ",14
17556, they look a film or a serie because theyre ,6
17557, focused on the screen that they becomes agressive ,3
17558," parents turn off the tv
other people say that looking films can be positive because children learn something new

in my opinion in the advertising it looks always great but ",6
17559, you buy it it is much more worse for me the advertising for children is okay but i think it should be more realistic and with less fantasy,20
17560,i must honestly say that i never saw an advertising  children aged  and ,16
17561, doesnt make sense to produce such advertisings because children dont or shouldnt spend more time watching television than their parents moreover children cant really react on the advertisings because they dont have money to buy something by themselves ,14
17562, the goal of an advertising isnt reached anyway but if it should be allowed or not is the other question in my opinion its a bit mean to show children things they would like to have or like to do but they have not the chance to buy it by themselves but i wouldnt forbid it beacause its the parents exercice to control their children ,16
17563, watching television children shouldnt watch television anyway they should go out and play with other childen ,17
17564," there isnt any problem with advertisings 
all in all ",11
17565, this isnt a subject that is important to discuss because like i said in the ,21
17566, important for the people in community that we cant live without televison from time to time the children started watching television earlier in their lifes  but television for young children isnt in every situation something good with the television children are able to learn a lot there are a lot of tv programms in which children can learn a lot about animals and the nature etc with the televiosion they are using their time with learning new things and dont vasting their time in some cases is it ,17
17567, useful to help learning a language but there are ,18
17568, they can lose their sozial connection to other persons if they are only watching tv they dont go out and play with some other children ,17
17569, ist that they can developp an addiction to the television if they are addicted they will not be interested in other things what could be a problem for their future an other problem of television is that tv isnt really for 100 exactly we dont realize that but our brain for example the sound and the movement of the lips from the persons in tv ,17
17570, the have a dialog or something like that isnt exactly to the same time the timing is not correct our brain realize that and in this young years of the children the brain can save a lot of informations and ,24
17571, this timing isnt for 100 correct they dont learn ,19
17572, a language it is more useful to learn a language ,21
17573, the children listen to a person who read a book in this language in our age we dont realize ,8
17574, that it is mor useful for young children if they watch not a lot tv or start to watch ,6
17575, they are seven or older they learn more ,24
17576, the play with other children or listen to persons who read something for them in my opinion is it completly unnecessary ,8
17577, children start watching tv with two years ,17
17578, that television advertesing  shouldnt be allowed      ,15
17579,we are living in a world where we are constantly under the influences of the media especially advertising belongs to our everyday live and there is hardly anyone who does not get affected by it because of that there is a lot of critism going on where do we have to draw a line shoud it be aloud to direct adertisement toward all people in this essay i will display the ,15
17580," of television advertising 

a salesmen would say ",10
17581, it doesnt do any harm and ,4
17582," there are many perks to it young children should see what the world holds and they should be able to grasp the wealth and luxury that adults do also they are easily influenced to buy something and can talk their parents into purchasing things 

on the other ",8
17583," we have concerned parents and caring grandparents who say that their children and grandchildren shouldnt be constantly on the line for such things children should be protected from those influenes that pressure them into buying things that they dont necessarly want or need 

",9
17584, that television advertising s children shouldnt be allowed because as a child you cant really differenciate between you wishes desires and necessities and ,13
17585, it is unfair to pressure them or their parents into buying things on the other ,9
17586, that it is over all the parents responsibility to protect their children by limting their vulnerability and setting rules to the usage of television ,17
17587, as other medias but those parents could be easily helped by setting a law,12
17588,"everywhere are advertiments mostly there are only pictures but in television advertisment includes moving pictures parents who havent time to play with their children put them in front of the tv all day the advertiser knows that with their clips they can influence this children

children who spend their leasuretime watching television see a lot of bullshit not only the advertising some series for children try to support the enfantil development but mostly they arent really helpfull the children believe what the television say is true and if an advertisment says that it is super cool to have this car they think their life can only be cool with this car the one who complains about the advertisment directed torward childern are the parents but if they dont let their children sit the whole afternoon in front of the tv the children wouldnt even see the advertisment 

if the children dont spend their time sitting in front of the tv  advertisning torward children aged  wouldnt be a problem the parents could ",14
17589, limit the tv time down to one episode ,1
17590," there wont be any andvertising

the game producer  not computergames has to bring his stuff to the people the parents mostly buy their chilrdern what they want to have the easiest way to make children believe they want something is television advertising in the eye of the producer this is the only way to sell their stuff ",20
17591," the children saw something they want they are telling it their parents and they are buing it

in my opinion the real problem is that the children are spending to much time in front of the tv i dont see a problem in the advertising torward children
",14
17592,"
in the weekends i take guard to my five year old niece and sometimes we want to watch some tv escpecially the childrens programebefore the climax of the plot we are interrupted by annoying advertisers the problem is that they are not for childrens eyes and i have to cover them i feel ashamed because it is not that late i would propose that children in this age should not be directed advertised because the content is sexualized 


the advertising has changed they are more sexualized content ",16
17593," in the childrens programcartoons aquire costumers for their toy and the appearance is not childlike that could be a danger for the growing up of the children because they children are in these phase naive and see a model in them that view can cause conflicts between the children and the parents which can in worst case loose their control 

second the language is developping in this time and if they hear ",20
17594, curse words from the ad it could have ,11
17595," for their language skills in the future the direct communication between children and ads is powerful and influences the language the produces use it for their profit but forget the impacts for their young costumers 

at the end it would be my advise to the advertisers to make theyproduct more childlike becuse it could have serious impacts for their later consumers the children ",16
17596, censoring is not effective to fit in for the childrens growing up would be much more sustainable ,12
17597,during the life a person earns a lot of knowledge by making mistakes and by making it better the ,21
17598, time every person learns from experiences he or she made from adventures he or she had and from spending time for thinking about things in life as more experiences as you make as more you build your own opinions about things in life children between two and five years dont have a lot of experiences they ,8
17599, live in their own world where everything is great and sweet and they dont know any danger or influencing people or advertisment they believe almost everything you tell them in case of that a television advertising which is  makes no sense and shouldnt be allowed because theyre too naã¯ve and to young to make own decisions ,2
17600," a young boy aged three years would be scared about a telephone call with a unknown person who wants to sell a him something first of all the child would ask itsself why this unknown person wants a telephone conversation with him and not with his parents as usual
the seller would just use this little guy for making money by influencing him with fascinating toys and sweet animals its ",20
17601, much easier to influence young children than adults because adults know that the unknown person at the telephone promises false ,7
17602, about the product he wants to sell i absolutely dont ,23
17603, unfair for the young children im sure that ,12
17604," parents wouldnt be fascinated about a television advertising which is  their children 
otherwise its very intelligent of the unknown person to influence young children with their call they really know how to make money

but im ",14
17605, against a television advertising towards young children ,13
17606, with this statement but at the otherside ,21
17607," we cant forbit children watching televison

i have grown up in the year 1999 and my little brother in the year 2004 there are only five years between usbut ",17
17608," many things are completely diffrent for example the consum of social media 
so many children dont go out for playing football or to meet other children i see less children outside than ever ",24
17609, and if my little brother asked his friendsif they wanted to come outside for playing football they didnt wanted to come because they prefered to stay at home to play their video games they wanted to stay at hometo watch the television or wantend to play with their new i phone they had their own friends in their computerworld  and ,24
17610," sad when i was in that age i played football or volleyball with all my friends outside and my parents forbidden me watching the tv the whole afternoon 
my opinion is that it is totally okay if children aged  watch television but their parents should set limits because small children cant say whats good for them but their parents know it and they should only permit their children to watch movies or series that arent scary or something like that 
i know that ",17
17611," many partents dont see what kind of movies their children watch and thats terrible 

but i kow there is nothing that we can do the world is dominated by the new technology and this technology is getting better and better the new genaration needs a  sream everywhere it doesnt matter if this is an i phone where they can watch tv or if this isa television ",17
17612,in my opinion children should not be able to watch advertisements in television one explicit reason is that the influence on children is much stronger than on an average adult children tend to soak everything up they see and every thing they see can change their personality or influence their personal developement kids who experience terrible things in their childhood are more likely to get into any kind of addiction that is why a child who sees some advertisements aldready starts to think in a way that takes consumtion for granted but this is not true consumtion as we do it today is not eternal and ,14
17613, should not be promoted especialy not in front of a child who is not able to think critical ,12
17614,"

these advertisements directed  may even be a danger for their parents because the persons who produce these advertisements do not care about the children they care about their parents money so if a child wants something out of an advertisement he starts to beghis mother to buy him ",16
17615, a new toy this scenario can have two different ends rhe ,18
17616, end would be that his mother doesnt want to buy him a new toy this might cause some troubles the ,20
17617," end would be that his mother buys him his toy so she supports the consumtion promoted from people who make a living out of abusing our world

in conclusion ",20
17618, that unless you are a person who does not care about children you shouldnt allow advertising directed ,13
17619," about my little 4yearold brother watching tv and wanting me to come and look on the advertise on tv because he wants to have this new playmobilcar i do have my concerns about television advertising towards young children
but lets start over
television advertising makes people wanting to buy things and maybe ",13
17620, some stuff they do not really need or know what to use them for so ,3
17621," advertise influences us a lot 
the influence is not really based on the age but what is based on it is the reaction on this wish 
adults can handle their wishes much better than children can kids live absolutely in the moment and they do not care whether they need a new playmobilcar or not they just want to have it and ",0
17622," the try to convince the parents to buy them this car
now it is the responsability of the parents to show them why they can or cannot have a new playmobilcar children need an adult to make the rational decision and cannot do it by themselves adults can but sometimes it uses to be very hard to face the truth that one really does not need to buy this 

when ",20
17623, again about my brother wanting somthing he has seen on television it can be very annoying ,20
17624," shouting and sometimes crying just to get me to buy him this thing 
so in such a situation ",18
17625, that television advertising direted toward young children should not be allowed but if we think rational we recognize that ,13
17626, we do forbit television advertising towards young children we need to forbit the advertising towards adults too because children somehow have the ,13
17627, that their parents that are more neutral that the kids are can decide ,7
17628, adults are influenced by advertises they do not need to ask someone and ,2
17629," maybe they buy things faster than a kid can convince his parents 

in conclusion ",2
17630, that television advertising s yound childre do not have to be forbidden because it is anyway not that healthy to watch too much tv and parents should be able to handle their childrens wishes and decide rationally i ,13
17631, think that if it really were a problem one had to forbit advertise in front of stores too because if advertisting is a problem at all ,11
17632, it should be elliminated everywhere,4
17633,television advertising is something we see a lot ,10
17634, we watch tv it is a way to promote new products and make it appealing enough ,10
17635, that people want to buy it often it does work because a lot of adults and ,23
17636," children watch enough television to encounter these 

television advertising  has its positive and negatif ",14
17637, if someone promotes a product for little children like ,16
17638, a new toy the children can talk to their parents and maybe they will buy it for them therefore the children are used by the promoters to get the parents spending money on something they have seen in television at the end children get influenced a lot by television and the producers gain a lot of money from this promoting something over television can ,0
17639, children see things they have never seen ,24
17640," and maybe they want to try out something new and exciting 

as for negatif ",3
17641, the children just follow what the guys in the television say and ,6
17642, they dont really think that hard about it if its right or wrong therefore ,3
17643, that adults who are not their parents or family should not meddle in a life of a child and decide fot it which toy it wants to have or not except it is dangerous ,12
17644, it should have the right to choose though if a friend of one of the children has got a new toy and the other child wants it its ,12
17645, a way of promoting the new toy but at least the child saw it in real and ,20
17646," in a screen

in conclusion ",18
17647, its fine to use television advertising for children but one should consider that children ,14
17648," should be able to choose by themselves if they want something or not i would prefer it if they could choose what they want in an actual store
",23
17649,"is television advertising for young children good or bad this is a question for parents which is realy important in the education of their children

first of all i have to say that young children in the age between two or five shouldnt watch television alone ",14
17650," for example children in the age of two they have better things to do as watching something in the tv they can play with toys or they can go outside with their mother but they shouldnt sit inside and watch tv

if the kids turn older ",17
17651," in the age of five than they can watch sometimes their series which they love but only the series and not the advertising between them 
",6
17652, often the advertising in the tv isnt for ,10
17653, little children because mostely the advertising is for older children or for parents ,16
17654, this isnt good to see by the young children on the otherside this children see the advertising and ,16
17655, that they want the thing who they have seen for example they see a new toy and ,3
17656," that they go to the parents and want that they will buy this toy so the parents have always this nerving children which want something 

the advertising in tv is often on a deep niveau and hasnt much background also it isnt very intelligent so for the education of the children its not very helpful

finally ",0
17657, that the children in the age of two or three shoudnt watch tv and the older kids can watch tv but only one serie of propably twenty minutes and ,17
17658, that they have to turn of the television so they stop watching ,10
17659, they can see the advertising so ,11
17660, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed ,15
17661,today the spectrum of diffrent television advertisings is huge there are advertisings for man and woman ,10
17662," as for every age including young children but are those advertisings s young children a good influance or do they even have such a negative influance towards children that they should be forbidden
advertisings ",16
17663, about food do not always tell the truth and can have a negative impacked towards the health of the children for example the advertising about nutella says that their product makes a healthy start in the day what is clearly not true young children are not able to judge wheter the told stuff is true or not but ,2
17664," that the perants should tell them and look for the health of their children and tell them the truth about what advertisings make children believe 
but ",16
17665," the television advertising should not be allowed what kind of advertising would be between children movies it is not reliable to show them advertisings made for adults because they could scare the children and could cause an even worse influance than children advertising 
in my opinion advertising towards young children does not need to be forbitten every advertising influance people ",14
17666, all advertisings should be forbitten or not it is not a good option to show children advertisings made for adults because they can have an as worse influance as those made for children,16
17667,in todays society advertising is a big part of television these advertisment target different types of people and interests and as it comes some ,11
17668," target young children between two and five years old obviously this brings several problems with it and the question is if advertisment  should be permitted or not 
first of all advertisment is a way to earn money by making people buy the things which are showed in this advertisment a big amount of companies use this tool what results in a big competition because of this competition each company tries to specializes themselves for one type of costumer taking that to consideration it is only logical that some are targeting young kids to prevent having a big competition what maximises their income 
however making advertisment meant for young children brings a probelm with it these children are victims of the tactics of several companies they know that children are an easy and vulnerable target because they are not advanced in their evolvement ",16
17669," children are not able to evaluate situations like we adults do despite this knowledge the advertiser is ruthlessly using those children therefore young childrens from age  are a victim of advertisement and should be protected 
in order to sell a product many companies are using advertisment to make it look better over time the competition between those companies gets bigger and new targets have to be found  the kids in their early stage of growth they are a good target and easily influenced they are ",16
17670, victims in order to preotect them advertising  should be banned let the innocent young humans be safe and free from things which they are not able to handle ,16
17671, talk about my opinion to tv advertisements which are  there are many different types of advertisements some are pretty funny and some are just stupid and id wish they are taken offline immediately because i dont like my time being wasted of stupid ads which tell me lies about prices or ,15
17672, there are too many lies and wrong ,21
17673, shown in tv the internet or just on a screen in public the older we get the better we can make differences about true or false information but children cannot do this and ,7
17674, their thurst of knowledge they believe pretty much everything ,3
17675, the information is completely wrong they get a wrong information and believe in this ,3
17676, they are told there should clearly be set a difference between ads for children which contain maybe a game or an idea for their christmas wish and ads for older people which know whats wrong or whats true but not ads from greenpeace or wwf in what awful conditions our planet is cause they are mostly showing only the bad or good ,16
17677, and chilren get a completely wrong opinion of it when they get such informations they should be teached about the whole subject and ,21
17678," one part of it 
anyway ",19
17679, adverstisements are a waste of money and recources the companys got for example the coca cola advertisement there was made a study where people were shown a coca cola advertisement in the cinema and they were asked which drink they had bougt in the break the advertisement didnt change their opinion at allthe companies would better spend some more of their in exploring new technologies to reduce the carbon footprint of everybody in here especially our children which dont need those advertisement will be thankful to us having at least tried to save their future,11
17680," it depends on the specific situation it plays a rule what the children are looking at the television if they are looking ah childrenseries for their ages than it should be allowed to look television but not to often 
every day looking television is to much for their ages but one or time times in the week should be allowed because ",17
17681, it is possible to learn of looking televison their are many series or movies which have something usefull to leran ,6
17682," for young kids it should be find a combination between looking television and doing more other things in the free time reading or at this age looking books is more important or better than looking the whole time television but a little bit looking would be possible

it is okey to looking a little bit televisionbecause for one reason the children have for a little time something to do the parents can do in the same time other things they mustnt look really hard of the children and the children can ",17
17683," learn intressting things and they can see new things which they wouldnt see without looking television

it should be something special for the young kids the parents shouldnt allowed their kids to looking often television the children should have the feeling that looking television is special and not something you can do every time 

so ",17
17684," should be that the children are allowed to looking television but only movies or films which are for their ages and they can look only not often television

",17
17685,"the question if television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not is actually discussed very much it is a question which have many different opinions 

some people say that television advertising  is the key to a good childhood and they say it is good that they can watch television and ",14
17686," the parents have more freetime for parents it is very hard to have a child which is aged between  so to let them watch television is a good option to have a bit of freetime

but the other ",17
17687, says that to let a child aged  watch advertising television is not good for the child then in this time the mother is not there and the child do not get love also many people say that for the education and for the developpment of the child it is very bad to watch television ,17
17688," you habe a age like this so they can become bad at school or bad in their job later

all in all we see that there are many supporters that kids aged  can watch advertising television because ",14
17689, the parents can get a bit of freetime but there are ,1
17690," many proposers which say that it is not good for the developpment of the child now the question is if there will be soon a law for this case
",4
17691,"advertising

it is known that children like to watch cartoons or other tvshows which mach their age the producers of these tvprogramms know that its helping their company if they show a lot of advertising  because they get money from the other companies for showing their products to children the question is should that be allowed doesnt it count as manipulation

everyone knows the reaction of a little girl who sees a pretty doll on televison or a young boy who sees a nice electronic car they run to their parents and ask them if they could buy it for them most of the parents arent ready to do ",14
17692, where the disappointment comes in the children start to cry or get angry and that ,7
17693," every single advertisment in other words it slowly ruins their character 
unfortunatelly an other reaction is jealousy a child sees another child playing with the one toy it desperatelly wanted to have the child which is jealous could start to think about stealing the toy what would be even worse it leads to a bad life with no job no money or even going to prison 
on the other ",2
17694, it could make them more interested in working and earning their own money ,9
17695," they get older furthermore it makes them more and more independend and it helps them to get through their life on their own 

in my opinion they shouldnt allow showing advertisments towards young children the children shouldnt watch televison that much at all because its better for their health ",14
17696, they play outside with their friends they shouldnt care about what they have or they dont have they should enjoy their life ,3
17697, its okay if they get presents but they shouldnt be spoiled with gifts and toys because that would be bad for their character and they wouldnt come ,20
17698," far with this way of thinking 
",19
17699,advertising can be really abboying for exemple ,11
17700, you want to watch a youtube video about cars and you have to watch a clip about a datingwebsite ,18
17701," but for parents can it be even worse because not they get trapped by advertising there kids do 
when you get odler you learn to understand the differents between what you need and what you would like to have and you know what you are able to afford you have the ability to decide what you want to spend your money for for young children thats diffrent they do not know how to handle money they can not really tell the differents between what they want and what they need so they are great victims for advertising but the problem is they havent even the money to buy it ",2
17702, the real victims of advertising  are their parents they have to deal with crying babys because they refuse to buy them a new toy maybe they really would like to buy it for their children but they cant afford it can be heartbreaking if they see them being sad another possibility would be if the parents already have problems to show dominance and it gets even more difficult ,0
17703," they see new stuff on television all the time
so its a question about ",6
17704, important for us do we want free economic possibilities or do we want to help the parents raise the ,9
17705," generation
for me its definitly the ",18
17706, its already a big challenge to be a parent and we do not have to make it more difficult for them by using little children without experience as their weakness,7
17707,"in this essay i am writing about television advertising  the question is are this kinds of adds okay or should it not be allowed

in my opinion it is totally okay to show children things like that because for the economics it is importent to catch money from the kids i mean ",14
17708, a kid likes a new toy from the television spot ,20
17709, it askes for it by the parents and if the parents are grateful and have enough money to buy it them go for it but ,9
17710, they havent got enough money why should the spend money on a television for the kids it is important that a country can earn enough money and ,17
17711," go for the children a full school career costs a lot for a country and why shouldnt give them some money back

i can understand a father who doesnt like these kind of adverts but ",9
17712," he has to search the problem by his salary maybe he has to make rules how much a child can spend on toys the kids have to learn how to spend money but the main problem isnt television advertising a good father is someone who loves to spend money for their kids because nothing makes him more happier than a happy face of his child

we have to look at this theme from two ",9
17713, is a worker at a toy industrie the other one is a broke human because the own kid costs a lot i just realised that i made the whole essay wrong but what can i do ,18
17714," the description in written in german

a good ",18
17715, for adverts in the television is that everybody from the economic ,10
17716, profites a negative statement is that a kid gets influenced even ,7
17717, the can think alone they cannot build their own opinion for the guy who reads this youre wasting your time haha im sorry but i dont know what i should write anymore  im sitting here and i am waiting until the 30 minutes are done i ,19
17718," think tha i am wasting my time

",18
17719, a human never gets mature only the toys are getting more expensive,20
17720,children that are  years old often decide things they want by looking many companies that sell products for young children advertise their products on many media platforms but the most popular platform is the television many children are allowed to watch an episode of children program ,2
17721," teletubbies or dora the explorer inbetween the program the television company often show advertisements for games or other things that young children like
 
if these companies would not advertise their products the market for toys would breakdown let me illustrate this ",0
17722, a young boy saw a lego product in an advertisement now this young boy wants this lego toy because the advertisements attracted him what the boy ,20
17723," does is to ask the parents if he could have this toy as many parents only wnat the best for their children they buy everything the child wants this means that they spend a lot of money as a result of this the parents support the economy in the country they live in

a ",20
17724," is that young children get used to the money system that exists in the whole world it starts to realise that you need to have money to buy things this means that the child learns how to use money

all in all i ",8
17725, with the statement that was mentioned above because with advertisements children and their parents support the local economy the children ,0
17726, learn how to use money which is very helpful once they are older,24
17727," thing that comes in my mind reading this statement is that there are only toy companies which advertise towards young children advertisement are here to attract a specific group of people to buy something what else  would a child desire than toys 
we all now young children like to scream and cry if they do not get what they want immediately it would ",2
17728," be a nightmare for parents if their child wishes for a toy  it just saw on the tv and starts to cry because the toy does not magically appear
but the parents should not just shut down the television for their child nowadays the tv plays a major role in our society ",20
17729," during the childhood the cartoons and the earlymorning serie cheers every child up the advertisement shows a child what is up and popular these days
there may be some conspiracies that advertisements have hidden manipulative effects and are ",0
17730," a bad influence on children it might be far fetched but humans in this young stage of life are the most influencal and they can easily be convinced to something that would be one of the greates fears for overprotective parents
in conclusion people should be less paranoid about the advertisement having a bad influence on their child most of the advertising are for toys and there is probably no evil mastermind behind the screen who tries to manipulate the child from an ad parents should be more concerned about their child browsing the internet 
",16
17731,"the aim of this essay is to clear the contovers statement television advertising  should not be allowed then nowadays more and more young children growing up in front of a tv so for many people leads this to problems and they want to disallowed it for young children

on the one ",14
17732, the children are very interessted by the tv ,17
17733," they can stay hours in front of the tv and watch children series that makes it very easy for parents and they can do other important work or clean the house 

but ",1
17734, children should go outside and have fun with other children or play with the parents ,8
17735," sitting inside in front of tv if children only sit inside in front of the tv they will lose there social conactions to other people and there social skils will disappear 

in my opinion this ban for young children is a good idea because children should play with other children ",12
17736," watching tv but how should this ban work how can we contoll it 



 

",12
17737,in many households the televisions are daily on and the children are sitting ,17
17738," those every time is it better if the children aged  cant watch television anymore
 
in our time childs are often confronted with televisions or smartphones ",17
17739, that some parents just sit there kids ,7
17740, the television because for they it is easyer to handle and they mustnt play with the kids and can do other things ,1
17741," the household 

first of all children have to explore the world in nature and have to learn to speak to use the language they can play together but if they are watching tv they do not play and practice there voice they just hear the language on the other ",17
17742, many stories or series have a moral end or they could learn about the things theyve watched but ,6
17743, that the children are to young to learn about those another ,7
17744, is that they cant make mistakes and learn from those if theyre watching tv when they are outside and ,17
17745, fall from a trampolin they learn that they have to be more concentraded ,19
17746, that it should be alloud that children could watch tv but ,17
17747, that the parents have to think more about how long their kids are sitting ,8
17748, it and to chose what their watching and not just sit the children ,12
17749, it because it is more comfortable for those and for the parents it should be clear that it is really important to play with the kids and be outside in nature   ,12
17750,while most people are quite anoyed of them but ,19
17751, have to accept them there are ,19
17752, parts of it which have to be discused we are talking about commercials and in this case if it should be forbidden to advertise directly  in the age  an essay by me and myself idk if im allowed to wright my name ,15
17753, it is clear that commercials try to manipulate us to make us believe that we need something which we sometimes do not really need at al and it should be ,10
17754, as young as  are realy easy to manipulate and ,24
17755, it is right to say that companys should not make use of the naivity of young children the problem resulting out of this is that children want things ,2
17756, bad which can get verry annoying for parents just imaging your children all the time screaming for the new mega super duper action power figurine but it can ,4
17757, lead to other problems it can change the view about certain products i mean just look back at the old malboro commercials the malboro man was one of the coolest guys a lot of adults can remember nowadays and people start to conect beeing a cool person to smoking ,4
17758," you probably know how bad it is for you and your body so you see that the wrong commercials in front of the wrong persons can cause many problems

but ",11
17759, there are a lot of problems at the question how to make sure the youngest of us do not recieve theese commercials i mean we can not stop streaming commercials in television nor can we stop hanging them at walls etc because that would mean to have no commercials at all an this is definetly not in the sence of companies and ,14
17760, most commercials are stupid and not really necesairy there are ,11
17761, some which could be verry helpfull and yeah for children that is probalby a playdoh clown which can grow his own hair but the ,18
17762, birthday will come and it is good to know what you want it is ,18
17763, usefull for parents which would not have any idea what to give their childs and last but not least ,8
17764, it would make things worse if you didnt see comercials until you are five and suddenly all these influences no one would be prepared and companies would benefit of your naitivity even stronger than ,7
17765, it is not necesairy to change anything about our commercial system as it runs right nowmy myself i used to watch a lot of commercials and ,10
17766, it didnt really hurt me at all sure as a kid i would liked to have all these toys but as you get older you start to see trough all these promeses and great looking products and start to see what you realy need and ,20
17767, it can be verry helpfull to see this laptop for just 150â£ which could replace the one you just totally destroyed the day ,18
17768, because you decided to accidentaly throw your softdrink all over it but well that is just my own view about it thank you for reading ,18
17769,television advertising is one of ,10
17770," advertising methods because most people watch television even if they know what the aim of advertisement is they are influenced by it and buy often things they saw in television advertising but children shouldnt be influenced 

young children shouldnt watch television at all they could be confused by the ",14
17771," that the audio doesnt fit to what they see the audio is always slightly delayed advertisement s the children doesnt help it makes them even more addicted to the screen maybe they dont understand what advertisement is but they see things they would like to have they would watch the television more often because they enjoy seeing puppies or something else

children cant buy things they see in the advertisement the parents will decide if they buy ",14
17772, a puppy or not the children would ,9
17773," try to convince their parents but the adults dont buy everything their children want it would be more useful to direct television advertisement towards the parents if they think it would be great for the children to have something they will buy it

",2
17774, that young children shouldnt watch television but this is the responsibility of the parents if they dont allow watching television it isnt necessary to forbid television advertising s children because they wont see it ,13
17775," way also directing advertisement towards children aged  isnt useful because the children have no money so my opinion is that the parents shouldnt let their children watch television 

",14
17776,"television advertising 
television manipulation is known ",10
17777, the television itself people are tricked with commercials and advertising because this is the easiest way to get them buying or making something everybody can be manipulated but as humans grow up they can think difrently and ask themself whether it is right or not children at the age of five can not decide such things ,10
17778," whith the satement but this is caused by a complete different reason

first of all we have to decide wether advertising towards  year olds makes sense at all their brains are on the developing state of any other aduld animal ",16
17779, a cat or a mouse these animals can be manipulated very well this is ,19
17780, showed in several tests where the hunger and the instinct of surviving is used to force the test object to do anything the difference between humans and other animals is that humans can reflect themselfs and ask who we are the earliest hildhood memories date around the age of three this means young children are not more than any other animal not reflecting its own actions as we look at these things from this ,8
17781, of view advertising towards these little children is ,16
17782, i ask myself why are children in front of a television in the ,17
17783, place whst is the meaning of childhood the meaning of life ,8
17784, it is wasted in front of a television humans do not think in the logic way they are teached to think ten years additional to the life of a 30 years old is just a quarter of the whole life for a ten year old the life span is doubbeled s time seems to strech as we get older what is ,1
17785, the case because with every ,21
17786, you get a smaller piece of the time you already got as we go ,18
17787, we see that a pretty short span in front of a television is a huge amount of time for younger people childhood is one of ,17
17788," times in the life of a human being it can be used better than just in front of a televison its not bad to watch a movie sometimes with the parents but in this case there is no advertising and the discussion is wothless

to summerise i can say that ",17
17789,"it is well known that a lot of brands would do everything to get more clients and obviously to earn more money a lot of companies spend tons of money for a good advertition campagne but is it okay to direct television advertising towards young children
first television advertising  can be very useful for brands because children dont think as much as adults do ",14
17790, they see an advertisement children just think that ,16
17791, the toy they see in the advertisement is funny to play with ,20
17792, they want to have it and they probably tell their parents the ,3
17793, time they see the toy in a store or ,20
17794," their birthday is coming up and theyre asked for their wishes this can really help companies to earn money and there are companies which only run thanks to this
on the other ",3
17795, television advertising for young children can be dangerous and confusing for them sometimes in television advertisments things are happening which cant possibly happen in real life younger children may not understand that and ,14
17796," suddenly get scared of their toys coming to life even worse they may try to copy certain actions which they see in an advertisment on television this can lead to very dangerous situations like children trying to climb out of the window or stand on a high wall
after my opinion television advertising  should be forbidden ",14
17797, they are too young to understand certain things and can easily misunderstand what they see as a better option i would advice the companies to make good advertisments directed to parents because ,2
17798, they know that they get something good for their children ,9
17799,should television advertising  be allowed first of all it helps the children to understand the world in a funny way on the other ,15
17800, they arent playing on the outside ,19
17801, they are watching television therefore they are ,19
17802, lying on the couch television can help in education but only ,17
17803," it isnt too much

children are learning the most ",8
17804, they are having fun or are interested in something while playing with their siblings or watching their favourite show they are having fun and ,24
17805," learning something new most television advertising for young children are made for this sole reason  the educate the children

but ",14
17806, they are watching tv and learning something about the colours they are missing the trees and flowers outside the connection to the green parts of the world is missing and that at a ,6
17807, in time where this could be humanitys downfall when the little ones arent interested in mother earth who protects it ,7
17808," from global warming

not only are they missing a huge part of nature and memories it is ",19
17809, not good for the body ,4
17810, there is no movement in the childhood the muscles dont build up and ,24
17811," metabolism is suffering also they wont play soccer in the neighbours garden and probably wont be as interested in sports as the older generations where sports was the only free time activity

in the end ",24
17812, this subject isnt as black and white as it might seems yes ,21
17813, children are learnig a lot during watching tv and they like to learn something this way on the other ,6
17814, you musnt underestimate the huge part nature and sport plays in all our lifes best would be if parents and siblings are doing some advertising together in the garden which is fun ,0
17815, the role of the television isnt needed any longer,10
17816,"the question is simple like a monster is disguise
should child equipment be directly advertised

it doesnt matter if the families are wealthy
we all ",2
17817," that televivion is unhealthy

but does the young age of toddlers affect
the televisions unhealthy effect

ive never been a good essay writer
but ",17
17818," i write raps i appear brighter

we all ",18
17819," that theres no recipe
for right behavior on tv
you know its better not to mess with me
cause i can be your worst enemy

a negative part about advertisement
is that in tv there arent many wise men
because all they care about is finance
",10
17820," about it i get frightened

not to mention that its all a big contest
and that the black boxes are like bombshells

we can see the result in their notes
how the stupidity explodes

but ",19
17821," it doesnt stop the evolution
",19
17822," about it writing my conclusion
forbidding it seems to me very useless

i dont know who i wrote this for

where i keep my core
my holy source of rhymes thats ",18
17824,young children do not have full conscience and can easily be manipulited often they can not know if the things that are shown in an advertising are true or can be true for example the advertising for kinderschokolade is ckeay  kids they see laughing and happy children eating this chocolate and giving them ,16
17825, they think in real life ,3
17826, they are afterwards as happy and as powerful like the kids in the advertising so they go to their parents and want them to buy this product in this case kinderschokolade the parents themselves would not have bought it but ,2
17827," the littel children ask them with a dogregard they can not say no and buy it 
exactly the same pheomene is wiht the mcdonalds advertising for happymeal the kids see the fries and burgers und hear the yummysound and naive how they are think that it is very tasty and want to get the little dolls or whatever that is offered with the food so they go to theparents and ask them to go to mcdonalds with them to eat happymeal so the parents have to buy things the would normally not and the kids get fat
a positive ",2
17828, is that the economy augments because of the parents who have to buy things they do not really want to but they want to do a favour to their children so the eating and food companies profit from such advertisings  children ,2
17829," game and toy companies 
i ",20
17830, think that it is not right of the companies to lance such advertisings because the children at this age are not strong enough to not want to have the advertised stuff because normally children want to get everythin that makes them laughig and that seems to be very tasty they are too young to deciede if ,16
17831, advertised food is healthy or not if games are useful or make just dumb and aggressive or if they will ,23
17832, a week or if it is just nonsense that entertains two hours and ,6
17833," that it is just rubbish
",21
17834, it is not fair from the companies because of the children get just fat dumb aggressive nervous and want to get everything and the parents are nearly forceless beacause of they want to make their children happy and they often think that if the neighbours buy that stuff to for their kids it has to be good but effectively they spend their money mostly for rubbish,2
17835,nowadays advertisements are omnipresent you see them ,11
17836, you leave your home in the morning to go to workschool or university you see them ,18
17837, you are on your computer and surfing the internet and even ,18
17838, a long day and want to watch a movie there will always be commcercials everywhere and the ,1
17839," our technology develops the more we have to deal with a constant bombardement of advertisements or commercials 

so the question that posses itself is if it is okay to have global corporations ",23
17840, implanting our desires in our brain and where do you draw the line between advertisments and brain control if you take coca cola ,11
17841, a lot of studies have been made to show that it can cause serious health issues ,4
17842, you consume too much of it ,18
17843, bad teeth because of the sugar and other troubles you get ,4
17844, all the acids it contents so the question is where does the urge of these children who drink coca cola come from most likely ,4
17845, advertisements which are programming them from young age the goal of these big corporations is to generate an urge to consume their product in some way like a drug addict gets hooked on a substance and ,2
17846," needs more every time to achieve the same outcome 

to conclude i would state that it would be greatly contribute to our health ",21
17847, as an economic equality towards the people and a more natural development of a childs brain if it would be possible to stop advertisments towards young children sadly this wont be easily done because there are a lot of lobbies that need to make their ,16
17848, by staying in the game to grow bigger and bigger and make even more money no matter what the costs are ,23
17849, a child is growing up is common to everybody but in this society the children are confronted earlier with the media such like on the television mobile phone or on the computer while the parents let their children to watch childfriendly series on the tv there are ,24
17850, a lot of advertising but is it good for a  year old kid to look at ,20
17851," many advertisements
nowadays the children are being raised with much more attention and love than in the past its known that parents usually want only the best thing for their child for instance ",0
17852, a kid sees something interesting on the tv like a toy they want it and the parents buy this toy because they know the child is going to play with it so the parents have some free time and the kid can play with the toy and ,20
17853," with the creativity of themselves 
but ",19
17854, the advertisements have an big influence on the children not everything that appears on the tv is ,14
17855, good for your child today the opportunity to buy something is ,9
17856," big that means that the kids are constantly being confronted by advertisements on the tv its clear to everyone that children are children and dont think the way that adults do if they see something they want theyre going to do everything just to have that thing and with that behaviour theyre going to want everything they see theyll grow up with that behaviour and will be careless so the television advertising has an bigger influence on the future life of the children
nevertheless are televisions a part of the todays society children but we have to be carefull with how much time we spend or let our children spend with it the technology is moving forward but we should not forget that we have a real life to live",14
17857,"in the last few years there has been more and more advertisment on television for children younger than the age of five critcs say this shouldnt be allowed

children are easily influenced ",13
17858, adds might have an even bigger effect on them than they have on adults if they see something that looks cool on television they will probably desire it which could cause stress for their parents ,24
17859," they might not be able to afford it or just simply dont want to spoil their kids

on the other ",9
17860, selling things is always good for the economy and adds like this will increase sellings of toys ,20
17861, a lot of parents have trouble saying no to their children strengthening the economy might be advantagous to all people ,9
17862," it could increase the general living standars and might even lead to a reduction of taxes

furthermore television adds might even make things easier for parents around christmas time ",17
17863, their children will be able to pinpoint exactly what they want however i believe its ,9
17864, unusual for a child to have trouble finding a wish ,20
17865," that might be unnecessary

adds on television might promote things which do not fit in the parents moral priniciple for example there could be an advertisment for toy guns the parents might be against violence and could be shocked if their child suddenly exclaims a wish for a toy gun it might be harder to be firm in ones principle if the television influents the childrens mind strongly

personally ",14
17866, advertising directed to this age group shouldnt need to be prohibited it just shouldnt bring any profit parents should not allow their children to watch tv in such a young age they could let them watch a movie once in a ,13
17867, but only if the parents themselves are present for it there are ,9
17868, many ways to occupy a little kid ways that actually help the development of the brain and their ability to form relationships ,8
17869," watching tv could potentially cause damage to their psychological development
if parents would just not let their children watch tv adds for the younger audience would seize to exist ",17
17870, noone would profit from them anymore i firmly believe this would be the best ,23
17871,"essaytelevision advertising directed  toward young children should not be allowed

in one ",13
17872, is it not that good to make advertising  because the advertising industry want that the children love the item that is advertised for so the children go to their dad or mom to say that they want this toy or these awesome shoes that light up ,0
17873, you wear it in the age of  they believe what is said in the tv for example ,6
17874," an advertising comes on about shoes and they say that these can breathe because its geox the children believe that and obviously want that 
on the other ",2
17875, should advertising toward young children be allowed because the advertising industry should have the right to advertise the toys they sell to the children because for the industry its important that they can advertise their item ,16
17876, they make income in the advertisement they can lie a bit to make the item look better and for the children it looks cool ,2
17877," they convince their parents to buy it and with the cool comercial they made the item will be better sold out and that really works
in my opinion it should be allowed because i dont think that an advertisement is that bad for children if the parents dont want that the children dont have to watch tv i mean n",0
17878, is that it really shouldnt be allowed just because children of this age are easy to influence i mean how many times have we seen in our life that you just have to tell kids something and if you tell it with conviction they most likley will ,12
17879, with you and will tell it to other kids and these children are not really capable of analizing a commercial and forming their own opinions they just want it because it appeals to them or they dont i just dont feel like its good for children at this age to bombard them with ,2
17880," many commercial so maybe you shoudlnt prohibid them but reduce them 
but if i was a cmo of a company that sells childrens toys id say that we need these commercials because we need to give these kids the incentive to buy something respectively to tell their parents they want something if we cant promote our products no one really will since a lot of parents just buy their kids what they want but they dont tell them whats on the market
so as with everything there are two ",0
17881," that you can pick 
for me ",18
17882, i feel like these are ,19
17883, factors or at least the ones which came ,21
17884," the quickest  
i feel like we cant let the kids be bombarded with all these commercials etc i feel like we kind of need to protect them from our bad world they have enough time to ",1
17885, be bombarded later with all the adult stuff but one the other ,18
17886," i grew up with commercials and i dont feel like they damaged me in any way or maybe they did but i just dont know noticed it maybe we should do some research about that so we actually know what effect it has if it does have a effect
but ",14
17887, that business economy is a really important factor to i mean can a country really prohibid commercials directed twoards children companys need to be able to promote their product and through that actually sell them thats what lets our economy going,0
17888,first of all there is the main problem that advertising  children has the effect that they ask their parents to buy this toy they are interested in secondary there are some parents who arent able to buy these toys because of financial reasons ,2
17889," their chhildren could get very dissapointed in their parents if they dont follow their wishes if there arent enough financial resources in this family but the parents want to buy this toy for their children they maybe leave out a meal or something else to save money 

actually  advertising isnt the main problem but the ",2
17890, that children in the age of two till five years are spending to much time in front of the tv in that age there are many better ways to spend time than watching movies or tv ,17
17891, advertising isnt against the law if the advertised product is legal ,11
17892," there isnt any use of prohibitting advertising like this the advertiser doesnt target the children between two and five years they mainly advertise for their parents because they want them to buy some cool stuff for their kids so the true problem is that parents arent able to diside which toy would be suitable for their kids

personally im not against advertising for products for children because there woudnt be any space for playmobil etc to promote their products if not in tv so ",16
17893, for this problem would be to teach young couples and parents how they can decide which toy is a good one and which isnt in a short sentence i can say that there isnt any need to unallow advertising directed ,0
17894,nowadays it doesnt matter where you are everywhere you are confronted with advertising ,11
17895, in television in our society ,10
17896, young children are included they raise with the endless advirtising on tv channels which are made for children they show advertising which are ,14
17897," of advertising towards young children is that it can increase the wish of receiving presents from their parents when they are about to watch a tv serie for children its not possible that they wont watch the advertising too they see toys games and other stuff in the advertising which they automatically want to receive from their parents they would not have wanted it if they have not watched the things in the advertising

television advertising towards young children can ",0
17898, be positive it can influence their behaving in a good way when they watch an advertising about a toy they dont just see the toy for itself they ,0
17899," see how children play together with it and how they treat eachother through that children can learn social competences and learn early how you have to behave yourself in our society

in my opinion this statement is true there are a lot of other ways how they can learn how to behave ",8
17900, they play outside with their friends nowadays everything is digitalisised and i do not think that ,1
17901, that learning has to pass throug television advertisig can have a big impact of our lives and children will be confronted early enough with advertising ,14
17902, they grow up to conclude television advertising  should be forbitten and on tv channels for children should only be the series withour advertising in between,14
17903, with this statement but todays young children are even without the television confrontated with advertising and other things which children some years ago havent ever seen maybe in some years it will be normal that a five year old boy is using a handy and can explain his father how to use his computer when im travelling i can often see how the parents give their children electronic devices like an ipad like this the children are occupied and the parents dont have to look ,17
17904, their kid the children are already used to see advertising everywhere ,16
17905, i dont think that with a televsion advertising they would have some damage when the children are watching tv and an advertisement appears where ,14
17906, the newest thing to play is introduced the children want it like this the parents get more and more in an obligation to buy their kid everything my personal problem is that the children nowadays play with their phone and not with their friends anymore all the social interactions ,24
17907, playing a game with other kids arent there anymore ,1
17908, later they willl have problems to get in contact with other people because its the time of 37 years where children have no problems to play with any child i cantfigure out any ,24
17909," if the television advertising is  its normal that every company wants his own advertisement in the tv beacause its a good maybe the best platform to find new people buying their product and its the right of every company to show an advertisement but if its for children up to five its not okay
",14
17910,"advertising s young children

the pure ",16
17911, that young children age  already watch ,6
17912, much television that we as adultes need to talk about the ban of tv advertising already reflects the huge problems we have in the ,15
17913," world

however it has to be said that we live in a capital based society which is built on capitalism and the free market in a free market economy the whole population profits ",23
17914," more products and goods are sold to the pobulation so we should argue that we should allow adertising for our kids just for the good of our economy
i must say i ",12
17915, strongly our country is run by a ,21
17916," called social free market economy which is a system where the state corrects social differences by reallocation resources from the rich to the poor all that wants to say that we care about everybody wellbeing in our society so why should not care about our youngest and already make them and protect them from the influence of advertising
since children at the age of  are getting to know our world very intensively we should not show them our made up world of advertising we better show them our real world and by that i dont think about some sort of cool animal documentaries on dmax our kids should figure out for themself what they like or not we should not be talking about what kind of ads we would like to ban for kids we should be there and support them as our own brothers and sisters i am very sure ",13

this essay is about the discussion if television advertising towards yound children should be allowed or not 

a child gets immidiantly confronted with advertising as soon as the television is switched on but isnt it a wrong thing to make yound children believe that they need certain products ",13
17921," be happy
one could say that the decision wheter to buy the advertised product or not ",11
17922, lays in the hands of the parents a child in this age cant simply march into a supermarked and buy the aimed product in the end the child learns that he cant have everything and that not everyting advertised in really needed ,2
17923," be happy also the mother or the father learns to say no
one could ",9
17924, say that advertising is simply a part of the economy and theres ,15
17925, a sector that promotes children products all the toysshops or other companys that sell childrenproducts need to survive and today it is needed to advertise ,0
17926," be competitive in the harsh market 

but theres ",23
17927, of the advertising in television for partens it is not easy to always say no the advertising lays pressure on them nobody wants to be the strictly person that always says no and nobody wants endless discussion with their children about someting they dont need and thats already ,14
17928, the advertising makes immature children believe that theyre in a need of certain products in a yound age theyre already told that they cant be happy or not fit into a group whitout having the latest cool products at a later ,2
17929," in life they have problems to resist buying the latests products what can lead to a buyaddiction so isnt it very unethical and unfair to make economical benefits of the immaturity of our young innocent generation
yes it is there is absolutely no need to advertise products towards two year old children and for the sector of economy there are ",2
17930, other ways to promote products like magazins for partens theyre mature enough to decide if that product is needed or not ,2
17931, that would be a better way to advertise this products,11
17932,there are channels with films and series just for kids ,6
17933, these cannels must show their advertisments for kids it doesnt make sense ,16
17934, the adverts are for older people because this could be a reason to switch the channels this would have ,11
17935," like less views and people would search other channels for their kids to watch 


kids have a difficulty to accept and to understand when they liked ",6

adverts can danger little kids  age 2 3 we all know that little kids like to have something in their mouth like the finger or something different when they put a liitle subject in their mouth like a little lego weaponthe kid could not get oxygen it can be the reason for the deathit is the job of the parents to look ",16
17938, the kids and that the people who made that advert cant do something ,16
17939," something is happenng to the kid

little kids with the age 23 are ",24
17940, easy to trick because you can talk about something different what they like and make that they forget what they wanted to an older kid who has not a good education would talk everyday about this game until the kid gets it it depends ,24
17941," on the education of the kids and who the parents handle with the kids
 
when they show programms for little kids everything must be for kids as i said the people who do the adverts can just look that the adverts dont get too voilent or agressive




",13
17942, you were young and sitting infront of the television and ,6
17943, there comes this really amazing advertisement of this really cool toy which you just had to have to play with i can remembre these times just like they happened yesterday and everytime ,20
17944," i asked my parents and they finaly said yes and i had the toy in my very own hands i was disapointed because it just wasnt the same as it was shown in the advertisement every child really likes these awesome advertisements which show the product in its greatest way but should television advertising directed  be allowed

these organisations whose product is directed  do have to advertise ",14
17945, they can sell their products better every organisation has to advertise the whole reason of advertising is that the people who see the advertisement buy the product young children dont have any money ,16
17946, the reason of these advertisements is that the little girls or boys go to their parents and tell them to buy the product the problem of this is that often young children just want everything and they cant decide what really is worth to buy and ,0
17947," the parents will buy it for their children to not disapoint them with this advertisingstrategy the organisations are abusing exactly this problem so the young children are an easy target to sell stuff to 

in the end ",2
17948, that television advertising which is directed  should not be allowed because it abuses the lack of knowledge that children have ,13
17949,"television advertising  should not be allowed
television advertising has a really big impact on children mostly the television advertising  children shows a situation where other children play with or use the advertised thing in the advertising everything seems to be great children think if they have the advertised thing their life would be like the one shown on tv but as soon as they got this thing they realise that it isnt as funny as they had thought they start to ignore that they had it and they want to have the ",14
17950," thing
if children would like to have the advertised thing they had seen in tv they ask for it all the time and the parents have to say strictly no or if they arent that strictly they will buy it but if they start to buy one thing they will have to buy a sencend thing and ",2
17951," on in the end its going to be a big amount of money they spent for these things and the children arent happier with these things that the parents dont get in such a situation they cant let their children watch tv but in todays time this is really difficult
in conclusion the children and the parents dont profit from the advertising and they just waste money for something they dont really like a long time the best thing to do is not to allow television advertising",14
17952,some peole say that telvision ads dirceted  could be a problem because they could be influeced by them and they could drain the money of a poor houshold but kids at his age normally dont have money so should those ads ,14
17953," be allowed
ads work on the concept ofinfluencing people to buy their products or to believe that something is good if such ads are directed to  years old children that are easily influenced by anything could be dangerous they could be influenced by companies ",13
17954, theyd be an easy target for ,19
17955," ads and could be bound to a companie believing everything the say
furthermore ",11
17956, referencing to toy ads they could push their parents to buy them anythig they want because theyve seen itin an ad and that could be damaging for housholds tht dont have that much money its similar to the phenomenon of microtransactions if you give them the permission to do that by bindin your credit card to your account they will ypend as much money as they can ,2
17957," they dont uderstand the conceptof money
but why giving them everything they want if youre persistant you can fend of the demands of your child they themselves dont have money ",9
17958," aslon as youre in charge you can block everything no one gets everything he wants
in my opinion the ",19
17959, in charge is the reason why those ads should ,11
17960, be allowed it doesnt matter how hard kids get influenced ,12
17961," you dont give them everything they want
",3
17962, there is some truth behind this statement afterall there are studies which prove that watching televison isnt good for children it sais that it has negativ influence on the development of the brain but ,17
17963, tv doesnt stop influencing your brain no mather what age you are another importent reason why ,17
17964, watching tv under the age of five shouldnt be allowed is that in that age you normaly arent able to make a diffrence between reality and fiction even some grownups fail doing that line watching tv isnt in the nature of humans actually a lot of things that we do isnt natural anymore and ,17
17965, years of your life you shouldnt interact with tecnology too much personaly ,18
17966," that as a kid you should play with other kids or some toys like lego actionfigueres
watching tv from time to time is alright ",8
17967, the parents are careful about the movie choice and make sure watching tv is something their kid doesnt do often a lot of parents let their kids watch tv ,17
17968, they are distracted or to calm them down but that is one of the worst things you could do as a parent further ,24
17969," tv can be used as a rare treatment in the end i have to admit taht there are some good tv shows for kids and they do have fun during watching tv  who doesnt
",17
17970, the parents keep watching tv as a special and rare treatment it shouldnt be a problem to let kids watch tv but never the less they should be careful and make sure that the tv consume doesnt get out of hands,17
17971,one of the biggest problem in our todays society is the influence of technologie by watching television or by using your mobile phone in your life and your attitude this ,23
17972, people does use for advertisement in ,11
17973, make the product or the company more famous and popular now there are ,23
17974," many people for example an advertisement of the newest mobile phone is  the younger generation advertisement is the most popular way to show todays life and enter in this society so why should not be an advertisement for chldren too

advertisement is important ",11
17975, people children included are up to date and can compare different offers advertisement is a part in our every daylife for we find it everywhere in the internet in television or even at the bus owing to that it is like a part of education for children in that way they are from the ,0
17976," they can learn earlier and quicker how to handle with it 
moreover they share a component of everyday lifebecause of that they feel like a part of this world and this society and this improves their selfconfidence

in the other way advertisement can have a bad influence on children because they can not be able to make their own decisions for their mind is ",0
17977, opened to every experience without asking the ,18
17978," that means children can be more manipulated than adults
additionallythis influence does not takes the possibility of making decisions it destroys the naturefriendly childhood too in ",7
17979," that children are disturbed in their life by let them in this world to early
moreover it gives the children the possibility to rebel and scream their parents for children want the product represented bythe advertisement

my opinion is that is better not to have television advertising ",14
17980, children need to discover their nature surrounding ,8
17981, enter in to this society,21
17982,one reason why it shoudnt be allowed is that young children dont really understand what they see in television they can missunderstand things or they can get manipulated what can make it difficult for parents to help them grow up at the age of ,17
17983, not in position think about what they saw or what the advertise really means and they dont know what to believe in ,3
17984, they hear things in the television advertise but i ask me the quesion if the advertising really can manipulate the children that much that there are problems for the parents or for the children themselves maybe ,2
17985, the children see an advertise of ,16
17986, a very tasty looking candy and they see it in the ,3
17987, say no another question is if the children really get sort of manipulated or if they are really happier ,9
17988," they see an advertise of something in the television they seem to like it and they get it bought by her parents 
so at the end there are ",6
17989, opinions so the real question is if a very strict rule like forbit it completely is really the way to solve the problem tough it is not sure that it really is a problem ,21
17990, of myself that its a too strict measure for a ,21
17991, see that her child dont watch too much of television or something like that,17
17992,"ads for the young

young children spend a lot of time consuming digitial media one of which is the television there is no doubt that children will at one ",14
17993," or another come to watch some sort of advertisement in their infancy the goal of advertising something is usually to get the viewer interested in whatever you are advertising and possibly have them buy your service product or whatever it is so should people be alllowed to advertise their products  

",16
17994," that you should be able to there is no good reason as to why your target audience has to exceed 5 years of age of course i am talking in a general sense there are obviously some special case products which i would not want to see advertised on tv whether it be s a 5 or 15 year old things like adult movies toys etc are obviously meant by this anyway there are reasons o plenty for why ads s youngsters are a good thing first off they will distract the kid from whatever he was watching and force him to take a break this is a good thing because othrewise the kid might be inclined to watch tv all day his eyes glued to the screen health is really a important subject and to prevent its deteriation advertisements serve a useful purpose so advertisements serve a practical purpose and keep your kid from becoming an addict
when it comes to the actual content of the advertisement it really does not matter im sure there are going to be ads advertising baby toys and stuff like that there is really no problem with that because all it can do is inform the child of something it does not force the child to buy whatever the advertiser is selling that decision will hopefully rest with the parents as they would be the ones who will have to go out and pay for the toy so if the contents of the advertisement are for older kids or adults ",14
17995, it really doesnt matter because the kid will not understand it eg medical advertisement and if the ad is s the kid there is really no harm in ,16
17996," it is essential that well made advertisements are s young children because we all know how annoying those dirty little brats can be if they want something them little devils will be tugging at your shirt and bawling all day if you dont get it for them this is exactly what those greedy advertisers are banking on they want to drive you crazy and make a profit as i have no kids i really couldnt care less 
in the end advertising is just another way to make some revenue and revenue means money which we all want right
",16
17997, i red this statement was why young children are definited by  years what is ,8
17998, younger children watch the television or ,17
17999," they are six or seven years old it would be a problem himself if babys watch television but thats not the question


my oppinion is that it should not be allowed to every person who could not already think critically about what they see
but a big problem is that this is ",17
18000, a problem itself because you cant think critically about things you see in television ,17
18001," as an adult
do you know that the television is able to publish some clips from cocacola mc donalds or what ever which you wont see because there are published in a few milliseconds  but your brain remainds in the future it will be more and more that the television or other new tecnological would change your mind without thinking about it
for children it would maybe be more important because they are getting there minde and personality ",17
18002, for adults because this are the people which buy this products for children there should ,2
18003, be an affect that they learn something ,8
18004, they are watching which is ,19
18005," in the discussion about children and television
another problem is how long do a normal person watch the television or playing with their smartphones


",17
18006," it is an interessting statement but it would be very very hard to change something politic people  and if there would be something it would not be hard to cheat
all people children and adults should watch less television and consuming smartphones etc they should go out do some sport meet some friends and love their lives ",21
18007," you may would not talk about this question
",18
18008,"well why are there always boring statements in essays
i do clearly ",21
18009, the explanation for it is very simple itâ´s becaue it destroys the base idea of capitalism if people had a problem with ads in the television ,15
18010, they wouldnâ´t let their childern watch it there would be atleast one or a few channels which wouldnâ´t advertise and they would be much more popular ,6
18011, the others but it seems like every channel dispalys ads ,10
18012," noone really wants to block them another problem with the state manipulating specific categories in the economy is that it wouldnâ´t be fair who can juge if it shouldnâ´t be allowed to advertise young children and whats about the eight year olds 
after 15 minutes of thinking over it ",12
18013, didnâ´t came into my mind why anyone would want this to protect you children from foodadvertise ,16
18014, that they eat healthier and dont become fed maybe because young children canâ´t compare the difference between reality and ads and ,2
18015, they trust anything they see then there are ,3
18016, the parents to control them and to tell them what is real and what they should do and ,7
18017, to only block and on television wonâ´t help at all they will ,19
18018, see ads if they browse throught the web and yes four years old do that and ,24
18019, they play outside they will ,19
18020, see ads on the streets and other people would tell them about new products as a conclusion it should be allowed to advertise to anyone and if my country would block certain economies like that ,11
18021, i would leave this country immediatly because as a content creater i would never know which content gets blocked and which doesnâ´t ,19
18022,televesion advertising is something we all see nearly everyday it has become part of our life it can be annoying ,11
18023, watching a movie but it might ,18
18024, be interesting  to know what new toys have been made in this essay ,20
18025," be talking about television advertising  and why it should or should not be allowed
children today watch alot of television it is very easily accesible and ",13
18026, they are watching television and add always pops up this adds are targeted  ,11
18027, they pop up in the childrens television channels ,6
18028, disney channel they have cool music on their background and make the toy they are advertising something everybody has to have they basically brainwash the children that is the ,0
18029, of advertising  these children get brainwashed very quickly ,16
18030, seeing the add on television is go their mom or dad to make them buy them the toy the ,20
18031," is that making young children watch adds brings nothing usefull to their lives it just brainwashes them to buy the toy it does not teach them anything
advertising  has ",0
18032, but only for the company which is advertising the product like i mentioned ,11
18033, young children get brainwashed very quickly and because they will not stop beging to their parents to buy the product the parents will eventually buy it to them ,2
18034," they can shut up once and for all about that product and that ladies and gentlemen is how companies make money by advertising 
",11
18035, advertising  instead if putting an add the government or the channel itself should put something that teaches the young children something usefull like ,0
18036, brainwash the children to not smoke or not do drugs which ,7
18037," makes much more sense than advertisng a toy
",20
18038," is a controversial topic i mean most of us dont like them at all but we adults see what is behind those advertisings that the promises often arent true that they just say things to make you buy them but what is about children they are more and more the aim of television advertising should that not be allowed

childern dont see what a true promise is and what is just an empty statement which was developed from a marketing team with the aim of making you buy that product childern believe those things they somehow are easy victims for the companies they shouldnt be confronted with such markteing strategies in that age

so is it better to make those advertising illegal shouldnt companies have the freedom to do what they want i mean we live in a time of capitalism all people want to earn as much money as they can as a company you just want to make a good financial profit 

but doesnt a company have a certain responbility they should be a good role model and stand for moral there are already laws which make sure that some kind of advertising isnt leagl for example advertising for cigarettes at public events arent allowed anymore ",13
18039," they very quite normal in the 60ties 

clearly a company stands for something and they influence people but some desisions should be made from parents the children have to learn that they cant get everything they see in tv and the parents are responsible to learn that to their children i mean ",2
18040, a child wants a product which was advertised in tv the parents are ,2
18041," the ones who buy it its their desision

i ",3
18042, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed in the todays world we are confronted with a big amout of adverts daily so it is important that children ,13
18043, learn that these promises arent true that its just a strategie of the companies so they become more critical which is on my opinion very important in todays world its a ,23
18044, that economic groups want to make profit so they should be free to make advertising as mentioned its in the power of the parents what they allow their children and what not out of this reasons i thinks its okay that television advertising directeed to children is allowed,13
18045,absolutely marketing should be made available to all customers subjecting themselves to the medium used to advertise the products if parents have trouble with their toddlers demanding tracys fruit blast bubble gum ,16
18046, would be to turn off the tv or have their kids watch a different programm after all it isnt the kids that will end up buying the advertised products ,2
18047," by targeting their agegroup in advertisements they are not being exposed to anything that could affect them economically nor are they prone to bad judgement that would be the legal guardian 
one of the few situations in which i would advocate for controlled advertisement is ",16
18048," it comes selling potentially addicitve or hazardous products to young adolescents because this age group already has the means to buy the products but lacks the judgement to decide whether or not that its a good idea
where young kids are concerned ",2
18049," its up to the parents to decide what they want their children exposed to at any rate the only means of advertising products to toddlers and young children are through a tv or potentially a radio seeing as most kids in the targeted agegroup will not have the reading skills and will very probably lack the interest to decipher the offers on billboards and posters set up in their immediate environment so all means of advertising to small kids are very easily controlled by their parents and can easily be turned off if the content is deemed unsuitable
also how ",16
18050," would companies exclusively selling childrens toys advertise their products if not to children sureadults can be targeted too but they will not always be inspired by the same products as their squealing counterparts that always seem to know exactly what they want whenever they see a colorful picture of a toy i meanhow on earth would my little pony have gotten started if adults were the only ones who knew about the product        
",0
18051,"nowadays a lot of children watch televisionbut the things you see there are not just movies or seriesthere is always a lot of advertising in the programand as we know advertising can be very manipulativeso the question is if television advertising  should be allowed or not

advertising isnt always something negative or manipulativeit can ",14
18052, inspire peoplefor example a child sees a very cool bag made out of jeans in an advertising in televisionthe child asks his mother if he could have a bag like thathis mother answered with a clear no and ,8
18053, the child starts to think of how he could get a jeansbaghe comes up with the idea to create one by himselfa creative idea and clearly a good investigation of his timeso the advertising had a good influence on the childbut advertising can influence a child in a negative way ,0
18054,"for exemple that the child wants everything to own by himself and to have more and more things and gamesthe child could get unthankful and unhappy

in my opinion children in the young age shoulnt watch tv too often but ",17
18055, they watch it for once it is okey to have advertisingadvertising is ,10
18056, in the newspaper or on walls in the streets it has a lot of advertising ,11
18057, why should one forbid advertising in tv ,15
18058, it apears in the daily life ,21
18059,television advertising  should be allowed ,15
18060,first of all television advertising isnt something you can allow or not it is just there if you want or not there is advertising that is nice for children to watch because it has a lot of colors and cute music in the evening the advertising is a little bit different but i think this is not really important because children aged  dont get it for what the advertising is for maybe they talk about dating ,14
18061," on but the kids dont even know what this is they look at it and think oh what a nice color or something like that

the only reason why we think that this should not be allowed to our children is because we dont think like kids when the television is on and ",12
18062," we see a spot about condoms we instantly want our kids to close their eyes but they really dont know jet what this thing is they think this is advertising for a ballon 

maybe we should worry a little bit less about that it is just in our minds and not in the minds of the children they dont care what about this advertising is they just look at it and listen to the music in the background so i ",2
18063, with this statement it would be an overreaction  ,19
18064,"in this essay we speak about the question should television advertising  should not be allowed with children they mean the kids aged  

children aged  are very manipulative if they see something they will test it out by themselv or if soemone have something that they want they dont stop speak about it for the business guys is this a chekpot if they can manipulate the kids with television advertising is this awesome for them that is one piont that says that it should be allowed

the ",13
18065, was from the view from a businessguy but we ,23
18066, have to respet the view from the parents imagin you have a four year old kid and it sees one of those television advertisings ,2
18067," from a toy your kid does not stop cry until it has this toy this can be very annoying and disturbing so from the view from the parents television advertising should not be allowed

they ",14
18068, that kids are very manipulative is ,7
18069, negative imagin your three year old daughter sees a television advertising in which soemone get killed now your daughter starts tinking that killing is ok ,12
18070," television advertising or another example your daughter sees in one of thouse television advertisings how people rob banks or things like this and she starts thinking that commiting a crime is ok 

my conclusion is that it should be allowed but only ",7
18071, it dont manipulate the kids in a bad way as i sayd above i ,8
18072, tink its the problem from the parents if they think its ok to let her four year old daughter watch tv it should be clear for them that there are television advertising,14
18073, because the electronic is the future besides that young children love to watch tv ,17
18074, that the children could watch max one hour a day there arent many ,1
18075," kids like to watch tv on the other is it not good for their brain to watch too much tv 
",17
18076,in these days nearly everyone has a television in the house this activity is completely integrated in the society several hours a day are spend in watching tv and in this time ,17
18077," advertisment is consumed
with advertisment exists ",11
18078, the intrest to make a product known it transports ,23
18079, the information that the product is needed to have a good life this is a way to manipulate the idea of a fullfilled life and ,23
18080," the effects are for children stronger
with this information you can say that the consumation will rise and this will have a positive influence on the economy
",4
18081, children shouldnt consume advertisement which may manipulate them and i would extend the age from two years up to thirteen years because teenagers are ,16
18082, if not more concerned but ,19
18083, its more important that children shouldnt watch a lot of tv today tv is often not a way to learn about new topics than to waste the time ,17
18084, until you have to go to bed ,18
18085, it is sad that in this society a law is needed to protect children from the influence of advertisment ,13
18086, offer them more attractive activities and keeping them away form consuming too much tv,1
18087,"television advertising is a big problem in our society well not for the people who earn money with it but for the people who just want to watch a movie on a saturday evening its really anoying advertisment is everywhere and there is even specific one for young children many parents are afraid of that and want the industry to stop making them

i dont really know why its thought that television advertising  should not be allowed because for them its only a nice show which shows the newest toys or television shows and it ",14
18088, could be a chance for parents to see what their children want ,12
18089," at christmas or easter 

well i understand that parents could be afraid that their children crav for more and more but that is the problem of their education and their oppinion of how they want to raise their kids  
parents can ",9
18090," be afraid that the television advertising tries to control the toughts of the children and make them believe in things they want them to but in europe that isnt the case maybe in north korea but not here 

so ",14
18091, that parents care to much about things that are harmless maybe theyre just afraid because they hadnt that kind of advertising in their childhood but in one thing we all ,2
18092, television advertising is immens boring,10
18093,however television advertisements generally misusing to recommend the thing that advertising from them for people to buythey always try to show the produch more convinient and better to prefer for selling themadvertisements which are directed by toward young childrens parents actually should have the responsibity that their children directing in advertisement that tries to show the product differentadvertisements makes people to want and buy the productbut its actually very common ,14
18094, in children products that advertisers prefer to use little children to have their their parents confidencebecause ,2
18095, parents see a little children directing advertise something they think like its okay if i buy this product to my childrenbut actually its not a big problem that little children directing in an advertisement because ,16
18096, you try to sell something if its children product you have to direct a children tht can be used by them for have more requestin my opinion if the advertising product not trying to show what is actually like not misusing peoples minds it okay to directing a children in an advertisementbut some of parents which has no responsibity about advertisements they can direct their children because of for earning some money from therebut at 23 age of children cant decide what they exactly think what they have to do as an adult ,16
18097, thats certainly up to their parents,9
18098,television advertising  is a often discussed topic there are different opinions on one ,15
18099, you have to understand the company because they want to sell their products and earn a lot of money they know how the children react ,2
18100, they see something in television what they like und ,6
18101," they want to have it their parents want that their children have all what they want and be happy so they buy the product 
but you have to look at the cons too it is not good for children in this age to be confronted with games like that and with games it is not meant a normal game it is a psychological game in the televison advertising they tell the children that they need that product and only with this one they could have fun so they make a hype around something the children are too young to understand that it is only a hype because of the television advertising and ",20
18102, they want it but that is really unfair because they do not understand that all is based on psychology but ,3
18103," all of us see that the companies are really mean and they use the children to sell their products 

",2
18104, that television advertising s young children is nothing what should be done because it is not fair the children cannot handle the situation and they do what the companies want them to do they want that their parents buy the productin the end the parents want that their children are happy and they  buy the product it is like a robery only in a legal way,13
18105, with this statement because television isnt a good or a bad thing you can learn ,17
18106, much with just a flat screen but theres ,18
18107, very much nonsense on it but for those young children who are just 5 years there is a high chance that they just look some stupid shows or things about animals wich can talk so they dont watch popular shows like galileo where you can learn ,6
18108, much about the earth and how things are going they more watch shows like spongbob or somethinig like this but if you look at the books for todays children its not a big difference to those television shows another thing you often say about the tv is that your eyes will get very fast worse if that statement is true than ,6
18109," its miserable if you let those litte children watch tv 
but there are ",17
18110, like you learn how to use electric things you fast know many things about live and you can better keep them in your mind than if you red them in books ,8
18111, need less time to learn the things because you hear and see them ,8
18112, they stay more easily in your mind and if the statement that your eyes will get worse from watching tv isnt true than the negative ,6
18113, or maybe this doesnt even matter because earlier or later you ,18
18114," will get a handy and a computer wich is today necessary to live and work 
so ",18
18115, its a that bad idea to let them watch the tv because as i said you can learn ,17
18116, much about the life in a very short timelaps and about the eyes it doesnt matter that much if you start watching at displays with five or ten years so ,8
18117, it should be allowed to watch tv with the age of five years,17
18118,i feel like these days young children are often confronted with content that ,7
18119, is age appropriate but far more evolved than what other generations witnessed in television i feel like that might shape you and your childhood in different ways but without necessarily damaging the character or having a negative impact back ,6
18120, children grew up with oldschool toys whereas nowadays children with the same age are growing up with the newest versions of iphone and samsung something that i had no knowledge about and at that time simply didnt interest me maybe because at that time smart phones werent really a thing but ,20
18121, television advertising that are  aged  often are just ads promoting the ,10
18122, it comes to being on the playground or maybe theyll see advertising of a small boy drinking some kind of special milk and suddenly becoming really strong whatever it is these ads ,0
18123," in this young age often are forgotten in the moment they could intrigue the children but in the long run they will not be haunted by it 
a lot of our generation of teenagers grew up watching ",6
18124, a lot of television and it didnt have an influence on us were just an example of many obviously but one thing that seems like a key ,10
18125, to me is that whatever they see at this young age they dont take it in they dont overanalyze or think about the message because theyre children maybe im wrong because i dont have the knowledge or the proper evidence to support my theory i can only talk from my experience when you see advertising there never is a deeper meaning to it were not talking about propaganda but advertising used in channels  infants they build on their desires maybe trying to get them to convice their parents to buy the heavily promoted product in the end its all about business but it doesnt show you the weight of the world or societal problems and ,2
18126, its the job of the parents to protect their children from such advertising and ,16
18127, they wouldnt understand a thing and im talking about regular smart children without worries children that grew up under harder circumstances could be influenced more ,7
18128,"television advertising a perfect day in a zoo with your familiy they are showing elephants and giraffs and every little child tells his or her mother mommy can we go there now you think why not
lets say a child who lives in a big city and possibly will never have the chance to see animals like cows or horses in real life ",2
18129, its 10th birthday in this case an advertisement would be a good thing ,0
18130, there are  maybe no cows or horses in a zoo but ,19
18131," nitendo is going to make advertisements towards children aged tow to five about their new mariocart version and its no problem for children  to play it is this usefull
",16
18132, their parents are the origins that products like nitendos are bought for young children they will see this advertisement and maybe the vater says mariocart i allways played this game and it was the best game i ever had i loved it and he possibly goes to the ,20
18133, gamestore and buys this new game beacuse he loved it and he would love it ,18
18134," his little boy would love it so he teaches his little boy how to play mariocart only because there was an advertisement about it but wouldnt it be better to let children in this age play with sand and water or legos to let them know how it is to play with things like that to encrease their creativity to encrease their selfconfidence etc their parents enjoyed it to play on the playground in the neighbourhood they knwo how funny it is to play hide and seek they never had an nitendo in this age so why do they allow it that their children are sitting all day long in front of their nitendo and play mariocart
thats only one example of advertisements toward children between two and five and its defenetely not great so ",2
18135, advertisements  yound children should not be allowed,16
18136,"advertising for young children
the question is if young children between two and five should get a directed advertsiting in the television 
if young children get an advertising directed to them they become more interessed by the television and if the young children are more interessed in advertising on the television they learn more words and other things because they see an image and they hear somthing the ",14
18137, are that this child will learn faster and apply the things that heshe learned in their life for an example they learned a new word ,8
18138," heshe saved this in hisher head heshe uses this word always
but what happens if th young children become adicted by television
on the other ",17
18139, it would not be a good idea to set advertising specially for young children they could become addicted by ttelevision and the concequences were that later on their lifestyles is not going well if they have not many frinds or more ,16
18140, that no frinds they can not really intgrate to the socaial life thats not good becouse they were ,19
18141," isolated from the society
in my opinion they should not have advertising for young children in the television because the negative ",14
18142,"when we are children we look up to our idols and we try to be like them maybe some of our idols are on television but are they always the best for us
our parents can watch with us tv and they can control if we are watching something that is no good for us ",17
18143, it depends on the parents maybe they see some kind of things they not know ,24
18144," plays dolls or brands for childrens sake in case of the parents are newbies they might be relieved for some advertising about them
but ",20
18145," children are very easy to manipulate theyre young and take up everything like a sponge if theyre interestedthe main cause why young people are into having sex or watching porn is because there are always some kind of naughty scenes in advertising maybe not in advertising s young children but there are others childrens advertising manipulate to buy those dolls plays and games because children want to
",24
18146, their children and what they watch television is a new form of let the children play ,17
18147, parents can relax there are ,1
18148, many children who are addicted to electronic gadgets and their parents dont want to do anything their childrenre getting more and more unsociable my opinion is parents should more look ,24
18149, their children and play with them outside than watching tv,1
18150,"the question in this essay isshould television advertising  should be not allowed televison advertising is made to give the impact to buy the product so maybe the advertising can have a big impact to the small children but is that not the choice of the parents

televison advertising has a big impact to the people who see it children can be impacted much easier than adults it can affect children to do things that they would not do if they have not seen the advertise think about that there is a advertise with a young child this child is playing with the televison and the cables of the televison when young children are seeing this they could do it aswell and playing with cabels and elecrticity this is very dangerous

when you look at the other position there is an other arguement why should the gouvernement should make a law ",13
18151, there are parents that have to help the children growing up the parents should look that their children are getting a good character and they have to decide themself how they can do this so why should the gouvernement take that responsibility away from the parents they can ,12
18152," decide how much televion they should whatch

at the end you can see that ",10
18153," up we can see that it is not nessecary to interdict the televison advertise for young children it is in the responsibility of the parents
 ",13
18154, is television advertising generally legal every television channel has the rigth to send adverising also is it unpossible to hide the advertising from young children i mean how should that work a televions channel has do send advertise otherhand they cant survive ,15
18155," its theyre own incoming money otherwise how will they decide if children or adults sitting in front of the tv they just can make advertise or not 
but ",10
18156, i think is makes not really sens to show advertise to kds if they see a product in the television they dont go in a store and buy this stuff if they want something its in the most cases the parents which decides if a child get it or not the most of the advertise is build with an hidden sense ,0
18157, a child cant really understand what it really mean or they understand it wrongly ,7
18158," the chance that a child get a bad influence is much biggger than the chance that the kid goes to a store and buy the stuff the see in tv 
",2
18159, i think it should not be allowed to send advertise for kids it mekes no sens and is in the most cases just a bad influence ,16
18160, if it would be possible to separate kids from parents in frot of the tv they sould not send advertise for kids,17
18161,"television advertising  should not be allowed

many things can influence young children of course the adverts in television and ",13
18162, in this time period in which we watch television all the time young children trust this things they see ,17
18163, and is not good for them ,4
18164," they watch adverts 

but how can a this television programms can be financed it is very expensive to send some programm and ",10
18165, you do not get money from the adverts it does not make any sense for the producer to send this programm for free and ,11
18166," you do not send this for free the other peoples does not buy them to use and let the children watch the televison programms for free with adverts

another thing is the children with the age of  years do not have to watch television of course it is much more easier for the parents to let their children watch television ",6
18167," playing outside with them


in my opinion it is not to do for the producer to send the programms for free and the children do not have to watch television with the age of  clear the children in this peer group are very influencably but ",17
18168, this should be allowed because the children do not have to watch television with this age,12
18169,"the theme of this essay it pretty strange and i dont really know something but i will try to give my best

its possible that the advertising on the television have a bad influence to children aged  but ",14
18170, the better question is if these children at all should watch tv at this age shouldnt they play with theyr toys in theyr rooms they are ,17
18171, young and got already confronted with such medias it cant belive that this is a good thing so ,21
18172, the advertising isnt good for the ,11
18173," its possible that if they got confronted already soearly they learn how he world is doing and that the truth is that u have always to watch advertising if u watch tv why should they have a better like than it is in reallity it would be a lie another thing is that they are able to learn many tings from the advertising for exaple all the diffrent things which you are seeing at advertising they ot to know 
so the advertising have for young childrens a positiv and ",0
18174, a negative influence for me there are more positiv ones than negativ ,21
18175," with advertising for young childrens from age  pretty much if they are allowed to watch tv it dont makes a big diffrenceif there is advertising or not


by the way ",13
18176, if you ban advertising at television for childrens aged  no chanel will ,13
18177, to show broadcasts for young children because they arent able to earn some money without advertising,10
18178,children are easy to be influenced theyre obviously young and you can tell them anything you want and theyll believe you when theyre directed with television advertising of the latest games or whatever parents could get in trouble because their children always want to have the latest games at this ,2
18179," the problem is that there are new games every week whenever you switch on a kids channel youll see lots of advertising for new stuff every kid needs they dont actually need it but the advertising makes them and even you feel like they need it

children of this generation need the advertisement to be updated what kind of chilld would you be if you hadnt heard anything about the latest toys or games you have to now whats going on to be a part of in todays generation everyone wants to be a part of  children nowadays grow up with a television and are used to the advertising back ",2
18180, their parents were kids they mostly didnt have a television ,6
18181," maybe its something new for them

",3
18182, television advertising  shouldnt be allowed when i was a kid the advertising influenced me much i was allowed to watch kids channels in the evening ,15
18183," school in kindergarten i wasnt that interested in watching television
the advertising took place between the series i watched and sometimes was even longer than the clip itself sometimes the advertisement made me feel bad because i felt like an outsider ive never had the latest toys it made me think about what id be and what my friends would think about me if i hadnt got those latest toys 

 ",0
18184,nowadays young childrens are watching more tv than childrens who were born ten or more years ,17
18185, the fascinating technologie is really interesting for young childerns about this age in this age the chilrderns are learning a lot and they take everything what they hear and see and with that informations they learn and grow up so it is really important that they learn from real sources like the parents not from the tv there are a lot of advertising in the tv that tell nothing important or sometimes they show up a wrong reality the parents cant conrol what the childrens are watching and thats a big problem it isnt good for them to just consum tv it is better if they go outside and play games ,8
18186, they can explore for them self the real world ,8
18187, in nowadays time it is important that you dont just sit in your room and watch tv you have to get outside and see the real world it is more common to just watch tv the hole intheier day exspecially for young childresn aged  i understand if they are fascinated of the tv but as parents you heve to defend your childrens from bad influence and there are a lot of bad tv advertising so i am fully against television advertising toward young childrens because there are bad influences in the tv whitch can understand wrongly and in this age they learn everything what they been told ,14
18188, they take it how it is and i think they cant decide if this in the tv is reality,3
18189,"would you want the bad influence of television advertising  your child i suppose not and there are some good reasons why not
they need toys at teir stage of development young children need to play with things they can touch and toys which are invented for the stage they are at televisions are far too fast altough there are series for children on tv which is a benefit they learn quick to change the channel and the risk is too big that the parents dont pay enough attention because they need time for their own and their child watches something else
the development of young children is influenced badly their brains are not developed enough to be able to make a whole out of the things they hear and the movement of the lips they see thats an ability they learn with time but because the diffrent signals they receive are not received ",14
18190," they may develop speaching problems
they learn at an early age that electronic devices belong in the daily life this increases the risk of addiction in their life ",4
18191, they are older and altough it isnt proved ,19
18192, that elecronic devices have a bad influence on our health there are incidents to this theory and ,4
18193," for  the young children we should be careful until it is proved that the theory is wrong
children are the weakest part of our society ",7
18194, one because they will create the future but at an early age thats why they need our protection to provide abusing the tv as a toy which it is not to help them developing quikly and in a natural way to avoid later problems like speaching faults or addiction we should not allow television advertising ,17
18195,"to young to be advertised

nowadays children ",16
18196, young children are allowed to watch tv longer than the children fourty years ago thats probably because of the evolution of technology and that every household has one or more tv not only the tecnology has evolved ,17
18197," the whole economy and marketing so it happens that the stores who sell products for young children make adverts for those and in which way with television

first off the children shouldnt be allowed to watch tv that often its not good for their health and ",14
18198, not good for their relationships they ,19
18199, should go play outside with other children when they watch tv they are in another reality in that age they dont know whats real or not they get influenced by the adverts and get a fake impression of the world for exemple if a child sees an advert of a toy animal if in the advert the toy can fly the child most likely thinks it will do it in reality or they tell the kid that they need this toy and the child believes it because its naive its almost like brainwashing otherwise ,17
18200, they watch tv and see the adverts for a produkt they cant go by it by themselves they arent even allowed by law to make a contract like buying stuff they have to ask their parents and if they wont by it ,9
18201, the adverts are useless another ,11
18202, is that the child would want the toy and cry to get it if it doesnt stop and the parents ,20
18203," get it this could lead to a spoiled kid and that is psychologicly not good

all ",9
18204, considered the television advertising towards young children is unnecessary it would be better for the companys to direct the ads towards the parents the children are to young to know whats good for them they ,16
18205, shouldnt be influenced in a bad way by television they are just to young,17
18206,television is a great source of entertainment for all of us even for very young children it has ,17
18207," talk about television advertisement and about the effets it has 

children aged  dont have the ability to decide what is good for them they start to want eveything the advertisements want to sell them with television advertisement they get confronted with materialism quite early and ",14
18208, at this age its important that they learn that there are other things which really matter they ought to learn how to make friends and being social ,24
18209, wish to have new expensive sneakers or a new app young children get attracet to things ,20
18210," toys the advertisments have shwoed them thats normal at this age

moreover children that young arent able to know which advertisement is real and which is fake ",20
18211," they start to copy the moves the children in the advertisement do they cant assess what is dangerous to imitate and what not 

thirdly television advertising could influence young childrens eating habits if they see an advertisement with junk food in it all day and maybe see the cool kids eating it they want to behave like them they think its normal to eat this kind of food because even the television says its good for them 

all things considered ",14
18212, with the statement that television adverstising  souldnt be allowed the government should act to protect children from interference banning a television advert isnt against the freedom of speech and expression if the government doesnt support my opinion ,13
18213,nowerdays many people spend hours in front of their television we might not even realise how many commercials we see in a day but what about young children aged between  what do they take out of those advertisements in this essay ,14
18214, inform you about the adventages and ,18
18215," that the parents have to decide how much time their cildren are allowed to spend in front of the television if they do not want them to watch advertisements all the time they should not allow them to watch tv but that might sound easier than it is

on the one ",13
18216," it is a good way for young children to see what is possible nowerdays they will get confronted with high technical things they did not know they would exist 

on the other ",8
18217, they should learn and see that by discovering it in real life and who says they have to know that high technical computer games like this exist they will have enough time to learn about computers and high technic ,24

18229, much experience as the older people and dont have the same humour as peoples who are a little bit older a little bit of television advertising is good and ,0

18233, to the behaviour of young children ,8
18234, we have to find a good mixture of television advertising ,10
18235,advertissments make up a lot of parts in nowadays television advertising is a big market in this industry this televised advertissments are directed to various factors including age or gender in various occasions there even is advertising  because of their young age such advertissments can easily influence the children more than in every other field of age should this type of advertising be banned or is this advertising ,14
18236," every other

generally television advertising s children is like every other type of advertising it is fitted to their special needs in this age its often toys or other media made for entertainment it may does not matter if this advertising does strongly influence the children in their opinions and wishes rather does the influence on the parents matter they are the one wich will buy the toys advertised in the tv because there is a authority wich can decide wether to buy a product or not the influence on the young children does hardly matter

on the other ",14
18237, children can be very invested in their wishes and opinions it is often the case that they get what they want specially in a time period like christmas this is ,9
18238, the reason why advertissments with toys and similar products are displayed more ,0

in my opinion companies really take an ",11

today there are a lot of kids who already has a mobile phone at the age of four or who watch tv all the time but do the parents really know what effect this have on the education of their kids

the use of a television is just an escape for parents ",17

but if they dont learn the communication with other kids or even the parents later they could be very shy or just not able to speak and behave correctly in contact with other people in school they would have problems if theyre not able to speak in front of the class or they dont know how to behave in contact with a teacher because they just know what the people in tv does and they often do things which are funny but not wished in reality

18258,nowadays television advertisment is a subject we find ourselves constantly confronted with there is basically now way around it a lot of huge companies use this knowledge to manipulate or steer the behaviour of the people in all western countries where the standart of living is ,10
18259," high it is completly normal to have at least one televison per houshold this leads  being confronted with those advertisments too this essay will discuss whether it should be allowed to direct television advertisments towards young children

on the one ",14
18260," companies depend on having enough costumers and they usually get them by advertising their products on public spaces like platforms or tvs furthermore children who see commercials of things they want can tell their parents and the parents wont buy their child something it does not want  

on the other ",23
18261, using the innocence of young children and manipulating them form a young age on is not very kind and a ,7
18262," unethnic thing to do

personally ",18
18263, that parents should not allow their kids to watch television under the age of four anyways and if they ,13
18264, get to watch something it should be something off a dvd or something where the parents know there wont be a commercial break furthermore parents should always watch with their kids and not let them watch tv alone but apart from the parents responsibilities ,1
18265, that televiosion advertisments for young children ,14
18266, should not be allowed because it seems useless to me in the end it will be the parents who decide whether to buy the product their child wants or ,12
18267, my brother was 5 years old and we watched tv together i always was genervt of the advertising but my brother was looking forward to the interrupts in the best scenes of the film but some advertisement werent for his eyes i thought and ,14
18268," i asked me why they show them if little children it watches

a cons is that young children dont understand what they watches they cant link one thing with the other another ",6
18269, is that the parents can decide if their child are allowed to watch tv and ,17
18270," they can steuern the advertisement which the children are watching on the top of that you cant stop the advertising on the television

an ",14
18271, is that young children can see some thing they dont have to see there are television advertising which arent for youngchildreneyes another ,14
18272," is that children should have the possibility to decide for themself what they find good finally its difficult to control what the children are watching

in my opinion it depends on the advertisment and the product which are the advertising for each parents have to decide what they show their children ",14
18273, young children play in the nature ,24
18274,when it comes to advertisment and the way corporate companies try to trick people into buying their product im usually very pro consumer but ,11
18275, i try to give the free market as much room to work with as possible unnecessary regulations and restrictions are inevitably only going to be a hindrance and dont really give us any other benefit other than a false feeling of being protected television advertising s young children is rarely harmful ,13
18276, most children aged  dont watch tv the same way adults do for example if i watch a tv show my attention span is way larger than the actual time span of the program and ,17
18277, once it has ended im ,18
18278, hungry for more entertainment and my brain is ,18
18279, consciously watching tv which makes it easy for advertisments dircted towards me to get my attention but ,10
18280, if a four year old watches a show like fire man sam he cant even pay attention during the whole episode let alone during the adverstisment afterwards another important thing to consider is the ,6
18281, that advertisment for products for young children are actually s their parents ,16
18282, three year olds are and shouldnt be allowed to have their own money to spend anyway ultimatley the parents have to make the decision to buy the product if they consider it appropriate for their child even in the case of a five year old who watches an ad for an action figure or some other toy being exposed to it can in the worst case only teach him a lesson if he doesnt get what he wants ,2
18283, that television advertising  childern aged  should not be allowed but why do they thinke ,13
18284," there are many reasons why it should be prohibited but how else should the new toy be advertised

the companies know that the parents or grandparents buy the toys for the children but the children should like the toy or else it is a waste of money children are going to say their parents what they like and because of that is makes sense to advertise toward young children 

on the other ",20
18285, children at the age of  like everrything they see and want to have it the parents like to see their child happy but what if they can not afford the new toy their child wants theyre disapointed that they can not give the child the things that it wants the child is ,9
18286, going to be sad because if all his freinds has the toy he wants to but he cant have it he feels like hes not loved from the parents an other ,20
18287, is that the young children dont even understand what the advertise means they just find it very fascinating and want to be like the children they see in television for them it is like the perfect life they want to have they dont understand that it is just played to look like the perfect world even ,2
18288," the child gets the toy it doesnt has a perfect life as the child in the television who has a lot of fun with his new toy

in my opinion the television advertising towadrs children should be allowed but maybe not for children at age two or threethey are to young to understand what it really means and they just want to have it all as soon as the child gets older it should be allowed to advertise towards them but they have to understand that they can not have everything they see on television ",14
18289,"televison advertising should be allowed for young children 
in my opinion its a great idea to let children as soon as possible to work with multimedia electronics children at a young age are very talented in learning new things very fast ",14
18290, they they will never be faster and better in learning new things than at that age in our culture television and other multimedia are very expended and important ,17
18291, chlidren automatic will be conformed with these medias ,18
18292," why keep it back and dont let them use it at a young age 
some doctors may say that its dangerous to let children playing and working with multimedia things at a young age but i think sooner or later they will get used to the television and co 
in many countrys televiosion advertising is already in use and the children dont get sick of it or have any problems with the handeling if we dont allow television advertising now it will happen in a few years beacause the market is growing ",17
18293," fast and every minute the electronics get better and faster and we need to use them to get to work or to comunicate with each other 
so why dont let our children get used to it im sure in the future everyone will let their chilren to advertise direct by televisions and it will be normal for everyone ",17
18294,everybody knows the situation youre watching a movie but ,18
18295," twenty minutes some advertise interrups television adevertising is on every channel also the kids get in touch with the advertising should the television advertising become forbiden for young children

on the plus ",14
18296," of the television advertising can kids learn how many products excist they see that teddybears excist in many different forms and colours if they wouldnt see the promotion they would think that the teddybears of themselves are the only one in the world
but if the children see all those playtools they want to buy quite everything in the storage they are crying because of the mean mum who dont want to buy something
an ",0
18297," is that the kids have to learn beause of the advertising what are important and what are usless informations they learn very fast that they cant guess everything like that the advertise helps the kids to think by themself 
enemies of the promotions says the advertise has to much influence to the kids a child doesnt see just television advertising which is made for his age it is very often confrontated with sloganes with bad influences for example if they see some promotion with pills to lose weight they are asking the parents why some people take these pills like that they are confrontated with this beautyforce too early 

in my opinion the kids souldnt see every advertise but ",0
18298, thats quite difficult to get trough but if it would be possible in a way ,18
18299, it shouldnt be allowed to sum up the television advertising has ,15
18300, but i thnik it dont have to be ,18
18301, much promotion kids dont have to see everything in there young life,8
18302,everybody or nearyly everybode watches the television when i was young my parents told me not to watch to long to the television nowadays it is completly different children getting a mobilephone in the age of fife is sometimes more than usual i ,17

18304," i was nine years old and i had to pay it on my own well the question about advertising directed to five year old children is connected with several other things of education education in the sence of sensibilisate the kids from getting stupid behind the television 

its good for making the kids think of what they really need if there is an adverising about a playgun or something like that the can learn to ask themselves if they are really in need of such a thing 

but to the other ",16
18305, they look what their friends do or maybe what their parents want them to do so they dont think on their own but do they really think o their own in the ago of just five years no i dont think ,7
18306, be different in that age you often dont wanna do what your parents want you to so you start crying becaus you cant get your playgun ,24
18307," you have the possibility to think about it 

should it be allowed or not

why not thats now my own opinion it is not said that these children have to watch this advertising if the parents dont want them to they can just shot the television and make their kids to play in the garden 

but i see the ",14
18308, problem many parents dont even realise advertising and its tricks so its absolutely ridiculous to want the children to realise it but you cant say the television is not allowed to send such advertising thats a big problem its their strategy to make young ,14
18309," as old people to buy things 

if you want to do something in the opposite direction you would have to start to educate the parents because the children dont have an own opinion in that young age 

start to sensibilisate parents who not realise how stupid and objectiv their children can get parents make your children watch docmentations about animals or about spaceshuttles let them make sports or let them play an instrument but dont make them to see only one shity thing on the televion without thinking about it a little let your children leave their lifes with a big futur ",9

18311, of this advertisment is that the children are informed about their environment at a young age they might know where the closest pharmacy is at and where they have to go in an emergency but on the negative ,0

",20
18320, its a bad idea to manipulate children at a young age to get more profit as a company in conclusion advertising  should be forbidden they should ,16

18331, their favourite series is paused because of an adevertisment brake but television advertising gets far more controversial ,10
18332," a company is directing their advertisment towards young children so should television advertising  be allowedâ¨


the main ",13
18333, people bring up against such advertising is that the children in this age arent able to handle with advertisments children in young age can be manipulated easily and believe in what the adverts suggest ,16
18334, it is not the truth children are not able to understand in their age that the world is dominated by the financial ,7
18335," and companies highest interest is to make as much money as possible

on the other ",23

18337," of their product furthermore at the end the parents are responsible for what they buy for their children


in my opinion advertising  should not be allowed because children are way to easy to manipulate in their age but ",16
18338, parents teach their children how advertising works and how it affects the peoples minds furthermore companies know that children are easy to manipulate and ,0
18339, they are more interested in convincing children to buy their product than honestly explaining their product and it strenghts,2
18340,the question of this essay is if i ,21
18341," with the following statement television advertising  should not be allowed

first ",15
18342," out that children as young as  will not remember this time later in their life maybe except very traumatsing experiences furthermoreyoung children should watch channels which are specifically made for them in order not to scare them to death 
also they should not watch advertisement for adults for example women in the advertisement of gilette shave their legs which does not sound bad at ",14
18343," but if you look close it already teaches them the role of men and women in the society and children shoud not deal with that 
in my opinion it is better for them to get an advertisement for something to play with if they liked the things on television they can ask for it as a present for christmas or their birthday the parents can ",17
18344," decide if it is worth bying
in the end the parents decide anyways what their children are watching if the parents do not like advertisement for children t
for those reasons i ",14
18345,okay well i dont really know why we should ban such a thing from tv it doesnt really make a lot of sense to me and i probably dont really understand the statement anyway and maybe my text wont make a lot of sense to you but heres my opinion to this statement ,15
18346, you should ban such advertisments i mean it depends on what content it has and how they represent the product of whatever they want to advertise of course it shouldnt ,11
18347, turn kids to having stupid brains and just watch tv all day and if its directed to such young kids they maybe should stop that kids need to get out of the house and not stay home and stick their faces in front of the tv i dont know what else to say technology took over humans okay not really i mean we are ,17
18348, i actually mean that humans are ,19
18349," addicted and constantly on their technologies we cant imagine life without it 
listen to be honest what am i supposed to say about this statement anyway i cant think of anything else than what i wrote and i that in like 8 minutes and that timer up there is ",23
18350, stressing me out i cant write 300 words because i cant think of anything else to type on this modern hpcomputer i apologize for my behaviour in this text but im about to rage and the best part is i have to sit here for the ,18
18351, two hours i wonder what will come up ,18
18352, do something with filming in my future lifetime and maybe develop some advertisments but why the hell should this be banned from tv its not pornography or anything similar to that its just something that people want to sell to the world specifically to children aged  but what on earth do you think they will sell a dildo of course not i completely respect the statement but i cant argue about it because i actually dont really care i understand if the advertisment would contain inappopriate information but ,13
18353, of the day they will ban that in some time anyway that doesnt mean you have to ban every single one of them just the ones which arent supposed to be aired on tv but seriously do you think the advertisers will be like hey i got an idea lets advertise some inappopriate toys to young kids aged  if thats the case well ,16
18354, i can just say that they are mentally ill in their heads and just disgusting pedophiles who dont have a normal mind of thinking of course there isnt anything normal in this world anyway but im just saying with some stuff you can like rethink about it ,7
18355, you actually open your mouth and share it to the whole entire world theres a dark web that exists in the internet they should check that out well actually no they shouldnt check that out but ,18
18356, making a huge fuss about tv advertisments for kids they can start banning the sickinthehead place thats called dark web but anyway ,13
18357,the subject tv advertisement is often discused because of how the media rules our mind nowadays i myself think tv ads s young children shouldnt be forbidden but id say its a waste of money for the companies because such young children usually dont watch tv regularly ,14
18358, theyd probably barely ever see any ads ,11
18359, because they might only watch one show and ,3
18360," their parents would turn the tv off again sure its not the same for everyone and in some households they might watch a lot of tv and see those advertisements but its not the norm 
overall if i see ads doesnt matter if ",14
18361, on tv or in magasins i dont feel like buying that object sure it makes you aware of the product and the brand but ,23
18362," my shopping isnt being influenced by advertisements 
if parents are concerned that their kids would annoy them with buying stuff they saw ",2
18363, i suggest not letting them watch tv that often but ,1
18364, with the statement above i do think that its not necessary and definitely no one would miss anything if theyd stop advertising products on tv doesnt matter towards who it is,15
18365,television advertising becomes more and more important in our daily lifes because more and more people are able to afford a tv even ,10
18366, a lot of children between two and five years do not ,24
18367, watch a lot of television with that being said advertising becomes totally irrelevant but if they actually watch tv they shouldnt be confronted with advertising because some of them include rude statements ,11
18368, children should grow up without being influenced by tv advertising if they watch to much tv theyll get educated from the tv not from theyr parents sometimes tv advertisor use specific sentences to kind of conrtoll the childrens minds they know exactly how to get theyr attention because young children do not have as much experience in life as ,14
18369, theyr parents do with that being said ,9
18370, that the community should ban tv advertising ,15
18371, parents should pick theyr nose and conroll the television consume of theyr children if they successfully do ,17
18372, tv advertising will become a serious problem ,10
18373,"advertising toward young children is a good life lesson for everyone

advertising is an often discussed problem ",16
18374, it comes to advertisement for children while some people are certain that advertising toward young children should not be allowed as parents will hear their children say they want this teddy bear right now advertisement for children does have its positive ,16
18375," a higher income of the advertising agency a great example for parents to show their children how to handle money and a lesson to teach a child to resist

first of all the advertising agency does have a higher income because most children want to own everything they see ",0
18376, in television in addition parents are often not able to say no and eventually buy the certain product as a result the child reaches a temporary happiness which makes every parent happy too when it comes to the income of an agency they will gain the most money with advertising  ,14
18377, because there is a higher possibility that parents will buy it ,9
18378, because children will go to there friends to show off with their new product as a consequent these friends will want it ,2
18379," and the advertisement spreads out  the income increases

additionally advertisement for children is a good example for parents to show their children that it is not possible to buy whatever they want but that it needs to be able to handle money for instance parents can teach children that one teddy bear is too expensive ",0
18380, the other one is affordable and ,18
18381," okay to buy

lastly children need to learn to resist they cannot have everything they want after having six teddy bears in their bed it is just enough ",20
18382, that teddy bear in the adverisiment is the cutest advertisiment teaches exactly this resistement of products which seem to be ,0
18383," extraordinarily beautiful and perfect children need this life lesson to grow as a human

television advertising  is efficient for the advertising agency teaches parents to be the boss and children to resist consequently it does have a positive impact and if parents cannot handle television advertising ",14
18384, how bad is this last part of the payment in a shop with all that chocolate and sweets ,18
18385,"advertisement which is targeted at children has quite a big influence on our children and their lives when they see an advert on the television they often want the products which are advertised consequently some people say that the childrens opinions are altered by television advertising and they believe that our children should be able to make up their own opinions
additionally it is argued that ",13
18386, advertising almost always presents a product ,11
18387, a toy it makes the children believe that the material wealth is ,20
18388," thing instead they should be taught to value the immaterial things in our lives more
another interesting idea is that ",7
18389," television advertising children in poor families see what rich parents can afford their children this can lead to the childrens beeing unhappy about their family situation 
on the other ",14
18390, children should learn to cope with advertisement ,16
18391, they will encounter adverts all the time ,11
18392, they are adults it is ,24
18393, important that the parents teach their children to cope with television advertising which leads us to the ,14
18394,"
it is not the states responsibility to protect our children from negative influence of advetising but ",12
18395," the parents task they are the ones who should ensure that their children learn how not to be influenced too much by the adverts
last but not least it would be hard to find a economist who would vote in favour of such a proposal this is for a good reason because a lot of companies rely on selling kids toys as a result such an advertisement ban would have negative effects on the economy
because of the negative impact on the economy and the principle that it is the parents responsibility ",16
18396,"television advertising direced toward young children aged  should not be allowed

children in this age dont knowe anything about life theyr are dependent from theyr parents 

the economy is a big part of evrybody life ist a part of the children too there is a winn winn situation the children need some plays how lego or playmobil the children lean by playing the economy use the television to present the children the new plays and whats its possible with this tihngs so why shouldnt it be allowed ",13
18397," the parent of the children do the same and let them inspired by the adversiting so the economy can grow and the children can learn

18463,"the following statement takes about adverticement s young children between two and five years old
the main purpose of televison advertising is to sell a product and earn money each advertise has its own neash and is dedicated to a specific groupe of people behind each advertisment there is a sertain promotion that controlls people and their decisions 

televison advertising helps a product or a brand to become famous and to be sold at the end creativity can positifly influence an advertising ",0
18464," it will reach out to their comsumers ad dedicated to children might help them develop an interest in something or makes them familiour with all the options that are out in the world 

but there are major problems that advertising can cause tt leads to consumerism with their clever advertising they can control your mind and make you want something that you aldready have or something that you do not need 
an other issue is that it can promote a wrong image 

advertising is a part of our life and comtrolls our decisions it can help us find a product in a mass of options but it can ",0
18465, lead to unnaiccesery comsumerism and materialism when it comes to advertisingthat is dedicated  i thing that it should not be allowed influencing a child from such a young age is just cruel children should grow up makeing their own decitions without being brainwashed from the media even if their ,14

18467,"whenever you watch a movie which is played in the television youre interrupted by some annoying advertisement some people say that television advertising  shouldnt be allowed 

in ",15
18468, there are a lot of ,18
18469,"
some people would say theres no need to hide commercial from children because they do no harm its a everyday thing and belongs to the televison programm theres no reason to feel any guilt in showing advertisements
the advertisement is made for new products and theyre often not showing the whole truth theyre made to influence people to buy something really good without giving any information about the negative ",14
18470," the children will believe everything they hear so its not the best idea to make them think everything is only good and perfect
there are ",7
18471," made for children at this age to make them wanted their toys companies should have this ability to have a chance to grow in our world marketing is a huge and important factor
another thing is that children aged  have no money and the parents have to buy them the things they want without television advertising parents arent forced to buy that many toys
even if there arent advertising  there are some toward adults ",20
18472," there would be the same effect

to sum up television advertising is part of our everyday life and have some influence on young children in my ",14
18473, of view television advertising is nothing bad and should be part of the television,15
18474,the statement television advertising  should not be allowed  highlights the issues surrounding the impressionability of young children which is often abused by corporations the author of the statement is of the opinion that such advertising should not be banned however in todays modern society is a claim ,13
18475," this to be taken seriously and is this something worth considering or is this an isssue of no importance 

on the one ",19
18476, childrens television is an important source of income for many television companies and it is understandable that the adverts shown are s the audience watching many children enjoy watching the adverts as they can learn about new toys and games on the market another ,14
18477," supporting advertising s children during this segment of childrens television is that other adverts might be of an inappropriate nature and make young children feel uncomfortable

on the other ",13
18478, companies are well aware of how impressionable young children are and often advertisements for toys are not completely accurate leading children to believe that they are getting something far more desirable than the item their parents buy for them meaning that parents are essentially wasting money the ,20
18479, is that there are many adverts for snacks and drinks directed at young children these adverts are dangerous because they can lead  being unaware of the health risks that these foods pose and not learning about healthy eating at a young enugh age they leave young children with the belief that such and such gummy snack is a cool thing to eat as the adverts glamourize their consumption consideably these bad habits can accompany a child through their lifetime leading them to think ,16
18480," of the tastiness of what they are eating and not what effect it is having on their bodies and health

in conclusion ",21
18481, adverts s children between the ages of 2 and 5 are perhaps necessary if the product ,16
18482, a fisher price toy is targeted at this audience and needs to capture their attention ,20
18483, that the impresionability of young children is being abused for financial gain is undeniable and children are taught to think in incorrect ways ,7
18484," it comes to what foods they eat after all how many adverts for fruit roll ups and sugary juice boxes can we all remember being streamed into our conciousness as young children and infdluencing what we twanted to eat
i ",19
18485, believe that the author is correct in the statemnet that he makes and that there should be no television adverts s children of such a young age i believe that ,13
18486, children are this young parents can be relied on to make choices as to what products to buy to ,9
18487, the happiness of their young children,9
18488,"television for all ages

we all see them they are everywhere from the televisions to the streets which we are using everyday im speaking of adverdisments advertisments have a very big impact on the people ",10
18489, on young children for example ,7

on the good ",13
18491, its positive for the people who sell the products for children children are the easiest clients because they are naive and they dont look at a price of a product when they want something they want to have it and beg their parents to buy it for them thats an intresting and ,2
18492," a save way to sell their products

but ",23
18493, most parents cant refuse anythung to their children because they dont want them to be sad and to hate them so they buy them ,9
18494, the new toy car because their son saw it on the televison ad it has ,20
18495, a very good impact on the childrens minds they tv advertisments can control the opinions of the kids for example what toy is cool what jacket you should by ,14
18496,"

in my opinion its a very good marketing technic ",23
18497, a very mean one because children have a very big impact on their parents the parents want their child to be happy and buy them what they want they spoil the children but ,9

many companies try to get new costumers by advertising on television some companies try to get children between two and five years these companies try to sell candy fast food or toys

",0

18501, and get addicted to fast food once they are addicted they will go to these restaurants for the rest of their lives its very difficult to get adults to come to your restaurant because they know that fast food is bad for your health and children dont know that ,2
18502, annoying for the parents of the children because they always want to go to that restaurant and to no other but ,9
18503, that its the parents fault to let the children watch tv at that age when i was that age my parents didnt let me watch tv ,17
18504, i played with my friends or with my sister the parents could ,1
18505, let the children watch only one program like spongebob and ,17
18506," the episode is over they can turn the tv off 

all in all ",1
18507, that advertisments with the target audience being young children should be banned because young children are easily influenced by these advertisments some of these kids could become fat if they go to fast  food restaurants too often ,13
18508, in our daily lifes there are uncountable forms of ardertisings and we are getting confronted with advertisings everywhere we go at any time commeicials on television are very intense because they consume ones attenion by stimulating multiple humen senses ,10
18509, ones eyes and ears therefore children can be easily influenced by tvcommercials because they react according to their stimulatings and feelings advertisings on television which are specificially created to reach children often include edits that are supposed to manipulate the young audience children are easy to persuade and are likely to believe false promisings that are used in advertings to sell a product one problem of the manipulation is that companies do present an unrealistic image to children ,14
18510, kids may start believe in things that dontt actually exist in the real world beacuse they have seen it in a commercial parents do ,2
18511, suffer from the specialized advertisisings beacuse children will beg their parents to by a certain product as long until they will ,2

even ",18
18513, that commercials for young children may cause some stresssituations or arent very ideal for the kids education the advertisings on television should not be prohibited children should get used to commecials and learn how to deal with daily advertising as soon as possible parents ,13

first the parents would save a lot of money children do want whatever they see based on my experience so lets say they want an iphone which they saw on tv ",14

18518," we nearly have to buy it for them and those arent that cheap like a teddy bear 
second and last those ads might shape their life in the future they could be all lazy bed room sleepers with their ipads and iphones in their hands and doing nothing they wouldnt go out to play with friends or even doing sports because they are used to be on their new devices those ads provide different things to them which might be dangerous in the near future

18523,there is a big discussion going on about whether or not to ban television advertising s young children as more and more young children watch television more companies are interested in showing advertisings on the respecting channels now ,14
18524,"

many parents state that their kids are to young and to easy influenced it is well known that younger children are generally more easily influenced therefore it is only logical that people want these advertisings to be banned parents want these advertisings banned ",16
18525," that their kids dont get influenced by them

another ",7
18526, young children like something they want it if they now get flooded with tons of ads on tv they probably want multiple of the things advertised as they dont have money their parents would have to pay making it ,0
18527," expensive because the parents have to pay for the things the chidlren want it could get very expensive

the ",9
18528, that generally speaking less ads lead to more enjoyment nobody really likes ads the same ,11
18529," goes for small children allready are the channels flooded with tons of ads so to make watching tv more enjoyable for them ads directed to them should be banned

however there arent only positive things about a ban small children shouldnt be watching tv in the ",14
18530," place more and more parents let their kids watch way to much tv if the children wouldnt watch it ads would be obsolete and there wouldnt be a need for a ban

another thing to keep in mind is that most of these children dont understand what they are watching if they now see an and it doesnt mean that they understood the message so again a ban would be obsolete

now the ",13

18532," the ones directed to young chidlren their main audience

after looking at the ",6
18533," stated above it seems that the channels themselves should decide whether or not they want these sort of ads a ban would just lead to problems for the companies hosting the channels and would be to big of a change for many companies television advertising s yong children shouldnt be banned

second young children do not even know that they are influenced by advertising their state of mind is not that developed to realize such an influence this kind of influence is called brainwashing which should definitely not be allowed ",16

18575," its really important to take a break and to think intensly about it social media no matter if the internet or like here the television marks our life dramatically and the more years pass the younger the people get who are confronted with the fast moving social media so the question of young children beiing in connection with these commercials can be discussed deeply 

there are some positive things about such commercials in a young age children can learn from a very young age to know which things are on the marcet and to think about what they really need and if the parents take some time they can explain their children that not everything whats shown to us is essential for a happy life what sadly most of the advertisings claim
 but there are ",14
18576," a lot misleading parts about it if you spend too much time with people in this case commercials telling you what you need to have to be complete can be very dangerous why do i say that well imagine if someone tells you every morning you have to brush your hair to have a propper appearance someday you will start doing that and believing that yourself thats the trick about commercials they do the same thing to you and if such young people grow with that idea of needing everything they tell you they will have it a lot more difficult to think for themselves and to difference what they really need or what they just crave for

in my opinion children shouldnt be confronted that directly with these commercials because the negative ",2
18577, that are listed have a bigger effect on the future life and they arent able to think in a rational way we fall too fast into that dependence of the advertisings dont we,11
18578,in my opinion television advertising  should not be allowed because of several reasons first of all children are not a part of the adult community ,15
18579," and do not earn any money it is the responsibiltiy of the parent to decide what is good for their child and what they want to buy for it therefore the advertising should be focused on parents and not on to children 
secondly children are easily influenced which makes it a lot easier for advertisment companies to get into the childrens heads that ",16
18580, brings a certain danger some people could misuse that opportunity to influence children in a bad way and it could ,12
18581," be a reason for a quality drop in television advertising
i ",10
18582," think that children should spend more time in nature playing making social contacts and making a lot of experiences out there in the world it might be alright to watch television from time to time but if the advertisement encourages children to play with some product and make them believe that they actually need it to be happy it makes them addicted to things which could kill off childrens natural eagerness to live and play
having too many things or products ",14
18583, they do not have to come up with any own ideas to play anymore this would lead to serious problem ,19
18584," the children become teenagers or adults they would always have to rely on products to entertain them
all in all television advertising targeting children seems to be a very bad idea to me it does not focuse on the buyer but on the user of the product which does not make sense because the parent is responsible for their child and should decide what they play with it has ",14
18585, a high possiblity of influencing children negatively other ,7
18586, are that it discourgages the children to make any experiences in the real world and it decreases a childrens natural creativity,4
18587,"nowadays multiedia like radio television or computer has become dayly stuff there is everywhere advertising it is possible in every kind of way to make publicity some advertisments are even for young childern aged  they watch tv and become influenced by the ads should television advertising  young childern not be allowed

firtlyyoung childern aged  dont understand what advertising really is they see the ads about maybe diffrent toys for children they find them cool and want them but ",14
18588," they dont understand what this toys really are and why theyre seeing them it is always the parents desition whether they by something for their children or not ans not the childrens desition so advertising hasent a great influence on little kids

secondly young children shouldnt watch television at that age they should play with other kids and learn things and not stay hours infrint of a screen so it isnt the companies fault if a child wants a toy or if the child crys because it dosent get it parents shouldt let them watch tv if they dont want that teir kids demand toys

summing up advertising is something you can avoid if you really want to it is a parents job to make sure that their children do not become influnced by television advertising and ",2
18589, if they get influenced the parents can always say no and decide ifthey want their children to get inclueced personally television advertising directet toward children should keep being allowed,13
18590, nearly every child aged  watches tv from time to time or mostly even on a regular basis children orient themselves on every sort of idol they are in touch with thats why the influece of television advertisement shall not be underestimated still it doesent get children in any danger if you have a closer look on advertisement for toddlers its almost exclusively about toys a tv show or gross looking colourful cereals in the worst case the child has a screaming fit ,14
18591, its parents wont by them that transformers roboter or the new barbie house they saw on tv in comparison to the effects that advertisement has on younger women and teenage girls the toddlers are far better of while 14 year olds pressure themselves about not looking like the angel from the victorias secret ad developing a completely sureal picture of the ideal womans body toddlers just desperatly desire that new gameboy that now comes with every happy meal the only risk i see in toddler advertisements is the toy machine gun the battelfield game or the fake granade a potentionally handicapped child could develop a wrong image considering weapons and war but ,2
18592, children have awlays been playimg with squirt machine guns water pistols and some centuries ago with slingshots ,8
18593, a connection between playing with guns in an early chidhood and later misuse of weapons is highly questionabe in conclusion ,21
18594," that w certainly have bigger more important issues to talk about and give our attention to than advertisement for chilren in an early age if a person has the opionion that advertisements have a bad influence on his or her children this person should just simply not let them watch it
",14
18595,in these days everyone wants to make as much profit as possible and ,23
18596, television advertising gets more and more important but often they can influence people and ,10
18597, children to buy things they do not really need in this essay ,9
18598," discuss the question whether television advertising  should be forbidden


there are some reason which support the statement that televison advertising  should not be allowed
children aged  can often not decide whether they really need something or not they can easily get influenced by the pictures represented in the advertisments they want to have what everyone else has the parents ",13
18599," have to convince them that not everything showed in these advertisments is useful and sometimes things are not as they look like in television advertising this often leads to conflict between parents and their children

but there are ",2
18600," reasons which show that there is no problem in showing young children television advertising
adults often get influenced ",14
18601, by television advertising so why should television advertising directed to adults ,13
18602, be allowed in addition children get not just influenced by television advertising other advertising methods or even other people can inluence their opinion about something ,13
18603," well or even more


in my opinion there is no need to not allow television advertising toward young children of course they can be influenced but ",13
18604, other people can be influenced by advertising ,11
18605, well as children in addition ,7
18606, that other factors influence childrens opinion more than television advertising,13
18607,a lot of children are watching television ,17
18608," they are very young
on one ",24
18609, the question comes up if young children aged  should already start watching television often ,17
18610, the parents do not have time to carry for their children they put them in front of the television ,17
18611, advertise them but in this young age it is said that it is bad for the childrens education instead of watching television they should learn how to play and to learn a lot of very important things and to be honest ,17
18612," that they really would understand what they are watching 
but ",6
18613, maybe it is not that bad because with watching television the children can learn the language especially the swiss children could learn the german by listening to television despite the ,17
18614, that they learn the language i do not support this because ,12
18615, their parents are talking to them they can ,24
18616," learn how to spell and understand the language 
an other problem is that quite often in television is not shown the truth sometimes even in movies for children there exists brutality and cruality in my opinion it is clear that a lot of teenagers and generally young adults do have problems in their social life because of having watched to much television 
concluding ",17
18617, that children should be allowed watching television they should learn how to play with other children and how the real life is,12
18618,advertising can be seen in all places in our everyday life in the internet in newspapers magazines and ,11
18619, especially television advertising is a very controversial topic ,15
18620, in terms of young children some people suggest that it would be a good idea if television advertising  wasnt allowed ,15
18621, that the danger which the children are exposed to could be minimzed however the question arises whether advertising ,13
18622, is dangerous for young children in this essay some ,4
18623," are given on this topic

on one ",21
18624, it cant be denied that advertising has a huge influence on us and our everyday life sometimes we clearly see how advertisments try to manipulate us but in other cases we dont even recognize their impact on our decisions and our actions in ,11
18625, advertisments bring some dangers with them older people are probably aware of this and ,11
18626," it is not a general problem yet there is no way that young children are able to completely understand these problems young children are unconciously influenced in many different ways to illustrate if young children start to see advertisments of new toys in the tv they usually want all the things theyve seen and become somehow addicted to buying new stuff 

on the other ",2
18627, to pick up the last mentioned ,18
18628, young children cant buy these toys by themselves they need their parents this suggests that it lies in the hands of the parents to control their children furthermore there are probably quite a few children in such a young age that are not even allowed to watch tv but ,20
18629, that the parents know the exact content of what their children are watching and ,17
18630," the problem with television advertising could be diminished

to conclude there are arguements for ",15
18631, of this controversial topic in a way one could argue that parents are responsible for their children and ,9
18632, it is a unneeded restriction of our mostly free economy yet there are many dangers that people ,23
18633, young children are exposed to with the massive amount of advertisments in our everyday life and ,16
18634, it could make sense to protect younger people with the prohibition of television advertising which is  them similar as it is with the prohibition of advertisments for smoking which is ,13
18635, we should try to stick to the idea of a free economy and i believe it should be possible for parents to control their kids ,12
18636," that the influence of these advertisments can be minimized and if these ads wont have any effect anymore probably


  ",11
18637,"television and young children

nowadays nearly every family has got a television at home most people use the television to watch the news the weather forcast series movies or documentations

",17
18638, is a very good thing for children in my opinion there are many ,8
18639, which help children with their education for example there are series in which they can learn many things about nature music animals and more but there are ,6
18640," some series which arent good for children like series in which they fight shoot or use expressions children shouldnt use

television shouldnt be prohibited but parents should observe what their children are watching parents should notice which series have a good influence and which ones have a bad influence to their education another ",17
18641, is that parents should be aware about how many hours their children sit in front of the television in my opinion for children aged  it shouldnt be more than one hour a day there are some exeptions ,17
18642, they want to wach a movie maybe once a week or something like that but ,1
18643," children have much more opinions than pass the whole day in front of the tv they should go outside in nature play with friends or draw a picture

",17
18644, this is a very interesting topic because ,21
18645, we compare this topic to the way of life 50 years ago this was no problem at all it was an exeption ,21
18646, a family had got a television at home most families had got a radio to listen to the news everyday and not more nowadays technology has more and more influence to our life and ,17
18647, to the life of the children but ,12
18648, people 50 years ago could live without television our generation should ,17
18649, be able to live without it ,18
18650,when nowadays someone turns on the tv he or she will probably be confronted with some kind of commercial theyve already seen somewhere else but in most cases this doesnt mean theyre going to buy it just because they saw it on tv in ,10
18651, a lot of people find television advertising very annoying ,10
18652," their favorite show is being interrupted by it but what about the children should there be television advertising on the favorite channel of a three years old child
first of all advertising was invented to make the customers interested in different products like a shampoo a razor or maybe some kind of makeup the customer would ",14
18653, go to a store and buy it but a child doesnt have any money it would ask its parents to buy it and start to cry ,20
18654," they say no the parents would eventually be exhausted and their wallet would become thinner and thinner
a child wouldnt understand what advertising is it would think the products are awesome and want them no matter what they are manipulating a small child and tricking it into wanting expensive toys and other products should never be allowed imagine a child watching its favorite show ",2
18655, it suddenly gets interrupted by some kind of commercial once wouldnt be the end of the world but all the time would if it doesnt want the products it will get annoyed by it maybe it would even stop to watch tv and do something else it would be bad for the tv industry but ,10
18656," it might do something better like play outside with its friends
this would be the only positive ",19
18657, of tv advertising  i can think of but im ,11
18658, against it because the child might ,12
18659, stay inside and watch tv ,1
18660, playing with friends there is no garanty for it and the bad ,4
18661, outweight the good ones by far ,19
18662,"television advertising has more power than we think the influence of seeing all those topmodels with the nice clothes and the perfect bodies or seeing the hot guy with the newest iphone is quite huge but how does television advertising affect young children precicly two to fiveyearolds and how bad is it for those children to already stand under the great influence of television advertising that early

when young children see television advertising showing bad manners or habits they could likely start bevaing the same which is bad for their developement children at the age of  are in a phase where they learn and develope just by imitating grownups they copy movements gestures ",14
18663," words and phrases so it is important to make sure that children at this age dont see any television advertising that destroys their innocence and teaches them bad manners andor words 

we live in a time where adverts are everywhere so its quite important that we can deal with them ",14
18664, we dont like seeing them if children dont get used to advertisement early it might just get harder ,16
18665, they someday get to know television advertisement anyway by letting young children see television advertisment right from the start parents may be able to teach their kids how to deal with it earlier and ,14
18666, television advertising  should stay allowed because ,15
18667," that its important that children learn 

",8
18668,"i do think that these young children can be baited way too easy but i dont think its a bad thing to have advertises towards them when i was young and would watch television i wouldnt notice that there is much advertising i just wanted to watch my favorite show and nothing else if the pause during two episodes would be too long because there was too much advertising i got annoyed

some products are designed for young children ",16
18669," why shouldnt you be able to advertise towards them
when a mother sees an advertisement for the newest and best toy she wouldnt just immediately think of buying it 
but ",16
18670," her son watches the same advertisement he would stop begging her to buy it until he will get it

children shouldnt be exposed to advertising that early later in their life they will be facing an uncountable amount of advertisements at a young age their opinion can be chaned very easily it need time to grow up an build an own opinion wich really represents what you are thinking
 
",2
18671, people would like to have advertising towards young children banned because they think that these young children will get baited way too easy and kinda fall for the advertisement you should ,16
18672, consider the situation i mentioned above the mother doesnt want to buy a new toy for her children ,9
18673, she doesnt want her child to be exposed to those advertisements in my opinion it shouldnt be banned advertising will become more important in the ,13
18674, children will have to face it ,7
18675, they wouldnt like to it is much easier to learn things ,24
18676, one is young and what we learn ,8
18677, is waht we will keep in our mind ,21
18678," if a child is exposed to advertising very soon it will be able to easily handle with it later on in their life
",16
18679,children watching television a common sight in any household these days ,17
18680, as tvs are affordable for almost anyone nowadays i myself remember watching different childens shows just ,6
18681, my mother could do something else for a ,18
18682," than entertaining me 
with all normal tv chanals come advertisements usually for the newest beauty product or a nice car and most of us dont think twice about it but is advertisment on a childrens chanal for young children a good idea 

children are much more influenced by things that people are doing around them it is all part of the learning process this includes watching tv which is not too bad as specific childrens films and series can even help them learn the problem is the advertising between these shows the things shown might seem appealing and could lead to dangerous behavoir for example if a nerfgun is advertised and the child might think it looked cool shoot things if this child ",14
18683," found a real gun it could end disaterous

advertisement for makeup and cars are made to look appealing to anyone it is directed to this is the same for childrens toys a child will see many toys advertised on tv as it is what most children love if he or she sees something she likes they will ask their mother or father to get it for them and this could go ",2
18684, way if the childs parents say no and the child will have a tantrum which is ,12
18685, not nice for he parents and the child or if the parents say yes the child is happy but will ask for more and more and will ,9
18686," get a no and have a tantrum or get spoiled by all the toys

obesity is an ever growing epidemic all over the world and people are blaming the fastfood industry for it as thier food is high is calories and low in nutriens a big problem related to it is the growing size of overweight children food advertisement on television is not helping this at all advertising for a happy meal or cookies will only make the children want more food ",24
18687," they are not hungry which leads to them gaining even more weight

this is why ",19
18688, children are to easily influenced by the advertisements to be able to have them on tv,14
18689,our modern world could not be thought without television people from young to old are watching on daily bases if that is healthy for little children is an other question because ,17
18690," many people are watching the television is a good place for advertising now are we asking if television advertising  should not be allowed

advertisments for young children are ",14
18691, bad when children never saw advertisments  them ,16
18692, they do not know that not everything that is advertised is needed in life so if the advertising is forbitten young children do not learn how to handle it and ,2
18693," they are adults they buy everything thats advertised to them

on the other ",2
18694," advertisments try to persuade our mind to buy something the most people can think against that and deside for themselves whats good and what they need but young children are not able to think for themselves and want everything they see in the advertisments especially if it is  the  years old we should forbit this to protect the children from all this things

",16
18695," adversising to the young children should not be allowed because they see too many things they do not really need
",12
18696,if children are about one to fourteen years old they arent able to think responsible or make important decissons we cant juge them because they just havent collected enough experience so ,7
18697," children at the age  arent able to consider wether they should buy this or not wether if it is good for them or bad wether they should spend money on something or not they just look at things and they like them or they dont or they want them or they dont want them children dont think about if they need thing like that or not 
the television advertising for children are mostly about toys or things to paint or build something they are often visualized better than they really are in reality some toys can speak or walk plays are often animated with other things wich arent in really in the game and most of the time the stuff in the advertising look better than in real life so children want them and if they receive them they are dissapointed because they imagined the things diffrent than they really are
on the other ",2
18698, everything costs money and as i suppose children dont have money they want something they see but theyre not aware what that thing cost ,2
18699," they always have to ask their parents or their grandparents or someone like that and some toys arent cheap they cost a lot of money and some familys can not afford them so the children are dissapointed that they dont get what they want and they dont understand why 
the television advertising always bring some new things up new games new toys often children think what is new that is deffinitly better than something old so they always want the new things and they will never be completly satisfied
so i think television advertising  should not be alllowed they influent the life of the children too much the children will never be satisfied and i think young children shouldnt watch that much tv ",14
18700, they should just bring de programme for them ,19
18701, they can watch it and ,3
18702, turn off the television and do other stuff like go out or play with toys and if they would show ,1
18703, many advertisings to little children like toward adults children would watch more tv and would want more stuff so i think it wouldnt be a good thing for them and i wouldnt be that sure if it would bring more money to diffrent companys  ,0
18704,imagine you are sitting in front of your tv with your children the movie is ,6
18705, ripping and you cant wait until the end but ,18
18706, suddenly the tvadvertising is coming you know that your children have to go to bed in the ,1
18707, 15 minutes but the movie is going a little longer so what should you do bring them to bed and having a big ,1
18708," with them or let them watching until the end if there wouldnt have been the tvadvertising they had been on the right time in bed so should we forbid advertising  in the age of 25

first like ive told ",14
18709, there is an interruption between a movie the child has more time for staying up every person hates ,6
18710, you cant watch your movie until the end especially ,18
18711, you are a child parents today allow children to watch the movie to the end so ,6
18712," there is more interruption between the child can stay longer up so it is a benefit for him but not for the parents

in the tvadvertising there are often a lot of things for playing presented when a child sees that it automaticly wants to have it eg ",17
18713," it sees the brand new playstation thats the biggest dream of a child so he can play it wiht all of his friends but who will pay it right the parents and if they wont pay the child gets very said 

tvadvertising is one of the important things for a tv channel to earn money who has ever thought about the producer they ",6
18714, have a job and the aim is to earn money of that and ,18
18715," give the people something to relax watching tv 

when i was a child i ",1
18716, hated the tvadvertising but i learned to live with it at some ,10
18717, in your life you have to accept that and today there are lots of other possibilities where you can record a movie and ,18
18718," watch it at any time you want so i dont see any reason of give a forbition of tvadvertising for childrens
",14
18719,"watch tv with two years

today a lot of children aged  watch tvshoud that be forbidden why should this be forbbiden or why not

children aged  shouldnt watch tv because thy learn a lot of things in this years like how to climb on treesbut wen they watch tv they dont go in the nature and dont make experience for her lfe they only sit infront of the tv and do nothingthey dont do sportthey dont learn how to make a fire or how to swimon the plus ",17

18722, it could be good to watch tv aged  years because you dont hurt yourselfe or do other bad things ,17
18723," you wath tv

so you see there are a lot good and bad things about watching tvaged  yearsyou cant say its very bad or its very good to watch tv in these yearsbut ",17
18724, its bat to do it because in my childhood my parents did a lot of things with me i always was in the nature and everything was a new experience and made me very funi guess you feel afraid if you look back to you childhood and you only watched tv all the timebecause you havent done somthing real and you havent got a lot of beautiful experience,6
18725,"essay

the following text is about the question if television adververtising  should be allowed or not with young children is meant children aged 

television advertisements have different qualities some are very deep and you think about it a long time ",5
18726," you have seen the advertisement and others are not as deep and do not have a specifial meaning they are just dumb or inappropriate

children aged  understand only adwertisements with clear meanings and which are easy to understand they can not think about the advertisements the same way as adults or teenagers can if the advertisements show bad things ",16
18727," violence or things which are easy to understand they should not be allowed 

on the other ",21
18728," advertisements  children aged  with a deeper meaning can be allowed because they would not understand they would not understand because they can not think about things as adults do and if they understand deeper meanings mostly have an important lesson to learn

to sum up it depends on what advertisement if the advertisement has a deep meaning or does not show any bad things ",16
18729, it can be  children aged  however if the advertisement shows things the children should not see it should not be allowed,16
18730,"television advertising  shouldnt be allowed because  year olds shouldnt be watching tv all the time they should play outside and socialize they dont learn as much if they are just at home watching tv as they do if they are active and social

also children can get addicted to watching tv quite easily they dont want to do anything else but watching tv and once theyre used to watching many hours of television per day its hard to change the habit 

parents shouldnt think its ok for their young children to be watching tv television advertising s young children can give parents the impression that they should buy a television for their kids which can have bad effects on their childhood as stated above

on the other ",14
18731, a company shouldnt have too many regulations with respect to competition a free market requires free competition a business has to think of ways to sell their products if they feel the need to direct television advertising toward young children ,13
18732, they should be free to do ,12
18733,"

parents who arent aware of the ",9
18734," that letting their children watch television can have should be taught about them yet television advertising toward young children wont change anything about the problem parents should be old enough to be able to decide if they want to buy a tv for their kids or not

in my opinion television advertising  should not be allowed it is immoral and doesnt help with the problem that too many kids nowadays watch too many hours of television in their free time",13
18735,in the last century advertising evolved into a new level through digital media it has become fairly easy to direct advertisment towards a certain social group it is common for even young children to spend time watching television and ,0
18736," being exposed to advertisment this essay will discuss wether or not television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

young children do not ",13
18737, have a sense of what is true and what is a lie because of this reason they should not have to deal with advertisement if a child watches a person telling him that this is the best toy in the world it will certainly want one at a young age a child will believe most of what it is told the child is ,2
18738," learing about the structure of this world and having to deal with a person telling you what is better will influence the development of his liking drastically to remain objective advertising s young children should not be allowed

in contrast raising a child can never be objective and wether the child is influenced by advertisement or by his parents does not matter in ",16
18739, it might even be better if the child gets influenced by people other than its parents the child will ,7
18740," not grow fully according to the will of the parents which will grant it individuality this is the reason why television advertising  should be allowed

in conclusion advertising can be a risk because it affects the thinking of a young child yet ",14
18741, it is clear that the child is influenced this way it can never be fully shielded from the influence of the outside world and this has to be taken into consideration ,7
18742, asking the question wether it truely makes sense to frobid a form of advertising which is onmnipresent in todays society,11
18743,young children are easily manipulated if by their peers their parents or other people or objects they look up to childrens opinions can be changed quickly television and specificaly advertisments are ,7
18744," important in this matter but is it actually ok for children to be specificaly targeted by advertisment

one might argue that it should not be allowed and it would be sensible to do ",16

arguments why it should not be forbidden are that many television programs for young people show good morals and the children can learn a lot of them for example ",17
18787," the protagonist of a programm says that you should not lie the child wont lie because maybe his parents said that and  the protagonist
another good reason why it should not be forbidden is that for the children in the young age the television stars are for them heroes and they look up to them

a good reason why it should not be allowed for children is that children who watch a lot of television does not learn how to make some social contacts or friends mostely they are very quiet and does not want to do anything they just want to watch television
another pro ",17
18791," is that young children in this age should play together the best would be if they go outside to play they should explore the world and not the world of their fantasy heroes

in this essay we saw many different ",8
18792, which say that television for young people is good or bad but ,17
18793, i have to say that watching television is good for the education of a child  at least it doesnt damage the education you just should not let your child watch too often television because it should ,17

first of all watching advertisings makes children curious because they show things with the newest technology and this stops the children appreciating what they actually have my father thaught me ",0

in conclusion there are pros and cons you may let the children watch to practise the language skills or you do not let them because you want to protect them in my opinion ",6

on one ",13
18810, children between  years of age are not able to form an own opinion when they get confronted with a certain opinion which is usually the case in those kind of advertisment they frequently adapt the very same opinion additionally those advertisments often show that one might be more included into the society or in specific peers ,0

furthermore if the law forbid these advertisements ",16
18816, children would not be informed about new products they are keen on playing with this results in less children specific products being sold which eventually can damage the economy also in the advertisment jobs would be lost additionally the channels airing children programms would go bankrupt ,2

18830, many commercial breaks during a movie or whatever is on tv this can be very disturbing for the viewers because of the interruptions the business ,10
18831," all imagine the broadcaster and companies are even trying to make money with advertisement for young children now the question really is should it be allowed

firstly commercials for young children can be an ",13
18832, for adults they can be very helpful ,8
18833, inform parents about new products for young children ,2
18834, play toys or diapers however children might not really profit out of that especially ,20
18835, the grow older and they see such commercials in the television it is to assume that they want to spend more time on the tv the reason ,10
18836, is that children probably will ask the parents more frequently to go on tv moreover children ,17
18837, might get euphoric about a special product which they really want this may ,3
18838," be very disturbing for parents because children are trying to persuade the parents to get the product from the company thus this is not a controversial topic were the opionons can be totally splitted

in order to all those ",2
18839, commercials for children are definitely exaggerated for me this is an absolute reason that advertising has been growing for the past decade and i really do not think that companies need to do that children in that range of age are very young usually they are not capable of judging a situation like adults are and this makes it easier for companies to convince children of their products ,16
18840, this is very unfair even rude it is like making someone weaker and smaller the decision for you plus that the children are always seem cute and ,12
18841, an adult is more likely to say yes to the product ,2
18842, they do not want it and this is rude,3
18843, talk about if television advertising  young childern who are between   should be allowed or not theres a big contraversy on this topic and there are many different oppinions on it my goal is it to show you the positiv and the negativ ,13
18844, of this topic and at the end ,21
18845, at the moment we are conforonted every day with advertisement there is no day where you dont see or hear advertisement in any form so why should it not be allowed to make advertisment which is direct toward yound children they are confronted to it ,13
18846," it is not directly toward them if they see it in young age they maybe even learn from their parents how to look at them in a critisizing way
even if there are a couple of positive ",7
18847, which are not that positv aswell for example that young children ,4
18848, between  can be easily influenced by the advertisement maybe theres a danger which we are not aware of like this you could manipulate the children ,16
18849," theyre watching tv and they dont even realise it
in my oppinion the television advertising  should be allowed but in a way where they dont get influenced that much you can make advertising about healthy food ",14
18850, like this they get influenced but in a good way at this young age you shouldnt let your children whatch tv on their own anyway,17
18851,the question whether television advertising  from age  should be forbidden by law is controversial this essay is going to examine the issue from three differnt ,15
18852," to conduct a reasonable answer 

firstly one could ask herseld or himself why should someone wants to invest in  years old children those children somehow dont earn any money to spend neither do they get any from their parents and mostly their understanding is not enough developped to obtain the message of the advertisers 

on the other ",16
18853," it can be argued that they do respond to advertising and that there is really a danger namely the companies stress a psychological effect on the children that means that advertising occurs to manipulation toward kids in therearly growing stage 

last but not least one needs to question the system and its reason in general kids should not watch any advertising on television if they do it means on one ",14
18854, that they watch more than 25min on one stroke which is obciously not healthy and ,4
18855, that theã®r parents are not able to control the amount of time that their kids watch and ,17
18856," more importantly what they watch 

therefore i do stronly believe that the parents of the children should be aware of their responsibility and the law should not interfere in the advertising in television this would only give the parents the signal to be less cautious about their childrens activities",13
18857," that televiion advertising  should not be allowed in that early phase of their life these children begin to develope their thinking morality and behaviour with the advertising directed  their interest in products and offers could be influenced even controled by the firms who make these advertising through the advertising in the early phase of the childrens life the firms achieve to get loyal clients in the future because these children grown up with these firmsin their minds we should protected our children from such an influence because these children are our future and they should develope a free mind and not grow up with the influence of big firms which have only an interst in their profit these firms dont see us people as humans they see us simply as clients
and im gonna be honest wit you i dont see one positive ",13
18858, to allow advertising which are  these positive ,11
18859," would all end with the same goal money
",19
18860,"nowaday children watch a lot more television than they used to at the end of the 20th century today nearly every house has a television people often do not watch tv for the latest news but to watch movies or documentaries so its normal that young children watch tv for fun but is it healthy for them

children who wtched tv ",6
18866, they were younger are not that succesful ,19
18867," they grow up than children who didnt watch that much tv they learn to spent their time with other things and they developpe their social behaviour by playing with other children and spend time outside
when tv advertisings are  they feel welcome they are includet in the world of television if there werent these advertisements the children may not feel comfortable

",14
18868, advertising directly toward young children schould not be allowed but the most tv programms has them,16
18869,"in this essay the topic of televion advertising s young children is discussed this is a controversial topic as there have been rising many concerns the statement argues that young children who are aged between two and five years shoud not be the targets of these television advertisements

first of all it is arguable that these advertisements should stay allowed because there exists the law that states freedom of speech for example if there are no more television advertisements allowed for products that only sell to children between the age of two and five years these companies cant sell their products therefore these televsion advertisements have to stay allowed secondly it would hurt the economy if these companies couldnt sell their products anymore because they are not allowed to make television advertising this could lead to whole companies who have to file for bankruptcy ",14
18870," a loss of jobs and this hurts the economy badly thus even parents of children who are aged between two and five could lose their employment

on the other ",9
18871, parents have to buy these products for their children because the children have seen them in the advertisements for example a boy who is three years old sees the exact same toy car he has seen in the television advertisements in the supermarketof course he will beg his mother to buy it for him een ,2
18872, he might already have tons of toy cars at home furthermore the exposure of small children to the same television advertisements can lead to an indoctrination of these children for example a little girl four years of age only wants to drink a certain juice anymore because she has seen this advertisement over and over again these ,2
18873," would suggest a ban on television advertising  children between the age of two and five

in conclusion the ",13
18874, that support the statement are more serious than the ones that ,21
18875, because the young children are the future and they cannot be indoctrinated others would argue that if the economy is hurt badly there wouldnt be a future to live in but the companies can ,9
18876, make advertisements on other sources therefore this topic is very controversial in my opinion i wouldnt ban the advertisements because they are only on television and if parents dont want their children to be exposed towards them they have the possibility to not let their children watch television,13
18877,the fallowing statement is a true thing in my eyes ,21
18878," that there is already to much advertising on television if you want to watch a film you spent like two thirds of the time watching some advertising and this really annoys me extremely 
also it is a very bad thing because advertising forces you to buy things you maybe never wanted to have everything is showed in a unbelievable fascinating way witch isnt the truth in realitiy ",10
18879, a hair product it really attracts women to buy stuff to color their hair because it looks ,23
18880," wonderful in the advertising but in realitiy the stuff sometimes looks like straw 
and thats exactly what is does to the children because in advertising for children there are only things that every child wants to have if it sees it in televison or if a friend has it and with advertising these things are totally force kids to want them the diference between adults and kids is that adults most time can make the difference if something is really good and if they need it or not a child most time cant know this it sees it with its child eyes and it wants everything witch looks good funny or cute advertising is ",2
18881, played by children it shows kids that are playing with the new playmobile or with a cool lazer pistols for boys and if kids see these other kids smiling ,6
18882, playing with the things it automatically shows the kids that tis must be fun in my opinion the kids are manipulated by advertising in a very bad way it ,2
18883, shows to the child that it is needed to have cool things to e cool and to have fun and most times it starts if some child of a schoolclass has a cool thing because everyone wants it too in case it is ,8
18884, negativ for the parents because they have kids that are killing their nerves because they want something ,9
18885," badly and you cant explain them why they cant buy everything 
its just a very bad way to force kids having stuff they dont have and its a sad story that adult people do this just to making money ",9
18886,what makes a successful business is it the number of products sold or the revenue this is a well argued question all over the world what all economists ,23
18887," that a successful business can just be created by a well planed marketing concept the main focus of such a concept lies on the different ways of advertising pobably the most successful way of advertising a product these days is the media is there a better way to bring your advertisement to potential costumers than by streaming it right into their living room television advertising has become much more popular over the last few years but shall such ads be directed  between  years
for sure there may be some success with that young children are really easy to manipulate and as soon as they see something they want they will probably argue with their parents about it until they give in the businessman is happy the child ",0
18888," it is a happy ending right wrong
by directing their advertisements direct the businessman has to face severe moral and ethnical issues they bet their money on the assumption that kids these days hang out in front of the television all day long and that they do not have enough respect from their parents to accept the ",0

18901, that children have to learn to deal with this theme earlier or later they have to separate good and bad by their own oppinion the parents have to inform children and sumit them on some rules so they take a very importent position in thei childrens life with that there is the possibility to learn to cope with all that in a positive way like always there are positive examples ,7

18906," see these advertising does this really make sense or shouldnt it be allowed
the ",11
18907," is that most of the young children in this age cant think rationally like an adult they think that everything what they see in the advertising is real but a lot of the advertising are fake so its really easy to manipulate the children with the advertising
the ",2
18908," is that its boring for the parents because they have to buy most of the things which their children have seen in the advetising and mostly of this things arent really cheap
but ",2

18910," that children are easier to manipulate than adults so these sellers make a lot of profit with their toys
an other ",20
18911," is that the parents know exactly what their childrens want for example as christmas present they dont have to ask what the childrens want and the parents can see in the advertising what it is exactly
my opinion is that television advertising directed to children isnt good because the young children cant make a difference between fake things and real things they think everything what they see is real so they are a kind of victims from the advertising and are really easy to manipulate and its bad for the parents too because they buy most of the toys for their children because they dont want that the children are mad so these advertisings don make sense ",0

but ",14

18931, they watch television once or twice a week it is okay later they can watch a little bit more,17
18932,"advertising is nowaday a very important method to distribute information about a product and to convince people to buy a specific one everyone knows the feeling of wanting something really hard 

you cant turn on the tv and watch a movie without having some breaks for advertising some advertising are ",11
18933, for young children they see some toys on tv and afterwards they want them it is very easy to manipulate children and that is a reason why advertising for children is normally successful in my opinion television advertising directed young children aged  shouldnt be allowed because ,14
18934, young children should learn to play outside and shouldnt be dependent on to much material objects we should protect them from advertising the parents have to teach them how to play alone or with other children interaction is very important i know that a lot of children in this age already spend a long period of time in front of the tv but ,24
18935, this is wrong because they should do other activities even young children are nowaday addicted to mobile phone and want to play games on the tablet this is very dangerous almost every app for children ,24
18936," contains advertising which influences the children and their opinion you cant do anything against it  

children need to learn how to deal with the tecnology and advertising but ",16
18937, they should learn it by the age of two or five soon enough they know how to handle with smartphones and computers they grow up with the tecnogoly and are digital natives but they shouldnt start by the age of two ,24
18938,"nowadays the television has a big influence on the whole society mostly children fill their free time more and more with watching television so it does not surprise that the market reacts of the change in the age of the consumers and starts to produce advertising for children but should that really be allowed

on the one ",14
18939, television adverts for children open a whole new market which has an high potential it is an opportunity for companies to make their brand be aware in the heads of the kids from a really young age on so they create a higher possibility that these children will stick to this brand even ,0
18940, has its risks their is the possibility that ,4
18941, of all the advert is not appropiated for young children ,16
18942," they get in contact with subjects they can not cope with also the children get from an early age on an education in capitalism they grew up in a world where they get all the time information about what they could buy and what is available out in the stores this creates a need for this things which should not be told in a such early ages

in my opinion it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward young children children are not able to cope with the mass on information the would get over television advertising also they are emotional not as stable as adults are ",2
18943, they are more easily captured by the advertising and what is most dangerousily about this ,11
18944, is that children mostly are not able to get the real message behind a advertising and can not put it in the right relations with the real ,16
18945, just children and believe in what adults tell them ,7
18946," with that statement because yeah why not
",21
18947, there are many or any children aged to to five already watching television or even the advertising sections in adition to that ,17
18948," if there should be any regulation of tv advertising than a complete ban of it
i mean the complete background of this idea is that little boys and girls are ought to be more influenceable ",13
18949, others some studies may have shown ,21
18950," but really do those people really think there is advertising s little kids
those people ",16
18951, do have to believe that everyone is highly influenced by advertising and it should be banned completly dont they and if ,15
18952,"  as already mentoioned  tv advertising should be banned completly


",15
18953,if someone want to make a television advertising about baby daipers or for toys than it schould be possible to direct an advertising with young chldren ,0
18954," you would see a toy advertising just directed towad older chlidren or teenagers
and babys or young children are cut and because of that a product would maybe be sold out quicker than others
for mothers who cant go to work because of their kids it could be helpful ",9
18955," teir kids have a job an make money but those mothers shoulded force their kids to do that they should have fun filming an advertising

one negative ",2
18956," of that thing is that it is a lot of pressure for a young kid to film something and thy should have fun doing it
and i thnk for a lot of mums out there it is like a drug ",6
18957, their kid once have success by filming sommething they want that the kids do it al the time and that could turn out bad for the children,12
18958," that they dont have a real childhood

i the end i think ",7
18959, the kids have fun filming an advertising and as long they ,0
18960, have time to play with their friends and just can be young kids it is no problem to make television advertising toward young kids ,14
18961, i think it should be allowed,12
18962,television advertising that is  is a manipulative method that brainwashes the children to become consumers as they are growing up evident for this would be the high impact advertising is already having on our society today with consumption in the west already being ,14
18963, high that one earth would not surfice anymore if every individual lived ,19
18964, having children grow up accustomed to high consumption of goods is problematic ,9
18965," it would have a massive impact on our environment which would amplify the issues we are already facing today
additionaly this type of advertisment would cause more stain on the parents ",16
18966," they would be the ones paying for these advertised goods the standards for parents everywhere would be higher as the demands of the children will increase with the advertisment therefore it will create more pressure for the parents with low financial means as they attempt to live up to parents that can afford giving their children what they desire

however what has to be taken into consideration is that adverts are already a crucial part of our life and society we cannot leave our house without seeing them sometimes they are even subconciously imbedded in our minds even children are affected by adverts meant for adults ",0
18967," the target audience is older therefore its questionable if banning agespecific television adverts would make much of a difference

in conclusion ",13
18968, television advertising  should not be allowed ,15
18969, it puts unnecessary strain on our planet and the parents it is not the main offender ,4
18970, analyzing the problems we face to really make a difference it would be necessary to review our general use of advertisment and how we monitor our consumption however we should not increase the problem by targeting and conditioning children at an early age,16
18971,"we all know the advertising for children they are a lot of things they see and they want to have in toystores tv or magazins other people want to make money with articles for children is this bad for them

when you want to make money with your toy ",16
18972, you have to make advertising and almost every child wants to play with something it is ,20
18973," parents dont know what they could give the child on christmas or birthday with advertising the child can see different things and say what he or she wants
 
but ",0
18974, there are many things who dont speak for advertising  they can see that the children in the advertising play with a lot of toys and they want them ,0
18975, they are dangerouse or not good for the child but i dont want to write all the time about toys there are ,20
18976, many other advertising sometimes with food or clothes we often can see in tv young children who eat a chocolat bar or something other sweet other children see them and want to eat this too but the parents dont want them to eat more sweet things than they eat normally and ,0
18977, they are the bad parents who dont let their children eat what they want children in the age of  are ,7
18978," to young to know what is good for them and what isnt parents can better know what their children need or want for a present or they can ask the child

in my opinion it should not be allowed to make television advertising  it is better ",14
18979, the advertisement is  the parents so everyone who wants and who have enough money can make advertising but the parents can say what the children need and what not and it dont give a lot of row the children are too young for directet advertising,16
18980,"nowadays there is a lot of advertisments in the television directed to different kind of groups
groups with different interests and characteristics
some groups are easilier influenced than others children for one are ",14
18981," simple to manipulate
the product just has to be presented with some flashy colors and they all suddenly need this object
but is it okay to have all these ads
children dont know what they want they just want what the others have what is new
and these adverisments use this ",0
18982, on purpose because they know sooner or later most children will have been working their parents long enough in order for them to buy it ,9
18983," that the children are calm again
on the other ",8
18984," if those ads were to be banned all of a sudden the companies wont sell as much no more
it would have quite a grave influence on the economy without really helping anyone
maybe those ads are manipulating the children but adults are manipulated ",16
18985," by ads and media
lastly banning these ads is only milding the symptons not curing this materialistic disease europe is suffering from ",23
18986," their free will was stomped by the americans the british and the soviets
these children as said dont know what they want and the adults seek it alike in these times it is order guidance discipline a purpose other than existing so banning these ads will not do much good anyway
",16
18987, theres no need to do ,18
18988,"many peoples in the world couldnt live without television because there are newsflashes films series documentation and much more so should watch young children with the age  television but the big question is should television advertising toward these young children be allowed

the positive effects of advertising to children is that they may learn what they like often children like the same tihngs in television as in their real life another effect is that they learn the language ",14
18989, they listen to it  and they ,3
18990," learn many voices of the life like animal voices
negative effects are ",21
18991, that if the children see and like an advertising of a television programm they want to see it immediately they seat ,13
18992, the television for hours if the parents dont do anything ,1
18993, going out and playing with other children television may ,1
18994, make the children unsure of what they already know because not everyting in televison is true and many things are invented the children may ,6
18995, have fear from some tv programms an ,6
18996," this they might sleep bad

in general ",19
18997, the parents of the children should decide if television advertising to their children is okay so its all right from the television company if they make television advertising  if parents want that and in this sense it should be allowed and parents who didnt like this advertising to their children shouldnt let them know that because up to five years it isnt necessary to watch television they can learn much more ,14
18998, playing with other children or reading some books with many pictures and noices,1
18999,"should tv ads dircted toward young children be allowed

the television is a common way to bring information to customers by publishing advertising a lot of people do use the tv to watch their favourite movie series or the news some people do watch tv just because theyre bored and do not know what to do ",14
19000, frequented its extremely interesting for enterprises to show their products in the breaks between a tv show if a lot of people do see the advertising the probability will raise that more potential customers will buy the product the income of the enterprise will raise too and their goal is achieved but there arent only adults watching tv also a lot of children love it to watch their favourite movies like cartoons or disney films for sure companies have seen the potential to sell childrens products in the pause between a disney film ,10
19001," 
but critical voices say that children get confused by these advertisings made for them they dont understand if the ad is saying the truth or not they cant make this difference after they have seen an advertising they will go to their parents and ask them to buy the shown product if they wont the child will cry until they do it and exactly this mechanism is planned by the company which has shown the advertising and because this is ",2
19002, betrayal towards the children because they cant analyse the ad correctly about its correctness and secondary because the parents do not have a choice to buy the product or not ,16
19003," this should be forbidden not to mention that its the parents job to decide what is right for their son or daughter and not the televisions












",17
19004,"advertisments aimed towards children unmoralic or okay

some advertisments are particularly aimed towards children this will influence them without them or the parents even noticing is this a problem or does it have  too little of an impact to care about it 

if you look at the ",16
19005," of view of the parents they will always buy the stuff their kid wants in terms of food or diapers or whatever so they might pay more for something they could buy cheaper without any loss of qualitythis may in some cases lead to the parents having financial issues and they do this only to make their child happy because theyve been influenced by these advertisments

when you look at the companies ",2
19006, you can recognise that this will make them earn more money which probably every company on earth wants to achieve so ,23
19007, if they are allowed to use these kinds of advertisments they ,11
19008," will use them as it has only positive effects for their company just think of it as if you were the guy in the company who is in charge of the advertising department if you are honest with yourself you know that you would use this technique too to earn more money

finally in the societys ",11
19009, of view some will say that this isnt a big problem at all and can be ignored some will say that it is unmoralic and that the companies definitely shouldnt do it and there will be people that dont care at all so ,23
19010, it is difficult to get to one ,18
19011, to this problem and say whether it is okay to use television advertising to have an impact on children ,14
19012," that some particular companies can make more profit 

personally i ",23
19013, that little children will be influenced in such a crucial way that this would lead to any bigger problemseven ,7
19014, say that it is not right to make money by using innocent children,12
19015,"technology has advanced really fast in the last couple of years one of the most used and probably the one thing every hous and family uses is a television
there are now many diffrent kind of televisions which are diffrent in styles and ",10
19016, in their function how to sell these products themselves is a sciencefield on its own the older generations were not used to  or even not allowed to watch television now parents look at the tv as a cheap babysitter this developpement gives room for the companys which produce the adverstisment to directly speak to 2 and up until 6 years old childrenthe companys which produce the advertisments have always specific goals either they want to have a special kind of ad which was never seen ,0
19017, it is special and stays in the minds of the people who are watching tv the other technique is to overplay an ad ,10
19018," the ad gets accepted and a habit to see in the television normally ads are here to provide information over a new product or they just want to sell their own product
nearly everyone likes to watch tv and this gives the producers of the ad an oppurtunity to sell their stuff and they are getting more and more agressive in new commercials ",11
19019," many other companys trying to sell the same product in the end the children are the ones who see in the stores the products they have seen magicly in the tv and because they look nice and their friends have them they want them and beg the parents to buy them but the parents are the ones with the money and not the children so it is clever to let the kids see what is new and what they could buy because if only the parents would see it they  think its just an other dumb ad but if their kid begs them to buy it they are letting themselves easier to buy it because they dont want to be cruel
so it is kind of messed up that the companys are targeting already the very young children which are innocent and dont know that they are being influenced by the ads but from an older age like 5 years  in my oppinnion its okey because from there on the childreen tend to start wanting specific toys and to showcase them in an ad is really cleverso why not trying to get the childern already in an early age to accept ads in their function thaat later maybe they work as planned",2
19020,"tv watching for young children is a hard issue to talk about everybody has another opinion to that but the children have mostly no other idea than watching tv or game on the computer 

one ",17
19021, for tv watching for young children is that they could learn something about the world ,17
19022, watch the news or some documentary films it could ,19
19023, be that they watch a film or serie with their parents and that like connects the familys relationship they could have together fun and laugh about the same things in future many jobs will have something to do with electric gadgets like computers televisons or tablets these children are ,24
19024," very good prepared for their future because they already know how this electronical gadget would work

a ",23
19025, against tv watching for young children is that they dont know what else they should do in their free time with their friends they have no other or almost no other idea what they should do together my parents always said ,17
19026, you watch too much television youll get squared eyes today i and everybody else know that this statement is not true but ,18
19027, they just wanted to say that ,19
19028, would be dependent on tv watching and in some ways ,10
19029," that this is absolutely true 

in my opinion children should be allowed that they could watch sometimes tv ",17
19030, every day 15 minutes but not too long they should have ideas that what else to do and not just hanging around and watching tv all the time ,1
19031,"in switzerland people watch tv three hours a day on average thats quite a lot of time even in young childrens life television is very present a tird of the time people watch tv they watch advertising the following essay is going to explain why advertising should not be allowed toward children aged 

at the ",14
19032," place young children are not able to handle with advertising if children are young they are very goodbeliving they think that everything people say in tv its true that means that they are very easy to improve thats exectly what the advertising companies want to do 

at the ",16
19033," place advertising learns young children a false way to see the world well advertising is all about material things it learns that your cool or popular if you have a lot of stuff but thats totally wrong its all about your caracter and not about what you posses

not to forget is that not all of the families have a lot of money to use for their childrens toys that can be very stressing for parents if they arent able to buy all things their childrens wish other parents maybe are able to buy their children the newest toys they saw in advertising spots that couls cause that children are jealous of each others 

in conclusion advertising towards young childrens causes lot of problems not only because of jealousy it ",0
19034, shows the goodbelieving children a fals way of life thats why it shouldnt be allowed,12
19035,young children often watch television nowadays because of that there are more and more advertisements directed to children but to what extent can we support advertisements directed to our children ,14
19036," it influences them withour them noticing

in our modern world there is no way to fully live without advertisements sure enough on television a great part of our advertisements are shown however ",10
19037, we go to a supermarket or just outside for a walk we are exposed to many different kinds of advertisements a huge part of it is directed  ,11
19038, why should we ban television advertising directed  ,15
19039, accepting all the other forms of advertisements directed to our children another ,16
19040, that television advertising directed  should not be forbidden is the ,15
19041," that once children hit a certain age they will be exposed to advertisements anyways so maybe its better for them to learn how to deal with it from a very young age

on the other ",13
19042," young children most often dont understand that not everything on television is true which isnt a huge problem if theyre watching a childrens show but advertisements use that innocence to make them believe that they need a certain product in that way television advertising influences our children badly without them noticing because of that television advertising is a disgusting way to make money from children who dont understand whats going on

in conclusion it is impossible to ban all advertisements directed  ",14
19043," not allowing television advertising directed  would be a start at least

",15
19044, with the statement i find the children in the young age should better play in the nature children should go to the school and ,8
19045, that at home they should go play in the garden or something with friends i dont find it goot ,1
19046, children go home and watch for the whole evening tv ,1
19047, that today are more and more tv programms which arent make for children i mean ,17
19048, you scroll on your tv programm there is sometimes only things witch the subject war suicide horror thriller and something like that ,6
19049, these arent subject for children and as i know the children they would watch these series and films ,6
19050," they are alone at home so the children should play in the nature and dont watch tv the whole evening 
i ",1
19051, think that children who plays regulary in the nature are healthier as these children who are only at home when they are in the nature they are ,8
19052," in contact with schmutz and thats good for them 
another reason why tv schouldnt be allowed is that the children would be more outside there they would play many games so they would always be moving and fit today more and more children are fat because they have to less movemement
when the children play outside they play a lot of games with other friends or other children they dont know so its perfect to start an new friendschip with others and you have more fun because you know everybody 
the children should better go outside to do sport and have fun with friends
",17
19053,television is a daily theme doesnt matter for who kids teenager adults everyone is confronted with that theme but now we talk about how the advertisments are s kids is that a good thing or not should it be allowed or not those are all questions we have to think about at latest ,14
19054," we are grown up and have kids would you like it if the tv advertisements are s your kids

there are always positive things about it and negative ones advertisements are a great way for kids to see something and learn about something because ",14
19055, watch the avertisements in an intrested way its a good chance to let the kids see something they have to learn about anyways but if the advertisements are ,16
19056," the reason why kids know what they could have and if its s them they feel like they really have to have it and start wining about it infront of the parents
kids at the age of two mostly dont really get what theyre watching and dont get really influenced by the comercials ",24
19057, if its s them they dont really notice that ,19
19058, it really doesnt matter the way the advertisements are done matters ,11
19059," becaus eif there is some violence it can affect the kids and they just do what tehy see in the tv advertisements 

so ",6
19060, it really matters what commerical it is that is s the kids and ,0
19061, all kind of commercials series or dvds dont just affect the kids ,14
19062, the parents and their parenting if its an advertisement about school or stuff for school or somethinglike that ,11
19063, its a good way to get the kids intressted to it and theyll look forward going to school,8
19064,"television advertising  is a very common thing nowadays through this a lot of money is made by the companies but there are some dangers involved with this 

first off theese advertisements can influence young children they will always want what they just saw in the tv this is pretty hard to handle for parents which dont have a lot of money and cant buy their kids what they want all the time and if the kids dont get the toy they want theyll be sad another ",14
19065, is that this advertisement is often misleading ,11
19066," the product isnt correctly described and wont be the same in real life as in the advertisement also its a bad to make money from young children they will always want the newest toy they saw in the tv because thats just how children are 

on the other ",20
19067," the companies which produce theese kids toys should be able to advertise in tv because its very effective and anyways not getting everything is a good lesson for the young children because thats how life works you never get everything you want

",20
19068, that advertisement directed  in tv should be allowed because its the parents responsibility to control what the children should watch in tv i ,13
19069, think that this advertisement generates a lot of money which is very good for our economy,11
19070, that not all adverts are bad for children for example an advert that presents vegetables could encourage young children to eat more vegetables ,0
19071," their health

however adverts for toys that are new to the market and very expensive can put the idea of needing to have them in their head the parents will ",20
19072," have to tell their children that they cant have it which is a struggle

on the other ",9
19073, if the parents dont want to argue with their children about stuff they have seen on television adverts they can just minimize the time spent in front of the television because its the parents task to have control what their children see not the governments lets say a child spends 4 hours a day watching television they will see more adverts than a child who watches one hour per day therefore the ,13
19074," child is more influenced by those adverts and will have more desires that his parents will have to decline 

in my opinion adverts  should not be forbidden ",16
19075, its not the task of the government but they could change the adverts and the time theyre shown,15
19076,"at the age of  children should learn to know the world the real world and not an invented cartoonfantasyworld with talking fruits and too thin barbies thats not good for them and maybe it could even effect their childhood 
but not everything on television is bad there are ",17
19077, many good shows like dora who is teachingthe children englisch or a good animalshow to get to now new animals and the parts of the world they live on shows like this are ,6
19078, important for kids its a good preparation for kindergarten or school i ,8
19079, wished i could have watched shows like this but are these kind of shows really good for them arent they putting to much pressure on our children kids at this age should have fun and dont have to be interested in geographics english or biology but ,6
19080," we have the other kind of tvshows they show them a fictional world with people with too big heads and eyes a too thinn body ive read many storys about young girls with eating disorders just because they wanted to be like their idol a fictional caracter even if some tvshows show us not a real image of real human beings they could inspire our litlle ones to do great things many shows are about friendship helping each other and being a good person the question now is if  kids really understand whats happening in front of their eyes or if they are just happy to be animated because these days parents dont play very often anymore with their kids they are to busy with work and other stuff to go outside and play with their kids 
so ",6
19081, tvadvertisement should be allowed in a good balance between cartoons or animated shows and shows to improve childrens knowledge but not too often,14
19082,"essay

we start with the question should television advertising  aged  be allowed or not 
first of all we have to know that children are ",13
19083, humans with the same rights as an adult or as an educated person so they can be manipulated by the advertising ,13
19084, as an older person for my opinion its allowed to create and show childrenadvertisings to children with the age  you have to see that only the kids whoms parents gave the okay can watch tv in all of the cases is the mother or the father responsable for his child and ,13
19085, what it is watching and ,6
19086," somebody watch television there is every time advertising if qou do not want your child confranted with this things you have to forbit it or controll it or you have to speach with your children abaout the problems who can folloy  this is the only way of prevention

but we ",4
19087, have to focus on the psycic of de child television can be good interessting and educating but you can ,17
19088, watch horrible things wich injure you mentally this goes to the question if it is usefull to watch television ,17
19089, apearently kids withe tte age of two are really anfã¤llig in brutal stories dangerous situations or even pictures with a world wich is not perfect because they do not know it better so it is very important that you as a parent take the responsability and talk to your child to his behaviour to other children and help him to understand the differents between the virt   the okonly the boys and girls ,24
19090, children generally shouldnt watch television a lot perhaps sometimes in the evening half an hour but ,17
19091, not more when they watch too much television they see definitely advertising which they shoudnt see but if they watch just rarely television they wont have any ,10
19092, by the advertising in contrast ,11
19093, they see this and the parents can tell them why does it exist they can learn something when the children know about the use of the advertising they know in the future that they cant take all this things like it was said but this is the parents work so ,0
19094, the children are allowed to watch tv just because the parents will their silence advertising and television in generally is bad for the children but ,17
19095," the parents talk to their children about what they have seen this can be good for their learning process
for example ",8
19096, a child see a toy on television he will have it for any reason but the child has to learn that he doesnt need all this stuff first the child will cry and shout and ,20
19097, it receive the toy he thinks that the ,20
19098, time he will be offered an other toy ,20
19099, he want that on the other ,18
19100, the parents doesnt give him the toy and explain why the child wont ,20
19101, but he know for the ,18
19102, time that crying doesnt helps for the parents is the ,9
19103," way much more complicated they have to dispute with their child and this can be really annoying but a few years later they have less problems with their child because he know that he doesnt receive all he wants
so to resume ",9
19104, the young children just watch them rarely but ,6
19105, they see this too much it can ,3
19106,"televison advertising  should not be allowed

well today there are lots of televisison ads you cannnot watch one single film without any ad break all twenty minutes at least in freetv on the other ",15
19107, i can understand why there are ,19
19108, many ads the tv companies need a huge amount of money for there channels and there is only one easy way to get to it yes you guessed it right advertising but should five year old children ,14
19109," see those ads

on one ",11
19110," we can say that there are many ads which shouldnt be watched by young children because they are to complicated or maybe they scare little children the imagination of a young human is much bigger than it is by an old one so advertising isnt just advertising for a child it could be much more in a bad way it depends on what is shown in the advertisement
children are ",16
19111, much more influencable than older people and ,19
19112, that the ads are aiming ,11
19113," there is no other option for a lot of tv companies because somehow they need to get money for some chanels we need to pay taxes which are called bilag in switzerland but most of them dont have any other way to get money
also the ",10
19114, that younger children are more influenceable isnt a good reason because the decision over buying something that appears in a tv spot is ,2
19115," the parents decision and not the decision of the five year old


in my opinion it isnt that horrible or bad if younger children watch tv ads so if you as a parent ",14
19116, dont want your children to watch such ads just dont let them watch tv this may sound a bit to strong but there are lots of series and films which they shouldnt watch anyway so why you dont go out with them and play football or some other outside activities that would be healthier ,14
19117,most children like to watch television they can watch films and series which are espacially made for their age and there are ,6
19118," a lot of teaching tv programms but between to programms there are often advertisings they aim to get people to buy a sepcific product should it be allowed in children television too
children who are between two and five years old arent able to think about other peoples opinion they are influenced by diffrent ",14
19119, from advertisings if they see joys in the television they want to have it ,10
19120," it isnt made for their age or it isnt useful
in addition to that children can be very exhausting if they dont get what they want once a child saw something it really wants the parents are often not able to stop it from crying until it gets what it wants to have for parents it means a lot of trouble and spending money for joys some parents may not want that children see certain products because they cant or dont want to buy it
in my opinion childrens tv programm should be free of advertisings because children arent able to deal with it or to understand it properly watching tv should be fun and children should learn something without being disturbed advertisings influence children too much and arent helpful for their education consequently ",14
19121,"should advertising directed to toward young children be allowed or not in this short essay it will be discused if children  years should be directed with advertising that could influence them in positiv or negativ ways

firstly ",13
19122, young children should not be directed with advertising of any kind because i dont think they will understand the meaning of it it is hard to know how the children react to this kind of advertising ,16
19123, an advertising about a shooter games the children see this advertising and they want to buy this game but ,0
19124," it is not good for them they could get serious issues for their whole life like aggressions it is clear that the parents play an important role in this case but for parents it is hard too to say no to their own children

the ",4
19125," the media influence young children should not be confronted with any kind of media because they could get dependent to it if they watch television every day they can not focus on other important things like going outside and enjoy the time with friends or explore new things in their lives the television advertising could act like a drug the children need it everyday and cant get out of this issues

lastly young children should stay away of this trap the companies create to buy their products

to conclure i fully ",14
19126, the statement that tv advertising toward young children should not be allowed because ,13
19127," it is a bad influence for the children who have to explore new things in their lives without any technological influence companies should be punished for creating a trap for the children



",2
19128,everywhere we have advertisings a few people say that advertising are a bad thing and lay to often but not every advertising are the same like the other we have they in television newspapers magazines or in shops so young people maybe are more influenced ,11
19129," older should it not be allowed to directe television advertising toward young children

on one ",13
19130, young children havent much money ,9
19131, they see something in a tvshow they want buy it and ,3
19132, that the children have no money these people cant learn how to deal with money and later ,9
19133, they are grownup they often have financial problems a other problem are ,24
19134, that the products in the television often arent healthy for the kids for example cereals with ,14
19135," you have never seen a advertising from a potato or a tomato

on the other ",11
19136, children grow up they will confronted with all this things when they already knew everything in this direction they are less influenced it would be ,7
19137," really hard to forbite this 

",18
19138, advertising isnt something realy bad how many people say but it could be dangerous for some children betwenn the age twofive dont realize this ,16
19139, this can be allowed for the children if parent wont this ,9
19140, their children shoudnt watch too much tv,17
19141,"television advertising directed  should it be allowed or not
it is always said that watching television is not good ",15
19142, and even more critical for children of young age but it has ,4
19143, for example watching television is a very good thing ,21
19144, the parents need some time for each other ,1
19145, that they have later more time to do things with the child it is ,8
19146, good because on the television the world of the child is not ,17
19147, it is just at home the child gets to see more ,1
19148, of life that has an important influence on the developpement of the cultural knowledge of the child and the skills of interaction between people but it can ,8
19149, developpe excatly the opposite if the parents arent present to control the activity the child can ,8
19150, change the chanal of the television and watch somesing very brutal of very scary like an action film or a thriller that can have a bad influence on the developpement of the personality of the child and ,17
19151," for their skills of interaction with people it is possible that the child learns something that does just existe in films and not in the real world 
the influence of the television could ",6
19152," in the physical developpement of the child it can be said that just sitting around is not the healthiest thing that one could do and watching television includes excactly that sitting around never breath fresh air fixing the eyes on a screen that will have some influences in the physical developpement
in my opinion watching television is not the problem even not for young children the problem is that if the parents arent there the child can change the chanal or watch too long it is a good thing ",17
19153, it it is controlled by the parents and not for too long but i thinks ,12
19154," thing of a little child is the interaction with real people and advertising outside on fresh air
today the problem is not the television anymore more and more the phone gets to a bigger problem than the television ever was because now even outside it is possible to watch some film on youtube ",17
19155," should not be allowed by the parents in such a young age 
so to my question on the ",12
19156, line yes it should be allowed but in a healthy portion it should not be too much the child has to developpe himself in the real world and not in fictive univers of the television,12
19157, it is not necessary to put advertises on television channels for children my opinion is that young childreen watch too much television on general it would be difficult to ban all advertises on every channel because many children do ,14
19158, watch channels and series they are meant to watch ,6
19159, most parents arent concsious about the ,9
19160, what too much watching television does  what series and what channels the younger watch is a bigger problem banning advertising wont solve this probelm ,17
19161,"in the modern time a lot of children watch television and between the normal programms are a lot of television advertising so the question is if it should not be allowed to directed television advertising toward young children between two and five

on of the main ",14
19162, is that if childrens are looking television and they see an advertising of a game or something to play they want to have those things its the best chance to make them want those beautiful things ,0
19163, they see it so they go to their parents and ask them to buy this games for them its the best way to make children want things children see in the television how those things are working and how to use them and than they know ecsactly which they want its better for the parents because they dot have problems like buying the wrong game and ,20
19164," that have the problem with the children because they dont like it

on the other ",12
19165," it can get very expensive if children are always seeing new stuff it can be more stressful for the parents to say no all the time and to be the bad parent because you dont buy it for them probably they get spoilt if you buy all those things however a lot of children have already enough things to play with and they dont need more new things with television advertising they get a view of life which isnt always true it shows the life where everybody should have everything which isnt nessecary in this age its like manipulate a young children i

in conclusion ",14
19166, it isnt a good idea to show those things to them and make them wanting those things but at all ,3
19167, watching television in this young age its a better idea to go out in the natur and play with animals or build a woodhouse but at the end the parents have to decide if they want to allowed their chilrends to watch television or not but if they allowed it to them its possible that they have to deal with more things ,17
19168,"essay about television for young children

every child want to watch television but is this really a good thing i mean there are a lot of series only for young children and this series say that the children will learn something with the television but is it really better to sit at home and watch television ",17
19169, playing outside with the other kids i dont think ,1
19170, years of our life we learn how to integrate us in the sociality how to make friends and how we should be to other persons all these things do we learn during the playing outside with the kids from our neigborhood we learn ,8
19171, much for our future and i cant believe that the television can relpace this things and today there are a lot of teenager who arent social and arent wellbred because they never learned it they werent outside with the other kids and didnt learn how to make friends and ,17
19172," they dont know how to treat other kids in the same age 

another problem is that the science have found out that television is bad for your intelligence in the ",17
19173, years of the life someone who always played outside is better in school than someone who always watched television the television watching children cant stay concentrate a hole day because they never learned it children without television have to engage with themselves because there isnt always a programm for them so for these kids it is easier to stay concentrated ,17
19174, the lesson is boring or they dont like the subject,8
19175,"nowadays information is constantly given to us according to our behaviour on social media we are being targeted to specific products and ads whithout our knowledge we probably buy way too many things that we do not need but usually we realize this too late this is what we call consumerism at times it seems as if we were held captive in a materialistic world where the brand of your shoes matters more than the ideas in your head 

the consumerism of the western countries is a very controversial topic ",23
19176," that already younger children are the group of interest of certain television ads

children at the age of  do not own money nor do they have jobs to earn money at least not by law in these countries they do not have the ability to comprehend the concept of money ",13
19177, thus it can have serious ,21
19178," for them if they start spending money they do not have at such a young age they might enter a downward spiral of debts

on the other ",9
19179, showing them ads s them could help them develop their own opinion and taste early on this might contribute to them being creative people later in life creativity is a main part of developping ideas and starting new projects since we face various and unique problems these days ,0
19180," the climatic change gender ineqaulity racial tension etc supporting innovation could be crucial

nevertheless i ",21
19181, with the statement above television ads s children aged  should be prohibited because it is a misleading concept the children would not understand the reason why the can not have the products advertised to them in addition ,13
19182, that many money related issues could be prevented this way,23
19183,advertisments are everywhere these days companies wnt to make money and ,11
19184," they put their advertisments everywhere newspapers billboards and television are full of advertisments for every age group out there but should there rally be advertisments even for chlildren 

children lets say from age  do they rally understand that what they see is really an ad the whole ",16
19185, of advertisment is that the viewer sees the product and feels inclined to buy it but children are not able to buy what they want ,2
19186," it doesnt rally matter if they see the advertisment or not 
what is actually important is the parental advisory if the parents themselves dont want their children to be watching all of those advertises on television ",16
19187," they should cut the the tvtime for their children its not the companies fault somehow they need to make money

on the other ",13
19188, ads are everywhere and it is impossible for one individual to avoid them they influence uf into different thinking and are there to make us want things that we didnt even knew existed why would we want the chlidren to be influenced at such a young age children are supposed to be playing outside with other kids and to enjoy childhood but it is inevitable that sometimes a little time on televison is ,14
19189, needed but in that time they get influenced into wanting toys and games that get advertised they dont get to enjoy their favourite show or programm because ,2
19190," some ads they wish to have a product or toy that got promoted some time prior 

concluding to all this i ",11
19191, with the statement that tvads should not be allowed for children younger that five companies should stop try and influence children at such a young age and we should let them be children becaous there is enough time where they will get influenced ba ads,13
19192, it is quite difficult to direct advertising towards individuals that havent ,11
19193, learned any language to a degree at which they completely understand the advertising you could only make ads about toys in which you just show the object you are advertising because this does not correspond to the guidelines to which ads are created in order for them to be as effective as possible in finding new customers for the advertised goods it would not be very efficient to show lots of ads directed at young children if this statemnt is true the density of childdirected advertising is quite low in public television why does this matter a person defending the original statement would probably argue that those ads may brainwash a child it could be influenced by the ads in ways that do not correspond with the principals of the parents or the daycare of the child however ,16
19194, this is not a realistic problem a child between the age of 2 and 5 is in the process of learning to behave according to its surroundings television is a quite widespread form of entertainement right now and ,17
19195," be exposed to television and its advertisements the chance of a child being badly influenced by the ads s it is extremely low even the ads not directed at the child may pose a bigger problem than the ones who were made to be watched by children 
personally i dont see a reason why advertising s young children should be prohibited especially if the normal advertising s adults would ",13
19196,everyone knows advertisements and i cant recall a situation where i realy enjoyed advertisements ,11
19197," watching tv as i am no longer a little child i know quite well to draw a line between what the ad states and what the product in reality will look like the younger a viewer is the more approachable he becomes for advertisement and with the increase in toddlers adn kids watching tv they are a well targeted group so should advertises for kids be prohibited or not
first of all how does one detect ads specifically targeting kids its a lot harder ",14
19198, one initially thinks as for an example is featuring kids in advertisements automatically targeting young children ,16
19199, they are advertising a product for adultes or is a pampers ad targeted at kids ,16
19200," theyre clearly not the ones who decide what type of pampers theyre going to wear
secondly theres a real danger in kids watching tv and ",17
19201, for the ads thrown at them no child aged between 25 should spend most of its time alone watching tv at home children that age should be oudoors running around playing catch i dont mean fangis but catching balls evolve there social behaviour and link up with other young children the ,14
19202, many kids are doomed to stay at home watching tv make them ,17
19203," much more approachable for all sorts of advertising
third of all are ads realy dangerous for kids this age or are they not equaly dangerous for everyone who has not made experiences with advertisements the modern society is realy used to ads all over the place one can not go to work without wlking or driving past billboards with ads on them so one gets to realize that not believing what most ads try to sell you and not buying it is the easiest way not the waste money through ads so is it not better if people at a younger age start to learn this ",16
19204, than waiting till they are older and ,24
19205, have to learn these fundamentals ,18
19206," they start to believe that they know everything 
after all i think that ads are a problem ",11
19207, the ones targeting young children but i find it far more worrying that there are ,12
19208, many kids just watching tv at home on their own the ,17
19209, that theyre not playing outdoors and not making friends with other children is the way bigger problem ,24
19210, ads directed at kids the blame for this situation goes not to the advertising companies but to the parents who fail to raise their children in  a way to protect them from ads and giving them a ra,16
19211,its shocking if you see all them young children watching television or playing games on the gigantic phones or tablets of their parents should it be forbidden to take ,4
19212," of that in advertising toward young children
first of all it has to be said that advertises are really important in our daily life even if you dont recognise it your mind thinks about it and considers the quality and nessesarity of it so if young people see products and thoughts for themselves its way better for their education and graduation 
secondly and even ",0
19213, if it wasnt allowed what would be the content of advertises i mean one cant do advertise for men on a disney channel so if you cant do ,15
19214, of it there isnt any advertise but ,11
19215," problem how are you able to pay the whole channel it just doesnt work
others argue that adverise makes little children even more addicted to television but i guess if children wouldnt watch advertise they would just waste their time on watching something else if you want to change something you should try to solve to problem in the education
so ",14
19216, its a good thing you can use advertising to give good information to the young generation but you should use it wisely and barely,11
19217,advertising has always been a controversial topic from cigarette ads that say smoking is good for you to offensive tv advertisent and a swearing goat trying to sell mountain dew but claiming that tv advertisement s young children should not be allowed seems a little weird and i dont really know on which ,13
19218, of this discussion i should be on one ,18
19219, is a bad thing it can lead you into buying something you dont really want or werent really planning on buying and doing that to little kids is kind of messed up ,2
19220, a small child should be forced into liking something just because the advertisement of it is flashy and colourful its even worse ,16
19221, the product isnt enjoyable to play with you can compare it with the pokã©mon trading card game most of the kids didnt know how it was played they only knew about the anime and just collected the cards the anime series was just one big advertisement but ,20
19222, you could say that its good for the economy you have an army of mindless children that will want everything that looks cool on tv also we live in a society that is based around consuming and buying expensive stuff we dont really need we have to learn them young am i right just kidding im really sorry for the parents that have to deal with kids who watch tv advertisements all the money they have to spend and all the crying children they have to deal with in conclusion ,14
19223, is bad for kids and if your kid doesnt watch tv it wont watch advertisements directed to him or her go send your kids outside to play ,14
19224,its easy to influence children they believe at almost everything and even more ,7
19225, they have seen something on televison but the televison workers must be free to put whatever they want and if the parents of the children ,9
19226, with a kind of advertissement or anything else the have to control what their child is looking at the televison maybe the parents of one child would think that one adevrtissement is very bad or stupid but some others would think that this is a very great advertissement so ,14
19227, this is not the law or the televison who mustnt allowed that but the parents to their children they must control what their youngs children watch on televison and forbiden some kind of programms or anything else like that if they ,17
19228, tha their child watch that or if the think that it could be a bad influence to himher some people can find the advertissement good and some other can think that it is bad for many differents reasons ,14
19229, its better to let people decide what the want to their children and what they think its bad i believe thatits better to not control how people wants to educate their sons and daughtersand give them the possibilty to choose what they children can watchor not so ,12
19230,advertising its everywhere and theres one for almost everything on the television on the radio the streets in magazines and even in our school books one can barely imagine our society as we know it today without it advertisings have a huge influenece on our consume often even without our knowledge sometimes an add is ,11
19231, there are people who claim that there should be more districtions for whats allowed and whats not for example wether advertising toward very young children should be forbidden arguments reach from the question wether childern should even watch tv too often to parents deciding what they buy for their kids and the ,12
19232, that the products the advertising companty is trying to sell can ,11
19233, be very good pructucts even ,18
19234," they are for children 
at ",20
19235, sight its up to the parents wether they want to buy a pruduct for their kid or not childern usually dont have enough money and dont know how they can buy something ,9
19236," on the internet

on the other ",18
19237, the responsibility of our society too make our ,21
19238, generation the best it can be its very questionable if its good for a child i its just brought to watch tv the whole day children should read or play ,17
19239,television today is something that is extremely present in our modern lives as are smartphones computers and electronical devices ,10
19240," 
it is almost impossible to prevent that ",19
19241," young children are confronted with the technical development

children as young as  are very influencable they are young and they are interested in everything looking funny to them adverts that are s them intend to make them want something there is the important difference between children and adults seeing adverts adults can differ between something they actually need and something they only want because it looks nice on tv children watch this advert and believe that they need it ",0
19242," they have enough to play with

the good thing about this is that children have more to say in what they get to play with when children can not see these adverts they wont know that there are certain plays they would maybe ",16
19243," play with than what their parents have bought them beliving they would like it 
they are clearly more advanced in a way that they can choose freely what they want

in my opinion its not healthy for children to watch tv excessively and adverts encourage this ",14
19244," adverts should not be directed at children that young because this tells everyone that it is okay if children sit in front of the television all the time 
",16
19245,everybody knows these annoying ads ,11
19246, you are watching tv they are everywhere and it is impossible to ignore them as we want to they are quite different like specific products for men or women for children and more but is this really useful that some ads are   young children ,16
19247," investigate this question 
first of all lets have a look to the children they are pretty young and they do not really know how to handle with these adverts if they see a thing like a mini electric car they want it they do not think how they could get it or who pays it they just want it maybe it is possible that they ",2
19248, buy something without the permission of their parents because this there are coming a few problems and ,9
19249," this is not nice for every parents 
in the other ",9
19250," you  can see young children as helpful for ads because as i said if they see something that looks nice the want it so they try to persuade their parents to buy it and that is what factories want they want to sell their products 
last but not least ",0
19251," it is not really correct to sell products in this way sure they need to sell them but it is not correct
to sum up ",23
19252, with the statement that television advertising d young children should not be allowed because it is not nice for the parents and young children do not know always what they are doing ,13
19253, they can buy something not because they want to but because the have done a mistake pressed on buy ,3
19254, and this is not necessary   ,18
19255,"today there are many different types of advertisements there are advertisements which are directed to men women teenager housewifes sportsmen and children is it right to advertise products s to people who cannot effort  this product by their own like teenager or even children

firstly the advertisement has to present a product which is directed to a certain group this means you have to make an advertisement towards children because they are consumers and users of this product and not the parents so they have to get excited about this product and again not the parents 

secondly the parents buy the products for their children ",16
19256, they know the best which product is good and useful for their child children see a lot in the tvs and they want everything what they see and like but this does not mean that everything which they see and like are ,2
19257," good for them the problem here is that they cannot distinguish between what is good for them and what is useless 

thirdly a company can only sell its products ",23
19258, the consumers like and find the products attractive parents anyway will not find the products ,2
19259, a toy attractive while children are looking at the designcolours and the ability of the toy the parents look only at the price and if their child can lern something from it but learning and the price of a toy or any other product for children are not the only factors children need ,20
19260, toys with which they can just play and for this they have to see them in the tvs ,20
19261," decide which one they want 

forthly advertisements on the tvs towards children can and do ",14
19262, lead to family problems the raison ,21
19263, is that children see a product and they want it but the parents do not ,2
19264, with their child so they have to explain their child that they will not buy this product for it which makes the child sad angry and disappointed towards his parents this happens every single time ,2
19265," this child sees a product and wants it in the end it gets the feeling of not to be important enough for his parents which can lead to huge misunderstandings and problems of trust to his parents

in the conclusion there are good and bad ",2
19266, of advertising s children in my opinion children have a right to see ,13
19267, product which they like and they can identify with it it would be very boring for them to see only advertisements directed to adults they ,0
19268, learn not get everything which they want what is ,3
19269,"television toward young children
some people think the new technology is bad for all computers mobile phones and the television too young children where aged  sit the whole day in front of the tv and do nothing that cant be good what if there were a rule that television advertising directed torward young people should not be allowed

this is a good idea because the children will go out and play with their friends but ",14
19270, the parenst have to watch all the time what hisher child is doing so they havent a break they overwhelmed unfortunatly the tv is not good for the eyes if they are looking tv ,17
19271, theyre young children they will wear glasses on the minus ,24

19273," they look television they learn something and we all know young children learn fast

finally ",8

19277," realized you saw a television advertising of it the other day most of the time we dont even realized how big of an impact this have on us now imaging how kids without the ability to disting between reality and fiction react to television advertising

19278," watching tv
advertising has an impact on our minds especially kids dont know how to handle it while they are watching tv their shows will be interrupted by many advertisments some are for kids others are for their parents these children will soon get an idea of what is popular and what they have to have lets take a remotecontroled car for an exemple boys and girls watching the advertisment would like to have this car often the short clip shows some cool guys playing with it saying every cool boy needs to have this remotecontrolled car the children will develop the feeling that they need to have this car ",14

19282," with

furthermore television advertising on a kids channel is not for kids only it can be that an advertisment for an powershake is showed between an episode of spongebob and pipi longstocking this is not  but toward their parents watching with them this is might seem like a harmless exemple but there can be more dirsturbing advertising children watching tv ",14
19283, are not protected at all the shows they watch might be for kids but the advertising breaks in between are ,14
19284, for kids parents let their kids watch a kidschannel thinking they are allright not knowing what happens ,6
19285," their episode is finished 

in conlusion television advertising  should not be allowed to protect the children
they dont know how to handle it parenting gets to a harder level and parents do not have absoulte control on what their kids are watching 
there should not be any advertising on a kids tv channel or in between to movies for kids they will soon enough get influence by advertising but they should not grow up with it
",14
19286,television advertising for young children should not be allowed because the young children dont really have the ability to understand and to think about the things that the ad communicates the children just thinkoh ,13
19287, play with that and are saying this to their parents but often the ad is not something good and manipulates the child it manipulates the will to play and the will for adventure but at the end it can be a bad product and not worth the money the parents ,2
19288, have to buy it or make the child sad and to ignore the wish just because the children cannot ,9
19289, analyse and think through the advertisement ,11
19290, that an advertisement for the child but  the parents is the best alternative way to advert a product for a young child with such an advertisement the parents can analyse and see through the advertisement and can make a well decision if the product is good for the child or not as an example we see something to play from toysrus and it is made to attract young children sitting in front of their television now the child just sees the fabulous design of the thing and wants it immediatly but if toysrus would make an advertisment for the parents it would ,0
19291, show the good funtionality and the safety that the thing brings or not brings and ,23
19292, the parents can analyse that and not just buy it because the advertisment tricked the child with its design,2
19293,in our digital age our television gets unsed a lot when the fist televisions came into the households mostly the parents watched tv but soon we found out the use of television for children the television companies started to show kids programms for children so more and more parents led their children watch tv as television got more and more famous it got attractiv for advertiser a company who advertises over a tv chanel ,10
19294," in a movie break could rich without a lot of effort a decent number of potential costumers nowadays television advertising is normal on the most chanels the effect on those who are watching the advertise is not totaly clear
some television chanels even started to show advertisements on kids chanels and these are ",10
19295," specially made for young children but is this legal or is it manipulating
young children of the age  can not realy build their own opinion and often can not decide whether they want to see the advertisement or not young children ",16
19296," react a lot more sensilbe to inputs than older people do they can ealsy get manipulatet if an adult is watching an advertisement on television he can make his own opinion about it but a young child does not have this ability so whatever a young child sees on television it believes 
another poin is that it is just not fair for the parents if their children are keen on having the lollipop from television ",24
19297," they have seen its advertisement 
because of these ",11
19298, that television advertising  should be banned from all television chanels otherwise our children get somehow manipulated in a way we do not really anderstand ,13
19299,"advertising is a good thing because without it the companys would make much less profit you can change a viewers opinion to something by just showing him an advertissement of course it depends on how good the advert is but if its a well based one it can influence many peoples mind but is it okey to influence a young child 

a child at the age of  didnt even had a chance to build up his own opinion to some kind of topics also it is way easier to change a babys mind ",0
19300, it is to change the mind of an adult person kids can ,8
19301," easily get fascinated by some colourful with music and nice voices filled adverts they arent smart enough to think about the dialogs in adverts and if there is a advert lets say about a new yoghurt they want their mothers to buy them this yoghurt if the advert attracts them they dont know if the product is made with some unhealthy chemical stuff or if the company is bad and the workers have to work way to much for way to less money 
and this is the ",0
19302, where the companys can make ,23
19303, much profit a young mother dont want her children to be sad ,9
19304," if the kid says he wants this yoghurt the mother is most likely going to buy it without the children as a group which you can attack with adverts the economy would be way smaller

for companys kids are a good object for advertising because they are ",16
19305, easy to convince but i ,19
19306, dont think that you should be able to distract such a young childrens mind by showing them unreal things in my opinion you shouldnt be able to show adverts in childrens tv programms i mean you just have to look at the advert of kinder milchschnitte the advert has absolutely nothing to do with the product but they are showing some nice animals and happy people who are eating this cream filled chocolate thing what kind of world were living in if we have to attack a young childs mind to make profit of it,14
19307,"nowadays there is a lot of advertisment in modern media the goal of those advertisments is making people buy their products obviously every product is working perfectly in the advertisment people have to make their own opinion and decide if they should believe what they see and if they want to buy it

firstly it is obvious that young children are not able to buy products and clearly not because of advertisment on their own they depend on their parents their parents are caring for them buying them food and even clothes children do not know ",16
19308, that not everything what comes in television advertisments is true children aged  cannot make their own decisions about what they want to buy moreover they do not have the money ,2
19309, and they are not allowed to buy stuff on their own because of the law although they can say what they would like best it is the parents who make the decisons ,9
19310," that is why it does not make a lot of sense if television is advertising toward that specific age 

on the other ",14
19311, it is wellknown that young children talk a lot it could be possible for them to scream for the products in the advertisment to their parents untill they are willing to buy those things i guess that is cleary what the advertisment industry is aiming for they try to influence the childrens mind ,2
19312, that they talk more about what they really want ,3
19313," just letting their parents buy what they think it is best furthermore it is an ethical question if it is alright to influence innocent young child

in conclusion altough i can see what goal for the industry is ",2
19314, that it makes a lot of sense to advertise  that is why it should not be allowed ,11
19315,first of all what is exactly meant by television advertising these are advertisements on the television that want to achieve a childs attention those can ,14
19316," be advertisments for games physical and electronic

reasons why these should not be allowed are ",15
19317, the children are  years old and their brain is in the middle of the process of developping at this age even more than later and they are not supposed to watch television anyway because they do not understand it and it could have a bad impact on their developement second children should play outside with other children it is important for a child to have friends that are the same age if parents let their child watch television ,17
19318, he or she suddenly absolutely wants the thing that is shown on the advertisement and most of the time it is something stupid because nowadays people produce anything to get a lot of money so parents should not even let their children know what unnecessairy things exist but on the ,2
19319, be a good thing if children see childs advertisments because they get to know new things and it may ,16
19320, give them ideas for new games they can play with their freinds another ,1
19321," for allowing is that they learn new words children aged between two and five are learning languages most efficient because the brain is very active they learns new verbs nouns and adjective it can be very helpful for the linguistic process

my opinion is that advertisements for ipads or other electronic devices for children should be banned but not normal games that one can play with parents and friends furthermore advertisments for healthy food should really be a thing because as we all know healthy food is important where as unhealthy food ",16
19322, fast food should not be allowed as television advertising advertisements are differentiable and we should know which are the good ones to show the children,13
19323,advertising in tv why should be it not allowed i clearly ,15
19324, with not allowing ads in childrenstv  i mean the parents can allow their childrent to watch tv or not if they have a problem with advertisments which appear in shows they can just forbid their children to watch or switch of the television in pauses and turn it on again ,13
19325," children their selves here between 2 and 5 dont have opinions about ads in tv they just watch them
and ",14
19326," is that advertisments dont just appear in tv as an example the childrensjournals and placates and in the questionaire its written for children between two and five are children in the age of two years even able to know what happens in advertisments
for me parents who allow their two yearolds to watch tv often and wich are complaining abot advertisments in tv arent really intelligent anyway
another reason is that there is tv for adults too and there advertisments are much more often and ",14
19327," that children are much more reachable for ads
a simple example there are ads in tv for chickenwings in a warehouse theres a big possibillity that they say that its time to visit the warehouse anyway and there they buy the chickenwings children between two and five hopefully dont havereally much money anyway",0
19328, they cant just go for a shoppingtour and buy thethings they see in tv so ,3
19329, it would be really silly to forbid ads in childrenstv and ,16
19330, its not really cool to get interrupted by it all the time,18
19331,"a lot parents use the sentence television has a bad influence on young children watching a lot of tv is bad for our concentration and stops the experiencing of life by yourself plus children cant know the difference between reality and imagination so everything they see is automatically real for them this essay will show that this common expressions isnt as wrong as some people may think 

everytime we sit down and watch tv our brain gets in the energysavermode and during time this has a bad influence on our concentration watching television is relaxing because you dont have to do anything so our brain takes time ",17
19332," for relaxing our concentration sinks if we want to do something again which takes a lot of energy and which isnt very easy our brain has to come on its full potential back this takes time so if you have a habbit that you watch a lot of tv your brain is most of the time in a slowpotentialmode as a child the brain doesnt develop as much as it should

specially very young people want to experience life and are conscious about learning new things with television you cant learn a lot even if its a documentary the brain cant remember ",1
19333, you experience it by yourself because you only hear something maybe once and theres no emotional connection to it experiences connected to feeling can last ,18
19334," much longer in the brain and this is reason for why its important to go out in this world and see new staff in reality because you get a emotional connection to it
 
children to eight years old cant seperate phantasie and reality as good as an adult this is the reason for young people think that theres ",6
19335," an monster under their bed so if they see some scenes in the tv they do not know that these are only played and arent real maybe cant even be real as you can imagine television without knowing the difference between real and unreal has a bad influence on children 

to conclure watching tv isnt bad as itself it gets bad if you do it too much and too long its important for children to learn by themself by experience and to get their full potential of concentration and this needs to be without tv children believe everything they see on television because they cant seperate phantasy and reality ",17
19336," as a parent you have to be carefully about what your child is allowed to watch
",6
19337,when i was a child we didnt have a television at home so i was never confronted with television advertising and i dont have the feeling that this was such a bad thing my parents bought my toys and ,14
19338, i would have done the same good selection we didnt have ,18
19339," more time to play with my brothers at home or in the nature 

young children are not experienced enough to see that they cant have anything if they see advertising they just think i need this and they cry momma i want this for parents its hard to stand the wishes of their children and ",9
19340, they end up buying a lot of things that are just in the wardrobe or made in chinaplastic that is broken ,9
19341, a few weeks so the children will look for new toys and find them  ,20
19342,"  in television advertisement

in the society that we have capitalism reigns and ",10
19343, its a bad thing it brought us far and i want like to miss our good economy free marketing is important ,23
19344," and wouldnt work without advertising so its hard to forbid some kind of advertisement because than we are going in the direction of an economic system that is controlled by the state

so dont allow is maybe not the best way to protect the younger generation ",15
19345, its more important that parents teach their children how to deal with advertising learn them to say no and show them that not every toy is necessary to have a great childhood its enough to play outside in the nature with some friends or for exemple brothers i am the living example for this ,0
19346,in my generation we often talk about the developement from technology it is no secret that people today are more connected to technologys than ever ,23
19347, the tvs are getting bigger and bigger it is no surprise that children in young age are watching television about an hour or more a day the world i going foreward and today watching television is normal even for young children but are we one the right way of our developement when i was four years old i playd the whole day with my toys and ,17
19348, that experience is important we learnd what it meant to be bored and we learnd to do something on our own i remember the ,8
19349, time i built an lego house on my one i felt like the king of the world and is not that the experience that children who only watch tv are missing another reasen why ,17
19350, that watching television in younf age is not good is that the mother  child relation is not as good as if they would play with theyr children advertising television should not be forbidden but maybe it would be better if parents would only let there children watch television about an hour a week maybe sometimes we should listen to the old people ,17
19351, they are talking about the good old times,18
19352,"are children being manipulated by television

nowadays nearly every child watches tv at least once in a ",17
19353, there are many shows for young children ,6
19354, on but theres one thing everyone dislikes ,19
19355," watching tv advertisments every half an hour theres a five to ten minute pause for advertising and theyre getting even longer and like in every channel theres advertising in the channels for young children should television advertising s young children be forbidden

channels have to earn money and the best way of doing that is showing advertisments but who wants to put their advertisment on a channel which is for children i mean the advertisment would be watched mostly by children and this wouldnt be worth it so the only advertisment that are worth to be showed on a channel for children is one that is directed to them 
but many advertisments are made ",14
19356, to make the viewer by something ,18
19357," these advertisments are often manipulativ they want you to do what they want young children can be manipulated much easier than adults one could just make an advertisment about some kind of soda every hour and its likely that this child will remember this soda this could lead to an obsession with it this could make the child obese and thats already a big problem nowadays
but that would be one of the smaller problems one could use advertisments to make children much more things imagine if during the ",16
19358," many children watching tv and being manipulated 

one could argue that the parents are much more influential for those children and that it is their job to watch their children and make sure they dont watch too much tv
however nowadays there are too many parents not being able to handle parenting and just letting their children watch tv all day

in my opinion tv advertising toward children should not be allowed children should not be manipulated ",14
19359, early in their lives it could become a much bigger issue than just wanting to buy some stuff ,9
19360,these statement is really hard and strict ,21
19361, it is impossible to stop the television advertising because the companies want to start by the young children with their advertisement so the children can nerve their parents and get the things they wanted without the direct advertisements on television they cant explore the world in this way ,14
19362," fast they see everywhere advertisements why should it get forbidden on the television

on the other ",15
19363," i understand these statement completely parents know that advertisments are bad for development of their child and make unsatisfied they sorrow theirselves and want that their chidren can look television without the advertisements because to buy all these things would be very expensive 

at least my opinin is that parents should not allow their children to look to the television alone ",14
19364, young the parents should have the control they can play outdoor with friends and have fun so it is a desicion for each family individully ,24
19365, the advertisements are not bad but the television should not show too much of them ,10
19366,"television advertising  should  not be allowed

young children basically grow up with a television in their household nowadays there special tv channels that show a suitable programm for young chidren ",14
19367," kika in germany in order to run the channel sucessfully they have to place commercials in between the different tv series these commercials are often adressed  the target group of the tv channel

in my opinion adressing a commercial  has several problems first of all these young kids do not realise that this is a commercial and the promoted products are often very expensive they want to have this products and ",10
19368, they have no money their parents have to buy it secondary young children basically love everything that looks fun they cannot decide wheather they really need this products or not they just want to have it another important ,2
19369," to mention is that even elder people often cannot resist the demand to get the latest gadget how should kids realise that the companies just want to earn money by selling these products 

as we can see commercials adressed to children is very difficult",2
19370," which make this sentense true and some which dont
especially young children are fascinated by the television when the television is on ",17
19371, all children are looking at it because something is moving in the following essay ,8
19372, have a look why children depend on television why it is worse ,17
19373," children are looking to the television all the time and how they change because of it

for children it is very important to learn new things all the time television isnt just useless children can learn from it a lot there are some series for children which are quite well they can learn about nature and how life works televison is for children quite important because like this they can learn something in a different way

although children can learn from television to much is not that good it is important that children dont just learn by the television the parents have to go out with them and show them the nature and how they have to behave children learn the best ",17
19374," they can copy their parents like this they can observe how life works they know how they have to behave with other people and how to get friends on television they often see wrong behaviors and the thing is that they can not make friends on television they have to go out and learn by themselves

to this not watching too much it exists many films where people are killing each other if children are looking to this kind of film they can end up really badly the children know that they can learn a lot from television and ",17
19375," they are watching to a crime or something like this the children think that how these peaple act and react is right then maybe they want to be like these people and they dont know that killing people is wrong

",7
19376," television is a good thing for children but not everything on television they can learn good things from children series for parents its important to find the middle way too much television is bad but a little is quite important 
",17
19377,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
television can learn you much things like beeing social in good company or solving things with that i just mean what do i do ",17
19378, children do learn fastly and good ,8
19379, television can be very good but technoligy isnt always good children need to go out and explore the world they need to fail ,17
19380, they can learn how to do it right ,19
19381," always sitting infront of the tv is not the best thing you could let your children do 
many series who are for young kids are full of phantasie and they need much imagination and that is very good because sometimes they just need phantasie as we do in writing tests but it has its dark ",6
19382, a lot series are about fighting and war the hate and the distruction that is not fine at all kids need to learn how to love and be grateful ,6
19383," what they have and not spend their time watching tv
so ",1
19384, that this is a critical subject and im not sure at all what i should think but i grew up not watchig tv till i was like eight years old or something so my oppinion is that children shouldnt watch much tv they need to spend their time outside watching birds or just explore the nature but tv isnt always bad ,17
19385, that it should be allowed to let the kids watch tv but not much just a lil bit  a day,12
19386," is that this statement cant be answered by yes or no
advertising is made by companies which want to sell their products theyre using their knowledge to catch the attention of the group of people they want to speak to so ",11
19387," they sell something for young children aged  the products are things which kids love like sweets or things to play 
young children dont think about the original thought of the advertisment they just think i like that or i dont care
as i was a little child a few years ago i can face this problem quite well the ",0
19388, thing they do is talk to their mother and ask if she could buy that ,9
19389," parents dont even react anymore to this question beacuse theyre ask that all few seconds 
another question is how much television do children in this age watch all the technological progress causes youth using television earlier and earlier
",17
19390, companies achieve much more sucess ,23
19391," they use advertising which is  adults because they can buy all the things themselves 
little children ",2
19392, have to ask the parents which decide if the product will be bought so ,9
19393, this is mainly a question of annoyed parents if you look at this question from the psychological part ,9
19394, children are influenced by all the advertisments in medias but ,14
19395, it changes much in the emotional part so if i look at the statement now ,21
19396, it doesnt have any positive ,4
19397, of the client but it forces the the companies,23
19398,little children are easyly manipulated for that reason it is easy to understand ,7
19399, people feel that directing advertising toward them should be prohibited for the same reason advertisers would probably say that it is the most effective sort of advertising and ,11
19400, the most profitable they would ,23
19401, argue that children should choose for themselves what they want i dont think that children of that age understand what is good for them and what isnt few advertisers care about what is good for children ,13
19402, they can profit from it since they are responsible for their children the parents must decide what they thinkis good for their children and act according to that advertising directet toward the parents of those children is something different ,0
19403, they are old enough to know what is good for their children for those reasons i think that advertising  should be forbidden ,16
19404," write about the statement television advertising  aged between  should not be allowed
of course this is a critical topic because there are lots of different opinions and ",13
19405, give you the chance to have a short look out of these ,18
19406," of view
first of all i chose to start with the cons which means with the statements that are for television advertising ad think this sentence is not true
it ",10
19407, depends on the presons situaution whether she grew up wachting television often or if the person did never have the chance to sit in front of it people who grew up with a tv at home were probably often watching there a film a serie or something like that so they got much more accustomed to advertisements than others and learned ,10
19408, little how to react with them they know that most of those products that are shown there are not that great as presented but we have to make a difference between normal tv advertisements and other advertisements on web pages that are erotic because ,11
19409," with television advertising
but now lets turn to the other part the pros which support the statement there is a lot of television advertising in tv and it often comes in a film ",10
19410, the scene is the most interesting perhaps you ,18
19411, know this situation then you are not ,18
19412, concentrated on the film and you change the channel because you may do not want to watch these people making out of everything the best ,6
19413, that you pretty much have to buy it it disturbs the tense in the room which has to rebuild ,23
19414," the film continues
in my opinion is advertisement ",11
19415, good for to clam down the tense and for to have a short break ,18
19416, tht you could think about the film and what ha d happened in it but ,18
19417, the film stops in the worst scene but what e3lse can we do,18
19418,young children aged  are extremely susceptible to manipulation by anything they see hear or ,7
19419, perceive this makes them ideal targets for advertisement experts because they can easily implant the desire for a product mostly toys of some sort in the minds of the young children who will ,0
19420," most probably go on to nag about this to their parents eventually annoying them enough to make them pay the toy or whatever the advertisement was for for them 

on the one ",20
19421, this is obviously using a weakness in another human being which is at least morally undesireble and at most illegal in some regions because the chilren are scientifically proven to be ,19
19422, easily manipulated the advertisement designers specifically target them not respecting their inability to make proper assessments of any content they see for example a four year old child will not be able to tell that a new sort of drink is harmful to them ,11
19423," because of high sugar content and they will only see the cool advertisement maybe with some cute animals or another smartly assembled theme that makes the children admire the product

on the other ",2
19424, incorporating a ban on advertisements on television could ,15
19425, be perceived as a challenge to freedom of expression it ,21
19426, plays another important role in economical development getting to know the feeling of desire wanting to buy something prepares the children for what they are going to experience in their later lives and is the ,9
19427," step to a new generation of consumers that keep the economy flourishing

in conclusion acknowledging the ",23
19428," that children need to be prepared to be parts of the consuming economy the abovementioned reasons and concerns about the childrens mental and physical sanity strongly hint at the need for stricter regulations or even a ban for advertising s young children

",13
19429, that the problem would be the advertisement itself but the ,11
19430, that those children are watching the advertisement in the case that this marketing strategie would be successful that would tell us that those children were watching tv at that exact moent so i guess that the overall problem wouldnt be the tv advertising but a new way of caring for the children years ago they were playing outside they were probably doing something with their parents or friends they would and improve walking maybe even begin learning how a bycicle is used but now they are watching tv maybe even playing something like xbox or similar stuff in my opinion this is a shocking ,14
19431, and a drastic change in childrens education at the moment they are learnig whatever tv says them like ,12
19432, they see a advertisement about mms ,3
19433, of them watching this they want some now the example withmms isnt that bad but there could ,3
19434, be other stuff on tv which isnt actually meant for children and ,17
19435, there would be tv advertising  there would ,10
19436, be other stuff lurking araound in the advertising crowd on tv now an example for those other things would be the new gametrailer for a violent horror game which the children are ,0
19437, watching now they could e scared and quit watching tv but the other possibility would be them actually amazed by the trailer which could result in a change of personality of those children because they now accept the violence as a natural part which would again result in real violence because the think they could solve problems with violence and ,6
19438, i dont think one shouldnt allow the tv advertising  but one definetly should not allow those children watching tv so to say ,13
19439, problem isnt economy which is using nowadays culture and way of educating for their own purposes but the nowadays family for giving the economy such opportunities and that is what should be changed its like one would eradicate a bacteria if you want to succeed you shouldnt fight the simptoms but their origin and its quite the same here the symptom is the advertisment but the origin is the  education children get nowadays and ,23
19440, we wouldnt allow this the only thing we would actually do would be  restricting the only advertisment which is actually not damaging childrens minds because the advertisement for aduldts would stay how it is and because of that i am totally against the action of not allowing advertisement ,13
19441,"is television advertising toward young children good or bad

nowadays ",14
19442, teenagers and adults watch television ,17
19443, children  years old inbetween the movie or soap there is always advertisement these advertisements ,16
19444," direct themselves toward these young children what effect can that have on children at that age

most advertisements that are directet toward children are about toys therefore these children want to have these toys that mostly cost a fortune in some cases their parents dont have that much money to buy the toys and as a ",0
19445, the children are mad or angry at them but ,7
19446, this is a great way for the parents to find out what their child likes ,8
19447," they can surprise them with a fitting birthday gift

mostly the very young children dont really understand what they see on television and that means that these advertisements dont make a lot of sense however if they do understand what they see ",0
19448, a toy commercial it doesnt really affect them in any other way ,0
19449," that they want to have these toys

nevertheless if these advertisements promote dangerous toys or violent behaviour it cant possibly be good for a child at that age but nowadays there isnt much or any advertisment like that on television

in conclusion ",0
19450," that it doesnt make sense to make commercials for children that are between two and five years old because they dont understand what they see


",13
19451,first of all it is necessary to say that television advertising nowadays is really common in our society everybody gets used to it already in young age it depends on the personality but i would claim that at least every ,10
19452," household has a tv at home so children rise with television
on the other ",17
19453, you could say that advertising ,11
19454, isnt really necessecary in tv it just gets on peoples nerves because they cannot watch the tvshow or movie that theyre watching in one piece children ,17
19455, dont like the breaks in their movies and ,19
19456," theres lot of advertising
another reason to allow advertising is that young children mostly are interestet in things that do not take a long time and that are easy to understand thats the case in advertising often it is ",16
19457," made in a funny way or has music in the background which young children enjoy
the last ",6
19458," not to allow advertising for young children is because it sometimes shows a fake or a wrong illustration of the real life so already in young age children dont see the life how it really is and get influenced by advertising there are studies which say that advertising does really influence us and how we see our life becuase it shows a perfect world which isnt the truth
to summarize there are positiv and negativ ",13
19459, in advertising often not just for young children but for people ,11
19460, in my opinion advertising should be allowed  because in our society we are just used to it and it would be kind of difficult to allow it for children above five and not to allow it for the younger ones,16
19461,todays television programs consists of a lot of advertisements to and depending on the channel theres a big variety between them ,10
19462, some tv channels appeal more to kids ,6
19463," others are meant for adults therefore kids are exposed to adverts too i see this very critically

firstly kids can be influenced very easily and by appealing ads the young children get very interested in the advertised objects the advertisers use this facility of influency and of creating interest to their profit it is a lot easier to appeal to a kid than to an adult ",16
19464, the adults know that the advertiser is only interested in his profit regarding this it is ,16
19465," a question of morality whether you want to use the childrens naivety to your profit or not 

secondly the ads might create an addictionlike behaviour by seeing all those fancy toys the kids get a sense of wanting something really bad and not having it and ",0
19466, they get it they will be happy for some time until they see the ,3
19467," advertisement with a new toy that they dont possess

in my opinion advertising toward young children should not be allowed ",16
19468, the advertisers use the childish naivety and simplicity to influence kids to their profit and ,16
19469, it can cause an addiction to toys or new things without the kids being happy with what they have,4
19470,there are hundreds of different types of advertising  any type of person there are shampoo and lipstick advertisments for women advertisments for cremes to reduce pain in the anchle ,11
19471, for older people and just like that there is a never ending amount of toys and other things you want to get children interested in nowadays children have way more opportunities and better toys than just a few decades ago back in the good old times children used to play in the garden or in the forest more often and they probably didnt even know what a television actually is today children have the possibility to go far away to africa where they can talk to lions or to outter space where they can fly with their favourite super heros by just sitting on the couch at home its no question that children like to take these offers ,20
19472, its sometimes hard for older people to understand how a tvshow can be more interetsing than everything around you now if companies make advertisments for things you play in the garden or you use in the swimming pool it seems like they want the children to leave the house more often again and ,14
19473, to get them away from their main source of advertising but ,11
19474, they just do it because they know that nowadays children lose interets in a toy much faster and ,20
19475, theyll go back to the couch and keep watching television and see another cool thing they want really badly so with advertising  children companies that sell toys and stuff like that might make a lot of profit because they can sell more things to children which dont really use it anymore but why should it be forbidden for those companies to make advertisments of course if children see something they really want it and they wont let go of it but ,14
19476, its their parents to make the call and to buy the things they really need and its not the five year old children spending a lot of monyey,9
19477,"television advertising 

these days there is a lot of advertising found on television ",10
19478," for our yougest generation 
do these adverts have an influence on children aged 

many parents leave their children infront of tv stuck there for hours and it ",14
19479, keeps them entertained but what they dont realize is that the ,3
19480, time they walk into a shop the kids have special wishes like a new barbie or a plastic truck at ,20
19481, they go witht he flow and see that there are many other mothers buying those toys for their kids that age the tv adverts which are  do have an influence that way they show them what there is out there that they could wish for their ,20
19482, birthday or christmas so basically it is informing them and demonstrating what great toys could make them happy ,20
19483, gives their parents ideas whats in and ,24
19484, gives them ideas for presents which could make their children happier than ever according to the adverts it somehow keeps them updated about the toys market and it ,0
19485," keeps the toys market going because there are that many parents who make the wishes of their kids come true 

on the other ",20
19486, it can influcence them to being greedy because susan or jeremy on tv have those toys and they seem happy ,20
19487, those children watching tv could ,17
19488, have that longing of having fun with the newest toys that could get onto their parents nerves and ,20
19489, theyd feel pressured in return and if they give in they buy them those toys it somehow doesnt offer to enable the children to feel happy with their toys and settle because there are always new things coming up and they get that information from those adverts if there wouldnt be any sources of information  they wouldnt get any information concerning the newest toy items on the market ,2
19490, they could find themselves being happy without having to always get new things despite that ,3
19491," what happens to all the old toys they saw on last years adverts  they probably end up in the bin they probably hardly get used to the toys they get because they are confronted with something better on tv 

in my opinion its a benefit for parents because they can easily get informed about the newest toys but unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros  the whole society longing of always wanting the newest things that apparently are supposed to be more trendy than the last hype is really sad because you forget to be happy with what you have because youre constantly informed about new things so ",20
19492, it shouldnt be allowed it shouldnt start at that age ,12
19493,"as manking grows and technology advances we face more and more conflicts today we live in a world of media it is all around us and sometimes to difficult to find refuge fromtelevision advertisingt is just another form of media this media is s different groups of people even small children but should television advertising  be allowed 
advertisement s young children should be allowed because we live in a society a state where we the people of our country have the freedom to say and think anything we want to an advertisement is nothing but an extension of a thought or a statement one could think of it as a message and one should be able to screen anything on television or send any kind of message that one wants to
yet this statement is meant to manipulate and change the thoughts of the viewer on a subconscious basis these targeted viewers arent able to judge or censore this commercial in any waythey are driven to ask their parents to buy them this product because they do not know how to react to it ",13
19494, censoring and obsorbing media is in my oppinion an abillity that has to be learned in time people who are older and more mature are able to do ,12
19495, and are less affected by thiswith the freedom of speech comes great responsibility which can not be abused so i believe televsion advertising s small children should be forbidden,13
19496,there certainly are many harmless advertisments on the televison which are aimed at kids ,16
19497, the influence which they have on kids is often underestimated children arent adults ,7
19498, all they cant form their own opinion as easily as an adult can more often than not kids immitate their parents trying to get an idea of what to do thats why its only natural for them to want something they see in the television as they seek for guidance everywhere this is probably ,24
19499, one of the reason why advertising tailored towards children is more profitable than other methods to add to that children are constantly developing their personality ,0
19500, any harmful advertisments are going to influence younger children much more than older ones this may lead to many different kinds of problems later in live which is not something i or ,16
19501, matter the majority of people want to see now to be fair there is ,19
19502, to it because advertising allows for many channels to operate for free or to have a bigger budget to allow for better educational programs or better quality television ,10
19503," advertisments geared towards children are generally more profitable 
so the question is now should we allow advertising for younger kids or should we ban it i believe there is no easy ",16
19504, there is a way with which ,21
19505, are at least somewhat happy ,19
19506, it would be best to have very strict rules on advertisments and to let someone check each one for malicious content that way we can make sure that it ,11
19507, exists and finances our television but companies cant use morally questionable methods to get kids to buy their things,14
19508,there already is advertising toward anyone ,11
19509, why not toward young boys and girls they are ,7
19510," part of the economic system as we are
children at a young age are a very good destination group to have i guess you ",8
19511," can imagine that little girl sitting in front of the television and watching an advertisement for a sweet pretty puppy doll so what do you think of course  she will be begging for this doll for days her mother will have become weak by  the time you see the allowance of television advertising is economically definitely great for some companies
but ",10
19512," it pulls the children already on the path of consumption and this is absolutely not how this generation should be raised at the moment the older generations are just like that but we should protect the kids of this how could we live in a world where already children in preschool measure their worth by what they possess or wear
the other big theme about children of television is the sexualising that is taking place in television all the time there are television advertising toward young kids of sexy underwear and makeup and oversexualised dolls
 in the end ",14
19513, it is bad for young children to look television anyway but you definitely shouldnt make television advertising toward children the reason is that you ,14
19514,the television is often used to influence and manipulate people especially children are manipulated very easily but television advertising can entertain too because it makes children see the new toys they could have this manipulation ,14
19515, the stores are full of candy ,20
19516, you are leaving if television advertising should not be allowed there would be ,15
19517," many things which had to be not allowed too
otherwise it is not good to show children what toys they must have to be cool or something children should have the possibility to think about their favorite toy by themselves of course it can ",20
19518, you see something in television for your wishlist for christmas or your birthday children dont go everyday to the stores to buy new toys ,20
19519, where would they be able to see them as television is a very common thing for young and old people the advertising is ,10
19520, a good thing to see whats new without having to run into the ,19
19521," store
but if parents dont raise their children right the children might get angry ",9
19522," they dont get what they want the parents would need to make sure that their children know that they get manipulated by advertising and that the toy maybe isnt that perfect and fun as it looks in the television

",20
19523, television advertising for children should be allowed because i know how much fun it was ,13
19524, to see a new toy and to put it on my wishlist for christmas wishing and dreaming are some of the best things in childhood and as a child i knew exactly what toys i wanted and which not not every advertising was attractive ,20
19525, children do know exactly what they like or want no matter how the advertising looks like,2
19526,the technological change maybe is ,23
19527," invite we cant controll all this changes the reason is that without this changes like television advertising  we are closed to this world but theres some benefits and disavantages that we should know about televison advertising because the victimes usually are children which grow up with this changes

theres ",10
19528," the danger that the children sees some scene in the television which is not really clear for the children the best example is love scens 25 years old is not the age that the kid can understand this informationsso the child can not deal with the situation it could lead to psycial problems which is really dangerous in this age
the other vision is that tv is good to learn the language specially in the age 25 years its the best time to increase the vocabulary there are ",17
19529," channels which matchs whith childrens humor and the the child learn to deal whith situations so the children has more connection with the world and can find them better

my opinion is that tv advertising for the young children should be allowed we live in a world that changed to a intelligent world we should learn the things around us its really important to learn this things in this age so you can pick up the vocabulary very fast and the child learn to deal with the sitations in his real live but ",14
19530," very important is to h


",21
19531,in modern time television and other technical instruments ,10
19532, computers and tablets became normality for a lot of young people and even childern but is television for young children beneficial or ,17
19533, it depends on the subject and the way how the information is passed to the children children of a very young age can take up information a lot better and faster in the ,8
19534," years everything that is essential sticks to the mind of the children therefore its possible that television advertising  can be helpful if they see the pictures and hear it simuntaneasly it might help them to remember things better also if the parents contribute to it and watch the programm with their children together it might improve the effect

on the other ",14
19535, starring at a televisionscreen isnt the very best for a young child it may cause headaches or even hurt their eyes childern at that young age ,17
19536, cant read properly or at all maybe it would make more sense if the knowledge and informations of the tv programm is being passed through books and textes its essential for a child to learn how to read a text and to understand it reading improves the intelligence whereas watching television does almost nothing to it ,17
19537," you only have to stare at the screen and listen to a voice

summerized there are many ",18
19538, that speak against televison advertising toward young children but there are ,13
19539, benefits despite that readig is much better for children television can be used as an additional help therefore i wouldnt ban it but as a parent i would make sure that my child gets ,17
19540, books and televison so i ,6
19541, it only would be contraproductive ,21
19542,if adult people see an advertisement on television they often dont watch to closely they arent interested in the majorty of the advertised products and ,11
19543, they are they are only influenced in their purchasing decision by some degree now a child ,9
19544, a small one views advertisement completly different it often can not differenciate truth from lies and is way easier influenced ,11
19545, an advertisement of a specific toy is shown in which all the children posessing it are happy the child will think its own life would definetly be better if it posessed this specific toy this can even lead to a ,0
19546, where the child envies the people shown in the advertisment ,0
19547, they are only characters playing their role the children ,7
19548, often try to force their parents to buy this specific toy by crying or even beating them this is even worse if a company promotes an unhealthy lifestyle if ,20
19549, mcdonalds is adverstising their products ,23
19550, at a young age many will often eat there for the rest of their lives and damage their health so ,4
19551, advertisement for young childen because they are to easily infleuncable,16
19552,everybody watches television young old male female it doesnt matter some watch more than others but thats ,6
19553, advertising or comercials are not everyones favorite their duration are too long and they appear too often still they are necessary for the tv channel to earn money comercials can be used in different ways either it really shows you the product in its best ways or it just shows you a supermodel doing ,10
19554," super cool stunts or nothing at all and most of the time the comercial had nothing to do with the product itself 
now are advertisments bad for infants they can be children are very influental many little kids try out things they reall shouldnt based on what they saw on tv so should we ban advertisment for children in my opinion absolutely yes kids are easily tricked and brainwashed into liking something or wanting to do something 
like i said ",0
19555, children are very curious and they want to try things out themselves if they see their favorite hero doing a backflip in a comercial ,6
19556," they will try the same thing they could hurt themselves badly and many people will just shrugg it off and pretend like nothing bad happend they say that its the childs own fault that it got injuries but its a kid it didnt know any better how could heshe the adults were doing it on tv why shouldnt they be able to do the same
but advertisments arent just bad things they are good for the market especially kids they are a very good audiance why do you think parents buy ",2
19557," much stuff for their kids certainly not because they thought that specific toy would be a great thing to have it was the choice of their offspring shehe wanted it because shehe saw it in the comercial children can be very presistent in their choice and desire of something and if they dont get it right away they will cry parents dont want their kids to cry especially if theyre  years old so they buy it 
the conclusion is if you see children as a marketgroup ",20
19558, yes show it to them if you see them as people ,19
19559," no stop showing it
in my opinion we shouldnt show little kids comercials we shouldnt abuse our power over them to make them buy stuff but protect them from their own ideas",12
19560,advertising is used all over the globe as a means of marketing a product or service television advertising is an effective methode for companys to advertise their product or service and gain new customers it is ,10
19561, a big income source for broadcasting channels television marketing ,10
19562, to other marketing strategies is very effiectiv because it reaches people of ages ,23
19563," that many people watch television

everybody knows about televisoion ads that disrupt their late night movie or football match that their watching this makes television advertising expected and catches noone of guard thus parents can switch off the television if they do not want their kids to see it

futhermore children do not take the decision to make a purchase they can only influence heir parents decision then again its up to parents to decide if they want to get influenced or not

however children of young age are very vunerable and should be protected from the aggressiveness of television advertising if broadcasting channels had guidelines they should admid to it would be much easier to regulate everything

in addition to that televsision shows aimed at young children should be a place of education and recreation advertising is definitely out of place here

in my opinion television marketing s young children should not be allowed the governement needs to set up guidelies and regulate them this would protect children ",13
19564, they are most vunerable and take stress off of the parents,8
19565,television advertisings are supposed to support the companies in question by proposing their rpoducts on screen however these can be very misleading and customers have to be quite careful ,11
19566, buying them young children are often very unexperienced in that matter and are more easily manipulated witch ,2
19567," can be seen as immoral

but that ",21
19568, should not prevent companies to produce advertisings s children the ,13
19569, that young children often have little to no pocket money leads to the ,9
19570, that they are not able to buy the products in question they often ask their parents to buy them which ,2
19571," allows their parents to carefully look at the advertised products and later decide whether or not they will buy them

every kind of advertisement can be misleading towards young or old companies are somewhat forced to advertise their products for the income so ",0
19572, any kind or advertising methods should be allowedd,11
19573,"televisions play an important rule in our daily lifes advertisings are a part of it the longer the more young children use a tv children can be influenced very easily thats why its important to evaluate whether television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not

one strong ",14
19574, for stronger rules of such advertisings is that you can influence children in a positive way you could ban advertisings which lead to an unhealthy lifestyle and ,16
19575," support education and sport
if these advertisings were banned completely the kids wouldnt be influenced neither positive nor negative they could focus on being a child enjoying their tv show without worrying about new stuff and money
the last ",13
19576," for such a restriction would be that parents dont have to worry about it they dont have to explain their children why they dont get a new toy or why the advertisings looks better than the it actually is

on the other ",20
19577," for advertisings
selling advertisings is an importnant source of money for tv channels ",10
19578," for channels with children as their main aim by cutting childrenoriented advertisings theyd loose a lot of money
if you just made stronger rules of such advertisings many enterprises and factories would have a benefit over the ones that mustnt make an advertising this would lead to unequal possibilities in the market

personally ",13
19579," that we should be very attentive what we want to show to children because advertisings can have many influences on them a compromise should be found i imagine something similar like the alcohol advertisingban in switzerland let them discover what new toys exist or what they could save for but make clear limits of what should be permitted
",13
19580, with the statement because they ,21
19581, see the parents as an allknownperson so the last word from the parents is wright the age between two and five is easy to influence but not enough that the children influence afterwards their parents they ,7
19582, dont have ther own opinion they tell that they have but ,19
19583, they just retell the sentense of ther parents i know that a child ,6
19584, seen something very cool in the advertise wants to have it but if the parents explain and tell them the contraire or show them something different they wont be anymore interesseted i have the impression that ,2
19585, the age of five the children start the make their own opinion they have allready some money and they are able to go some where ,24
19586," walk away from their parents and buy it by themself 
the age of two they dont understand what the are talking in the television and they just look at the persones and their movements the age of three is the age of saying no everything is not good if it is or not but just the ",24
19587, they can say the word no so they see something in the television and the parents ask him if he would like it the child will always answer with no they age of four the start to thinking and asking always why also if they dont care they will say why also the explanation will be answered with why and again why and why the age of five it starts to get difficult as i wrote above allready they start to have there favorites chanals and will discuss it with there friends they will have a depate about it they will always have the same ,24
19588," but that doesnt counts
my opinion is ",19
19589, the statement because the children arent able to have there own opinion and to fill out or to ,7
19590, there mission to get it or recieve it also because ,3
19591, some time its not anymore interesseting,18
19592, im enjoying a good movie and ,18
19593, in a sudden a stupid advertisment comes on and wont ever come to an end now a days i really dont have a problem with ignoreing all the products theyre trying to sell through the tv throughout the years i learned that there will always be a better facecreme restaurant or make up that they will try to advertise one day but i remember that ,10
19594," i was younger i always wanted to buy the products that had a good advertisment i felt like i would become a perfect human if i would posses all of the stuff the people in the tv had and it took me quite a long to change my way of thinking 
as a young child i really enyojed the advertisemnt with the newest dolls or playthings i always imagend in my head how i would be playing with all those stuff and started to heag my parents to buy me the all the newest playthings looking back i see how i was manipulated by our economie its actually a rally and efficent way to sell your products by using a child because a child doesnt know any better and will want everything that he sees on tv so i understand why a lot of people create their advertisemnt specific for little childern ",2
19595," it is not fair to manipulate a childrens brain i feel like the parents need to be strict to the ch
",12
19596,we see advertisements for children on television everytime we watch tv playmobile lego barbie and ,0
19597," on you name it they are colourful and always come with a happy tune but are parents pressured to buy the products appearing in these advertisements do children actually need toys to be happy and should these advertisements be banned

advertisements directly addressing children may make them feel like they need the advertised products to be happy every parent ",20
19598, wants his child to be happy ,9
19599, a child sees something on tv and wants that because the advertisement makes it feel like it needs it the parent may feel forced to buy the product it could ,2
19600, be that parents just buy their children all the toys they want because of the advertisements but actually do not give them what they would really need which would be love and attention because this is what they need most they do not actually need the toys displayed in the advertisments you could make a toy out of everything there are ,20
19601, good toys like puzzles or informative games ,20
19602," other games which are just for fun but it should be the parents and the childs decision alone which toy to buy uninfluenced by the tv 

in the end ",20
19603, toys are secondary in a good relationship between parents and child and advertisements may make them appear like they are most improtant for a child to be happy what really matters is that parents give their child all the attention and love they can give and not just buy him or her material things which they think a good parent would do,20
19604,"this text should be helpful for parents who have young children aged  because here we awnser the question if television advertising  should be allowed or not                                                                                                                                                        

pro to the statement is that they can learn more if they see like learning matter in the television and that they can see and hear it and learn it in that way a lot quicker
contra to the statement is the ",14
19605," that they lose their social abillitys and dont meet friends insted they are looking television and arent playing outside
then what ",24
19606, speeks for the television statement is that if there is just a mother at home with her small children she can easily switch on the television with a good program and let the childern watch that ,17
19607," she can clean something up in the mean time
an other contra ",19
19608, is that if they just watch television they dont now what the reality looks like ,3
19609, they have just theoretical knowledge and not practical this is important because the reality is diffrent ,21
19610," the television world
the least pro ",10
19611," is that they get confortable with the electronic devises of this century wich are important for the whole life like for jobs and the future
the least and most important contra ",23
19612, is that the childern lose touch with the parents ,9
19613," they are just watching tv and not talking to the parents wich avoids emotional connection with the family

to sum things up i personaly think that they should do that because i mean if you are just like watching a lot of television and not doing something else you are just in this mood of beeing lazy and tired and not willing to do something else

",1
19614, that it should not  be allowed so im with the statement today the people are using social media very often this includes ,21
19615," facebook instagram snapchat youtube on every media advertising is normal so we are all confrontated with it you even cant walk through a railway station without seeing some advertising we even dont notice them anymore
when i am watching tv i dont want to watch the advertising all the time with my tv programm i can skip the advertising because it is ",11
19616, enoying well a five years old child do not manage to skip the advertising so they are confrontated with it every 15 minutes and those advertising are like 10 minutes long i ,16
19617, think that the series the children of today are watching is not as very informational funny and interessting as the series i have watched ,6
19618, i was a child i ,18
19619, think the advertisings are coming more in the tv today than ,10
19620, i was a child when i was a child i only watched tv once a week i think that the children of today are watching tv to often i am shocked ,17
19621, i see how much of them have a smartphone i even became a smartphone ,3
19622," i was 12
because of all this things  i have the oppinion that television advertising should not be allowed 
 
",15
19623,nowadays parents let ther children watch television all day ,17
19624, they dont have to worry about them but this is not the job of the television to look ,10

children which looks often television are going to get this language in the young age this is very important that the children learn good language but in the television there are many bad words which arentt good for the children they will start using this words over and over again

against this the children learning the language faster because they hear it often when they have parents which have to do much things in their job and dont have time like this the children are learning faster but it al suppose at which channel the children are watching are they watching mtv odr a little children series or even discovery channel when they watching something like that the children can learn from it or not

one problem is that the children getting used to the television they only wanna watch television and dont go outside and play with other kids they get attached to it that is a huge problem you can see this in many families in the usa many children are sitting in front of the television and getting fat and fatter day by the day they just sit there the whole day and watch television and eat fast food this isnt good we need to stop that

",17
19626," chidren can watch television but only like a specific time maybe a half an hour a day or somethiing like that otherwise the children getting used to it and they should look stuff in their age and not whit bad words  

",17
19627,"should television advertising for childern be allowed

in earlier times televisons were not ",13
19628, popular as today they had only one or two chanels and adverties were too expensive but today we have a lot of chanels and ,10
19629," a lot of advertisy but is it nessecary to advert on a chanel for children

in my opinion the companys which produce products for children can get a lot of money if the show their products on those chanels for the kids you can easy make a children to want something even ",0
19630, it does not need it they would ran to their parents and ask them to buy that thing as soon as they see it  on their television the parants always want to make their kids happy ,20
19631, they would go and buy it the advertisy does not even have to be very special to turn a childrens mind that is ,0
19632," for the company they do not have to spend a lot of money on the production of an adverting it just has to look funny and cool and the rest dose not even matter for the little children

on the other ",0
19633," that it is okey to make money on this way because the kids can not decide how good the product is they only want to have it i mean the companys do some tricks so if the parents do not buy that thing for their kid it will be very sad some children can fall into depressions and feel uncool that is not good for later on if a children dose not have that thing and all the others have it and this little sad kid has to watch the product everyday on the televison it loses the motivation for playing 

all things considered i would bann television advertising for children ",2
19634, it is not fair to play whit the childrens mind and feelings i would ,12
19635, try to get little costumers on an other way ,18
19636,young children are often influenced ,7
19637, they are aged around  years the time where they ,24
19638, pick up the language and begin to speak so television advertising could be very decisive for children in this age group leading to a controversial discussion whether or not children in this young should be allowed to watch advertising in television s them as they could be influenced by bad behavior the early idea of selling products or in the other ,14
19639," influenced positively by le

it is known that young childrenn are easily influenced by their family their friends or even through television ",7
19640, adverts are crucial for the television business their goal is not to educate children and there are ,14
19641, plenty of examples why children shouldnt be watching adverts ,16
19642, they are s them as they may include ,19
19643,"

furthermore the goal of adverts is often to sell something and children definitely shouldnt be faced with these kinds of adverts at this young age beacause they are ",16
19644," learning from their environment and selling products shouldnt be a part of a four year olds life

on the other ",2
19645, you could say that television advertising directed to this age group could ,14
19646, have a positive influence by healping them to learn a language mathematics ,8
19647," adverts of this kind are very rare another positive influence could be teaching them good behavior but unfortunatly companys arent interested in this kind of adverts wich is why there are hardly any of them


in the end ",0
19648, overweigh heavily as there are plenty of adverts wich do not help the children to learn something but ,16
19649," to influence them in a negative way the danger of children seeing violence or bad behavior should not be put on the line for some companys profit as children are and will always be the future of this world

",2
19650,"advertising

nowadays there are many companies which advertise their products over the television many of those are advertisements about shampoos or a new parfume or something like that a new trend which came up is to advertise products toward young children most of them are toys 
to tell whether its  bad or good to do this kind of advertisement we have to list the pros and the cons
one thing which would be in favour of the advertisements is that children get to know which products there are they can tell their parents that they would like to have that new toy which they saw in the television that would be a way how parents wouldnt waste money on things their children dont even want instead of buying their kid something that will never be used they can make their child happy 
now that we talked about the pros lets talk about the cons
many of the products advertised in the television are ",0
19651, useless or overpriced the manipulate the children ,9
19652, that their parents will buy them the new toy 99 of the time its only about making money the companies make their advertisements as cool as possible ,20
19653, that many children go to their parents and tell them that they want the product its hard for parents to say no  they dont want the kid to be sad or to think that theyre bad parents ,2
19654," they eventually just buy it 
children of this age cant decide whether they need this new toy or not they see the advertisement in the television and decide upon that if they want it or not young kids dont ask themself if they will play with it more than once or twice the part of their brain which is responsible for the critical thinking is not as developed as the brain of an adult 
after talking about the pros and cons i would like to tell you about my own opinion
in my opinion advertising toward young children is another way for companies to make money off of young children i do think that it shouldnt be allowed ",2
19655, that kids are mad at their parents or that parents have to waste their money ,9
19656, to mouth many young couples which have young children dont have that much money to buy their kids every expensive toy they see on the television it doesnt really have a good ,20
19657, for the parents the problem is that economie doesnt work like that money is all that it is about,9
19658,"television advertising  is a controversial issue 
on one ",15
19659, marketing should not be strictly controlled and should allow creativity restricting adverts aimed at young children ,13
19660," is a tough issue for the marketing industry 
the people who believe that this kind of advertising should be forbidden is that children are easily influenced and they dont pay the product themselves since the parents are in charge of what they buy for their child the child shouldnt be aimed at directly for example toys being advertised where a hotwheelscar is flying and jumping through a burning ring is clearly not realistic for a grownup but young children arent aware of that and ",16
19661," have totally wrong expectations of what the toy will be like 
but who should the advertisement be aimed at if not at the consumer directly 
it is ",20
19662," difficult to advertise toys to adults because they dont use them themselves thats why aiming directly at the young children is the preferred way of advertising at the moment 
there is ",20
19663, a logistic problem to the issue who decides wheter or not an advertisement is  drawing a line would ,11
19664," that a prohibition would have to lead to somewhat arbitrary decisionmaking in the end noone can clearly say if an advertisment is directed at a four or a six year old 

in my opinion advertising should not be  ",13
19665, that children arent aware of what is realistic and what isnt children ,7
19666," get their hopes up and trick their parents into buying something they dont actually want 

i ",3
19667," believethat the counterargument that that a restriction limits the creativity of marketing companies is quite weak because they should be creative enough to come up with alternatives
although i strongly ",23
19668, that it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward  year olds i am aware of the ,13
19669, that drawing a line would be almost impossible ,19
19670,"do young children aged  understand what they see in television advertising can they understand what the television does want to tell them and how are the children reacting towards television advertising are there any significations that it shouldnt be allowed toward young children

",14
19671, children with this young age arent old enough to really understand what the television wants to tell them usually they have their children channels with shows to learn the alphabet or the numbers furthermore to connect terms to the proper items its a good source to give young children a way for easy education in television there is a huge programme of different shows with specific reasons you have programmes like dora to educate the numbers the alphabet the colors and ,6
19672," you have shows like caillou or the sandman to give them some happy hours

however what do children connect with televisions advertising studies have proofen that the brain of young children takes up a lot of information taught from television or other media sources but should they be bombered with television advertising

",14
19673, no in this young age you should be taught about education education is ,8
19674, important for our community and you are never to young to start with education but there is no need to allow television advertising,13
19675,television advertising is always a controversial subject especially ,15
19676, it concernes children between the ages  while some believe that it has many beneficial ,4
19677, clear that it is an unfair way to persuade children because they dont have the ability to question the said ,7
19678," this is why television advertising  should be forbidden

young children have not learned to think critically and question the things that they hear this means that kids believe everything that you tell them if they see a television advertising that tells them that they need a certain toy to belong to the cool kids they want that in the ",2
19679," place to not become an outsider because they believe what the advertising says so children become victims of the ad and this is why it is very dangerous to direct television advertising on children

supporters of the television advertising  the young children argue that the television advertising can help the parents figure out what their child is interested in depending on how the child respons to the different advertisings the parents are able to figuere out what their child wants for their birthday ",0
19680, without having to ask them while this is a helpfull source of getting information from their children you can ,9
19681," argue that you get the same respond from them if you walk through the toy section of a store

another reason why television advertising for kids is bad is because the children are not able to realize ",13
19682, their parents can not afford a thing promoted in tv this will make the children get mad at their parents because they think they do not want to buy them a certain toy but actually they just can not afford it this makes it ,2
19683, a very uncomfortable situation for parents it clearly shows that the children will only be disappointed ,12
19684," watching an advertising

in the end ",11
19685, you look at the whole picture everyone can realize that the television advertising  children does more harm than good while it can help some people figure out what their children would like to have it usually just leaves the child wanting something that they usually dont get because they cant have every toy they see on tv or because the parents are just not able to afford it and that is not all the advertising often ,14
19686, leaves them feeling like an outsider because the children are not able to think critically ,7
19687," and believe everything that the ad says this clearly shows that television advertising  young kids is an evil thing which has to be forbidden
",16
19688,in the age of technology every thing change nowerdays you can watch five minutes of tv and you have seen about 10 advertisments many informations witch the brain has to understand and deal with it as my father said your are getting stupid if you watch tv is he right how much are the children influated with all these advertations ,17
19689," the adverts for the children 

why shouldnt there be ads vor children whyshouldnt company be allowed to make ads its their right to try to sell their products to itscustomers without advertising companies will make a lot of losts and couldnt survive especially in the age of technology how should playmobil and lego survive ",16
19690," children are only haning out on the smartphones ore on the pc

the tv is dying out because of the internet there is less ad ",17
19691," children uses computers the are playing games or watching youtube the children themselves can choose what they wan to see and that theyd like to buy

the problem with the advertisments is that they passively influent the children the ads influate children to buy and buy more stuff the children are raised to be the perfect capitalist with is imagination they will have problems to handle money it takes them the usage to think allone ",0
19692," somebody tells you the whole tim eto do something

one more ",18
19693," is the children can be addicted to the tv they might sit there only to see the newest products the ads are presenting fun and colors and a happy world and changes the way of thinking of a child

",14
19694, i dont mind ads for children but they should stop being that passively influential i fortunately never liked watching tv but ,14
19695, i sometime watch it i cant stand it sometimes i get the feeling getting a epileptical attack ,6
19696,"television advertising 

so much people say that television advertising  should not be allowed but is this correct and does the advertising influence the education of the children or is this just a little danger 

first of all children are very credent and the companys know that they can influence the children with beautiful pictures or toys the children dont understand the reason of advertising and believe everything you tell them for exemple the lie with the toothfee the kids would be manipulated to buy a thing or change their opinion for the rest of their life

the companys have the law to direct every televison advertising to everyone they want one of their reason to make children advertising is that the parents should look ",14
19697, their children and decide what they should watch or not its ,6
19698," nice for the companys because the children are very easy to influence and manipulate 

in my opinion the television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because the children cant imagine what happens with their decision they do its ",16
19699, bad that the companys do that because they just look for their money and nothing more ,23
19700,since young children do not have the same cognitive skills as more aged people possess one is likely to say that those kids are not even able to understand the presented add properly as their brain and ,24
19701," far enough developed they can neither be influenced nor being effected by the advertising aired on tv which is the main goal of advertising companies therefore exposing children to tvadds should not be prohibited
however most of the shown adds are very noisey and ",14
19702, to that an excess of bright and striking colours which are literally an eye catcher for these young children they are captured by the variety of blinking and permanent flactuating objects the very sensitive human eye may get dirstracted which in serious cases can lead to photosensitific epilepsy causing irreperable damage to the eyes furthermore such an handicap will last a lifetime having a major impact on a humans life especially ,4
19703, one considers the technologies one have to face in our computerised world,23
19704, because if the television advertising shows products which are ,10
19705," for young children aged  the young children know better if they would like to have those productsi mean why would a 30yearold man would like to have a teddy that looks like a unicorn but im more or less sure that his little girls would like to have one so it makes sence to direct the television advertising for little children 

in the end the parents have to buy everything ",2
19706, i cant see a problem ,19
19707, television advertising is  and if parents dont like there children to see the advertising on the television they shouldnt let them see it those kids aged  are too young to watch tv without somebody who looks ,14
19708," them and who controls what they are watching so again idont see the problem and if there is one the problem is that the children watch too much tv and not that they could see television advertising in my opinion children at this age shouldnt been showed television anyway
 
i ",14
19709, cant see the reason why television advertising should be different to any other form of advertising theres advertising everywhere in the bus at school in the cinema everywhere you can think about so if you ask me ,15
19710, that the discussion about this topic wastes time it wastes my time and i cant see the sence anyway ,21
19711," there is nothing more to say about this

",18
19712, that it shouldnt be allowed to show advertising to children at the age between  because you manipulate the children the children is in this state trying to understand the world and with advertising you are messing them up they think that they really need the toy bag or whatever is advertised but there is ,13
19713," why do children whatch television at that age theyre way to young by whatching tv they dont learn anything important they learn things that are shown in the ty and sadly they get confronted with advertisement many companies know that and falsly use that they shouldnt manipulate those children the sad thing is that there isnt a good reason to show them advertisement there may be some good reasons to show television like there are some good channels where they teach kids to understand nature or they craft something etc but advertisement is a selfish act from companies which only want more profit and they pay their profit with the knowledge of children i got a neighbor and he is now 12 years old i can remember that he always whatched tv and always wanted the cool stuff that was shown in the tv now he is a selfish snobby baggar but his older brother who is 18 know isnt like this he is the complete oposite when i and he were in that age we palyed football all the time and only watched tv once a week 
this shows ",17
19714, now there is a lot more media and the youth grows up witch it like i said it isnt paticulary a bad thing but evereyone can influence the media today and that sadly hits ,17
19715," the youngest of us
now how can we ban these advertisements they pay a lot of money for these advertisments and how can they show the world their product 
maybe we can make it with the help of the coverment but these companies will find an other way to get throgh to the children",16
19716,"television advertising is something where you cant control who is watching it or how old the person is so it is nearly impossible to perhibit the young children to watch those spots
but the other ",14
19717," is that you can control what companies produce the television advertising  should not be allowed means that the plot of de spot should not have an impact on young children they should not have the feeling that the advertising is made to impress them children should never feel the pressure on them to buy the product they show in the spot
in addition children at that age arent able to afford this things the parents are the ones who ",13
19718," must explain why they wont buy the product after the children had seen the amazing television advertising it is impossible for them to understand why they wont get it 

another ",2
19719, is that it is difficult to make clear what the advertisings are supposed to do which group do they reach the most why does a spot which shows a toy for children should not be allowed because it is  it can be directed for expample toward the parents the grandparents and uncles ,16
19720," so its diffilcult to define which television advertising should be perhibited

from my ",15
19721, of view it is nearly impossible to stop the television advertisiing which is directd toward young children first of all the parents are resposible for their children and what they watch in the tv so its their own business if they let their children watching television advertising the ,14
19722, is that the spots do not reach just one specific group of people there are a lot of people who are watching the same spots at different ages but they can all toghether feel impressed and can find reason why they should buy it,10
19723," start with examples which i have seen on the tv my sister is now 10 years old and she looks quite often tv as a little child she has often seen advertisment of hasbro chewingum marks and others now there are tablets and computers in the tv which are only for kids 
of course the opinion is relative to the person who is thinking about this but generally ",14
19724," that it is very complicated to say something about this statement

",21
19725, that it should be allowed to make advertisement to little children because a lot of people earn money with this and they probably have ,13
19726," some children which they have to feed
on the other ",9
19727, that children aged  generally dont have to looking at tv they should better playing in the nature with friends to look in screens is normal for the elder but for young children it is not ,17
19728," good for growing up with this kinds of technics but that is my opinion it could be that i am a little bit too hard and it looks like i am a father but it is my opinion at age  i havent allready looking into things like tv and computers i looked at some pictures from books or i played with my playmates and i made things like this

because all the media have advertisment in their programm you have to decide of your own if you will looking that or not but the children could not decide if they will look at this they are only looking at this and they believe in the advertisment because it is ",17
19729," cool and nice to be a princess or a cowboy like the kids in the advertisment

at least ",18
19730, say that all the people decide of their own what their kids could do and what they should no do but ,12
19731, that my kids aged   should not looking tv anyway not because of the advertisment it is because of the creativity they could loose with the state picture of how the kids should play in my opinion they have to invent their own games,13
19732,its a daily problem your five year old child is sitting in front of the tv watching his or her favorite tvshow and a small comercialbreak appears but ,17
19733, advertising products for you a working adult whos able to buy whatever you want it shows coulorful bright plastic toys and a kind voice tells you a story or a joke or why this product is a musthave and seconds later your child demandes you to buy him or her one is this right is it right to use children to persuade adults for buying them the toys they saw on tv id say clearly no this aint right children shouldnt be capitalized in their age they dont even understand the value of money they dont know what working and paying is therefor they dont undrstand what the effort behind a funny toy is as an adult you should buy your kids a toy if you want to and not because your kid is demanding they need too understand the worth of things ,2
19734, they wont understand the valuable of work and money afterwords commercials ,3
19735, for toddlers shouldnt be allowed at all but you cant simply force them to disappear by law there is and there will be commercial for young children but its up to you if they will see them you can decide to show him or her what you think is appropriate for it let him or her only see movies without commercial by buying or borrow them and if you decide to let them watch regular tv make sure that you wont buy them the thing they want just because its a musthave for them and not ,14
19736, your paycheck teach them the value of things and ,9
19737, your children shouldnt even be watching tv all day at this age,17
19738,"if we turn on our television its most likely that we will come across advertisment nobody likes it but its just there and there is nothing we can do about it it tries to sell us a new detergent or the newest vacuum cleaner but it doesnt stop there it even targets children by trying to show them how awsome the new barbie doll is and how much cooler you become with it but should that be allowed 
advertisment is a product of our economy each company wants to sell their products as much as possible to make the highest profit and ",15
19739," children are a really easy targets because its easy to influence and manipulate themif you tell a child it would become cooler if it buys those blinky shoes it will believe you and want to buy them and thats exactly what the advertisment does showing the children how fun their product is and how much cooler they will become children are naã¯ve and will believe the advertisment because they see the happy children in the televisionthey dont see them as actors as adults do  but they see them as their potential friends but one big problem without those advertisment would be the financing of the kids channels because most of the money comes from those advertisments and channels for kids arent generally bad without those funds many kids channels wouldnt exist any more and they might start to whatch content that wasnt ment for them

 i dont support the idea of advertisment directed directly towards kids beacause it just an easy way to make money and its certainly a wrong approach ",14
19740, for this problem wouldnt be banning those advertisments but giving more responsibilty to the parents today there are many possibilities to get around them and if they dont want their children to be exposed to advertisment they maybe need to invest some mone and subscribe to netflix  buy more dvds or simply record the program they want their kids to watch so if you dont like that your child is exposed to advertisment there is an easy way out and maybe one day this will be enough to make the advertisment s children disappear,13
19741,nowadays you will find advertising everywhere and it manipulate us to buy or do certain things that we might would not do but the older we get more personallity and will get less easier to manipulate so companies try to get the easier targets like young childrens aged twoto five like mcdonalds which builds playground in their restaurants to get children and with that making them loyal costumors ,0
19742," the grow up criticts thinks that this is unfair and we might destroy their individuell personality but in the others say it is necessary for a healthy develepment

there are tons of people which think that childrens brains can not really see if something is real or not their brain are not finished at that age ",12
19743," their easy prays for big advertising companies aswell they are more inocent and might trust them to easiey and do not question it if it is real or not if the get manipulated this early we might get easier targets if wie grow up or even get damaged so people are scared that young children can not see between the line and detect the lies

on the other ",2
19744, there are the comapnies but aswell as other critics which think it is important to get in contact with advertising ,11
19745, if we grow up we question it more often aswell our brains learns what it is and we will get harder targets for them they ,7
19746, think if we fall for a trap young we can not possibly make a huge finacial loss as if we grow up and fall for it ,23
19747, says that we need to learn what advertising is in a young age ,16
19748," we can learn how to question them

but even in the pro advertising ",11
19749, there are some critics well there are not really thinking about children but about the effiency of the advertisment ,16
19750," is it really clever to target young children which forget things if they get older also they do not have any money to buy things so basicly they are saying that if is not clever to target childrens because they  do not buy but there parents are buying

in my opinon ",2
19751, is very important that they learn how to deal with it and that they lie to you that is a great lesson for their life but i do ,7
19752, with the critcs but i would not ban them i ,19
19753, would regular them more maybe ban a few too manipulative so ,19
19754, i would not can the system now to much because ,19
19755," it is important to learn buy maybe with a little help at the start
",18
19756,in todays world advertising is present in every form possible at every hour of the day and at nearly every location existing especially television advertising is powerful ,10
19757," this type of advertisment is directed to all your senses therefor there is most probably nobody who manages to escape advertising but should advertising really be directed to all age groups and kind of people 

the importance of technology increases year by year even in the life of infants televisions reached a high importance not only is this bad for their health fitness and social lifes its ",14
19758, a danger for their education and development children mostly at their youngest are very open for diffrent sources of influence to be exact ,7
19759," they are very sensitive for everything that is communicated through advertising this has to result in a law against television advertising s young children to stop the industry from making profit on the back of small inocent children   

on one ",13
19760, we have to keep in mind that watching televison on a daily basis isnt healthy for anybody ,17
19761," its the parents decision if and how much they want to allow their children to watch television if children would not be allowed to have such an amount of contact with smartphones televisions and other similar products this would not be a problem 

in summary i have to say it should not be profitable for companys to invest in television advertising directed to infants ",14
19762, at this age children should not be watching television on a regular basis the only ,17
19763, i see for this problem is a change in the thinking of the society as a whole todays world is too much s technology which reached a peak with the ,23
19764, that even infants are affected by this istead of having a discussion over television advertising which is s infants the people should ,14
19765, generation to a healthy and happy lifestyle ,8
19766,children of the ages  are often very naiv and mostly in the visit of their parents if its not the case ,24
19767, by watching television the children cant decide by therselfes which of the given statements are necessary or true this young people havent the knowledge to form their own opinion concerning the content given in televion adverttising it could ,17
19768," be possible that the adversiting companies try to influence the children in a certain direction to their own profit

but ",2
19769, advertising could be a good way to teach even young people whats right and whats wrong ,0
19770, concerning the natural environment or ,21
19771," humanity


but adversiting itself for products like games isnt needed at that age most of the time young children wont understand the given message in televion ",6
19772," adversiting is mainly focussed on making money for the great buisnesses the only ones who can say what the childrens require are their parents they know them best 
young children in generel shouldnt spend their time in front of the televion there is ",7
19773, much more to explore in the world than sitting in front of a screen and waiting for the ,1
19774, show parent should go outside play with their children teach them what matters in life or visit friends all of those experiences will teach and influence a young child better than televion ,17
19775,television advertising is everywhere today some people do not even realise it other see it and belive in everithing they say this topic is now most popular than ever because nobody really knows what can happen if the advertising is s young children we do not have any experiences with something like that we should not forget the television is a quiet new technologie ,14
19776," we all have smartphones in our bags now
the advertising is directed to only a apecial group of humans that could be women teenagers children animallovers grandfathers etc there is no muster but it is known that the younger generations have not made his own opinionso if the advertising is s young people nobody can say sure in wich way this could change their lives
many parents have not a tv in their house ",0
19777," the children have not the influense of it and they can play outside like our parents did in this age they think that the best way to handel this situation is to not confront the children with it but to hide it from them they are just too young for this big confrontation they could not learn how to handle it first children need to make their own experiences with the real word after that they are ready to confront the advertising
other parents think confrontation is the best way for a child to learn how to handle things so they are always in de near ",2
19778, a child looks an advertising and can make jokes of this product the children can realise what ,0
19779," and learn this way not to take everything siriuc they see on the tv this can make the rest of the life easier if they realise it but if the children are too young maybe they do not even see the advertising like it is but only colourfull and moving pictures
parents learned how to handle such situiations on the way they think it is the best but we would not have the problem if there was not any advertising  even the people in this management should realise that children shoul be children even for a short time and not some targents for a new product my conclusion is that it should not be allowed",16
19780,nowadays television advertising is very commonly used ,10
19781, win new customers however less often do we actually take the ,23
19782, of this type of advertisement into account directing television advertising toward young children may have tremendous effects one a childs life in this essay ,0
19783," discuss whether television advertising  should be allowed or not 

first of all it needs to be taken into consideration that television advertisement may influence childrens opinion to a very large extent this is ",13
19784, that by directing television advertising toward young children they will ,0
19785, copy certain attitudes and beliefs ,21
19786," lose their ability to evaluate and judge significant values and matters 

nevertheless ",19
19787," television advertising might too strongly influence young children numerous advertisements can very often enable young children to think critically therefore children might become sophisticated analysts who have to decide which advert they like the most such skills are very important for the future in terms of becoming an adult career decisions etc 

in conclusion ",14
19788, appear to be of great importance however ,21
19789, television advertismemt do actually harm childrens ability to evaluate and judge accordingly television advertising  should not be allowed ,14
19790,"just to clear up how i understood the statement its about children watching the commercials and not commercials about things for children

statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

no television advertising for young children

why would a toddler be intrested in televison advertising and why would it even matter to them
to start off i ",13
19791, with the statement why  well ,21
19792, children aged  watch television and if that isnt true ,17
19793, they do certanly not watch the advertising parts i litterlay cant see a single reason why a company or a firm would do a commercial for children that age because ,2
19794, it would matter to the children so basicly only the parents of these young children would see it and if the advert was designed for children it isnt going to intrest the parents ,16
19795," if im understanding the statement wrong i am extremly sorry for the person who has to understand what im saying
summing up i can only ",21
19796, i cant remember back to ,18
19797, i was two but even ,18
19798, never watched tv  the only thing was dvds and things like that where their wouldnt be any television advertising included and ,10
19799, im remembering that wrong again that proves even more that it didnt influence me as a child ,8
19800, there isnt anything wrong with television advertising ,15
19801,"today everywhere we go we are influenced by advertising for us we know that and most of us can handle this but how does it looks with the young childern do they know that there are influenced do they know that maybe there own desicions are not even there own

young childern should learn early to make their own desicions in the young age they should be told about the television advertising by their parents maybe it is not a question about age just about knowledge so if they know there are influecend they will realise it and do not get caught by televiosion advertising
if the youngest generation knows about this influencing the question is if they understand it there is a reason why school starts in the age of seven years in this young years they are not able to understand and even control thatthe television advertising is getting smater and smater and is finding new tricks to catch the young childernwhich makes it even more difficult to understand this for the young childern

television advertising toward young children has two ",14
19802, it is a great way for the industry to make their money and may ,23
19803, an easy way on the other ,18
19804, for the young children it is an unfair game because they are not able to understand and control this influence ,7
19805, it would be good if the television advertising toward young children would not be allowed but ,13
19806, it is not possible to stop the television advertising toward young children,13
19807,advertising is an important thing to influence small children now the big companys which have already enough money get more rich than ,0
19808, the message to the children is that the need something but in real they do not need it the poor parents have to pay thing for their kinds with this things the small childrens never play and it ends in the corner all of this is not important the most important reason is that the companys earn morer money this is good for the economy and a strong economy is good for everyone this leads to a happy society sure you can say that is not nice as i was a child i liked this advertising very much and it makes me to the person who i am i often fight with my mother because she does not give the gift who i saw in television these are the negative effect but the money is more important the advertising ,0
19809, inform the small children what is new so the companys are able to influence the life of the children which is not good our children are part of the economy ,2
19810,in the last few years television became more popular now ,10
19811, young children watch almost everyday tv it became to be a standard watching tv at least once a day now some people ask theirselves if this is a good development or if television could ,17
19812," for young children
first i have to mention that there are some really good an interesting shows in the tv ",6
19813, documentations about animals or other countries by watching this sort of shows the children can ,6
19814, learn something for their lives or if the children are watching tv in another language ,1
19815, they live in switzerland but only watch tv in english because ,1
19816, in the young age of the children they are ,7
19817,television advertising  should not be allowed young children dont think like adolescents or teenagers they arent suppose to watch television ,13
19818, it doesnt make a lot of sense because they are not able to understand whats going on on tv it shouldnt be allowed to do advertising  because tv shouldnt have an influence in their life kids should be playing outside and having fun with other children it is important that they dont get to see too much of the social media and television world ,13
19819," that they can exlore the real world by themselves

on the other ",19
19820, they can profit from advertising in a way ,11
19821," that they see what is happening on tv and what is popular at the moment they would have their own advertising made only for children in their age of course it would be fun and pretty intersting for them to see what is going on

in my opinion it shouldnt be allowed because children in that age are supposed to enjoy their lives in another way than watching tv im pretty sure that they will have enough time to watch a lot of different advertisings ",16
19822,"television adverstising  aged two or five should not be allowed

even ",13
19823, a long time it plays an important rule in our lifes ,21
19824, if you grow up with it there are a lot of parents who put their children in front of the television and make them watch it for hours the children will ,17
19825, the adverstisings that are played every 20 minutes or ,18
19826," but are these advertisings bad for your children

when i was a child i really enjoyed seeing all the different toys that were displayed on the tv even if i knew i wouldnt get all or even one of the toys i liked seeing how they looked because it exited me ",14
19827," that there are a lot of children who feel the same advertisements s children are really entertaining and thats a reason why they should be allowed

there are ",16
19828, children who are influenced by the advertisements in another way these children see them and ,0
19829," they want all of the toys and harrass their parents to buy them but its the parents job to make their child understand that it cant get everything it wants and to be carefull about not making it spoiled

the other question is the one about morality isnt it bad to try to influence a human who doesnt really understand that it was influenced yes actually it is really bad but ",20
19830," its a way to make them get in touch with these kind of things and to teach them how to handle these situations

my general opinion is that the advertisings arent bad they can even be good but its the parents task to control the level of influence and to manage how their children will react to them parents can even use this experience to teach their children important things about life and to teach them that they wont get everything they want and ",0
19831," the advertisements you shouldnt let your  year old child watch too much television anyway

",14
19832,"television advertising

this following statement is difficult to answer television ",10
19833," is not every time to support as specialy not for young children who are two or five years old young children in this age should do intelligent things like play with others they should not watch television all the time 

so its not right that television is  because they are affected of what they get to see in television they mostly dont really realise what they are watching and are fascinated of everything
a child with two years cant decide anything alone it needs some help with decisions so parents can control what they are watching on the television

my personal opinion is that i dont ",17
19834, the statement television advertising dircted toward young people children should watch less tv ,13
19835," they get less influeced by it its not right that adult people are leading the children to watch television parents should play more with theyre children and dont set them in front of a television 


",17
19836," we look televison we see advertissments there are many of them and for all ages but it is correct to advertising directed  should these be allowed today we talk about these questions
television advertising should be allowed because all humans have the same rights and it would be anoying ",15
19837, we only see advertissments only for one age the young children like this advertissment ,16
19838, they would have more fantasy in example ,19
19839," they see an add from children surprise they want those surprisee to play like the kids in the advertissment and have this fantasy and the chocolate give them power to create new things an other arguement for this is that at children telvesion like kika you cant show adds for adults this is not intressting for little kids they want to see barbie or something like that in the advertising
argument against this advertising is ",0
19840, that kids in this age should play outside or with others and shouldnt look television but if they do it too they shouldnt see this adds it should be possile to make a children channel without advertissments this adverissments arent helpful ,13
19841, the children want something and the ,9
19842," they go to the market with the parents they cry that the parents must buy this for them or something like that 
to take up the ",9
19843, for this addvertising with the joy from children surprise this joy isnt good for the environnement and ,4
19844, you find fantasy without this joy which you throw in the bin ,18
19845, this advertissments and find this schould not be allowed advertising is okey but not by this young children they should play outside or watch tv without this add adds for pampers are okey too because this is useful for young children not like the add from children surprise they get fantasy all over the world and ,16
19846," with this joy and this joy isnt useful its for the bin and its bad for the environement because its made by plastic 
so think like parents",18
19847,everywhere we go we have advertising everybody no matter if young or old is influenced by the advertising as an adult you know whats happend and you can stay against it but as a young girl or boy you dont even understand what these adverting is doing with you they are ,16
19848," easily to influence much easiler than adults so should it be allowed to show advertising in television toward these kids

on the one ",16
19849, yes because everywhere is advertising ,11
19850," why shouldnt it be allowed to show some in the television 
in my eyes the question is why can such young children watch television they should go out and play with there friends and ",17
19851, its the mistake of the parents because its their buisness to save the childrens from these advertisings and ,16
19852, there problem if the children see something to play with and they want it the industry isnt stupid its there plan to direct the advertising to these kids so they ask there parents for thousand times if the can have this thing and the parents want that their child is happy or they just wont hear much longer the same question everyday ,2
19853," they buy this item thats how our system functionned

on the other ",23
19854, its not okey to espacially direct the advertising toward the childrens they havent the chance to stay against it and say ohh i dont wanna have these sweets if they saw the advertising because its ,16
19855," easily to influenced them by anything in this age so its absolutly evil from these 
advertisingchefs to use this for there own money

back to the question it should be allowed to show advertising on television but not  to often and not to much its in the hands of the parents wheter they are okey with the ",14
19856, that there child watch advertising or not so the have the chance to chance it if they dont wanna this,13
19857,"television advertising 

the influence of television at our lifes plays a big role today
about this topic there are good ",10
19858," to discuss and people have many diffrent opinions about

at the ",21
19859," on  television are shown many interesting topics where you can learn helpful things for life
also for very young children there are special storys mostly fictional which can be watched so ",6
19860, children sometimes watch something on television which is thought for their age parents get some free time ,1
19861," know what their children are doing


in a ",7
19862," of this influence
on television there are ",10
19863, shown many stupid topics and things which are not thougt for the eyes of very young children for example films with much violence or topics which are only thougt for adults so ,6
19864, parents just let look their children what they want it could be very bad for them an other pint is that ,12
19865," children always sit in front of television they may loose their social contacts

to close this essay ",17
19866, that just sitting in front of television and zapping should not be allowed for young children because there are to much things which arent thought for children eyes but if parents sometimes show them a special selected film it should be allowed especially for versy young childen ,12
19867," the time in front of television should be 

",17
19868,today nearly every household has a television people of every age watch television daily but ,17
19869, we watch television there is television advertising nearly every fifteen minutes which is directed to different groups of people ,10
19870," 

a good reason to direct television advertising toward young children is that this is good for merchandising when children see something on television they want to have this thing and the parents buy it to make them happy another pro is that they learn to not be influenced by television advertising for example if they watch television and every 15 minutes there is advertising maybe they turn out the television because its boring and go doing other things like playing when they know that the advertising  is during 5 minutes they come ",14
19871," this time and turn it on again 

but there are ",18
19872," some conssometimes children want things they dont really need and if their parents dont want to buy them these inuseful things children often begin to cry and shout especially children in a very young age  cant decide whether a thing is useful and if they really need this thing 
another ",9
19873," they watch a film of  120 minutes and every 15 minutes there is television advertising during 5 minutes they watch television television 40 minutes longer that causes for young children headaches and they are more tired than if they would play outside 

personally ",17
19874, that television advertising  aged  should not be allowed because it has a negative influence on the childhood if they get everything they want because their parents want to make them happy they grow up with the thinking that they can have anything they want this can bring problems ,13
19875, they become teenagers they dont get much pocket money or the dont gain much money in a job and if they get it they spend it immediatly often on things they see on television,24
19876,television advertising that is  children seem usually harmless ,14
19877, it is there to promote products and other things that seem harmless ,11
19878,  however what a young child doesnt notice is that commercials tend to be or normally are manipulative of course do young children want the toy which was presented to them in a commercial which shows how awesome that toy is and how its going to impress their friends ,0
19879, this product will never live up to their expectations advertising is manipulative ,11
19880, but advertising that is targeted to children is often extremely exaggerated too of course you could say that products that are made for kids dont cost a lot and that the company needs money ,16
19881," there are a lot of commercials for different types of candy which are unhealthy television advertising generally presents sweets in a way as if it were glorifying them and its terrible that children think that unhealthy food is valuable 
in conclusion i have to say that im not against television advertising for kids ",14
19882, the exaggerated ones which trick children into thinking they really need the aforementioned products the problem is that children probably wouldnt want to buy them without such a commercial,0
19883, with this statementbecause i dont see how this could harm these children at that age they probably dont even understand the advertisment and if they do it is ,16
19884, the parents decision to buy them the productyou could argue that children being influenced at such a young age might be damaging in the future for their selfesteem because the presenters of the product are models and show the children a beautystandart that they cant reach  or they start to be very materialistic but to avoid that children shouldnt watch tv at all because they ,2
19885, see advertisements s adults and that influences them pretty much ,2
19886, they may be less intrested in thosethe way capitalism works makes it nearly impossible too avoid any kind of advertisment children in our day and age are going to be confronted with it everywhere not just in television ,14
19887, on the internet i feel like they are too young to be on the internet or watch a lot of television but ,24
19888," most parents keep their children quiet by putting them in front of the tv or giving them a laptop to play games on so it is unavoidable for the children to encounter any kind of advertisment in the end it is the parents responsibility too judge what their children are allowed to watch and to explain to them how to deal with what they see 
so advertisement  isnt something that should be banned because in most cases its just making them want something and ",14
19889, their parents dont buy it for them they learn a valuable lesson that they dont get everything they want it is nearly impossible too keep them from becoming materialistic ,9
19890, it is again up to the parents to teach them to be ,7
19891, happy without all too many things,18
19892, for and against it a main ,21
19893, why it shouldnt be allowed is that advertisement often contains wrong information or is at least making the product look better than it is in reality so the children will get wrong informations and as they dont have much life experience ,16
19894," they are not able to decide whether something is true or not that means that they will just believe everything the advertisement tells them 
further they will be influenced by many things in this very young age and that is probably not the best thing to happen there is ",2
19895," much different advertisement and the will just have too many informations and maybe not believe the truth the parents tell them bescause they like the wrong informations of the advertisement better

but there are ",16
19896, against not allowing it if there wouldnt be advertisement  the children would just see the advertisement directed to adults instead and that maybe is even worse for them ,13
19897," produced for them because there are some things they dont have to know or see at such a young age 
also if they get used to advertisement in a soft way meaning through advertisement produced ",0
19898, for them they already learned how to deal with advertisement in a young age so they wont have problems later and ,0
19899, in this young age the parents can help them dealing with advertisement ,16
19900, they dont have to deal with it all by themselfs ,3
19901," there adult aswell

i dont understand why you would let a child at such a young age watch tv at all ",17
19902, they have enough time to do this later in their lifes at such a young age you have energy ,24
19903, you can play inside or outside or do something with friends from courses you and probably your parents are attending together when you are older you ,1
19904, have time to watch tv ,1
19905, and dont have time to do something with your friends so i dont really have an opinion on television advertising but if i had to choose ,10
19906, it should be allowed because ,12
19907, they right away get the true impression of television and not a better picture of it than it is in reality,6
19908, that television advertising toward young children should be forbidden because the companys who make teslevision advertises toward young children they mostly ,13
19909, sell things for this young kids it would not make any sense if they want to sell a toy for children and ,20
19910, they would make the advertise for adults because the parents dont want the toy television advertises are often made for young children because they want to impress the kids and if they are impressed they directly go to their parents and ask them to buy the toy or whatever if the advertise dont impresses the child they dont even ask their parents to buy the toy and ,0
19911, the company would not sell many toys and thats not what the company wants ,20
19912," they better makes talevision advertises for young children
but in the other way i dont think that its good to make televion advertises for young children of course i understand the companys and the magasines why theyre doing it but i think its just not good for the young children because ",14
19913, they watch the advertises the always think that they need this toy or whatever it is and ,20
19914, they are never confident with what they already have maybe they got a new toy yesterday but ,3
19915, they watch television and in the advertise there is another toy maybe a newer one and ,20
19916, they directly think that this toy is better and ,20
19917," they want the newer one
so my answer to this question is that i ",3
19918, think that television advertising is ,11
19919, a good thing but it is quite normal nowadays and you cannot forbid it ,4
19920, we have to get along with it and the parents just have to be strict and dont buy their children everything they saw in the television advertising so my conclusion no i dont ,12
19921, with the statement that television advertising  should be not allowed,15
19922,"advertising

the television advertising which is ",10
19923," about pampers is not for the young children self the advertising is for their parents that they have to buy this article for their children the advertising need little children for this video because in my example the adults cant wear pampers it would be very funny but it wouldnt be their idea
after watching this advertising the young children often want everthing they want every playmobil and lego and everthing it must be very hard for the parents to disapponting their childern again and again 
",0
19924, that the people who makes this advertising for young children article doesnt directed their advertising toward young childern because they dont buy it they have to do it for the parents they want that the parents buy this article and ,16
19925, they use little sweet children for their television advertising because every adult think about them oh they are ,16
19926, sweet and this could be a good idea after watching that the adult buy the article but i ,9
19927, think that in this age the children have to play something outside int the forrest oder something like that and not watching tv so it wouldnt be a problem ,24
19928, every child in this age doesnt watch tv because ,17
19929, in this age the children need to play and they are not allowed to watch tv my opinion is that the television advertising could be  because its the problem from their parents ,14
19930, they allowed their children to watch tv ,1
19931,watching television is a thing everybody does these days from young children to pensioners and its a normal thing that ,17
19932," watching television we are confronted with advertising but what if advertisement confronts the youngest of us can we allow affecting children with these advertisements

for many people television advertisement is just a nuisance that comes with watching television they ",14
19933, change to another channel or do something else untill their desired program startsbut children may not understand the whole idea of advertising if they see something that looks fantastic on television they maybe want to have it too they cant know that the things they see may not be as marvelous as they seem however one could say that kids arent just influenced ,14
19934, there are a lot of toys and stuff presented for the kids a typical example is at the end of your shopping tour ,20
19935," you want to check out there are always those sweets and chewing gums presented right in the sight of the little children in the end everybody gets confronted with those advertisements and everybody copes with it differently the parents may have to keep an eye on their children too and teach them not to believe everything that the people on television say is true

in conclusion ",14
19936, one can argue whether or not children get influenced through televison advertising too much the parents can ,14
19937, forbid theit children to watch television if they are sceptical about those advertisings television advertising arent a thing i would support but i cant say it is ,13
19938, terrible that it should not be allowed ,12
19939,nowdays the television adverdising is a part of our lives we see everyday some television adverdising  the adults but there is ,10
19940, some of them that are  at the age of two or five years old because of that ,24
19941," i would like to express my opinion about that controversial statement and discuss if that should be allowed or not

first of all i would like to explain why there are some adverdising  children as long as there are products ",13
19942, toys consumed just by children it is normal that children are the goal of the adverdising because of that we cannot avoid it children are easy to get adverdised because ,20
19943," they see something they probably want to buy it without thinking how expensive that is or if it is something that she need 

on the other ",3
19944, adverdising toward children is manipulated and that manipulating people is illegal so we may should not allowed children to look tv at the  time of adverdising furthermore it is difficult to protect adverdising is manipulated but is ,13
19945, very important for our economy so if we just refuse to see any adverdising ,23
19946," we have a bad influence to the economy moreover not just children get adverdising but adults too

in conclusion i do not think that we can protect ourselfs and ",23
19947, children from adverdising we should just be carefull and do not get influenced easily adverdising should be allowed ,12
19948, for young children but it should not be ,4
19949, extreme because we all know that children are easy to adverdising young children may should reduse the tv ,13
19950," deal with the suggestion or more the desire that commercials that traget young children in the age of  shouldnt be allowed on the tv it is sure that many people start to watch television already in very young years in the past few years it even gets worse and worse a childs consumption of tv programmes rises constantly so this question is a burning issue that we need to spend our thought on

are children at that age already able to understand what the sense of a commercial is children at that age dont ",14
19951, understand what is going on in the world and with what tricks companies want to influence people theyre only watching television because they want to see their idols or their favourite series theyre not ,10
19952," interested in commercial or products that are promoted
but exactly the notunderstanding could be the problem children havent learnt ",2
19953, what is good and what is bad their brain collects all the information it can get and is not ,3
19954, able to sort out what is useless and what is important at that age their imagination is at a peak ,24
19955," they see something they can make up a whole story of it depending on what is showed in the commercial this could harm a childs mind or give it wrong illusions

another ",0
19956, to be considered is the aim of a commercial or its advertising company behind it the goal is to have people buying a specific product or booking a certain vacation etc the deterrant at a commercial s children is that they dont decide ,11
19957, what they buy and what not they dont have their own money even pocket money would not be enough that they could go and buy stuff with in this ,3
19958," of view there shouldnt be any worries that commercial could lead to debts
eventhough children cannot buy the promoted stuff by themselves they can go and terrify their parents until they get it this creates a competition among children because they always want to own all what the others have ",2
19959," lead to debts for the parents

moreover you never know whats going on in the mind of a child and how it perceives the worlds action you dont know how it feels toward itself maybe a child already has depressions or little psychical diseases and ",7
19960, commercial can be very dangerous people acting in a commercial mostly are quite beatiful and seem to look and live perfectly a child ,11
19961," could get offended and disencouraged because it sees what all could be like 
here ",19
19962, below can be found children actually live a very happy life because they dont have no worries ,8
19963, a child meets new people theyre not shy and directly go talking to them if they are sypathic to the child or ,7
19964," a child doesnt worry about what to say or what to keep for itself it speaks out loud what it thinks its not important for them how someone else looks like they dont care they just want to play around and have fun

although we have the same amount of pro and contras i ",7
19965, with the statement that television advertisings toward children should be prohibited while contemplating the ,13
19966," for and against the statement to me it appears that the contras are way stronger than the pros 
to give a full accurate opinion about whether ",21
19967, or refuse the statement given i would have needed to know what the intention was to say that commercial toward children should be forbidden ,13
19968, that it is not harming or causing damage in any way the only thing i can think of is that it should not be allowed because it makes children sitting longer in front of a tv set because there are always commercial breaks interuppting what the child really would have wanted to watch   ,17
19969,nowadays lots of people watch television there are different age groupes of people ,17
19970," young children teenagers adults or even old people who sit in front of the tv at least once a day the one thing everyone hates are advertisements which interrupt our series in the most interesting part there are different types of advertisements but is that a problem for the younger generation does it have an affect to youg children

television advertising takes a lot of time ",14
19971," you are watching tv and most of the time these are harmeless to us but is it the same for young children young children watch tv more and more this is a great chance to advertise some kind of game that the young children want to have this works actually really well because if the child sees it it goes to his parents and asks them to buy it when they dont they will cry until the game is bought but is this a problem for the child itself
it depends what kind of game it is there are friendly games which makes children play together or make them learn something in a playfull way in that case i dont think that it is a problem to advertise because it takes the child to play with others or to learn new stuff in another case where games are brutal or lead to violence ",14
19972," it shouldnt be allowed because this could lead to an aggressive child in the feature 

in the end my opinion to television advertising toward young children is that if the advertisement advertises something fun or intelligent where young children can learn something or learn to play with a group it should be allowed but if the advertisment has content of something brutal or violent  content where its obvious that there is brutallity in it it shouldnt be allowed because ",14
19973, it has a small influence to the little child in the future,8
19974,advertising in television has become more common over the past years ,10
19975," toward young children children just like adults are prone to believe the advertisements and can be heavily influenced by them advertisiting induces our western cosumerism into these little minds securing the market for the future 
does it make sense to ban television advertising

little children shouldnt be exposed to excessive advertising they shouldnt even be exposed to any type of media including the television itself the question is whether or not the parents should control what their toddlers are watching to protect them from advertising and from excessive media consumption in the end it is the parents job to control what their kid gets to see and what is hidden the law cannot interfere too much with something that should be each parents own choice

children should learn from a young age that real life is more valuable than spending time staring at little electronic gadgets they should be taught that we must be free form the media free to buy the things we really want and to not let the media brainwash us onlythen can a child become a good inhabitant of this planet respecting the environment and overcoming the egoistic nature of the human being

however if television advertising were banned for young children parents would have a much easier time raising thir offspring no more crying over barbie dolls or lego castles the children wouldnt even know these things they wouldnt have marterialistic wishes the companies would even save a lot of money and if they really wanted to they could target the children in other places they could donate some toys to kindergardens and targeting the children in other ways

in conclusion i believe that excessive media and advertisement consumption is harmful not just for young children ",14
19976, for adults however i can understand that some parents enjoy some time off their parental duties ,9
19977, their child is watching tv after all not all tv shows are bad some of them even have an educational or social purpose ,17
19978, that it is right for the government and the law to interfere in things that are clearly every parents own choice,12
19979,"in television often is advertising towards young children many people arent the same meaning about this topic it can have positive and negative sites but which is stronger

on the plus ",14
19980, is that young children are amused they like seeing these spots because they are diriectly for them if there are  lions or  rabbits in this clip ,6
19981," most of children like tho see these they can be just like a short film for them and notan advertising behind these television advertisings are creative people which tries to make the most funniest and cutest film for children

but one of the biggest cons is that they dont havetheir one money the advertising is only used to make the children ask their perents to buy something they see something in television and they want to have it but they need their parents the spot should be  the parents who have to buy it advertising toward childrean is unfair they dont have the abbility to put this in a normal context most of them dont understand that their parents cant buy them all things from these tv spots the children should learn to be play with that what they have

but this advertising could ",14

19983," for other plays towards children in this age the parents of them mostly chose what their children have and what they dont have

19986, that the advertising should be more  the parents they chose what they buy this would be in my oppinion ,13
19987, in the age of  young children dont have the ability to decide on their own what they need in their life so the kids dont see what is really behind the advertising they dont see that most of the products costs a lot of money and they dont know that you have to work really hard to get  lot of money so ,2

19990, of the statement there are many brands which are making products only for children ,2
19991, if its forbidden to do television advertising most brands dont get enough money because there are less consumer a ,15
19992, is that every brand should have the same rights it shouldnt matter if the brand are selling products for young children or adults my opinion is that you have to find a good balance ,13
19993, that the children take the stuff for granted and they should learn that the playtools costs a lot of money but that the whole television advertising isnt allowed anymore is ,2
19994, an overreaction those brands have to life of something and it wouldnt be fair if they have other rights than other companys ,23
19995, that the parents can look that the child dont watch tv so they dont have to be afraid anymore of unrealistic needs all parents should rule it on their own they are responsible for their own kids,12
19996,young children are supposed to do something because they want to learn new things and if you dont have the time to play with your children its very helpful to let them wathing television they learn new things like counting or learning colours and it is a really good change to see a film an ,17

20001," my parents said me if you watch a too long time television your eyes become four ecked

im not for or against it because on my opinion it is not good to see too much television because you need some fresh air and talking and playing with friends otherwhise you loose touch with your friends but it is ",17
20002, helpful to watch a bit television because they learn new things and they are occupated they are not annoyed the television programm is most always interesting but ,17

20004, is a very controversial topic advertising  children brings the controversy to a whole new level while some people state that ,13
20005," the parents can decide if little sarah gets her seventh barbie doll it is very often the case that little children are begging their parents for useless stuff and the parents are going to give in because they cant bear their children screaming at them and being unhappy nevertheless the topic is a hot one and there is no 100 right and wrong

companys produce products some companys produce products for children toys ",20
20006, people who are proadvertising that without advertising those products wont sell themselves on their own most television channels contain ads they need the money that is coming from the ad revenues many children watch television so why not advertise a product for children on a medium that is consumed by children it all makes sense if parents dont want their children being seduced by television advertising than they should not let them watch television why regulate it as i previously mentioned ,14
20007," the parents decide what to buy and what not

on the other ",9
20008, the people who are antiadvertising state that ads s young children should be abolished because they make use of the ,13
20009, that young children lack the intellect to understand that the happy voice coming out of the telly is not like a friend who only wants their best in this case to show them what are the coolest toys for them childrem dont understand that the advertisments and the company behind it simply want the money out of the pocket of their parents it is ,2
20010, very unfair because many parents sometimes want their children to be happy and  much more often  to be quiet and not screaming it often happens that parents buy their children useless stuff with the sole purpose that the begging for more toys would hopefully stop but the demand for toys doesnt stop it is created by the advertisements therefore some people say that tv ads s young children should be abolished parents have much more important things to do than stopping their kids from begging for useless stuff ,14

when children see a new product ",16
20017," watching television they want to have it often its something to eat a new kind of sweets or a special toy to play with in such a situation the parents have to argue with her child weather they are going to buy the product or not
the child can have two sorts of reactions it can start crying and shouting and getting on the parentss nervs just because of the product that was directetd to him in this case the parents feel bad to say no to their child and make it angry and sad
but the child could ",2
20018," accept the decission and react normal thats not happening very often because children cant really understand whats right for them and that their parents make decissions for the childs best
an other point is that a company who makes toys for children doesnt have much other chances to get their products selled if they dont make it attractive for children there isnt a big chance that the parents are going to by it on their own

",20
20019, the advertising towar children is a difficult theme in my opinion its a mean trick if you try to sell a product in directing it toward young children because they cant decide what they really need ,16
20020, children just want to have everything ,9
20021, it looks good on television and other kids like to eat it or have fun to play with it a good advertisement would be something that attracs the parents too because they should be alright with the thing their child eats and plays with if the parents like the product they are ,0

a reason tho allow televison advertising  is that they will be confornted with it sooner or later no matter what its important to learn to know what you need and what simply is just luxuary to have it should make you think about how bad you want it and whats truly worth spending money on


my opinon on this 
were living in the 21 centuary technology is everywhere and ",14

20034, of the advertisment useless the problem it might cause is for the parents the child might want to own the toy and will constantly beg the parents to buy the toy young children might be more susceptible to advertisments than adults because they will not ask themselves the question if they need the product or not which could later on ,16

the advertisments might be  children of such a young age but indirectly be for the parents at christmas it might be a good thing because if the childless uncle doesnt know what to get his nefeu he can simplly watch tv and be inspired

 in my opinion it is useless to show advertisments for young children because they cannot buy the product which makes the advertisment a waste of time and money if the advertisment were to encourage children to go outside and play it might change my opinion",0
20036,in my opinion the television advertising is a probelm for many tvwatchers and ,10
20037, bad for teenagers or childrens young children are very influental and dont understand the target of the advertising ,16
20038, young children should learn important and useful things and not be used to earn money but its impossible to forbid the advertising because the tv companies need the advertising to earn money its ,14
20039, impossible for the tv company to control who is watching their programs ,10

the parents should be more interessed in what their children do in their freetime ",12
20041, there should be some tv chanels for young children without advertising because very young people are too influental the products placements are very complex and try the customer to buy a product young childrens are ,14

20043, they are adults or have their own children in my opinion we have to find a way which is okay for the tv companies the parents and the children but its clear everyone have to work,1
20044,it has become a common thing that you have to watch advertisment throughout the day if you want to consum modern media for the television ads have and will always be the best way for the channels to fund themselves in such situations i for myself prefer to watch ads wich aims at my peer therefore i do not mind watching an adverstisment for a game ,10

so why bother asking if it is good to be advertised with ads which live up to my expectations of entertainment because it is ",11
20051," what adverstising makes with me even without me noticing it for people of young age it is important what other people think of them wo they are easily convinced to follow a new trend stereotypes are formed by the advertisment industrie so if i as a youth get to hear and see the same stuff more and more with more precision convincing me to buy or do something i am a easy victim so if the companys dont want to sell goods but a thought or political adverstisment it is queit disturping being the aim of a well organised and proffesional campain all in all it would not be like that if the advertisment would be if waider spread

20055," they cant buy these things for themselves 
clear is that children are fascinated from the television and that they love to spend a lot of time in front of it parents know that and advertising companies are aware of this too because of this they adress their advertising exactly to the children they use a lot of colors a nice design and lots of good sounding words and exactly this is a problem with these advertising spots childern only see the positive ",14
20056, of the products and they cant think about ,3

all in all ",0
20061, its silly to ban television advertising directed to children its normal to argue with your child about things they dont have and if you cant say no to something your child wants because it has seen an advertising you really need to think about your parenting advertising is business and thats the way it is additionally if your child learns early to be critical against advertising and that sometimes you have to accept a no itll go stronger through its life and at the end you cant always keep everthing away from your child and you cant always ban things you dont like or things which annoy you ,13
20062,"television nowdays is full of advertising and it isnt something special if you have full 10 minutes of dumb shortfilms but these little shortfilms dont influence young children and if you raise your child the right way they wont just sit in front of the tv because they will use their ability to think about new activities to spend the time outside

since young children dont understand the advertisement until they are three they are harmless for them if a child is three to five years old he understands the advertisement but they do not realise  that they are influenced by the media but the other question is what should the advertisement do with the children these children cant buy anything because they are to young another ",14

an ",14
20073," is that its good for the economics they make a lot of money because parents doesnt want to rejects the wishes of their children and theyre nearly forced to bey them
what is more is that this children will grow up and from the age of ten they will watch television on their own so they will be confronted to advertisment at a later age
there is ",14
20074, they say that the children in this age dont realise that the advertisment in the television could be bad for them children are innocent and arent able to form their own opininon on this type of advertisment an other ,14
20075, is that children often sit near the television and they didnt decided this their parents put them there to have them near to them selves to look ,17
20076," them or sometimes parents just want the children to calm down and to stop crying or whatever the children are entertained and dont annoy the parents any more
my own opinion is the last one ",8
20077, that there is enough advertisment in the world that it hasnt to be ,11
20078, young children are watching the tv programation for children its not fair ,17
20079, children have to have a good childhood and enjoy what the already have they dont need to buy more toys and the sweet food is bad for their health,2
20080,the question if television advertising s young children should not be allowed is very recent more children are watching tv than ever ,13
20081, the industry tries to convience them to have their product a big part of this advertising are toys on the one ,20
20082, in a free marked this advertising should be allowed because the industry should be able to present their products on the other ,11
20083," children aged  years are not able to decide what is good for them and what not so the industry trys to convience them what is good or what they need parents often dont like this because they want to decide what they want to buy them 
an ",2
20084," to not disallow the advertising is that the channel has to make money from the advertising because it is a very important way for them to make money in their buissines and if they are a channel designed for children they have to accept this because no company would show there advertising for adults 
another problem is that advertising could get poor failys into trouble for example if the children is told that he must have a certain product and he thinks this is right the parents get in trouble because they cant afford it 
my opinion is that it should not be disallowed because we live in a free market and the tv channels will probalbly get in a financial trouble ",13
20085, that some advertising is very aggressive but if the parents really worry about this they should think about pay tv where the channel is supported with the money from the subscription and not from the avertising remeber you get nothing for free in your live ,14
20086,the children should learn to play on its own it could happen that theyre going to be addicted to the television or other electronic things some of them wouldnt be able to get rid of the addiciton children might want to have the thing that is showed in the advertisment and ,20
20087, the dont get it theyre angry on the parents the advertisment shows the kids what they could have and they only want more they should be happy with the things they have when a other kid has something of an advertisment and the other kid dont they may get bullied watching television ,2
20088," advertisments could be bad for the eyes

the advertisments could be good for the childres creativity there fantasy would be better and bring the kids to new ideas they might recognize the advertisment or the sound of them which helps the brain to remember things better 

",0
20089, that the children dont need to watch television advertisments because they wont be able to buy it when theyre going to be addicted to something in this low age they might be faster addicted to something else but ,13
20090, that the television advertising dont have to be forbidden the parents should know if they want that their child watches the advertisments or not if they say its ok than they should look that the time of watching television is limited ,13
20091,nowdays a lot of young children watch television there are many reasons why they do that ,17
20092," its often because the parents want to have free time or they want to entertain their children instead of playing with them they let them watch a series on television and between their series or whatever they are watching a lot of advertisments come up they see all of the beautiful and fun toys on the screen and most likely want to have them too is television advertising towards young children a good thing and should it even be allowed

firstly ",14
20093, that young children are very easily influenced by things when they see advertisments for toys ,0
20094, they probably want to buy them ,3
20095," its not a fair thing to show them something like that and they dont even know whats going on they just see the toy and think it looks cool and want to buy it 
also the parents get into trouble with those advertisments their children want to buy constantly new stuff because they see it on television and maybe ",2
20096," their friends got it it puts pressure on the parents to buy those things for their children

on the other ",9
20097, you have to question is it even something good to put their young child in front of a television ,17
20098, parents do something like this they have to be aware that their child will see those advertisments in my oppinion their are much worse things that children could see on the television than advertisments suchas guns or murder and i ,14
20099," think that young children aged to two five should not be put infront of a television

but ",17
20100, those advertisements are good for the stores they can sell their those even better because children get influenced quickly and the parents will most likely buy them and its normal and important for the economy that they sell their products there are ,0
20101," not allowing to do some for children

in my opinion television advertising towards young children should be allowed its a normal thing that the media does and ",13
20102, they can do advertisments for grown ups they can ,0
20103, do it for children but i would give the parents the advice to take the children out of the house and away from the tv playing with your children is much more efficient and better than the television and ,17
20104," you will not have andy problems with advertisments
",11
20105, but i can understand why you could ,18
20106, with it first of all you can influence children much easier and ,8
20107, want to have this product but ,18
20108, they dont have any money to buy it so they have to go to their parents and ask them their parents should be aware of manipulation and really think really sceptically about buying this product because they lived their hole life with advertisment and its manipulation that they should know that they only try to manipulate you a small child isnt aware of this and the bigger it is the better there are some parents who cant handle this situation and want to forbid the advertisment toward young children but ,2
20109, we have an empty slot in the advertisment and they are going to fill this empty slot with a diffrent davertisment it is very difficult to make a restriction to prevent it but the easiest way to prevent it is not letting watch television or look at the newest catalogue about for exemple lego of course you cant prevent your own child to look at a poster outside but you can take certein steps to minimalise it as a good parent who can handle money ,16
20110, youre gonna have a big problem but to do all of this you have to be able to know about this problem  and you should not buy blind certein products for your child please dont missunderstand me i dont want to say you shouldnt buy any advertised product for your child but you have to think about that and decide by yourself,4
20111,nowadays children often watch television ,17
20112, going outside this leads to some children seeing too many commercials its not rare that children ,14
20113," theyve seen such a thing go up to their parents and ask them to buy this certain thing for them but what if they wouldnt see the commercials would the parents have less pressure of buying their children certain things

on the one ",2
20114, great for the product to direct their advertisement towards children ,0
20115, they do make doubtful use of the childrens innocence and inexperience if someone tells a child that this nerf gun is great and its the thing theyve always wanted ,20
20116," the child will believe this but what if its true what if the child will have fun with the product is it wrong to get the childrens parents to buy it

some people are sure it is children should be able to choose what they want without getting influenced too much by advertisement however some say that adults are ",2
20117, influenced a lot by advertisement ,11
20118," why should it be wrong to do the same with children 

personnally ",12
20119, children should definitely not get to see as much advertisement as adults i guess it influences them too much in some ways if it was forbidden to direct television advertising towards young children ,13
20120, help the parents a lot of course parents do have to say no sometimes but it does no harm to prevent directing television advertising towards children because ,13
20121, the fun things you see on television some of the commercials do really have a bad influence ,11
20122,my little cousin is three years old he is very activ and loves to be outside he always climbs on trees or plays on the playground he doesnt really care about television and electricitiy ,24
20123," thats how little children should grow up they should go outside and play with other little kids and make their own experience with dirt and sand
there is ",24
20124, much visual media in our world that young children shouldnt care about in their life its the only time ,17
20125, they dont really realize whats important to the rest of the world because in our time everybody is starring at his phone ,3
20126, watching youtube clips on the internet threeyearsold  live on their own little planet and there they shouldnt be hipnotisized by technology in my opinion its okay to watch a film with your kids but not everyday it must be something  extraordinary and special to watch tv like my little cousin i adore to watch a movie saturday night then we take some chocolates or biscuits with us and eat them to  winnie the pho    his eyes are always shining as bright as the sun he played to the whole day ,17
20127, parents shouldnt forbit watching tv but they should controll it and take a limit they may watch together ,17
20128, they can make a family evening ,1
20129, more families would control the consumation  of tv  than it would become ,17
20130, its not a bad thing to produce films for young children but they should be beautiful and lovely ,6
20131, advertising shouldnt be for young children because they dont really understand ,16
20132, advertising for children products should be more for mothers or fathers because they have to buy things for kids ,16
20133," we cant forbid advertising toward children but we should minimize it and we shouldnt show bad advertising for adults in tv because we never know if children watch and thats why parents should controll the consumation of television time

20134, too many laws about everthing isnt good because a law is only against the symptom it doesnt matter what it is iam not a friend of laws in ,12

20136, you have to chose if you want that your children watching television or not but whith a law nothing is natural ,17
20137, it is only a preasure so the princip is simple if you and only you or your husbandwife think it isnt good for our children watching tv you can forbid and it is more senseful if you make a campaign against the children watching tv you should give options to the children like playing in nature and playing sport and it is ,17
20138, important how long the chlildren watching tv cause of watching tv isnt always bad the children can ,17
20139, leaning a lot if they looking science magazines or the breaking news also and important ,18
20140, is that if it isnt allowed ,19
20141, most of the children would ,9
20142, watching tv cause of who will control that they arent watching tv it isnt possible so i think at finish it is ,1
20143," a question of the mass like in thousand different other things in life
",18
20144,the question if children should be allowed to watch television and if ,17
20145," how much is wiedly discussed many parents are concerned that television is not good for their chldren a large concern is advertising that is directed at young children between the ages two and five this type of advertisement has become more popular over the past few years and is usually streamed on channels that show cartoons for children this type of advertising should not be allowed because it is harmful for the children and their development

first of all advertising is a way of manipulation especially children can be manipulated very quickly advertising supports our consumer society and shows these young children things they want but dont really need at a very young age already although children do not have the money to buy the products they see on television themselves they will want their parents to buy it for them and be jealoous of their friends who have it children are not able to recognize what they really need and what they already have at that age parents often report of having toys that are never played with at their house

furthermore children should not watch ",14
20146," since advertisemnet can be adicting to watch it will make the children want to watch television more than doing something else this could be harmful for their development as it is proven that watching television slows the thought process of the brain for example a studay has proven that teenagers who watched a lot of television at a young age now have a lower iq than those who didnt therefore it is important to encourage children to do something else than watching tv

watching too much television is not good for anyone especially children are in danger of harming their development by watching television excessivley ",14
20147, that it is manipulative for companies to direct there advertisemnt towards young children just because it is easier to convince them children should watch less television ,13
20148, go outside or play a board game as this can improve their mental and physical abilities television itself is adicting enough for young children ,17
20149, advertisements directed at this age group should not be allowed at all,16
20150,in my opinion watching tv should be limitted no matter if its advertising or a normal tv show ,15
20151, television has a bad influence on people mostly little kids adults or teenager can handle the pressure of the television they arent that naiv they dont believe anything but young children have to grow up have to create an own personality and ,17
20152," its possible that the tv affects those people not in a positive way 

we have to think about the way of television advertising if a business want to support a special car ",10
20153, it doesnt have to be disallowed but if this car is driving too fast because the owner want to say that its ordinary fast it shows young children a wrong view you can look at this topic on a other view television advertising doesnt have to be disallowed because maybe young children could watch them there its the responsibility of the own partents to look that their kids dont watch those things but in a chanell for young children ,13
20154," kika or superrtl it shouldnt be allowed 

first because this is a channel for young kids and there shouldnt be advertising for example if they promote a little rabbit who can speak and they want that the kids buy it ",6
20155, thats great then most of the children go to their parents and say oh i want thisand this and ,9
20156, on and a other reason ,18
20157, it shouldnt be allowed is those young children want to watch there favourite show and they dont want to see advertising they are little and if you say to your children advertising is necessary they woulndt understand why at the end i have to say ,14
20158, a young girl aged two mostly dont understands this advertising maybe her parents allow to watch this special serie because its okay to watch it and ,6
20159," she sees promotin of a serie which you should only watch if you are like ten 

when im honest those kids shouldnt watch tv at all when kids are that young they want to do ",6
20160, much more than just watching tv you can go out with them play with them outside ,1
20161, they will love it more than watching tv because no matter if youre old or young spend time witch people you love do things with them is one of the best and most important things you can do those kids have a lifetime to watch tv to do boring things on the couch but now they are growing up they want to experience new things if they are like ten okey sometimes they can watch tv but not always maybe ,1
20162, like that because my parents doesnt allowed me to watch that much tv and now i have to say i dont watch that much tv i just dont need it ,17
20163, spend my free time with friends with pets i love i just have no time to watch tv at all ,1
20164,"a young child get up in the morning out of bed down stairs in front of the television for watching his favourite programm a situation that is very often today but what influence had television and all these followed things that television brings
often you hear the children dont go out and play with other children or have a hobby for exemple foot ball the children become over wight and healthy problems but are those things the most problematic things things like advertising are forget very often and very important are there ",17
20165," positive things for advertising in those young age
an ",0
20166," children dont learn how to use advertising in young age the never learn what they have to do in older age with maybe ten years suddenly all tv programs are full of advertising now the problem are with ten age the same with two
and ",14
20167, you had no advertising in tv whats about advertising in the internet in the towns and citiies our society are full of advertising and you cant protect young children we are from our ,14

but these ",15
20169, could look on from the other ,18
20170,"
yes our society is always in influence of advertising but you shouldnt do extra advertising for xoung children ",16
20171," you have the possibility to do it different
a big problem is ",19
20172," the topics of the advertising often they are unhealthy things the television is a very good platform for advertising our society life very unhealthy why not to use television for healthy food or somethin like that
",10
20173, you cant do anything that a lot of children watch tv that is in influence of the parents and you arent in influence that they werent advertising on television because the big concerns had a lot of influence but if they were possibility to say to the concern for other advertising for healthy food or something like that ,13
20174," advertising is a goog way to chance our overwight society in the future because you have to chance something the quastion is just how
",11
20175, children shouldnt get used to our world full of advertises that young ,16
20176, it manipulates their opinion on different things in that age you start to develope your own creativity it would be bad to show them things better than they are because that way they want a product and ,24
20177, they get it they notice that its way less fun than they thought it would be ,3
20178, it would be more difficult for them to develope their creativity and dreams if they were manipulated by advertises another ,11
20179, is that your childhood is the most beautiful time in your life and it shouldnt be disturbed by annoying advertises on the tv thats not enjoyable all things considered ,14
20180, there shouldnt be advertising toward young children but to be honest ,16
20181, kids that age shouldnt spend too much time on the tv at all ,17
20182, are nothing that should be prohibited ,21
20183, every company should be allowed to make advertisements wherever they want to it may be true that children at that age are very easy to trick into thinking they want something ,16
20184, they dont have an use for it one could say that its unfair ,3
20185, to use someone for your own interest ,18
20186, children who arent as suspicious as grown men and women and ,7
20187," believe almost everything they hear especially on tv which most small children have access to 
on the other ",7
20188, who should the company address its advertisemments to if not to the group of people the product is destined for who would make an advertisement about princess dolls addressing a 50 year old man and ,11
20189," the statement talks about television advertising specifically one could argue that it is the parents duty to watch over their children and decide whether they are allowed or forbidden to watch tv by themselves in the end the parents should teach their children from early on that they cant have everything they want to the parents are at all times the ones to decide for their children
personally ",13
20190, that it is totally okay to put advertisements for children on tv parents know that they are responsible for their own children and should have to put up with the difficulties that being a parent brings with itself mostly ,13
20191, that one can never direct their responsibilities to anyone else so the ones to blame arent the advertising companies but the parents that cant raise their children properly ,13
20192," letting young people aged  watching tv wont bring huge problmes within if you let them see stuff made for their age
that means that parents have to know what their children watch and ",17
20193, series are on the tv specially produced for childrens learning from 6 am to 12am are channels like bbc full of learning series like laura the explorer and others ,6
20194, at 8pm films with violent scenes are on which can cause sleeping problems by little children so good parenting means letting your child watch tv ,17
20195, something approached is on and at specific times not all they long bacause children should ,8
20196, make use of their own fantasie and play games with their mates in my opinion watching tv for a long time will make you lazy to do activities made up on your own ,1
20197, in younger years its a huge danger because what you learned once you wont forget easily after all i cant really take a black or white opinion on this statement because watching tv can be good for children ,17
20198, you give it to them in a responsible dosis and it can be ,4
20199," bad if you let them watch all day long 
finally i think its difficult to not allow television advertising  because how do you wanna control if someone let them watchand ",14
20200, that some parents will let them watch and some dont we have ,1
20201, that children arent treated ecually what causes disappointment and fights between childrens and their parentsfurther the new technology brings up mobile phones on which children can watch youtubevideos or do online games all day long id say thats a bigger problem which should be discussed ,12
20202,nowadays we live in a modern world with a lot of thecnology and in this society there are a lot of different opinions about how usefull ,23
20203, a handy a computer or a television is is it good or is it bad what are the ,23
20204," and a very important question what about the children
we fokus now on the television advertising and if it should be or not should be allowed for children one agrument which you can use that it should be allowed is that the children maybe learn something about what they see or that they learn the language better ",14
20205," they hear the voices on the tv
another one can be that ",3
20206, the governement says its not allowed the people who made advertising have to rethink their whole strategie and this costs i ,15
20207," think that its not something you can go and watch if the parents are doing it right
but one ",12
20208, we can use as an ,18
20209, is that it is harmful for the children to watch tv they better should go outside and play with their freinds its not healthy it can malke the children fat or in the worst case dumb the children dont use their personal imagination as they do it ,17
20210," think that at the age of  the brain developes really fast and its important in that period of time that the children learn a lot from their parents or from the things which they experience and not from silly advertising which are not usefull in their future life
",24
20211, i would say that it would be better if its not allowed for children at that young age but ,12
20212, i think its impossible to make this happened because every family is responsible for their own child but i would ,9
20213, for agreeing with the statement television advertising  aged  should not be allowed is that advertising can realy affect a aduldt person and children even more children who watch tv and always see the advertisement for toys and other stuff they like will probably ask their parents to buy them these because of the bunch of advertisement there are ,13
20214, many toys they want and maybe their parents cant afford them all because they do not have enough money for it these children will ,20
20215," probably be sad becaus others maybe got these toys and they didnt

an ",20
20216, against the statement is that we live in a world where economics are part of our daily life and one usually works for more money companies that produce toys and other stuff for kids achieve this by doing television advertising to sell more of their products it is the custumers choice wether they buy the product or not it is ,13
20217, the companies right to search new customers to earn more money and by doing ,23
20218," create new working places

i ",18
20219, do not think that one should forbid television advertising  children one should find a compromise in between ,13
20220, it is nowadys but it shoulnt be completely forbidden still there are some customers that find new products in tv advertising and are happy about having seen them to buy for their children also the companies that sell these products will be pleased to get new customers who buy their stuff so with a compromise ,15
20221, parties will probably be happy and get what they want,19
20222,i guess this topic is a very popular one to talk about right now television advertising just like many other kinds of advertising are mostly very controverial they can beeinflussen kids in a lot of ways sometimes more that parents do advertisings are ,14
20223, known for dividing gender children ,8
20224, they belive everything they see and hear if they see advertisings in which little girls only play with dolls and babies they are more likely to belive that real life is like that ,2
20225, they start to internalize everything some gender scientisty belived that if kids wouldnt see such advertisings they wouldnt pick their specific toys boys would ,20
20226, pick barbies and girls would maybe pick cars at the store toys are beeinflussen kids ,20
20227, bad that they start beliving that women need to stay at home and take care of the baby ,19
20228, men have to go out work and be mechanics a lot of people dont even come up with the idea that something ,3
20229, normal in our society could in a way change the thaughts of kids others think it is even better to let kids see those kind of advertisings ,16
20230," they know how it is going to be in life later they belive in gender roles and that diffrences between male and female have to be how they are now a very good example for how advertising teaches kids how to be are the colours pink and blue before televison existed colours like pink and blue were not identified with gender children were wearing all kind of colours without thinking about it nowdays boys would never wear colours like pink already at the age of three 
my opinion is clearly that advertising ",0
20231, should not be how it is now it shouldnt show any diffrences between women and men ,19
20232, not with kids i hope that it will change in the future ,12
20233,avertisement is all around us on our way to the bus stop huge banners can be seen online ads on websites and most likely of all on tv i grew up during a boom of television advertisement and i can ,11
20234," remember a few jingles from popular advertisements the questions is whether or not advertising  children of the age of  should be banned

is it suitable to assume that children of the young age of  can even realise what an advertisement actually does 
advertisements want to sell a product the marketing department of huge industries is behind that they want to make profit their idea is to make their advertisements most attractive for young children because they are most vulnerable the indusry reaches its goal by making advertisements with bright colours and funny creatures to appeal to the children so the little innocent children go to their parents and ask them to buy it for them and who can say no to a little kid the children get exploited by the industry its influence is enormous

nowadays a lot of young children already have a smartphone and they can access the internet or play games on it therefore ",16
20235," that a lot children dont watch tv as intensively anymore than my generation did in our youth

in my opinion children should watch tv channels ",17
20236, kika which is a channel specifically for children and without any advertisements i can say that i learnt a lot by watching tv nowadays there is often even more advertising than actual broadcasting on tv so there is a lot of waiting for the actual tv program you want to watch ,6
20237, that this time shouldnt be wasted by advertisement you should ,11
20238," go out and play than stick to the tv to watch advertisements
but ",1
20239, it comes down to the parents decision whether they want their children to watch a lot of tv or ,17
20240," go outside and have a good time







do they get it that young age
influence
waste of time ad

opinion learning fun",24
20241,"television advertising toward children dangerous or good

kids see everywhere advertisement on many walls in the city there are posters in the tram train bus everywhere you can see
advertisement but the problem of television advertising is that some of them are  very young children
so the business which made the advertisement knows that they use the children for theyre own goods for the economy
but is this theyre right to make that an example is migros mania altought this isnt television advertising its a advertisement toward children
the children want to have those manias and tell theyre parents that they should go to migros and buy some stuff so ",16
20242," migros doesnt want to make 
the children happy like they pretend to do know they just want more customers and want to rise theyre profit but ",2
20243, you see it in the eyes of the economy you have to say that its very important to make that much advertisement otherwise switzerlands economy wouldnt work its ,11
20244, important that the young children can handle these situations and that they get known with advertising its really naive to say advertising should not be allowed because ,16
20245," is the question how you want to get this through who decides which television advertising should not be allowed and it would be very dangerous for the economy we would lost much money 

so know i have shown you to ",15
20246, how you can look at this statement but ,21
20247," explain my own opinion
it makes me really angry ",21
20248," i watch television and i see like advertising for red nike shoes for children aged five this is a big 
problem of capitalism the big companys like nike apple addidas  and more use everybody expecially the kids and the youth
what should a kid think ",2
20249, all of his friend have red nike shoes and the television advertising says in other words you should wear those shoes ,18
20250," youre not as cool as the others children have to be protected from the capitalism they shouldnt be used as models for red nike shoes

",18
20251,television advertising is everywhere in my opinion you dont only focus on kids ,14
20252, on adults and it influences all of us ,7
20253, we dont realise that its ,21
20254, in the tv that we get connected with these things ,10
20255," in magazines commercials and in the malls however how can you stop that

i believe that television advertising for young children may be a little bit dangerous because in some cases kids want that cool pretty toy like in the tv but ",14
20256, in the older ages its more dangerous ,4
20257, you get connected with the society and seeing your friend with better and cooler things i know a lot of parents who dont let their kids watch tv until the age of 6 ,17
20258, the children dont have to deal with these things early but is it ,12
20259," better to have to deal with it up to the age of 6 or 9

i remembered that i was that kind of child that always stood up early in the morning and watched some cartoons they had a lot of commercial and television advertising and maybe i wanted a lot of those things but its in the hands of your parents if they dont treat you in the right way and arent stubborn about not buying you all toys that you would like to get or only buying you those things if its christmas or your birthday ",20
20260, kids in the age of two until five will learn that my parents did a well done job in that case ,9
20261, that television advertising may have the effect that some parents dont want to hurt their on children and buy them those things but ,2
20262, that it shouldnt be allowed it ,21
20263," may help other people to see new stuff that the fabrics have produced and get some ideas for gifts its not that toys are bad and kids shouldnt get connected with them 

so ",20
20264, you should allow all kind of television advertising or non at all ,15
20265, not for the adults parents have the most source of power for the kids in that age they have to teach their kids if its true or not if its good or bad and ,7
20266," what does the advertisement wants to show
its obvious that if they show inappropriate content for children its no good but the statement is  ",16
20267, clearly they are going to show them appropriate content whether it is a movie trailer for children or a product advertisement for children it doesnt matter ,16
20268, its safe for the children to watch the advertisement and not giving them some weird advertisement which ,16
20269, gives the children the urge of trying it out its all good in the end the parents get to decide whether the children get to watch some television or not i mean some parents dont even care what their children watch ,17
20270, how are you supposed to forbid something which you cant even control yes you could add a password to the television but ,17
20271, thats going to end up being a pain the neck usually children under the age of 4 cannot comprehend what theyre watching they can only stare at the screen and watch the pretty pictures im not saying that children are stupid no but if an advertisement has text in it they will not be able to read it and what does advertisement want to succeed usually the products they sell arent even allowed for children under the age of 4 then again if its a movie it would make sense but you dont take a child to the cinemas under the age of 4 as i said ,16
20272," they dont understand whats going on you can show them a video of a dog running around for hours and they would not get tired of it
now that i listed all my ",3
20273, i came to a conclusion i ,21
20274, with this statement theres no ,21
20275," in forbidding something they cant control so why would you forbid this 
this idea of forbidding the advertisement toward young children is pure garbage ",13
20276,yes we shouldnt allow young children watching television advertising because there are advertiseswhich are brutal or the children couldnt understand their real meaning ,14
20277, they understand it in another sense or they just see the objects without the real meaning of this advertise so ,3
20278, if their is a advertise where there are ghosts in a dark room advertising for a parfum they couldnt think off the parfum and just see the ghosts they cant see the real sense off this advertise ,11
20279," they get scared and just remember the gosts in another case if they get shocked it can negativly influence the brain because if you have a shocking moment as a child you will remeber it your whole life
otherwhise you can let them watch the advertises this are all normal advertises because if its scary or not for children it will appear a sign which says that the following film is not for younger children ",6
20280, they couldnt send brutal scences in some adverises you can learn things or they will get creativ if they see this things ,19
20281," they are young 
in my opinion you can let them watch the advertises if its a childrens television programme it is really important that if there will appear a brutalscared or strange advertise the parents should turn off the television or explain the scene to their children in the end its the choice off every parents   ",14
20282,"some people say that television advertising  should not be allowed
that opinion on advertisments is not that strange because advertisements encourage people to buy things and if a little kid sees something really cool on the tv it might run to its mother or its fahter and tell them to buy it that is really common way to gain customers

at one ",15
20283, it is kind of mean using children for getting a product bought children dont know that advertisments want us to buy things and arent really that cool than in the advertisememts they see all these nice things the product can do and ,2
20284," thay want that product but isnt it the same with adults adults are might seeing other advertisements on tv but they they get to want products the same as little children

in ",2
20285, we have to  ask ourselves why a five year old children would watch that much tv that they see some advertisement of a product they wantit is not good for children to send ,2
20286," much time inside watching television children should go outside and play with other children make friends and have fun on a playground
moreover it is a bit suspious that advertisement for older children or adults are apparently ",14
20287, horrible that they totally distract little children and give them nightmares ,4
20288, you have to make advertisement for little children if it is really like this than older children or might even adults shouldnt watch them ,16
20289,"

in my opinion i cant see a problem in making advertisements for little children but i can ",16
20290, see a problem in parents who let their children watch tv all dayaltough i have to say that ,17
20291," it ist really okay to gain customers on this way for me it is a problem in the moral 
",23
20292,in tv you find all five minutes some annoying ads unfortunaly do those ads know which kind of groups in our soiciety should realize that they are meant also young children its normal for kids that they watch tv and charming advertising but ,14
20293, because of these ads kids can get some bad influence the children get the feeling that they have to buy that product ,16
20294, they dont have the money there are situations where some kids start to steal the money from their parents the producers of those ads know how to provocate a meanful thought where the people think they need it ads are very manipulating and do have a strong hidden message the worst thing is that there are ads ,2
20295, about video games which have violent scenes and death delicts which could cause psychological damage even ,4
20296, with the statement that televisions advertising  should not be allowed ,15
20297, that kids should watch tv and ,17
20298, those ads if they dont watch them now theyll never learn how to bend the feeling to buy these products which are shown in the advertisment the later they would watch tv and ads the less they know how to handle the necessities and ,0
20299, you get older the more rights and possibilities you get as a young kid you are not allowed to buy expensive products but as a 18aged person you can buy whatever you want ,9
20300, its legal after all the parents do ,12
20301, have the decision what to buy for or to allow their kids until theyre 18  ,9
20302, one hundred percent with the statement because it wont really work to not advertise things in the tv because the tv channels can only live with these ads especially the tv channels cant know ,15
20303, a kid is watching their programms because some kids just watch channels which are made for children and some other children watch ,6
20304," tv channels that werent done for the children so it would be pretty hard to really work out a plan in which these young children dont have to be confronted with television advertising
on the other ",14
20305, i really think that the idea which is behind the statement is not that bad because young children ,7
20306, in the phase in which they are seeing things for the ,3
20307, time they can be influented very easily and they want everything they see so the children are going to ask their parents if they can buy them this and this and this for sure they wont buy them everything but they want their child to be happy and have ,9
20308," to buy them maybe something
in some tv advertisings are ",23
20309, things that wont be that good for the growing up process of the child in the worst case they could have disorders or any kind psycholigal error ,4
20310," content in the tv ads
but we could ",10
20311, say that these young children wont understand the advertisements because they dont know what these things in there are on the most tv channels the producers ,14
20312, pick not the worst advertisements for as an example ,11
20313, a tv show which is made for young children or ,6
20314, on tv channels for young children like toggolino or kika or super rtl they dont use any kind of advertisement because they are conscious about the ,14
20315," which these brutal ads will do to the kids
as a last ",16
20316, their children what they are watching on tv and which tv channels they are on in the world there are a lot of risks which could have ,17
20317," to older people so a bit of a risk is always in this world and you have to protect you and the people around you or which are important to you










",21
20318,"the statement should be more specific about what they want to show in the advertisement somehow it can be that parents think that the content is not really appropriatewhich makes this statement true for example the parents dont want that their child gets in touch with something electronic but the kid sees the advertisement and wants it 
an other ",16
20319," is that children between  want everything they see so if they see a television advertising no matter what they want it immediately and without excusefor example it can be hard for the parents if theyre in a financial crisis and cant really satisfy the cravings of their child 
or ",14
20320, the parents want their child to understand that heshe cant have everything the advertisement could get a problem for the parents its ,0
20321," hard to say no which makes this whole situation even more complicated
but ",19
20322, christmas arrives or the child has its birthday it can be a ,9
20323, because with the advertisement the parents know exactly what theyre child wants to have as a present with that its much easier for the parents to decide what they ,0
20324," want to buy with that the child chooses its own present and at the end no one complains
at the end everyone has its own opinion and one could discuss about that but i think it would be better that theres no television advertising  because it is better for the children to not know everything about whats available in the stores ",20
20325,children at the age of  years should not already be watching television in that time period children learn to talk to walk or start to play with children in their age so the parents have to be responsible and should not let the child watch television it could have an huge impact in the childs evolution for example a child who watches television every day or a child who goes and socializes which child will have the better social connection ,17
20326," they are older

another reason why children should not watch advertises on television is that at their age they can not understand what ads are for ads are for parents who buy the stuff for the children but it is just a waste of time if a kid watches advertises last week i went to visit my uncle and ",14
20327, his child was watching television as why arrived there was an ad going on about a new mercedes car i asked myself why did my uncle not change the channel because now the kid is talking about this new car but my uncle did buy a new car not ,9
20328, long ago also advertises give you that feeling that you have to be the same as this celebrity on television ,10
20329," children should not be thinking like that already in their young years

a contradicting reason could be that children who watch advertises on television may notice earlier that it is just a huge money buisness so as they get older they can handle it better than children who did not watch ads noticing that ads just want you to buy everything is a good notice it can give you another way of thinking 

at my ",2
20330, of view it is better ,21
20331," young children aged  do not watch television advertising because nobody should watch it it is just a huge buisness of making money on stupid people who believe thing on television 

",14
20332, about advertising s young aged children one good ,16
20333," is that children get to know whats out there on the market to buy for them 
but ",2
20334, for expamle theres no reason to show advertising to young aged children because they dont have any money themselves to buy it and ,16
20335, the parents of the kids will end up buying something with their money for their kids because advertising made the kids thinking they need that specific thing ,0
20336," they dont even need it 
",19
20337, that it shouldnt be allowed to show advertising s young children on tv ,13
20338, it is not neccessary to show such advertising to the yound kids because we already live in a materialistic world and theres no need for trying to get young kids to wanting something they dont even need the kids these days will be manipulated by advertising soon enough,0
20339,"when you watch a film in the evening on television their are always breaks for adverts some adverts are interestening some adverts are funny and some adverts are just sexist and weird mostly the adverts are nonsense and they arent usefull but how do they seem  young children dont konw as much as a teenager or even an adultyoung children are naiv and and cant order the adverts 
television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

adverts aret usefull for young children because they cant even buy things by themself young children normally dont have enough money to buy things ",14
20340, can influence young children which toys they want ,20
20341, that totally fine because the parents of the young child can ,12
20342," decide which toy they will buy their children
another negative ",20
20343, is that television at all is bad for children its not good for the eyes if the young children watch always television they waste ,17
20344, much time watching television it would be ,1
20345, much healthier to play outside ,4
20346, that television advertising toward young children  should not be allowed but ,13
20347," that children should watch less television at all and play more
outside
",13
20348, for and against this topic and ,21
20349," of them are understandable and reasonable 
children between the age of two and five do not remember a lot there is no tomorrow for them and they do not have any time feelings they do forget a lot and if they see something that could be bad for them they will not remember it in a ",24
20350, a three year old will not remember an advert with war content a couple of months later television advertising is mostly about cars or shampoos and a young child will not be able to use this information or be influensed massivly like a grownup most children will watch childrens programms and in most cases there is no advertisment shown and if mostly for the programm itself or the ,14
20351," children do learn fast especialy in this age category they hear and see things and they repeat them this is how a child learns it is totally natural so if a child by any chance joins in its parents watching some programme on television and there is an advert for a game that involves guns the child may see this as a normal thing or if there is an advert with bad or rude words the child may repeat them there could be adverts with content that is for adults and a child should not see that 
so there are two ",24
20352," to this depending on the adverts shown and how mature the child is 
my personal opinion is that children should not watch to much television anyway it is bad for them to sit in front of screens for hours and if they watch something it should be child friendly and not agressiv or with adverts but because of the ",14
20353, that a lot of children television programms do not show adverts a child can watch television alone ,13
20354, if that is not the case there should be a adult watching the child in the end it is the dicision of the parent if they would like there child to grow up with adverts,16
20355,"television advertising should not be allowed toward young children

lets begin with the pro ",13
20356, in my opion is that these young children react very strong on advertisements ,16
20357, on tv young children watch tv very often when they see something on tv which is interesting for them they tell their parents that they want to have something this happens very often and can be stressful to the parents the ,17
20358, is that children should watch somothing which improves their knowledge about the world eg a broadcast about animals or something in this direction but children watch mostly channels for children at their age like super rtl nickeloden or kika and ,17
20359, made for these children this is why they want to have something all the time children see these things in ,20
20360," of view as the adults do

contra",7
20361, it is quite normal that children watch tv as a result it is ,17
20362, quite normal that there are a lot of advertisements on these channels you can find advertisements almost everywhere on tv the people grow up with this ,10
20363, every advertisement has its own target group there are adults children workers teenagers and ,11
20364, on advertisements arent as annoying for children as for adults this is why children dont care about advertisements they often like advertisements to discover new toys and there are ,16
20365," advertisements which support the education of the children

my personal opinion ",11
20366, that advertisements should be banned from childrens channels better would be if advertisements are banned from all channels   this would be great  the best ,13
20367, for the new rule is that they react differently on advertisements advertisements have a very big influence on the life of a childd,13
20368,in my essy i write about the topic television advertising  should not be allowed television is a kind of entertainment it has ,15
20369, so it could make people uncreative because if they lie the whole day on the sofa and watch tv shows they dont have a hobby and they dont do anything they get lazy at the worst case they could lose their social connections on the other ,17
20370, can television teach us because there are many documentary movies which show important stuff ,6
20371, about our nature but there are ,21
20372, some tv series which makes watchers addicted to them and many movies show things which arent realistic ,6
20373, the watcher could get a wrong picture of the reality ,19
20374, with the statement that young children shouldnt be allowed to watch tv because they cant understand the documentary movies so if they watch television they would watch some series which arent teachfull instead of watching movies they should play with each other to make some social connections because thats important if a child never watch a movie or a serie it doesnt know it and ,6
20375, it doesnt need it its a fault of the partents the problem is that most of the parents arent too busy to play or care about their children ,12
20376," they put them on the sofa and they are entertained the result is that the parents havent nothing to do 

to finish my essay ",1
20377, that young children shouldnt watch television because there are ,17
20378, many things to entertain themselves ,3
20379,a current controversial issue are the all day seen advertisments they are everywhere in the supermarkets on the street in magazines and papers and ,11
20380," in the tv we cant do something without beeing influenced by an advertisment everything is about sponsoring people and gaining new customers
but advertisment directed to children should it be allowed or should they at least be left out of this money making strategy

with advertisment children get to know new products with the help of adds they can develop new ideas what to do with their friends or suggest to do ",14
20381," in the kindergarden
next it would trigger their fantasies and wishes as an example what they want for teir ",8
20382, makes it easier for parents to buy their children the right thing they really want and not just something the children ,20
20383," never play with and throw it away
moreover the children should know what different kind of new things there are they can get and mabey they ",20
20384," they have to read something or listen to the adviser
and last but not least it is better for the companies ",23
20385, adds are seen by young kids they ,24
20386, buy these items they like and ,9
20387," the companies can focus on them and developp their ideas based on the products which are more bought and therfore preferred by the kids

on the other ",2
20388," children can be damaged and manipulated by that many adds specially developped for them it can be too much for them and they can be misleaded or the add can be misunderstood
kids just want to life they dont want to see advertisment ",16
20389, they watch tv or read a cartoon they are too young for this for ost of the children it would just be a distracting thing in their life and they wouldnt pay attention to it so ,24
20390," the advertisment would be wasted
children get manipulated by it even ",16
20391," they really understand what is happening
and ",19
20392," they arent even able to afford all these thing which are presented to them by the adds it would be the parents which have to pay and this would put a lot of preassure n these parents which cant afford to spent too much money

so ",9
20393," advertisment towards kids because kids should life and not be manipulazted by advertisments or 
",16
20394, television isnt as popular as it has been a few years ago it is ,10
20395, a big part of our society especially younger people are extremely fascinated by their cartoon heroes and favourite shows but as we all know theres ,6
20396, advertisment in television and children do believe almost everything they see there they get amazed by the colourful toys and attractions that are shown in tv so they run up to their parents trying to convince them about buying the newest item they saw often parents dont want to buy anything their child wants and ,2
20397, they have to say no which easily causes madness ,19
20398," it comes to kids 

of course theres ",7
20399, because thats what advertisment is all about economics there are thousands of enterprises which are simply based on selling toys to kids and ,0
20400, their system wouldnt work anymore without advertising their products in national television if now television advertising for kids wouldnt be allowed anymore all these enterprises would crash so completely disallow television advertising for kids isnt really realistic but i guess children cant handle all the influences television has on them on their own parents must supervise their childrens behaviour ,14
20401, it comes to television also advertisment toward young children should be controlled more it doesnt take much to convince children ,13
20402," we have to protect them from all influences children shouldnt be abused to make money everything sold to children should help them to learn and discover stuff and there are lots of products on the market that dont do that 

to summ everything up id say forbidding television advertising isnt realistic but the future of our world should be protected better ",13
20403, it comes to influences from the outside,21
20404,nowadays television is a very important and controverse topic kidds and teenagers spend a lot of time watching tv in their freetime because the do not have any other occupations like sports or other free time activities its getting worse and worse and the age of the tv watchers decreaes from year to year   evne young kids aged  are watching more often tv shows ,17
20405, their parents used to watch because 30 years ago there was not any tv show for young kids not anymore kids are lost in the endless supply of media like computer radio or even like in our case the tv  it is horrible for the young parents and inevitable to stop ,17
20406, by watching televison kids are automatically exposed to all the numerous advertisements between their favorite shows like tele tubby and co it seems impossible for parents to take care of the kids and not let them enjoy the advertised plays or cool lego cars etcand ,17
20407, the tv companies exactly know which sort of people watch tv at a certain time of the day this is how televison advertising works   it is the try of showing and make specific aged people find joy and pleasure in a certain product which is shown from its best ,10
20408, for example pornographic stuff is shown in the night ,6
20409, kids usuallly sleep and stuff for kids like lego cars is advertised in the mornning ,1
20410, mothers are busy with cooking and occupates its kids with the tv  it is as easy as this since we know what televison advertising actually means ,10
20411, for kids who are exposed to these certain advertisements as you can perfectly remember ,0
20412, you were a young child whenever you saw something cool you liked ,18
20413, you would not stop bugging your mom and dad until you got what you desperitel wanted ,18
20414, bad that is exactly the strategy used by the companies which advertise stuff for kids  it is ,2
20415, easy to get children excited about a cool toy kids see what they canput on their bucket list whic is good but simultaneously kids are exposed to to much stuff children tend to get spoiled and do not appreciate anymore what they own it may sound crazy but kids are getting slefish and mean in my opinion tlevison advertising for young children shoould become prohibited based of all the ,0
20416, that i listed within this essay ,21
20417,"advertising
since the 20th century companies use television as an important tool to reach millions of people by annoying them with a great deal of advertisement
nowadays advertisement is ",10
20418," present in tvseries for children what effect does this have on our children should this be forbidden

advertising children leeds to big discussions in families it is that simple to influence children by televison ",14
20419, they nearly believe everything the advertisement says they immediately run to there parents ,3
20420," the film and wanted them to buy the latest things they had seen
furthermore most of childrens whises have been created by an extern influence ",2
20421," children who are less influenced by televison or other sources for advertisement have much less whishes
children in the age between two and five years are psychologiclally not that far developped to decide between what they need and what is only a spontanious whish

on one ",14
20422, we have the manipulation effect from advertisement on children but ,0
20423," we all know that children once become adults as an adult you have the same problems but they are even much biger and diverse so why should the children be protected of this problems if they are faced up to reality at there prime of life they learn much earlier how to deal with there problems

nevertheless advertising children is an important ecological way to increase welfare of the producer consumers often buy things leaded by advertisement they really do not need so in my oppinion advertising children makes only sense for the economy that is why ",16
20424, we shold limit advertisement in childrens tv programmes ,13
20425,advertising like this is a very new and modern problem young adults are confronted with over all it should be their own decision if they want to raise the children with such influences like the tv or not but here are some ,14
20426," for and against the advertising 

first of all its a good idea for the parents to see advertisments like this not for them but for their child ",16
20427," its not meant for them by watching these kind of commercials with or without their child theyll get an idea of what their child and other children at their specific age want to play with also its a good source of finding out whats new on the young children toy market without having to leave the house and wander around toy stores

but its ",0
20428, not that good of an idea for the child because already getting influenced by the media at such a young age and watching too much tv or even getting addicted to watching tv at a young age has never been a good habit problems like constant crying because of parents not buying their child the toys or things they want or ,17
20429, they saw on tv  might ,19
20430, occur a big question would ,21
20431," be if they actually understeand the things they see on the commercials because if they dont its just a big waste of money s someone that doesnt even understeand any of it

so overall i think it should be allowed because its the right of the channels to choosewhich kind of commercials the want to use and because its ",15
20432," the parents which are responsible for their child and checking on them like the things they like what they watch on tv or what the do on the internet should be a very important part of parenthood so if they dont like what kind of advertising there is on tv they can just turn it off and let the child do different things other than watching tv all day
",14
20433,"television advertising  between two and five should not be allowed
",15
20434," with the statement above for the following reasons
at ",21
20435, advertising on television will cause that children want the things they see a good example for this is ,0
20436, they make promotion of a game the young will show it to their parents this leads to ,0
20437," buying the game for their daugther or for their son
furthermore children will learn at such young age that the world is full of promotion this is how they get to know todays world maybe this will help them to think intelligent in school and in their lives
in the other ",24
20438, the  aged need to watch programmes specific for their age ,6
20439," dora explora this is a television show where the young are able to learn new things it is way better for them
moreover it could be possible that television advertising will cause a lot of more questions than answers because they are very young aged
in my opinion the  aged dont need to watch a lot of tv at all of course they can learn something but there are better ways ",6
20440, they dont have enough money for everything their child sees in the promotion that is why ,2
20441," with the statement above
in conclusion it is a ",21
20442, that advertising on tv is not very relaxing for young aged and for the adult because it takes a lot of their free time,11
20443,this statement depends on which sort of advertising it is meant but there is a very high chance that young children are more influenced than the older ones but if it is meant for advertisings that influence people to buy something it isnt this bad as the statement is telling because the younger children are ,16
20444, more influenced but they have less power power is meant that they arent able to buy anything alone they their parents ermission and often ,7
20445, their money because they dont owe on their own money so the parents ,9
20446, are a big factor of the choice to buy something or not for the young children but if the statement is meant for advertising that are not for buying but doing soething or going somewhere it is a completely other view because young children are very influenced by this they think that very much things are fun on the ,0
20447, but afterwards they arent happy so if the parents try to be nice and offer something to the children they do what the chidren like and ,9
20448, the advertising influences them the young children are ,2
20449, way easier to impress with something and the advertisings are made to impress people to buy something or do something and the young children are very influenced ,0
20450, so my opinion on this statement is that there isnt really a good decision because everybody is influenced by advertisings the young children are ,13
20451, influenced the most but they have got their parents to tell them that that isnt right and can ,7
20452, decide also we are unable to control if a young children is watching television or if it is anyone else so at the end the only ,17
20453, would be to have no advertisisngs at all because if not ,11
20454, it could stil happen that young children see advertisings but it isnt this bad as in the statement because they ,16
20455, have parents which normally are controlling them in this young age,24
20456," to that beacause if television advertising are forbidden for children it wouldnt be good for some businesses 
businsesses need the television advertising to improve the children to buy the toys its ",14
20457," for the parents from the children because sometimes they have ideas for the children wich toy they shouldcould buy for christmas
when the television advertising would be forbidden many children wouldnt have toys anymore
one only positive thing about forbid television advertising would be that children would go out ofter and ",14
20458, they would invent more games that they could play but thats the only positive thing about that the rest wouldnt be very good inspecial for the business who produce toys if you imagen ,20
20459, the business had no television advertising ,10
20460, they cant sell the toys anymore and that would mean that they would have no money the children ,20
20461, had no fun anymore in their lifes because they cant play with their toys because they dont have any toys if you have no business who produces the toys you cant buy them not every child likes to play outside with other childrens so they have their toys that they play with and ,20
20462, there is no toy means that they cant play with anyone so ,20
20463," that theyre lonely 
television advertising isnt that bad for the children its only bad for the parents money because they have to buy the toys but the parents loves to see their children laughing and having fun with their new toys and ",0
20464, children have their toys they dont annoy the parents if theyre bored ,20
20465,"there were many concerns raised in the last coupple of years  about weither television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not 

the supporters of such a law that would forbid this type of advertisement  argue that the advertisements seen on television could have a huge negative  impact on children  who are easy targets for companies especially the clips advertising candy or fast food  could influence the eating habits of toddlers and lead to overweight or obeysity the advertisors defend themselves from these accusations stating that they are not ones to blame and that it is the parents responsibility to educate their children and make sure that they are eating healthy
a ",13
20466, attack on tv advertisement is  that the pictures presented by them are stereo typing gender or ethnics and ,11
20467, disturbing the development of children the product placer anwser to this statement again by pushing all responsibility on the parents and ,2
20468," away from them

my personal opinion is that we cant and shouldnt prohibit the advertisement because of two reasons first of all  a law like this would violate the freedom of speech and media in an irreparable way if we start prohibiting children advertisements  there will be soon demands to ban all sorts of advertisement on tv 
second  children will become desensibelized to advertisement in media which will ",13
20469, lead to problems in the future  ,21
20470," they are suddenly exposed to it
the only and true ",3
20471, to this problem is  that advertisors should take more responsibility and maybe change the way or content they are showing to children  so ,16
20472, there should be more advertisement for healthy food and girls product placements should ,11
20473, contain pink toys and dolls  which are stereotizing the role of women  i hope for new advertisement which try to challenge the stereo typesof ,11
20474,"television advertising 

advertisements are a big part of our life however we may not even realise ",10
20475, normal to us that we may not even notice them they are everywhere around us ,19
20476, the day we are born it ,18
20477, has changed a lot in the recent years but do we even think about their influences ,19
20478, for young children in this essay ,8
20479," write about whether television advertising  aged  should be allowed or not

young children consume advertisements everyday it doesnt make a lot of sense to me to produce television ads  ",13
20480, they arent capable of even understanding them children dont have the capacity to analyse the goal of those ads ,16
20481, they consume them what two year old child would watch tv and ,1
20482," begin to think about the influences of advertising 

second ",11
20483, add that television advertising has changed a lot in the recent years lots of them provide us a false picture of our society which has a negative impact on us young children may feel forced to follow a certain goal of the ad ,14
20484, fit in our society this biulds a lot of pressure on young consumers ,23
20485," they dont fully realise for example if a young child sees an ad about a videogame or whatever he thinks he needs this to be cool 

however sexualised contents are ",16
20486, a big problem lots of young children are already acting like adults in television advertising which is really unhelathy for their development they need to be children not dress like adults or put make up on in the us ,14
20487," young children already play roles of adult women in ads or movies  

my last ",24
20488, that supports the prohibition of television advertising toward young children is the picture of violence they use lots of ads for ,13
20489," videogames are really violent this may contribute to the growing violence or aggressive behaviour of children

to summarise ",7
20490, televison advertising for young children should not be allowed a childs brain isnt capable of differing between negative and positive ,14
20491, of them my opinion is ,21
20492, that they are kind of unnecessary what is the goal of them to make a five year old child buy those new cornflakes in the end it is ,2
20493," the job of the parents to control what ads their children consume 

",13
20494, television advertising  children under 5 years should not be allowed,13
20495," there are many reasons but why
firstly ",21
20496, its not such a good idea to let young children watching tv ,17
20497, because in this age there is ,19
20498, much to do they should go out and learn how to interact with the natur and to discover it also young children should not be under influence of the meaning of others ,7
20499, of the meaning of a boss of nestlã© the young children are to young to decide whats is true and possibe and what is impossible in an advertising for example an advertising of redbull says that you can fly if youve drunk a redbull if a young children dont know that this is impossble the child might try it out and fails also most of the advertsing things are not healthy but a young children dont know this and ask the mum often to buy this productbut i ,2
20500, is not that children now just should watch advertising for parents,16
20501, and it should be forbitten to ad an advertsing between ,11
20502,television for young children is always a big discussion it had been one ,17
20503," the television was invented and it will be one in the future there are many pros and cons 
on the pro ",10
20504, that children can learn languages with th tv ,6
20505, greman many children in switzerland learn greman not swiss german but high german they have a bigger vocablurary and a better pronounciation another ,18
20506, is that the parents have some free time ,24
20507, their children are watching tv if the mother have to do the housework or the father have to work its easier to do ,1
20508," they dont run around and scream

but for each pro there is a contra ",19
20509, in the tv programm there are many series which are totally bad the figures do things the parents dont want their children to do or the children learn things which arent correct and sometimes totally false and ,6
20510, if they want to learn a language its not better learning from the tv ,6
20511, from the parents of friends or in school another ,18
20512, is the time some children spend ,8
20513, the tv a lot of houres a day and this is ,10
20514," because if the children dont do any sports or go outside they become fat and unhealthy and they will have no friends to play with

",12
20515, television advertising is not such a good thing,15
20516, there are more cons than pros althrough there are ,21
20517, chances for examples the children know how the world looks like and some programms have good series for learning something if i had children i dont know exactly what i would do but ,8
20518, each one have to make his or her own decision if its wrong or right good or bad but well have the discussion several times the future because its an important topic in our conected world,12
20519,television advertising toward young children has ,14
20520, is that they learn how to deal with advertising in a young age they get used to it ,0
20521, it wont be a surprise ,19
20522," is that they get ideas for birthday or christmas present wishes they dont have to walk through a shopping center with their parents and the parents dont have to spend a whole day on it to find a present they see it on television and can tell it to their parents
but there are ",24
20523, young they dont have the money to buy the stuff they would like to have because of the television advertising that could be the reason why they are sad and maybe even mad and angry at their parents they start crying because they dont get they toy which they have seen on tv thats not good for the parents too they dont want to say always no tho their children ,24
20524, they get forced to buy at least a few of the stuff the kids would like to have ,9
20525," they think its not really good for them 
moreover theres the risk of wrong advertising that could have a bad influence for the children if the advertising spot isnt made for young children it could be dangerous 
in my opinion television advertising  shouldnt be allowed no matter what kind of product the advertising spot wants to sell",14
20526, question which came in my mind was if children at this age are even able to understand the meaning of an advertisment so ,16
20527, there is no need to not allow television advertising for young children because can they really understand that the advertising was  them i mean do they understand that lets say it should stimulate them to buy something i dont think ,13
20528," because they dont even own money and there not really supposed to watch television at this age anyway and i dontt see in what way it could be bad for them i mean yes they can maybe influenced by television but not really in a bad way so why would you not allow them

it could be a good thing if they would forbid advertising which is for young children because today we have ",14
20529, much electronic devices and young children get involved more and more ,24
20530, it would somehow aso protect the parents because the children will run to them ,12
20531, they see an advertisment with something in it they want to have on the other ,11
20532," have to learn how to resist and that they can not have everything they see on tv so it could be a protection because everybody know how easy it is to influence such a young child and the parents could probably avoid lots of conversations with their kids becaus they want to have something they saw on television

all together ",17
20533, it would be an overreaction if they would not allow the advertising for kids ,16
20534, to it and there are ,19
20535, parents who have to tell their kids what is good and what isnt and they have to teach them how they can and how they should react to advertising so why should they not allow advertising just because the children are too young or that they dont really have their own opinion and reliability for me it is ,13
20536, a no i mean we all grew up with children advertising on television and we are completely fine ,14
20537, television  they are a part of our society it influencs us often more than we know everywhere are advertisments and sometimes we cant even see them but in the television it isnt the same especially young people where impressed by these skinny models and these white teeths or the strong boy with the sunburned skin in the advertisments mothers can see how to wash the clothes that they stay white and fathers can see the new car which one should always be the best but what happens with the young children ,14
20538, they see these advertisments are they ,11
20539," impressed and influenced or do they just ignore these

in my opinion it shouldnt be forbidden ",12
20540," young children maybe see the advertisments but are less impressed they dont think a lot about the products they dont realise that the clown with the red hair wants that they buy a new football they just think about the funny clown with these big nose and the big smile

an other ",2
20541, is that these young children shouldnt watch a lot of television so if they play more in the garden or with other children  they will got ,17
20542," less impressed 


to forbidden the television advertising toward young children doesnt make sense ",13
20543, because the advertising is everywhere not just in the television it is on the mobilephone ,10
20544, the mother is cooking it is on the streets and in the shops in my opinion you just have to show the children how they can get with it that these teeths arent that white and that these cars cant drive toward the ocean ,6
20545, that should be the goal of our society,21
20546,advertising is a big theme today we have it wherever you look and hear it is a good way to spread the ideas and products all over the world and there it is a problem because there are ,11
20547," many electronical devices its naturally the best way to do it
today everybody is watching tv surfing in the internet and playing games on computer or something like that
there are many studies today about children and the consume of electronic device time its not good for young children to have electronic device time
my own oppinion to this statement i think it is not good for children to have any time at tv or electronic devises until five or six years 20 years ago no child had the possibility to watch tv and the advirtising in there ",17
20548," i think it should not be disallowed it is the decision of the parents if they will allow their children to watch tv and the advertising between
the companys which are producing this adverts are a little bit stupid is my oopinion because they know it is not good for children to watch tv in this age
to producing this adverts should be forbidden but only on the television ",14
20549," you advertise in another way it is allowed because you will not surprised during a film or something
the adverts for ",11
20550," young childrens are not that good because the parents have to buy these things the child will cry untill it will get it
",20
20551," against television advertising s young children but for the company it is a really good way to earn much money when children see something they think its a good cool thing it is very difficult to not give them that because they will talk only about it all the time
",14
20552, this statement but i understand ,21
20553, the companys they have a easy way to earn much money,23
20554,a few years back the world was different and technology wasnt such a big part of our lives as it is now we used to talk to each other face to face go for a walk and meet new people out there but as technology improves every day its not rare to see how these habits changed we text watch videos and like everone elsess photos nowadays young children ,18
20555, have easily access to technology they love to watch television and at this ,1
20556, it is important that you know the ,21
20557," of this way of interaction

parents that are very busy and cant afford to pay someone who can take care of their children often decide to allow their kids to watch television this is good for parents because they have time for themselves and can relax a little bit and the children are more than happy if they can watch their favourite cartoons television advertising help the kids to learn new things and improve their speaking skills because theyre listening to new words 

everything sounds good until now but lets not forget that it is not healthy for young children to stay the whole day at home and watch cartoons ",17
20558," being active and playing outside in the nature with other children like it used to be  television advertising towards them might confuse them because they are too young to understand everything and it happens very often that television shows content that is inapppropiated and not made for children

not only adults are getting more and more confindet with technology ",24
20559, young children it is common to see little kids watching television playing with mobile phones and computers but ,17
20560, television advertising  shouldnt be allowed children at that age should enjoy their childhood interacting with other kids playing outside drawing and showing her feelings and thoughts they shouldnt sit in front of a television consuming stuff and doing nothing,13
20561,television advertising isnt only s teenagers young adults and adults ,10
20562, the question whether this should be allowed or not makes room for heated discussions and ,21
20563, pro and contra make good ,18
20564," try to shed some light on this controversely discussed question and to explain my opinion on this subject
children aged  are in an extremely important stage of their childhood in this phase they learn basic social skills talking and walking the brain functions in a very efficient way and sucks in everything its exposed to including television this means that television ads can have a profound effect on the development of a child one ",14
20565, against such advertising is the ,11
20566, appeal to the children some ads use what we adults perceive as childlanguage the problem with the use of such infantized language is that it doesnt follow basic rules of grammar and that words are deliberately mispronounced this could lead to major problems with talking and oral comprehension ,16
20567, that the target audience is ,21
20568," developing language skills another problem that arises with ads for young children is that children are easily manipulated their young age makes it difficult for them to use reason and logical deduction for discerning useless or wrong information from useful one
however ",16
20569, the effects of tv ads are balanced by good education and parenting if ,14
20570," exposure to ads wont lead to problems in my opinion the true culprit of failed education isnt the tv but the parents and education department 
ads for young children can be useful ",14
20571," sometimes interesting and fun toys are advertised and how would parents and children even know about those toys if it werent for the ads 
in the end i have to say that banning ads for children aged  doesnt make sense while im not a fan of ads ",16
20572, i realize that banning them is ,19
20573, it wouldnt help in raising children at all,4
20574, with this statement because the young children arent the ones who will buy it the desicion isnt in the ,2
20575, of the children its in the ,8
20576," of the parents the advertisment woudnt realy make sense becaus why would you advertis a product to a customer who isnt able to buy it also a big problem if we dont let advertisments be allowed is that this children televison channels woundt get money becaus the most channels life from the money throug advertisment 
on the other ",16
20577, the advertisment could affect the childrens in the way how they will spent money ,16
20578, theyre older also it could affect that the childrens will start to argue with they parents if they could have this product this would maybe manipulate the parents wich will buy this product ,2
20579," 
my oppinien is that advertisments should be allowed becaus without it the most children channels would disapear but the parents have to teach there childrens about advertisment and how to understand theme ",14
20580,"nowadays advertisment is everywhere you can see it in magazines on television on internet sites on sport events etc enterprises spend millions of dollars to promote their products but is it right to promote their products to children at such a young age

companys which sell kids toys obviously need people who want to buy their toys and they need to promote their product somehow to make their product known ",16
20581, sell these the tv channels ,10
20582," make a lot of money out of it

on the other ",23
20583, its wrong to see kids as a fortune maker kids ,9
20584, at that age cant really make up their own mind ,24
20585, and are easily because of that they easily could sell practically anything to the kids another ,9
20586, is that the breaks between the series can be really annoying and ,19
20587," really long kids want to watch tv and dont want to be told what 

",1
20588, its a bad idea to already start advertising products towards young children for me ,16
20589,today we can see everywhere we go advertisings in the supermarkets are a lot of different products like cornflakes juices or a lot of toys for children television advertising is a good possibility to show people at home the different products they sell a lot of companies like to use television advertising direct toward young children to show them their products ,14
20590, toys for young children if the children see the toys ,20
20591," they watch television they want that their parents buy them the toys they want but this is very unethical
young children ",20
20592, children aged  are very curious and they just believe and accept the things that their parents or other people say they dont know that adults could tell lies so they just believe what the people in the television say if a person say that the ponytoy is very funny and you can ,24
20593,  style the hair of the pony the children who are watching television and see that want ,6
20594," this ponytoy so they say to their parent that they want this toy and the parents should go and buy this toy 
the ",20
20595, problem is that companies know that children will cry if they dont get the things that they really want from their parents parents mostly cant leave their childrens alone at home because the children are two years old and they couldnt find a person who can care of their children so they take their young children with them to the supermarket to buy some food for the dinner in the supermarket the child see a product ,2
20596, special cornflakes that they saw ,18
20597," they were watching television so they show the cornflakes to their parents and say that they really want to eat this cornflakes if their parents say no the child is sad and begins to cry companies use this situation to sell their products because they know that parents will buy the product their children want 
if the parents always buy the things their child want the child will never lern that they should care of their money so they will loose a lot of money in the future because they just buy what they want ",2
20598,advertising has always been a big thing in our society and there has been millions of ,11
20599, and discussions about it in the following text ,21
20600," share my feelings about the statement television advertising  should not be allowed
first of all ",15
20601, explain the reasons supporting this statement in these days children should be better protected against the news and the internet they get ,12
20602, much information about things that arent supposed to be read or heard by litte children it seems like theyre getting driven over by all that information and they cant handle that ,7
20603," advertises directed to them makes that problem even worse 
another reason is that the advertises can push people in our consumer society and ",11
20604," its importat to protect the childrem from becoming part of that at an age where they cant really build an own opinion about the world 
on the other ",12
20605, one could say its nonsense to forbid advertising if the children can access the internet ,13
20606, easily and that the advertises arent any bad for them,11
20607, of all i think the television isnt a bad thing children can learn a lot of it ,17
20608, they can learn a forainge language with help of the television but i ,6
20609, that young children sholdnt watching advertising for children there are ,16
20610, much stupid and dangerous advertisings in the television ,10
20611, my opinion children have to play most of the time outside and spend a lot of time with friends ,24
20612, they can learn how to make contact and how they can be integret in a groupe ,8
20613, in any case i think childern shouldnt wachting long time television advertising for thinks like security banken and versicherungen isnt a big problem for childern but advertising for phantasy or sience fiction films are many times very curious young children dont understand it and it makes they afraid  ,14
20614, advertisig for things you can eat ,11
20615, the advertising which is made for children is ,16
20616, a problem because the children wanna have those snikers and ,4
20617, they will get fat in the whole i think the advertising isnt the main problem there are sort of advertisings which can be a problem for children the main ,16
20618, is that children should lear how to handle with the television ,17
20619, they dont sit the whole day in front of the television and ,1
20620, children play outside with friends the television is a good thing,1
20621,"it is saturday evening your family and you are watching a movie on television as always the movie is interrupted 30 minutes the sound of television raises without you even touching the remote but the not the movie that you were watching is on it is again one of those boring advertisment that you have seen more than ten times over 
who is not annoyed by those 45 seconds of interruption that are repeated at least three times it will be difficult to find someone who would ",10
20622," being played on tv that must mean that they are highly efficient in doing what they should  capturing peoples attention and lurging them into buying something but what if that advertisment is s young children between the age of  how could a child not be lurged into wanting something that it does not have in my opinion television advertising should not be allowed at all
the things a three year old child wants is ",0
20623, what his friend has what he does not have or what the child sees on television the purpose of letting their children watch tv if simply the occupation the parents want their children to be occupied during a period of time they set them in front of the tv ,17
20624, the mother or the father can do something during that time the problem is that often the child is not being supervised if the television programm is interrupted by an advertising the parents or an other supervisor does not have controll anymore of what is shown on tv now if the child sees one of those advertisments over and over again why should he or she not want the product and exactly that is wrong with creating advertising  children for example picture this scenario the four year old ben is watching his favourite programm on television about micky mouse that programm ,14
20625, is interrupted by a 40 ,18
20626, advertisment about a whole micky mouse set including a backpack a jacket and some micky mouse shoes that light in the dark now the whole set costs over 40 francs ben does not have a knowledge of how much 40 francs is when the advertisment ends the programm continues but ben was ,11
20627, focused on that advertisment that ,11
20628, his favourite programm ends that micky mouse set is all ben ever thinks about and because that advertisment is ,18
20629, being shown over and over again all the four year old ben ever wants is that set ,20
20630," the family might not even be able to afford it

advertisment  is simply wrong a young child aged  does not know what he really wants advertising plays with their minds and lurge parents into buying things that their child does not even need that is wrong






the parents are obviously the ones that decide whether they should buy something or not ",2
20631, it depends on the television advertising in the televison are many advertisement for lego playmobil and other toys advertisements like these should be directed to children because i dont think that this joys are for parents only if the parents play with the children its for children between  there are ,0
20632, advertising for sturby trampolino and others thats ,11
20633, for the young children it should be directed to the children and to the parents because mostly the children saiy ,8
20634, the advertisement that they want to go there but the parents decide if they go there or not there is ,16
20635, the advertising about other television series if the serie is for young children like spongebob or cosmo  wanda ,14
20636," dircted toward young children because they are the people who are looking this serie and not the elder children or the parents so sometimes the series should be s the children because they are the people who use that stuff or who look that series

the negative ",6
20637, about television advertising  is that they shouldnt watch tv ,15
20638, often for example the advertising about television series is that ,11
20639, the children want to watch all the other series which they like that isnt good for them ,6
20640, that some advertisement can influence the young kids they dont know that much they have to learna lot if they see how great lego is they want more and more of lego the same with all the other joys they want more and more its hard to say than alway no as a parent so there are ,0
20641, that there are some positive and some neagtive ,21
20642, it depends on the advertisement in the end the parents have to say where they have to stop its only an advertisement and if the young children get that what in the advertisment were mentioned decide the parents if i would sell lego ,20
20643, make an andvertisement for the young children because ,16
20644, its for them and not for the parents or others there are many adventages as disadventages,12
20645," completly with that
in my opinion children aged  shouldnt even watch television they should play outside and get dirty and wet or i dont know what but it is a ",17
20646," that many children today just watch television and get dumber and dumber in front of the tv in this age the brain learns extremly fast and copy everything that it sees so children in this age are extremely invluable with advertising
many advertising managers know that and send specific advertising on networks for children for example a producer for toys send a advertising for his new toy on such a channel a child sees that and bother his parents ",0
20647," long until he or she has this toy this is how advertising for children works
but back to the main ",20
20648, children in this age as said copy everything what they see and they ,24
20649," didint have such a strong will like an adult so they cannot resist against these advertisings these were all my negatives opinions 
so now we switch to the positive i can only figure out one positive ",0
20650, statement and that is the following advertising can ,11
20651," a smoking is bad or a pay attention in the traffic advertising can be positive for a child but these advertisings have to be producted by the country where the child lives and not from a private company who wants to generate success with that advertising 
so my final conclusion is that advertising for children is bad an except is ",16
20652," the advertising is teaching something to the children what they can use in there everyday life
to end this essay ",0
20653, a duty from the parents to look ,9
20654, what their child is watching or what he or she is doing and parents should ,12
20655, not allowed their child to watch tv more than 2 hours per week its better for them to play outside and to connect with the real world ,17
20656,in this young age it is really important for young children to use their imagination they actually want to play all day long and ,24
20657, they do not know anymore what to play they get nervous thats the ,19
20658, where they learn to invent own plays by using their brain thinking about that television advertising may not be a good idea because ,6
20659, they get to see all the objects they could play with and see how they have to play with them they loose the imagination of finding own plays and ways to invent new stories out of nothing that would lead to  a certain nessecarity of the television and the advertising they would want to have every single object that is shown there as we know advertising is made out of many psychological theories ,0
20660," they really know how to affect little children
let us think about the good ",7
20661, parents are often very busy and stressed but little children need their attention most of the time thinking of that ,24
20662," it is a good idea to get childrens attention by using a television now if parents would buy all the little plays their son or daughter may want they can satisfie them without even using their proper time
in my opinion little children are way to naiv to decide what they want and what dont ",17
20663, in this age it is really important to let them use just their imagination because this is something they can never get back again ,24
20664," they once lost it by the inventions of adults so i think television advertising  young cildren should not be allowed
 ",13
20665,television advertising is a very effective way to sell a companys products people will recognize one special song or slogan which leads them to remember the product of the television advertising and eventually buying it but is it really appropriate for all the people who are watching tv what about the younger generation children  years old will they be affected in any way by these advertising in the following essay ,14
20666," show the pros and the contras of television advertising  children

for the parents will it be very difficult if television advertising presents products like toys because if the children see all these great toys they want to have it ",14
20667, but not all the parents can afford itthat makes it for them very difficult to explain it to their children but if there are television advertising some special kind of healthy drink or food it can have a positive effect on the children maybe they are more aware of healthy eating habits and that helps them to stay healthy on the other ,2
20668," there are a lot of bad foods and drinks which are promoted in television like all the sugary soft drinks and creasy foods that can have the exactly oposite effect
i ",4
20669, think that it really depends on the products which are promotedthere are a lot of good stuff ,11
20670," a lot of bad stuff which can influence the children 
",7
20671,the influence that advertising has on small children is huge these kids dont know ,16
20672, what they really want so the advertising can easly manipulate the young persons for example lets say its christmas time and a child does not really know what she would like to have for christmas she turns on the tv and watchs a show the show gets interrupted by several comercials about toys or events now the  child would love to have a specific toy that she didnt want to have ,0
20673," she just got influenced by the advertising
another ",11
20674, is that the children just want to have more and more toys this is not necessary suddenly the children dont just want to have that one toy they ,20
20675, saw a cute teddy it should be forbidden ,18
20676," that we can protect our world a bit and not raise our children more than necessary into this consume society that we already are

but we can say that it is ",21
20677, useful that the children to see ,8
20678, many wonderful articles during the advertising because ,11
20679," they can learn to deal with money of course just in some way for example they saw five amazing toys on tv but their parents say they are just allowed to have one this concludes that the kids have to make priorities this may help them in the future 
we ",9
20680, have to think about the channel we dont really know if the channels ,18
20681, could afford famous movies without some advertising and ,10
20682," we just cant afford to bang advertising
i ",11
20683, think that there is no particular reason to forbid advertising for little children i ,16
20684, grew up with advertising and i ,11
20685, a two faced thing it promises and shows you things that are ,18
20686, not really going to come true if we consider advertisement for young children it gets even more complicated because children dont really understand what is happening to them ,0
20687," they are watching advertisements for certain products

starting with a pro ",10
20688," that would be that the businesses that are selling their products with these adds for children sell and therefor earn more money an example would be that if kids go into a store and see something they really want they are going to beg for it untill their parents buy them this certain toy now if businesses wouldnt even need to get their costumers to come to the store to get this reaction from their kids but they could even directly reach them at home to sell their products it is even easier to sell more because like that they can reach a bigger audience

a contra to that would be that children are already confronted at such a young age with such marketing ways the children are used as a way to get the parents to spend money on them the child is like a conection from the product sellers to the parents if they get the children to fall in love with their product by saying its the best thing right now with colourfull advertisement and kids having fun it is a trick into wanting to have that exact product because kids dont know ",0
20689," how these advertisements are constructed to get us to buy things

in general ",11
20690, that advertisements are not such a bad thing i just think it shouldnt already be allowed at such a young age because the kids dont know ,16
20691, how they shouldnt believe everything that is shown on tv or that advertisemnts are just a way to show certain products and make them public but that doesnt mean that we should directly buy them,13
20692,"advertising

its allways a very difficult subject if children should watch tv or not
in the following essay ",14
20693," show you the pros and contras of television for children

the good thing about tv is that parents with very loud and activ children can keep them quiet if they let them watch tv to get a quiet hour for themselfs
children can ",17
20694, learn if they watch show about animals like i did ,18
20695," i was young and learn alot of things

but the contra is that if children at a young age already watch alot of tv they will get used of it and wont stop watching tv if they were older if you start watching tv at a young age you could probabely get addicted to it
in the television there were ",17
20696," many canals who were very bad for young children because they contend violence and sex and it can always happen that a children switches in wrong canal like this
its ",4
20697," a pity that television will get you away from going to play outside with your friends and you will just sit infront of the tv instead and get fat

for me personaly the contras were much more important than the pro and ",10
20698,a lot of adverstising are directed to younger people mostly because of how easy it is to influence them these adverstisings often lead to them wanting to buy a new toy or something comparablethe issue ,2
20699, is clearly that children aged  are able to understand the advertising but havent had enough education preparation or just simply arent old enough to understand the mechanism of these typ of advertising a child aged  isnt very critical about the information he gets in their young life theyve just had little expierence with people other than their mother and family and some other same old friends they just take everything sirious and belive evereything they are told because till that moment they havent had any reason not to now these big enterprises come and try to make the biggest profit out of it by making them believe their toy is vital for being happy ,2
20700," it goes that far that you cant even talk of free will its like a brainwash they get and they are helpless in comparison someone older has seen thousand of advertisings and has been educated they know behind these advertisings arent good willing persons that just want to help them be happy its somoeone trying to make money
another problem is that these advertisings are directed to the children but ",2
20701," the one who pays for the product are their parents so by directing to the children theyre simply trying to avoid the parents and their more critical view the enterprises manipulate childrens undevelopped  mind to make profit from the parents 
but i ",2
20702, with the statement at the top these companies ,23
20703, have to have a way to show their products the perfect ,23
20704, would be more realistic advertisings,11
20705,it is well known that most people are annoyed of advertising ,11
20706, it interrupts a movie they are watching but is it really that bad to answer this question we should have a look at some different ,4
20707,"
what if there are parents who have absolutely no idea what their children would like to play with this may be a little exaggerated but some parents really dont knowwha t exactly would make their children happy so why not let the television advertising inspire them if parents cannot feel their childs cravings what else should they do when television advertising shows toys or food the children may really like it is actually a very good thing ",14
20708," for these kind of helpless parents
however if children watch television advertising and they see something that they want they want it ",2
20709, hard that there is almost no way for the parents to buy their children what they saw in television children are unable to understand what their parents mean if they tell them that this product is like ,2
20710," a waste of money or produced in a very immoral way or whatever they will just cry because the only thing they understand is that they wont get what they want  which parents would want to make their children unhappy the people who this advertising is coming from know about that and they make a large profit of it
whats more is that advertising is just ",2
20711," annoying if you dont want to see this but you are unable to skip it so you just have to watch it which is really a waste of time
lets be realistc ",19
20712, that such parents like they are mentioned in the ,9
20713, example arent very common at all and ,21
20714, they cannot find the perfect toy for their children they have friends who can give them ideas or they remember what they had enjoyed ,20
20715, they were young the contra ,19
20716, in this question are much more important to consider advertising is a business which people make a profit of recklessly it shouldnt be supported at all and i would be ready to pay for television without advertising,15
20717,"this topic seems to me not possible i mean how do you want to make this statement work 
parents often let their children watch television by themselves to have them occupied and the parents can relax in knowing what they are doing
how does the government want to control this statement do they want to make a log in and a password for certain channels
do the parents have to hold their hands in front of the kids eyes ",17
20718," they can not see the advertising during the break of the movie
",11
20719, that this problem is overratet the government tries to make always more regulations and ,21
20720," that this trend is overhyped
",21
20721," we should let the parents decide whether the advertising is good or bad for their kids in if they want their kids to watch them or not in my opinion this kind of problem is not the issue of the government
i grew up in a household where my sister and i were allowed to watch television on a saturday and sunday morning to let our parents alone and let them sleep in it worked out very well for the ",14
20722, parties of us my sister and i had a good time and we were ocuppied so my parents had time for themselves to sleep in and they were never worried because of the advertising on television i mean my sister and i never got influenced by an advertising ,1
20723, i know during the daily routines of a five year old child it has way more and bigger factors who influence the child than the advertising on television for example their firendships their environment in the family their kindergarten teacher their way to the kindergarten their tools to play etc ,24
20724, the government should have their eyes more on those factors who are much more bigger and influencal for the children up to an age of five ,12
20725,"today television advertisement is  allmost all ages from five to sixty or even seventy years of age now should televison advertisement toward children aged  years be sanctioned this depends on how much television this group of people watch and how much of this time is filled with advertisement also children of today use more handys and tablets to play and watching televison as a free time event isnt probably more interesting for them

in todays world with handys and tablets to play with and where parents havent that much time left for their children they buy them tablets to entertain them so the children would ",14
20726, use these because they are more entertaining ,18
20727," tv this could meen that a sanction against the advertisement in tv isnt needed anymore
but for the same reason that parents havent enough time for their children a disallowement of the advertisement is needed ",15
20728, the children dont have tablets to play with and ,1
20729," using tablets watch too much tv

the ",17
20730, is if these very young children can even understand the advertisements shown on tv because if this is the case advertisements and a sanction of them would be ,16
20731, totally sensless but if they can understand it and ,12
20732," want the things that are advertised on tv it shouldnt be of much harm because the things advertised in childrens tv shows are mostly toys and children love toys anyways

at the end of my essay ",14
20733, present my own opinion to the question questionned tv advertisement and other advertisements are found everywhere today it should totally depend on the childrens parents how much they see from it and how much they watch tv we dont need a disallowement of tv advertisement if the grown ups watch for their children and spend enough time with them ,14
20734, than only work and let the childrens entertainment to tablets and tv,9
20735,"young childern in the age of 25 shouldnt be allowed to watch tv is that a good ban with healthy attitude or a pressure for all parents
if parents watch tv to gain knowlege about the news or about the weather they simply cant lock the child in another room for about 20 minutes they have to spend time ",17
20736," watching tv with the child but a flackering tv screen could put damage to the childs eyes or brain couldnt it young childern in this age need to play with geometric forms or play on a playground with other childern or with pets childern cant gain logical skills through watching tv they have to exercise by themselfes
anyway about the damage to the eyes there is no need to worry if the screen has a high definicion science says that pets and childern prefer to watch on a hd screen because ",17
20737, it wouldnt be that realistic and even a low quality screen wouldnt put that much damage that the child would become blind for logical skills there are tv channels for children which tries to improve the childs logical skills and to forbid something ,6
20738," unnessecary is kind of useless its the decision of the parents wheter they want to raise their child with a tv or without
for me we had a tv at home ",17
20739, i was very young and i sometimes watched some american child channels i really liked them and spoke about the stupid dog with my dad but ,6
20740, i was about 4 or something like that the tv channels where cancelled and ,6
20741, i played sometimes on the game console but it wasnt all the time ,18
20742, not i played with my sister on the playground or in the garden or painted on the street with her i was able to sit in front of the screen and improve my logical skills so i totally ,8
20743, with such a ban i had lots of fun in my childhood even with a tv ,17
20744, a tv could be dangerous ,17
20745, the child has learned to say ,8
20746, watch tv if you havent one it cant watch anyway ,1
20747, a dvdplayer and some good movies are way better for children tv with this load of crap in it isnt good at all and for important informations like news or weather you simply read in the inter,17
20748,"now a days there are a lot of television advertising that are  some parents are very irritaded of these advertisings because they think that this dont make any sense

a lot of enterprises are interested in winning new costumers that are confident to the products and who always buys there stuff some of the enterprises thinks that you have to begin at a young age to impress your costumers and to bring them on your ",0
20749, so they maybe buy your products for there whole life ,3
20750," a succes for the enterprise 

but a other reason could be that the parents buy what the children want and if the children had seen a publicity with his favorite animal or something that every children like he would absolutely want to have the item in the publicity so at the end the parents buy it and the enterprise have attended his target

on the other ",20
20751," a lot of people think that television advertising directed  should not be allowed they say that everybody could sell everything if its good for them or not  on that way and than the parents buy that but they doesnt even exactly know what that is

in my opinion television advertising directed  should not be allowed because these
",15
20752, it depends on the subject of the television advertising some of them are not good for young childrend between two and five years and others are ,14
20753," not really bad for the younger people
most of young children watch television at 5 o clock in the evening they want to watch ",17
20754, micky mouse or another short film for children so ,6
20755, the chanel should do not show worse advertising but it has chanel they show advertising which i find not good during the morning or lunch ,11
20756," children watch television it is a possibility that we say that this chanel must change their advertising during the day
in the evening or night more eldery people watch television then ",10
20757, the chanel can show every advertising which they want because most of them people are more than eightteen years old ,16
20758, and they have not a problem with this sort of advertising if they have one they can change the chanel and watch another television programm many children between two and five years cannot change the television programm by themselve an older person must help them now a short description of a situation a mother of two young childrens cooks the dinner durning the time she is in the kitchen her childrens watch television in the living room the mother have not the time to look every minute ,14
20759, her children what they watch in the television and the children are ,6
20760, unable to change the programm by themselve ,18
20761, the chanel show some bad things when a older person find something bad they change the chanel ,6
20762," short time and that is it 
the parents should can be sure that their children watch normal things in the television so it is important the the television programm shows normal advertising and not ",17
20763, women or men which wear not anything ,18
20764, an advertising of haribo or barbie ,11
20765, are not bad because that are things or toys which the children know some of them ,20
20766, play with these toys which  are showed by the television advertising so that is not a problem of course it has children they want a specific toy or something else they have seen in the television but that is a problem of their parents the parents should say no to their childre ,20
20767," they want have something
in the end ",3
20768, it depends really of the subject what the television programm shows but advertising like barbie haribo playmobile lego are not a problem ,14
20769, that are things for children and ,8
20770," many children plays with these sort of things durning their free time
",20
20771,every day we are confronted with advertising of some sort advertisement has become an indespensible way for companies to make their products visible to potential costomers the aim of advertisements is ,11
20772, a means for a company to increase its revenue over the years advertisements have become better and more effective one way of doing that is to specifically target the demographic of interest be it a certain age or a certain gender we know advertisement works well ,11
20773, means we are very easily influenced by advertisement and mostly unaware of it children are arguably ,0
20774," easily influenced as they arent capable of thinking critically that begs the questions of whether television advertising  aged  should not be allowed
the advertisement children at such a young age are exposed to probably come from television the internet does not affect this particular age group therefore it is best to focuse on television 
however it is questionable whether children at that age understand the advertisements at all or whether such advertisements have a greater effect on the parents
specifically banning advertisements for this specific age range would lead to a ",14
20775, for companies producing products for young children however it would affect all of these companies equaly ruling out a competitive ,2
20776," for certain companies 
whether or not advertisement affects people negatively is heavily dependent on the product obviously marketing harmful products requires more ethical consideration products ",11
20777, childrens toys do not fall into that category ,20
20778," there could be toys promoting violence to a certain degree
",20
20779, advertisement can pose a problem and needs to be regulated as companies most likely not monitor negtive effects themselves to me a much larger problme seems to be advertisement directed at young adults and teenagers this includes most importantly the marketing of harmful substances ,15
20780,the question if television advertising  younger children should be allowed is not an easy one here ,13
20781, shortly discuss the pro and contra ,21
20782," for the toy manufacturers it would be very positive if they could advertise their products on television they would sell more things because more children would know their stuff 
but other than that i cant see anything good about it if im honest you could say that the children would always have an idea on what they want for their birthdays or christmas but ",0
20783," children especialy small ones wouldnt have a problem with that anyway

and now to the contra ",4
20784," little kids can be quite greedy they can get bored of their toys very easily so if you show them everything thats new they would always want more and newer toys which would be a problem for the parents espacialy if they dont have the money to buy new things all the time 
another ",20
20785, is that small children cant decide if the advertise is fooling them with the quality or the price of a product they couldnt decide if the advertisers are just telling great stuff about something to sell it and ,2
20786," they would believe everything
maybe it would ",19
20787, trick the children into watching the tv more often which is ,1
20788," not what you want as a parent

to end my short essay ",8
20789, television advertising towards small children aged  shouldnt be allowed because the contra ,13
20790, only the manufacturers would profit from it and not the children and the wellbeing of the children should always be ,2
20791,"today television advertising is something completely normal but some of them make you shake your head especially advertising  is often discussed so is this really that questionable as some people think

when i was a young child i oftem watched television in the morning of course i ",10
20792, watched some advertises which sometimes actually influenced me when i saw a cool toy in television i wanted to play with this toy and ,20
20793," i saw nice looking new cornflakes i wanted my mother to buy them so in this case you could say that its pretty mean to try and sell such things  who are often very influenceable
to protect the companies which are doing this commercials you could say that they somehow have to bring their products to their clients if their clients are young children they have to broadcast advertises for young children
what could be discussed is to forbid all advertises because there are ",16
20794," a lot of adults who get influenced by them but thats another subject to talk about
adults somehow ",7
20795, it comes to the parents of the young children parents are ,9
20796, factor in this discussion television can influence the children as much as its possible but if the parents say no to the children and teach them right ,17
20797, it should be a problem if the parents dont just buy everything their little sunshine has seen in the television the advertises wouldnt be that successful and would maybe even stop by themselves its ,2
20798, about the parents how much television the child is allowed to watch if the children just watch television the whole day and do nothing else ,17
20799, they get influenced and are the companies or the parents to blame in that case ,2
20800," the bad parents are to blame so the question shouldnt be if its allowed to bring television advertising  it should be if its allowed to bring televison advertising  whose parents cant raise them right

all in all ",14
20801, its a problem that there are advertises which are directed  ,11
20802, its the companies right to try and sell their produts ,23
20803," the parents can control their children and what they buy them

 ",9
20804,nowadays young children are often very early in touch with our modern technology its normal to have an iphone in the 5th grade of primary school parents allow their children to watch television ,17
20805, they go out or its okay to see a film under the week ,1
20806," school for example i sometimes go babysitting a child named lily shes five years old and on a saturday evening she always wants to watch tv their parents think its okay but is this the way it should be shouldnt television towards young children be forbidden

on the one ",17
20807, there are very funny and entertaining channels for kids ,6
20808, kika or super channel the children enjoy watching fantasy stories or interessting stories with a happy end when they get ,6
20809," early in touch with television its easier for them to use other technoogical things later maybe they see things on the tv they learn from
on the other ",6
20810, there are many channels on the tv with arent thought for children aged  years maybe they get shocked by the things they see and cant sleep again the possiblility that they get addicted is ,17
20811," very high they watch tv for many hours on a nice saturday afternoon they havent time to play with their friends

my opinion is that ",1
20812, young children should enjoy their live playing with friends outside and go on an adventure by themselves they have enough time to watch tv ,17
20813,today it is not rare to see little children playing with a smartphone or other electronic devices since they are a few years old they lern how to use such objects why should not they be allowed to be taught at school using television advertising ,12
20814," with this statement for the following reasons

firstly in todays population people starts to use tablets computers and smartphones at a young age in the following years the technologie will improve and we will be doing every thing on a gadget ",23
20815, the children should be used to it ,12
20816," they are little

secondly the children may prefer learning with television advertising than with books for them it could be more fun to watch short movies than reading a long text

otherwise there are ",17
20817, by showing them videos they are not going to improve reading and writing ,6
20818," they do extra exercises to practise this

in addition to that little children could get addicted really quick to these electronic devises and may miss their childhood by playing a videogame or watching movies instead playing outside with friends

i personnaly think that is a good way to teach little children ",24
20819, it may not be the best idea in the way that the will not have a big social life because they are constantly ,1
20820, with the statement that television advertising  should not be allowed ,15
20821, that parents can not avoid advertising ,13
20822, they are watching television the children should not be kept in their rooms just to not see advertisings ,14
20823, most of the parents will not stop watching  television or as an alternative will ,17
20824," watch it at night time anyways who controls if the advertising is  also the companies would lose a lot of money by deleting those advertisings and it would be bad for the economy

i would ",15
20825, say that some advertisings should only be shown ,15
20826, a specific time as example ,18
20827," 9 pm a lot of sexualized scenes are shown which should not be seen by children
some other advertisings which contain aggressive contents or those who could afraid children should be prohibited children often do not understand their meanings or interprete them differently this can be very traumatizing or even damaging for their brains ",14
20828," that children can not difference between realistic and unrealistic scenes later on they may have a different understanding in the world and have obstacles in life which were forced by those experiences

but a ",8
20829, is that the television and ,18
20830, advertisings belong to the new technologic world if television advertising would be prohibited you would have to prohibit all advertisings ,15
20831, those on the smart phones and computers it would not make sense to only prohibit it on the television for me it does not make sense ,15
20832, to only prohibit it for children aged  a six year old children is ,12
20833, very young and advertisings can ,16
20834, have a bad effect on them parents should be responsible for their children and decide by themselves if advertisings should be seen by their children,16
20835,it isnt quite easy to answer this question first of all it should be obvious that the television is directed to everyone even young childern already grow up with it and are influenced by it the programm they watch influences them and ,17
20836, does advertising its part of the programm like every other movie series or whatever on the other ,10
20837, childern want what they see because its new to them and they want to make new experiences thats natural the problem is that this behaviour can force parents to spend their money on these things and this can be dangerous during the hard financial conditions were in at the moment for some people life becomens even harder like this because they want to give their childern everything they want in addition advertising on  television is really annoying because it interrupts the movie you are watching every few minutes another important ,14
20838, that the company which produces the ads can make a lot of money by selling what they offer and right now this is really important for the economy ,11
20839," were in a global financial crysis 

because of the ",23
20840, i previously mentioned i clearly ,18
20841, with the statement myself i have a small sister and i can see how advertising on television already influences her sometimes she comes to me and asks me to buy her things even really expensive ones for which i dont have the money ,0
20842, most countries economy can take the hit itll get from banning advertising on tv but in exchange we can live a less sttessful life with at least one thinl less bothering us ,15
20843,young children are much more easy to influence ,7
20844, there are televison advertising directed  there is a big chance that they just belive what they say in the television ,10
20845," it is not true at all 
also ",19
20846," a young child sees something that it likes it is very hard for the young child to realise that it is not importent to have all these things
an other ",8
20847, is that younge children normaly do not have any money ,9
20848, it does not make any sence to make televison advertising  it only makes a child wants something that they can not have and ,14
20849," it breaks a young childs heart 

when there is television advertising  they learn how to deal with it early so the soon know that not every thing in a television advertising is absolutly true 

",14
20850, that television advertising  should not be allowed because a young child is ,13
20851," easy to manipulate and most of the people who make the advertising know that and it is just not right to ausnã¼tzen this 



",11
20852,first i dont think that advertisments directed to children at the age of  would be worth paying for because children in this age usually dont have much or any money at all so ,16
20853, that the advertisement relies on a  year old child beeing able to persuade their parents into buying something they want i dont think thats a very good idea additionaly most kids in this age dont watch a lot of tv or are surfing in the internet for a limited time per day ,16
20854, they are not exposed to the advertisements very much ,11
20855, some of my relatives allow their kids to use electronic devices for just thirty minutes to one hour per day and they dont watch a lot of advertisements in this time in addition a lot of people skip the advertisements with an adblocker in the internet or by switching to another channel ,14
20856, the advertisements start on tv so ,10
20857, there is a lot of advertisement aimed towards young children its not very effective ,16
20858,"
about if advertisements should not be allowed i dont really know children in young age are easely ",13
20859, maybe we should try to protect them from the influence of the medias and big companies on the other ,23
20860, some channels on tv or some website in the internet need the money they get from showing advertisements to provide a free service and with less advertisement and ,10
20861," less money maybe some smaller sites or channels or some that show a lot advertisements aimed towards children would not be able to exist as a free service and they would need to shut down or to demand money for their sevice
in the end ",13
20862, the ones publishing the advertisments and the ones that make it and pay for it just need to know for themself if they want to manipulate children or not,16
20863, television advertising  isnt anything bad ,10
20864," the advertised stuff is harmless like toys or food
the worst thing that can happen is that the child wants it and asks his parents about it a child cant afford anything because it doesnt own any money
it wouldnt be too good if the child is obsessed with something it wants because it sees it all the time on tv but maybe ",2
20865," the problem is that the child is watching too much tv
maybe its ",17
20866," not fair if the tv is manipulating the cildren with certain techniques in the little spots for children toys
or maybe the parents get annoyed by what the children now want ",17
20867," time they go shopping and if they dont get what they want right away they cry and scream until they get what they want
so maybe ",3
20868, its not that good to have televisoin advertising  such young children but i think ,14
20869," it is in a reasonable amount and reasonable things its all right



",21
20870,"advertising  danger for children

we live in a world thats controlled by technology its hard these days to manage the daily life without using your mobile phone or the internet as an adult youre even more affected of the use of technology than your children but the question is whether it represents a problem for young children or not are the children negatively affected by the advertising in the tv

looking too much tv isnt good for the eyes ",14
20871, for small children which are developing it represents a big problem all these children we see wearing glasses could have been watching too much tv in their past doctors recommend parents to control the time which their children use for watching tv but in the most cases parents dont do this because they dont see the ,17
20872,"

it has to be said that they ",19
20873, can learn a lot by watching tv there are special programs made for children to learn the lanuage or even mathematics can be learned by watching some series on the other ,6
20874, theirs a lot of advertising every 15 minutes you can watch an advertisment and for adults its most of the time pretty annoying when small children watch an advertisment which shows how other children play with their new toys they want ,0
20875, the parents have to spend money on unuseful toys many parents dont have enough money to buy all these expensive toys that are shown on tv ,20
20876," they have to disappoint their children which often leads them to ignore or even hate their parents 

an other ",7
20877, that it isnt controlled whats shown in tv the ,21
20878, advertisment could be about toys and the ,0
20879," watch things which arent meant for them and influence their childhood in a very bad way thats why we hear about boysman that touch girls on the street or even about rapes the childhood plays a big role in everyones life

on the one ",7
20880, a lot of useful advertising like stuff for school ,11
20881, pencils bags etc which can motivate youngsters to go to school or even begin learning more for school on the other ,8
20882, the stuff shown on the screen is 10x more expensive than that in the shop ,23
20883," it could be a problem for poor families

in my opinion im strongly against advertisment because it often more has a negative than a positive effect it can lead to problems ",11
20884, the children become older because maybe they see the world with different eyes ,24
20885,"advertising s young children 

last night ",16
20886, i was watching a rerun of a movie on tv i noticed that every 20 minutes of film i had to fast forward the ,6
20887, fifteen to skip all the commercials because of the change of nutrition fastfood companys gain a lot more money and can spend more on tv commercails obviously most of the commercials are directed at young children ,2
20888, they are a lot more influencable ,19
20889," grown ups

you could say that every company have the right to stream their commercial on tv if they pay for it this leads to a diversity of tv chanels wich are completely free and everone has acces to also the tv channels have the possibility to stream more expensive content leading to a happier viewer 

on the other ",10
20890, those commercial actualy have an influence on what children spend their money on if you look at the way people eat you can see that it has become more and more unhealthy and that lot of people ,2
20891," the young eat a lot of fastfood this is caused by all the ads on tv 
also the influenced actions of the customer leads to a verry inefficent overproduction of goods wich ",23
20892," leads to foodwast and shortages or the overusage of natural resources

in my opinion it shouldnt be allowed to advertise bad products towards young children for they are the new generation wich will one day be a majority id ",2
20893, have a smart and healthy people desiding over my life alsoi think we should go in the complete other direction meaning we should advertise more for a healthy and energy efficient lifestyle,23
20894,"the goal of an ad is to show something to someone and make them to buy it so my question is if children can get that feeling to buy something and if they even recognicethe ad

the ",0
20895, thing that comes in my mind ,18
20896, i read this is if children in that age realise that something is an ad or not maybe they think its just another show or series they can enjoy for example if there is an ad for a doll maybe an animated one they dont realise that they could play with it or even recognise it as a thing in that case most of the children this young age ,0
20897, wont see any difference between an ad or a normal tv show the other thing is if they can feel the    urge to get something just by watching an ad or if they are just like oh its cool but i dont need it in the case a child saw an ad and really wanted it they dont even have the goods to buy it or even dont know where to get it the other thing is if children are watching tv with their parents they are confrotated with ads to maybe its not s them but theyll see it too an other problem i see with this is that there are other methods of showing an ad we are living in a time where maybe even childre be at the pc doing something ,14
20898," online advertising is getting more and more popular so they might get confrontated there 

in the end i cant find anything that speaks against advertising directly toward young children everywhere we go we get to see or hear ads and ",16
20899, children will see or hear ads too even if its not through the tv ,14
20900,nowdays advertisment seems to be everywhere whether in magazines radio or on television companies are always trying to reach for people as annoying as it sometimes seems it is an important thing ,11
20901," for new companies and their products the main aim is to reach the right audience for the product and the television seems to be the perfect medium surely young and old will throw even may a short  glanze to a tv
but is is right to show advertisment whitch are meant for young children 

what speaks for it is that young children in these days watch a lot more tv a perfect way to show an advertisment at the break of their favourite showthe product is  meant for them ",14
20902," why shouldntt they be able to see it
but a problem that may occure is they are children ",12
20903, young and without the feeling of responsability they wouldnt be able to buy it on their own or to make a deal by themself what is the ,9
20904, of showing it to a part of the audience who couldnt buy by themself it would be ,23
20905, the parents who have to grab into their wallet and buy it children may get overwhelmed by all those products and want them all which could turn into some unpleasants row between parent and childall in all i think it is unneccesary to show an advertisment to such young people becaus,2
20906,most people all around the world in this century have a television at home and which they use regularly to watch ,10
20907, the news in the case it is a family with young children the small kids will ,9
20908, want to watch television with their parents it is normal that television channels use advertisement as a source of income these advertisements are s all kind of groups of people like ,14
20909, advertisement of dog food for dog owners or ,11
20910," something simple as advertisement of toys for the young children who happen to watch television with their parents
now some people are saying that television advertising s young children should not be allowed

one could argue that these advertisements lead to the effect that young ones want their parents to buy whatever is advertised on the television and the parents being full of love and care cant refuse them and have to buy it for their kids
on the other ",13
20911," the children at this young age are not fully able to understand what is advertised and for what use that thing is which is on television but i know from my own experience with my 4 year old cousin that he always wants if he sees something advertised in television just because the advertisement looks like fun and makes him laugh
at the same time it is ",14
20912, the job of the parents to not always pamper their child ,9
20913, explain him or her why they dont need always that what is advertised in the television or the parents should not let their kids watch a lot of television because it is not healthy for their eyes at that young age anyway and they are only able to see the advertisement ,17
20914," they are watching television for a longer time
also in the case of that advertisment directed  should be banned the television channels may loose a big part of their income and ",10
20915," for the companies which are producing those advertisements will have an economic loss

i ",11
20916, am against this statement because children at that young age are probably not able to understand fully what is advertised and ,2
20917, there should not be any problems to let the television broadcast advertisement towards the children it is ,13
20918, the responsibility of their parents to control what ther children are watching on tv and to think if they really want to buy the thing their son or daughter wants to just because he or she saw it once in television,9
20919," with this statement
kids in the age between two and five years pick things really fast up they see and hear they try to orientate on everything that seems interesting for their eyes and do the same surelly they start to think on their own but its pretty easy to influence their thoughts and their actions of course this has an influence on the rest of their life because a lot experiences pictures are memorized unconciouss so ",24
20920, for barbie theyll have this brand in their had then they want one from their parents because the advertisers know how to get children on their ,20
20921, the right music colours quotes etc so they play with the barbie for their hole childhood and it can happen that ,20
20922, they get older theyll have body issues because theyve allways seen this barbie in the media than at home and ,24
20923," it gets somehow something to orientate on
about the comment i said ",21
20924, that kids copy things they see so ,3
20925, they see some kids playing with thousands of toys their parents are ,20
20926," lovely and everthings seems like the perfect family the children see those images and they burn into their head propably theyll wonder why it isnt like this at their own home because they cant differntiate from the real life and an illusion of life so they want those things they see and propably its harder for them to understand that they cant have all of this beucause its just unrealistic 
",7
20927, children should generally not watch television in this adge because you cant allways controll what they see and ,17
20928, the advertisers are ment to be for this age theyre not allways good and you never know in which ways it will influence your own child ,16
20929,"television advertising  should be allowed or not

in my oppinion ",15
20930," the use of the television or even other electonic items should be forbidden for young children who are under the age of five
i suppose that young children in the age of their growing can easily influenced by sozial media and can gret an incorrect picture of life and beauty
when you grow up which the influence of the television or the ipad or even ",17
20931, you are five and you already have a mobilephone than young children are not able to use and understand simple things for example ,24
20932, i was working on a pony farm i met a young girl who was maby three or four and i was upset ,18
20933," i sam that she was looking in a book and she could not turn the pages because she used to read on her ipad and she could not swich the pages over with her hands 

on the other ",18
20934," you grow up with the experiance of social media and co you will grow up earlyer than i did you learn how to life with social preassure in your young life and you learn how to handle it when you are only watching intelligent television series and informative documentarys than you can learn important things who might help you in your adult life

in conclusion i belive the influence of the internet is ",17
20935," based in our world that young parents have no chance to hide it from their children but it is important to protect the adventure of growing up and let our children enjoy a well pleased and protected childhood without the influence of electonic stuff as the television 

 ",17
20936,should advertising television towoard young children be allowed or not  in my opinion it should not be allowed first ,13
20937, talk about the generaliy letting children in this young age sit in front of the tv we all know its easier to put our children infront of the tv ,17
20938, we can do our work we ,18
20939, get the impression that our children can get smarter ,7
20940, they watch good tv because it gives them a good source of useable information im saying no in the age of  it is of highest importance not to let your child sit infront of the screen you as a parent have the responsibilty to make good decisions for your childs future during the the 2nd to 5th year of live the essential brain connections are made these are not made by sitting infront of the box they are developed by using all their four senses and by exploring their world if your child doesnt make these necessary barin connecntion it wont be able to do them later lets talk about an drastic example to show you what i mean lets say youre really busy with work and you dont have enough money to pay someone who looks ,17
20941, your daughter you can give sarah your attention from time to time but most of the time she is spending infront of the tv questions i want you to think about how is she going to learn how to speak how does she know how to use her fine and gross motor skills ,1
20942, nobody goes out to play with her how is she ever going to be able to sozializewith other people ,19
20943, shes trapped in the house  my prediction is that this girl will be retared not only wont she have the basic motor skill ,18
20944, mentally she will be disturbed ,19
20945, she will have difficulties sleeping ,4
20946, she hasnt been active all day and ,18
20947, shes on her own and doesnt receive the needed love and attention of her caregivers eventhough its a exagerated example i ho all the essential skill are learn thourgh exploring the world sitting infront of the tv and not beingexpoes to anything wont do any good for your child regarind my explanation about not letting children spend time of the tv ,17
20948, its self explaining that i dont support the advertisement directed to children,16
20949,if i were a parent i wouldnt want my child to watch advertisements who are not made for his or her age but i ,14
20950, wouldnt want my child to watch television at all at this age in my opinion children at this age should go outside and play with friends they should pass their childhood at the playground discovering the world and not sitting on the couch watching television if children can go outside they can make friends for life and children who go outside to play are often healthier and less lonely because they are moving and they are together with other children children who only sit at home watching television in their freetime dont have the opportunity to make ,17
20951," many friends as other kids do
of course i would allow my child to watch televisionbut only seldom and not every day and i would want to know what my child is watching on television so i totally ",17
20952," with the statement children shouldnt be watchig things witch are not made for their age the most of the advertisements are made for adults and not for young children 
so ",13
20953, it maybe would be a great idea to make a television channel just for children without advertisements on this channel there should only be movies that are made for children they shouldnt include violent content ,6
20954, the parents know that on this channel their child isnt watching anything what is not mentionned for the childs age  ,6
20955,advertisement is something we see every day we may come across it at the railway station on the radio ,11
20956, browising the internet or just simply ,18
20957, watching tv it became something ,6
20958," common that we no longer question it but the advertisements have reached such an extent that there are now some targeted specifically towards children at the age of  years but thats not an issue or is it
childern that age cant buy the products anyways ",16
20959, why make a fuss about it in the end its the parents that has to work for the money to buy the products and its the parents who ,2
20960, buy the products so the advertisements targeted at children are just other means to reach the parents its kinda like putting the sweets right at the cash register at the super market they try to put the parents in a situation where they have to buy the products because their child wouldnt stop talking about it or maybe the child would even start crying or throw stuff around in anger at its parents this strategy uses the bond between parents and children to reach its means and i would even go that far as to say that they dont even care if they destroy these bonds children left mentally scarred just because they had some silly fight with their parents over a toy or whatever also small children are easily influenced by what they see or hear and some might argue that its good not to confront them with the bitter truth about life but telling them pretty lies might be ,2
20961," bad
i dont have any problems with the advertisement of products for young children but ",16
20962, its wrong to manipulate children those advertisements should ,16
20963, be s the parents so ,9
20964, its bad to make advertisements specifically for children,16
20965,nowadays many parents allow their children to watch tv but by watching tv the children might get very lazy and stop communicating with children in their age they wont  like to go play outside with their friends anymore what ive experienced is that ,17
20966, children start watching tv they focus really hard on what happens and if you try to talk to them they dont even hear youthats why ,17
20967, they can really get addicted to it in those young years its ,24
20968," possible that because of the tv their eyes can get damaged 
on the oder ",17
20969, be a good thing if they watch ,19
20970, they dont speak english they once will start to understand it and can learn english in young years that might help them a lot ,8
20971, they start to learn english in school it can ,8
20972," be a good thing for the parents to make themselves calm down there are a lot of parents which are very stressed because of their children and cant even take a little rest with letting them watch tv they are able to rest for a little time and start doing things for themselves or housework they werent able to do during the day

",1
20973, its important that the parents control the time ,1
20974, their children are watching tv and let them watch it just ,1
20975, an hour for me the parents should learn to say no to their children if the children have to switch the tv off they will probably beg them to let them watch for a longer time ,1
20976, the parents need to be strict in my opinion its ,12
20977," important that they wont allow them to watch tv everyday 
so that the children like to go outside and learn to communicate with other people ",12
20978, important that the parents go out with them they should spend more time with their children ,12
20979," that they dont have to let them watch tv just because they dont know anything other to do 
",1
20980,in my opinon television advertising shouldnt be forbidden in the ,15
20981, speak about advertising in form of spotsscenes and ,11
20982," about advertising in shows hidden
first we have to look at the television of the kids kids usually have their own sender where they watch their shows and movies so they advertising on this sender is mostly about toys and food which doesnt harm their psychis like ",14
20983, an advertising for a stripper webside of course the kids will be somehow influenced by the advertising and they probably want to buy the showed product but in age 2 to 5 they dont own money and its ,0
20984, the decision of the parents if they buy it or not secondly the advertising doesnt say what is bad and only says what is good ,2
20985," i dont buy schokolade because the haribo advertising says its bad so the advertising doesnt give them vorurteile about stuff
i dont understand why television advertising should be forbidden i mean in a supermarket are ",15
20986," big signs with advertising and it isnt forbidden 
and ",11
20987, is that a lot of kids dont even watch television advertising my 3 years old brother just switches the sender ,2
20988," advertising comes on 
in my opinion it clearly shouldnt be forbidden as long it doesnt change the kids opinion about major topics televison advertising for older groups of childs is much more a problem because they have money and they will spend it on stupid stuff just because it comes in the television 

now we come to the advertising in the shows itself like the main character who always drinks coke or eat pizza this is a bigger problem because the kids associate the good opinion about the character with the product for example the hero which always drinks coke ",14
20989, a battle because it makes him stronger the result is that the kids will drink a coke and ,19
20990, they feel themself stronger this is bad because coke is not good for health and ,19
20991," it makes a wrong image of it it shouldnt be forbidden but marked or said that like in the example coke damage your teeth or something like that coke  coca cola
",4
20992,television advertising s young children should be forbidden because it influences them in the wrong way they are getting animated to ask their parents for games or clothes they do not need further they are able to manipulate their parents into getting what they want the parents are almost forced to buy the desired things because ,14
20993," they would have magnificent problems at home with their children 

on the other ",19
20994, for the parents to always be informed abot the latest games or parks the could go to as a family they do ,1
20995, send ads for the children ,16
20996, for the parents because they know that more than half of the kids on front of the tv are watching with their parents in the background ,17
20997," that some of the ads are made specially for parents to get them into buying something for their kids or as a present for other families

i ",0
20998, think it is not a good thing to place ads on kids channels because i do not like advertising ,16
20999, and would not like my children being influenced by something i cannot control ,7
21000, the kids have a right to watch their channels and not to be overwhelmed by information about things they would like to have but ,17
21001, most of the time not really know what it actually is so ,3
21002, with the statement and think it should be forbidden ,21
21003, that we can protect our children ,12
21004,whats in favor that television advertising should be  is that maybe they get more tired and ,15
21005, they sleep better an other ,19
21006, is that there are children who wake up better ,8
21007, the televison is on an important ,10
21008, important what they look in the television and how long they look for example ,6
21009, they look every evening the children tvshow sandmã¤nnchen ,6
21010, they go to bed its not as bad as ,19
21011," they look the whole day spongebob because some tvshows arent good for the brain of the little childreens 
something thats again the televison advertising is that they maybe do nothing other as sitting infront of the television and ",6
21012, they dont have social contacts which are important for every human in every age it is ,24
21013, in the garden because to be in the nautre is ,18
21014," extremly healthy for little kids 
in my ",4
21015, of view it should not be allowed the directed advertising of television toward young children because ,13
21016, its not good for their brains and creativity ,4
21017, they have this direct advertising its more important that the play outside and with other little kids sometimes its ,20
21018, the play lonely in their rooms ,1
21019, they can talk with themselves in my opinions its bad for them ,12
21020, the sit the whole day infront of a televison listening to unreal figurs so ,1
21021, with the statement that television advertising  yound children should not be allowed ,13
21022,there many families who have a television in their houshold so often children are sitting in front of in their freetime ,17
21023," but isnt it wors to put the children in front of the tv and let them watch
there are many disagreements for it ",17
21024, some agreements the children are open minded and if you show them in their early years a childrenfriendly sierie they maybe could learn something there are many sierie about like dora the little pirates ore the einsteins who try to make a connection between a mean story and schoolsubjects per example learning numbers learning the alphabet or how animals live and ,8
21025," on and if theres a houshold who the mother have to cook they can leave her children in front of the tv so the children cant disturb them
there ",1
21026," some disagreements when the children are to long in front of it they see to many advertisings and in this advertisings sometimes are not nessecery informations and stufs and if this advertisings directed to young childred they are going to be manipulated if they see a toy in the commercial they realy want that and the parents should buy it and if they have enogh money they will and if they havent enough money the cant so thats the way to become very rich childrens and poor childrens

",2
21027,first i thought why should the television not advertise towards young children television advertising is the to make people want a certain thing you make them believe that they really need this new thing that they always see in the television a lot of kids are between two and five and they ,14
21028, want to play with the newest things they see on the tv on one ,1
21029, this is not bad because the technology goes ,23
21030, and with selling things to play you can make a lot of money money that they can use to produce cooler and newer things to play and ,23
21031, for themselves to feed their families on the other ,19
21032," it is bad to show this very young kids all this things they can not decide what they just want or what they really need so they want their parents to buy everything for example if little girls see horses to play in the tv they want one but the producer are smart and they produce horses in every size and colour now the girls ask their parents to buy them one of this horses the parents ask which one do you want now the girl has to decide if she wants the pink one the purple one or the red one every horse is beautiful in her eyes and she wants them all often the things they show children in television advertising is very expensive not every family has enough money to buy such things now we have the problem that some children always have the newest and coolest things to play and other have their standard doll to play which are not bad but its not as cool as the purple pink and red horses sometime this is enough to start bully other children in kindergarden 
in my opinion television advertising  is not a good idea mostly it is too much stress for the families and ",14
21033, for the children because they alway see what the other children have what they not have ,8
21034, beacause television advertising for young children is bad because very young children are very manipulative and if they see something they want you can hardly get that out of their mind ,14
21035, they dont own money neither they think about money ,3
21036," they dont care how much a toy is in my opinion television is anyways a bad place for very young children so i think we should lower the time that children watch tv anyways
television can be very inappropriet for children there are some exceptions ",17
21037, for example if childrens are watched by the parents or any other adults ,7
21038," they can safe them from the inappropriet stuff but can let them watch the series and films who are made for kids 
if kids watch television they often come threw pictures or videos that arent made for young eyes for example there are often naked girls in late night tv shows but they arent able to watch that because most of the times they go asleep early anyways but ",17
21039, over the day there are often disturbig videos and pictures seen ,18
21040, of injured people alot of tvs nowaday have child safety ,17
21041, if you set that up and put the tv in safety mode your children can watch good series on their own without the fear that ,17
21042," that can eliminate that problem ready
back to the main subject adveristising companys see easy money in children and they proberly are ",9
21043, right if childrens see something they want parents often have to give in and go buy it for them but as soon as they bought it the children have already seen another toy they want children ,20
21044," believe everything thats said in the adversitisement and they dont listen to the parents who tell them that its a lie 
in conclusion for the help of parents and to eliminate taking kids as victims of adversitising it think we should at least smaller the adversitiesments direct towards the chilren also parents should lower the time kids watch tv anyways because television often is a very inappropriet place for them",7
21045, its save to assume that small children that havent even reached the age of six arent even remotely as accustomed to our influential world ,7
21046, talking about how advertisement and other simmilar means aiming to make profit try to manipulate the consumer so my ,11
21047, thought would be to say that its really a good thing to not allow big companies to manipulate children but ,23
21048, again you have to start wondering if a child really really wants something badly what does it do i mean small children dont have any money they dont go into the ,9
21049, toy store to by the newest play set no they go and ask their parents to by it for them and thats the important ,20
21050, yeah children are easy to manipulate but it doesnt help the company to gain any profit ,2
21051, the childs parents dont by what was shown in the advertisement so ,9
21052, its not the evil television or greedy companies that are the problem but instead its bad parents the child didnt decide to by something because the child cant decide to do ,14
21053, the parents are the ones who ,9
21054, go into a store and get the object in question ,18
21055, the parents responsibility to make sure that they dont by something that in their opinion is not something their child should possess its not the advertiser thats to blame here but they now some people might argue that ,2
21056, a child wont be able to by something for themselves they can ,9
21057, scream cry fight and generaly make their parents live hell and ,24
21058, thats something the advertiser should be blamed for the parents have to make sure their child is raised in a way that teaches them propper maners and ,2
21059," every child will probably try to get something by being loud at least once they have to be taught that this is not hiw live works you cant and you wont get everything you want right away possibly you wont ever get what you want 

and if where honest ",9
21060, we are not better suited to face daily manipulation than young children are countless examples prove that wedding rings ,7
21061," are present in the live of practically every married couple at least in countries with a manely christian population but wedding rings started off as nothing more but advertisement by the diamond and yewelry market and i dont even want to start talking about war propaganda its the darkest and sadly most successful kind of advertisement that i can imagine and has led people to fight to the death against what they thought was satan himself but what would have turned out to be just another country with a slightly different culture

so ",23
21062," that advertisement aimed at young children should be allowed it wont ruin the childs live and its the parents duty to make sure the child is prepared to face advertisement in the future 

and just because its an interresting ",16
21063, add a little bit more here it might be true that general advertisment towards children isnt bad but what might be bad at least in my oppinion is advertisement dedicated towards a certain gender because ,16
21064, that thats one of the main reason for bullying anybody should be allowed to like whatever they like and if a boy likea barbies ,12
21065, why should the media tell him not to like them and even worse why should the media tell his school friends that thats not normal but i ,19
21066, know that this is a utopia something that can and will never happen advertisement is supposed to be effective and that can only be true if its ,11
21067, aimed at a certain demografic in the end i guess that this is a problem that wont be solved by society and its once again important that parents support their child ,12
21068," they can 

so i guess this concludes my text the parents have to look ",9
21069, their children not the media,7
21070, that children aged  are to young for advertising they cant decide what they need if a child sees a toy in an advertising it want this toy and it wants his parents to buy it and young parents perhaps cant say no to their child and in the ,16
21071, day this child sees another toy in the tv and ,20
21072, this child is a little bit older or ,8
21073, it is a teenager it could be that it is very polished and its ,18
21074, these children are older they only have to buy all these things which they have seen in the advertising because they got everything they want ,2
21075," they were a child from their parents 

in my opinion telvevision advertising should only be allowed to adults or teenager because children not even have money to buy this things if a teenager sees something in an advertising it could work and do a job to earn money like this ",0
21076, a teenager could earn money and buy something they want thats the only good ,9
21077," of the advertising  in the tv direct toward teenager so a teenager dont get everything simply from his parents but it works for it and learns to fight for the things they want 

so ",0
21078," televison advertising should not be allowed  because like this they dont learn to deal with money and for them its normal that they get everything they want

21079,television advertising s young children isnt an easy thing to discuss about on one ,13
21080, it may leads to more creativity and ideas on the other ,8
21081, its a deangerous thing because children get an unrealistic picture of how everything workes and how poeple are supposed to be or how they are supposed to look like for example barbie with her long blonde hair and small legs but this is not realistic at all it depends on the genes and other factors another ,7

on one ",12
21089, children aged  mostly watch television because their parents are occpued and need some silence it makes no difference which channel you are watching advertisements are everywhere ,14
21090, some which are  i can totally understand the commercial industry that they advertise their products and try to sell them especially little children normally want to have everything they see and ,2
21091," the television advertising is much more decorated with some technical skills that it looks more extraordinary and makes the child wishing it 

on the other ",0
21092,advertising with games for exemple ,11
21093, the children are watching television has some negativ ,17
21094, firstly in the mind of the children there appears the wish ,8
21095," thing they just have seen they want to have the seen product immediately often if a child want to have something it  asks their mother but if she says no the terror starts it screams in hope to get the toy but mostly the mother is stronger and lets the child crying until it calms down again

in my ",20
21096, of view children aged  should not sit in front of the television they should ,17
21097," go out play around let their energy out and maybe make some new friends if many children would do that we would not have to ask the question if television advertising  is allowed my personal opinion is that children should enjoy their movie they are watching without interruptions because if they are interrupted all the time they are not able to get the chance to understand the content of that what they are watching


",14
21098,the memories of my youth always ,18
21099, school i would get on the couch and turn the tv on and watch the kid network in my country for a decent amount of time there was one thing that really got on my nerfes even today and that is advertisments there were ,1
21100, any ads on tv i even messured with a stop watch how long the comercials break were they were or they ,10
21101, are up to ten minutes which for my little self was a lot sometimes i beg my mom or dad that they buy me the stuff in the ads a childs brain is like a sponge of informations it soaks all information in that the world confronts it with so it remembers all commercials and toys that got shown in tv but there are ,0
21102, ads that help the children for example the school materials that get shown in the kid channel are superb they get prepared for school the school ads help ,0
21103," the children to like the school because in the ads the school always looks like it is fun and cool 

but my opinion i think the commercials in childrens tv should be banned because it creats an image of capitalism and i think the only true form of a state is a state of communism in communism all the people are equal and there would never be a competitions of products and without a competition there wont be ads we sould take notes of mother russia and support it on its way to a state of communism glory to the communism",13
21104, in the age of  children shouldnt watch tv their childhood would be better if theyd go outside and play with friends ,17
21105, advertising in tv directed  is pretty stupid because they belive everything they see or hear i mean as a kid i told my grandfather everything i heard and made him believe me because i thought that this was the truth just because the influence of my surrounding was very big i hardly ever watch tv but ,10
21106, i do the adverts are mostly stupid and not really realistic the children would watch these stupid adverts and believe everything they would be influenced by tv and the parents have it harder than ever to help their children grow up in a good way to be honest i dont want to see the ,14
21107, two or three generations grow up i cant stand the young children now they all run around with smartphones and at home they watch tv or play videogames if they get even more influenced by  tv it will get ,17
21108, it should be forbidden to make adverts for young children they should have a childhood not growing up in front of an influencing tv ,13
21109,since the last few years technology made a big step forward every family in europe has at least one tv at home and is watching it one or more times a week today is it impossible to grow up without these things like tv internet and ,17
21110, we are confronted with the enormous development ,21
21111," our youth in school we have to be able to say whats going on in the world and the most of young people dont like reading the newspaper 

the same is for the young children aged  parents are often busy and let them watch tv ",17
21112, they havent time to play or talk with them for the children it is like learing the language and understanding the connection between humans and their life so ,8
21113, they are watching tv and it appears an advertising about a product ,10
21114, a choclat drink and they were talking about how healthy this is the child thinks that this is ,4
21115, but we adult persons most of us know that this could be ,7
21116, fake or not right the same in an advertising with a ,11
21117," young man smoking it shows the young children that smoking isnt something terrible and unhealthy they see just the good in this situation like the smile of this young guy or how he enjoys the smoking

in my opinion there are too many advertising in the tv i wouldnt say that the advertising is at all worse but it shows often not the reality about product just the good ",14
21118, that the persons which are seeing it buy it later on one ,23
21119, i dont like these advertising in the tv ,10
21120, that young children watch the same as me on the other ,1
21121, bad we learn new things about new products and we keep in touch with the development of the technology nutriation etc because of this ,23
21122," is it more  importante how the children grow up or more how the parents handle with this situation
",9
21123,"about the influence of advertisement on young children

television advertisement has increased in the past ten years the amount of information people are confronted with is crazy companies are promoting their products in the best way they can to sell it but regarding the young children who are often watching television these days we must consider the damages which the streams of advertisement may cause
if we take a look at all the advertisements there are ",14
21124," harmless types of them there are the kinds who are showing things that are inappropriate for kids in young ages and there are the types that are pretending that life is perfect and life gets better by eating a snickers they are showing a false view on the word and humanity of course we are old enough to know that advertisements tell a lot of lies but children believe almost everything they see so if there are advertisements made for young children to see they are speaking directly to them and making them think they way like it is shown in the commercial the commercial is made for selling as most as possible and like that children get trained to think in a way that is only positive for the companies children should not be confronted with that type of material the companies are searching  for the easiest way of tricking people into buying their products so they are just using children because they believe everything you say
another ",16
21125, to that would be that you can use commercials to do good to children there are of hundreds of television programmes made for children which are trying to teach them important lessons for their lives if you can make a way of using commercials in the same ways that those programmes do ,0
21126," it is totally appropriate but regarding the selling goals and the bad kind of influence it is not okay to confront children with masses of advertisement
",16
21127, that children should discover the world with a free mind i guess they have the right to think for themselves and be protected of the crazy business world for just a little longer than the ,8
21128," with this statement 

the reason is that young children are very easy to catch that means if they see something in the television they want to have it because they cant make the difference between something they need or they dont need they dont have to work for money the parents have the money and normaly they get everything they need and want the children are the weak ",2
21129," of the parents and they want to see their children smiling or laughing and not crying
big companys with products that are for the consume are ",0
21130, brazenly that they make advertising where you see some nice teddybears or some cute animals and stuff like that the problem is at this ,11
21131," small children make a links between objects and feelings for example if they see a teddybear they want the hug him or if they see a ball they feel happy and want to play with it if you look at a old mc donalds advertise there was ronald mc donald the friendly clown who played with some people and children who were in a mc donalds restaurant  and if a small child sees that he or she want to go to a mc donalds too because they think they can have fun there in videogames advertisings for small children not call of duty something like a racing game you see small children who sit at the tv and play the game they laugh and have fun together and if someon sees that who is not very old thinks that is the only way to have fun and he or she want to buy it
at the end ",20
21132, that it will be hard to make a law that says it is forbidden to make comercials that are for joung children because who has the right to say this advertise is for young children and this for children over five years,13
21133,many people agreed with the statement that televisoin advertising  should not be allowed but there are ,15
21134, some people who disagrees with this statement what are the ,21
21135, for letting children watch televison advertising and what ,14
21136," are there for not letting them watch televison advertising

",14
21137," one raeson why children shouldent see television advertising ist that children in the age  are really easy to ipresionate and to maipulate so if they make a very impressionate advertising for barbies or other toys the children want to have those things the parents will have the problem because they cant buy everything that their child sees in the television 
on the ther ",14
21138," say that the children might learn something from those advertisings maybe they can learn new words and expend their language
but the advertising can ",0
21139, have a bad influence on the children beacause ,7
21140," they see a person or the hero of the szene and they wan to act like them so they began to imitate the character that they have seen beacause they were really impressed 
but the characters of an advertising can have ",11
21141," a good influence on the children too

in my opinion children in the age  shouldent watch television anyway they should go out and play with theitr brothers and sisters and not sitting on the couch and watch televison ",17
21142, for people who are older ,18
21143," that watch televioson can be a good way to relax or to learn something for exaple in docomentarys
so ",6
21144, with the staement that television advertising  should not be allowed,15
21145,tv advertaisemetent has boomed in the last few years more and more ,10
21146," young children are directed by advertaisement with the goal to provocate their needs for buying a having new things but should television advertisisng s young people  be forbidden
a pro",14
21147, to the prohibition is that young children dont have the ability to form a personal opinion ,12
21148," they learn and grow by seeing hearing and listening thats why they are easy victimes and clients for the advertisment they are powerless against what they hear see and listen to and believe therefor everything 
on the otherhand young children dont have the possibilties to buy new things on their own they are looked and controlled by their parents who ",2
21149," have the decision over how to spend the money so advertisement for young children doesnt always make sence 
an other arguement is that children stand under the influence of advertisement growing up and that this can have influence on their lifes later on ",0
21150, the way they buy and think about the world the advertisement can ,11
21151," misslead the childrens interpration of happiness and what really counts in life they will associate happines and success with materialistic stuff andalways having the newest things
i pointed out more reasons to prohibid advertaisement for young childrenen but what ",2
21152, is that it doesnt make a difference and that its hard to stop advertasient young children will always stand under influences of the outside praising and telling things and somehow they have to learn to deal with it in my opinion what really counts it that parents transmit and teach the children the right ways of living and interprating things ,7
21153, telling them that not everything we see and hear is true children should grow up learing what really counts and not let themself be influeneced by what the outside world and the trends say ,7
21154, much i therefor say no it doesnt make sence to forbid advertaisement and that if there are people who dont like their children to watch advertisement on tv than they shouldnt let them watch t,13

21158," adverts for toys will make the kids want the products really hard and the children will go to their parents and make them buy them the toys or whatever the advert is advertising for
its clear that the products made for children must ",0

i can understand why parents dont like those adverts because ",16

but if parents dont want their children to do this they shouldnt let them watch television there are many other possibilities to let kids watch series or movies for example there is a tablet which i dont remember the name of where children can download series and movies and there arent any adverts i know this because i have a little sister another way which is a bit more time consuming is to download the series or movies in the internet and ",14

    ",1
21167,"i thing that its hard to say if its good for little kids to watch television or not because we people grew up with the social media
it depend for how long we watch and for how many times 

pro if you want to do something ",17
21168," cooking dinner you can put your child in front of the television and he is looking at the programm its very helpful beacause we can do oure own things without looking or playing with the child the child would be concentrate on the tv show

pro there are lot of intelligent programm the young childrens can learn a lot of things for example the moves or a melodie of a song its good that they are doing healthy programm  because its less dangerous to become stupid 

contra maybe two years its a little bit to early to put his child infront of the televison of the age of four its the best older to startif we put them with a early age infront of the tv the child would be used to watch it too much thats really bad because a young person should have other interst ",17

contra there are a lot of stupid programm and a little child could copie this bad things and could become stupid ",24
21170, its bad to watch every day television but if its not every day and not to long it would be fine ,17
21171,there ara some reasons why you would show or not show the television programm to achild aged  one of those pro ,6
21172, is that it is very easy to entertain a child with the television because there is something going on all the time and entertaining such a little child can sometimes be very exhausting and parents dont have infinit power to do that the tv is ,17
21173, good at keeping a kid calm wich is very exhausting too ,8

the same thing if the parents are working and have a babysitter for theire child but there are some intelligent programms too wich tell good maners or how to deal with complicate situations in live a contra ",6
21175, as young as those were talking about dont get enough time and love from theire parents it can effect theire evolution also if children dont go out to play with other kids they dont learn how to deal with other humans or kid of theire age somethig else is that if they dont move enough it may decrese theire motoric skills ,24
21176," that tey are worse in sports than other children an other one is that if they always get entertained by a tv they dont learn how to entertain themselves an may get less creative 
",8
21177, it shouldnt be forbiden its the responsebility of the parents but they should know how to use television if there is a young child,17
21178,"the new baby born only for 999chf say an advert directly  between age two and five many companies try the advertise their products towards the young children to make more profit with this they overgo the parents and try to get the kid to want their product television advertising  should not be allowed
just imagine that your kid sees these cool things in the tv every day it will animate the kid to watch tv more often ",14
21179," it wants to see more nice products and that is not good for the kid kids should be playing outside and not watch tv advertises because the radiation from the tv is bad for childrens eyes
furthermore the children cant buy these products themselves this leads to more internal ",2
21180, the kid wants something it saw and the parents probably dont want to buy it for the kid just think about yourself ,20
21181, you were a kid alot of things didnt make sense to you because you didnt understand your parents sometimes for example ,8
21182," you wanted a realy nice new toy but your parents just did not want to buy it for you most of us have probably cried because of that and had fights with their parents
this leads me to my last ",20
21183, easy to manipulate but doing ,18
21184, is ethicaly incorrect just think about yourself again ,21
21185," you were younger you believed nearly everything someone told you you were realy naive and thought that everything they tell you is probably right using that attitude to just sell more products to innocent children is a very bad thing to do
this leads me to my conclusion if these firms want to sell their product they should advertise s the parents of children and convince them that their product is good for the kid with a law against advertises s young children we can protect our future generation and give them a better childhood in many ways do not let the innocence of children get used any longer and support this new law vote for it on september 22 of 2016 just do it",2
21186,young children are influenced a lot ,7
21187," by television advertising they are very interested in things that move or make noises so television advertising which is about some toys and is  is an extremly clever move from the company when a child sees some of these advertisings it is fasctinating by the object or the product they want to sell right away they tell their parents what they saw and that they want them to buy it most of the time the parents buy it because they want to make their child happy in this case its very good for the company and they sell a lot of their products 
but ",0
21188, if the advertising is not about a product but about a place like disneyland its ,11
21189," good for the company but not very fair for the children  because not all about an advertising is true often the company exaggerate a lot and try to make the thing they want to sell look nicer 
in my opinion television advertising  doesent make any diffrence to advertising which is  adults of course children are a lot easier to convince but ",14
21190, the parents have to be convinved by the product because they buy it,2
21191,"advertising 

this kind of discusion is very difficult becuse there are reasons which are for it and against it and advertising ",11
21192," a problem for anybody in some ways
an ",21
21193, which agrees with the statemant is that young children should be protectet of some violence and sexual pictures because we dont know how children realize them and what these pictures or videos are doing with their minds but often it is a problem to protect children from bad advertising because in this time you can find advertising everywher and you cant controle everything so it is ,13
21194, difficult to control and forbid advertising which is  children ,16
21195," to influence children in a way that somebody has a profit of it is alway bad but many people do it and young children think diffrent to us and that is the greatness of to be young and we shouldnt exploit it 
at the end ",7
21196, you cant forbid advertising but advertising which  should be forbiden                                                                                                                                                           ,15
21197, young children between two and five do really like watching television they usually watch cartoons or some series that explain things and why they are like they are in a very easy way of course they ,6
21198," have to watch the advertising because nearly all channels do advertising the advertising that is directed  is mostly advertising for games children as we know are getting influenced very easy advertising is a kind of influencing because the goal of advertising is to make the people in this case the children to buy or consum the things they see in tv

now should advertising for children be forbidden

children between two and five are not able to do the last step i described on top they can not buy or consumate the things they see in tv unless their parents are buying it for them now you could say that if children watch advertising they go to their parents and just argue with them until they get the things they saw on tv but if that happens the parents are ",14
21199," just very weak and who says that the things they advertise for in tv are just bad and unusefull
maybe the child watchs something in tv and  shows it to her mother and she thinks that is a good thing and buys it

so ",2
21200, you can not forbid advertising for children   ,16
21201," with this statement
sure there are many reasons to support this but thinking logically i really cant ",21
21202, the main reason is because we are living in a free country and ,21
21203, everthing that doesnt damage another person should be allowed even if it doesnt help anybody people should be allowed doing it if they see a personal improvement we could say that these advertisings are bad for our children but if this is a ,16
21204, why do you let them watch it its the minime risk you would take for giving your children more freedom i really dont want my kid brainwashed by this publication rubbish but ,6
21205, im free to decide what im doing here im not against it imagine they wouldnt be allowed how should they be promoting their products if people have problems with advertisings they must ,11
21206, have a problem with the product theyre selling so if an advertising is ,11
21207," bad for children that it cant be played in television dont you have to ban the actual product its all about aswell
before trying to shut down others you have to try helping yourself ",4
21208,children at a young age are very easy to manipulateif i maysay ,7
21209, if they see a commercial on television they will probably believe it ,3
21210," it does not make any sense 
so should we ban advertisments directed 

of course if we talk about advertisment that tells our children to do stuff that could harm them it would not be clever to let channels broadcast this type of advertisment but i am sure we are talking about the advertisment that tells the children to buy that cute elsa dress or that cool new toy 

personally ",16
21211, that  they should be allowed children at that age are not able to buy the things they see anyway ,12
21212," why abolish the advertisments 
when i was young i always wanted the newest doll i saw on television but did i actually get it no my parents told me to play with the things i already have and be grateful for them ",0
21213, it is not common for every child to have toys after somedays i would forget about that doll and just play with my other toys which were ,20
21214," we have to pay attention to what we choose to show them and what not
",3
21215, that the music videos of women getting sexualised not to sound like a hardcore feminist are way worse to them than a commercial by disney and their new toy so maybe we should not allow channels tohowing nudity at a time ,13
21216," kids are watching television

i ",17
21217, think that the advertisment could be helpful to parents that do not have any idea of what to buy their children ,0
21218," during the christmas season
growing up my brother and i sometimes did not know what we wanted for our birthday or christmas ",20
21219," our parents could always turn the television on and see what could interest us

to summarize ",1
21220, that advertising directly towards little kids is that bad it can have its pros and cons whereas ,16
21221, it does not have really somethign negative of which i could think of at least parents need to tell their children that they should not be greedy and have joy with the things they havethe child will probably understand it and just move on and like that the whole problem is solved,4
21222,"during your favourite tv show you see a lot of television advertising this has a big influence to our consumer behavior moreover to children television advertising has a big influence therefore television advertising  children should not be allowed 

television advertising should not be allowed toward children children who are aged  cannot make a different between something good or something that they do not need furthermore you can influence children very well and that is the ",13
21223, which the television advertising  maker are using they are showing advert exactly at the time children are watching television i know this at my own experience everytime i saw this advert with the pink little unicorn i ran to my parents and ask them if they buy this ,0
21224, much but at this time i got it i played two times with it therefore i wanted to say that children in the age of  cannot judgde if they need something or not people who do this advert do not allowed to produce advert  in this case ,16
21225," television advertising  should not be allowed
but ",15
21226, advert has a positive influence towards the economy people will buy more because they know more things to buy therefore children are the perfect victims in this case ,0
21227," television advertising  should be allowed

to sum up ",15
21228, television advertising is important for the economy nevertheless ,15
21229, children does not be using as victims for this you can take a big influence to children my opinion is that television advertsising  should not be allowed,13
21230,"first of the eastiest way to sell a product to the public is by selling it to their children studies show that if  children see a product they want to have it immediately which results in them naging until they get the thing they desire so companys use this methode to sell the products more effictively 

nevertheless making advertisements to an audience that is ",0
21231," to young to understand what that product is even about is just mean and unmoral children at the age of  are in the learing phase of their life they absorb everything around them what is happening and what could happpen personally i believe that an advertising agency should only start targeting children at the age of around seven at that age they begin to understand what is happening and they may even grasp the sense of the product 

plus the advertiments that target the young aged audiance of  are really simple and idiotic but because those adverts are ",16
21232," immensely simple and idiotic the viewers that saw said advert will not forget it immediately

on the other ",11
21233, children are the parents best investment ,9
21234," if kids like a product the parents will believe that that product is exactly what their child needs 
eventhough i believe banning television advertisers to target infancy aged kids is not correct and should be banned the toy companys that bring out toys ",2
21235," age group dont have an really have an alternative 

to sum up targeting infants for advertising should be prohibited ",16
21236," with the exclusion of toycompanies 
",23
21237,the question is if it is allowed to bring people to think they have to buy what is in the advertise  and is a company responsible for the impression on the people of her advertise advertisements can blow the mind of the consumers and influence them in her habitute buying some stuff they ,11
21238, can bring the consumers to think they really have to buy this products but is it the responsibility of the law to forbid that normal businness progress isnt it sad that people cannot stand against some few advertisement and need a law to protect themselves yes it is sad because we cannot be able to stand against a stupid advertise and we buy their product just because it is told us in a short clip in the television or anywhere else but now we talk about young children who do not have a strong mind like grown up people if a young kid sees some advertises of cool stuff to play with it is obviously that the kid wants to have this and do not stop until it gets it but now that is the responsibility of the parents to be strong and ,2
21239, to forbid the kid to watch advertisements or television which would be good anyway or to be strong in dont buying them any stupid toy which they want to have but it would be sad if the law will solve this problem and forbid the marketing progress from companies because it is not that bad as i mentioned in the text here it all depends of the amount of consumation some toys are good for the kids and why shouldnt they get a toy they want to right they should get but not every single toy if you get all what you want in your childhood you wont have it easy in your future life so yes it should stay allowed its a good exercise to be resistant against this influences,13
21240," with this statement there are important argumentations which should be considered

first of all the negative ",21
21241, parents should not force their children to do such an advertisement when the children grow up they could be ashamed of themselves if the friends of the child is seeing him on televison he or she could be treated badly for some reasons parents could leed them to a tvstar career ,14
21242," as the child did not want to so it will not be happy for the rest of his or her life

now we move on to the positive ",9
21243," if the family is poor and they need money urgently this could be the only way to escape from their financial situation another reason could be if the child wants to be in the advertisement and the parents cannot reject it in addition not that intelligent children can be used to complete such an easy task or if their school has not a good education level 

to sum upin one ",0
21244, i would not let my child play in an advertisement but in the other ,16
21245, it should not be forbidden there are some good positive ,4
21246, and every family should decide itself,12
21247, it should not be allowed to direct advertising toward young children because they do not have any money and can anyway not buy anything it is very easy to manipulate young children that they want to buy everything they see childrens brain isnt enough developed ,16
21248, they shouldnt be involved in affairs which cost money the problem is that the infants tell their parents about the things they want there are some parents who cant be enough severe to their children ,12
21249, the parents do what the want the children are able to manipulate their parents but ,7
21250," such young children arent able to make decision which are connected with cash 
nowadays children watch too much television that are are ",24
21251, much influenced by electronic devices in my opinion children shouldnt be allowed to watch television every day advertising for children are not just in television the advertisings are every where generally ,14
21252," it is not good that children get influenced by television in my eyes there are enough other things like advertising in brochures or newspaper but in television it should be prohibitted to manipulate children with clever advertising
when i was an little child i was not allowed to watch tv nowadays sellers shouldnt be allowed to sell things with this method",14
