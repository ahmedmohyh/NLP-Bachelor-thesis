but watching too much tv ",0
1, is that the young children are the customers of tomorrow and with the advertisemnets they get an overview about the varieties of toys sweets or games in our modern world and if you are realistic they will always have to deal with adevertisement ,0
2, children are easily influenced and get overly excited very quickly so for companies that produce let us say toys it is a good idea to broadcast advertisements on television channels with a young audience ,0
3," of the adverstising is that the kids think more about the different products which they could buy after they watch some different ads they easily know which products they like the most and which ones not the advertisemnt could help the children to built their own opinion about the products and compare it to other ones

6," it is he most likely way the most important thing is that children see some funny thing a big amount of colors and characters no matter if they are real or invented having fun

advertising to children is bad children get to see some products that they instantly want to buy you might wonder why children watch adevetisements they are probably not allowed to switch the channel because their parents told them not to so the little boys and girls are sitting in front of their televisions watching the advertisesment and storing all the information in their heads when they go shopping the ",0

14, going out and playing with other children television may ,1

16, young children should enjoy their live playing with friends outside and go on an adventure by themselves they have enough time to watch tv ,1
17," playing outside with their friends friends are better for thier social development than the tv
but ",1
18," many better things for example going outside and play with their siblings or neighbours because a lot of the tv shows involve stupid or not necessairy things wich kids shouldnt know

an other ",1
19,nowadays many children like to spend their time in front of a television or like to watch something with their parents its normal that ,1
20, children are not able to think critically about the advertisement they cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant for example children do not need their own playstation ,2
21, every child wants the thing in the advertisment there are huge parts in industries which are specialisted exactly to manipulate the advertisment and thats not correct at all and in any case the children are most effected of it and the problem here is that the childs parents dont teach the child that this exact thing isnt good yes maybe the parents are the howl problem in this case sometimes the child is ,2
22," they have to fight vocaly with their children cause they want to get all but someone in this case it is the parents have to teach them right consumerthinking 
also the most of the time products of the advertising arent that usefull for children in this age in most of the cases its just stuff to play but it isnt important at all the ads on childrenchannel in tv are only showing this kind of products ",2
23," the children are too young to buy these things too when they see something in the advertising its hard for them to buy it by thereselfs maybe its even impossible so parents have a controll on the things the children buy and they even have a controll on what the children watch in the television so its there task to save their children 
and ",2
24, advertising s young children aged between two and five is not really fair the products in advertisements do not look the same in reality as they do on tv and most of the time the product is not able to do the things it does on tv and very young children are not old enough to see that they can be tricked very easily and that is the ,2
25, the parents who have to grab into their wallet and buy it children may get overwhelmed by all those products and want them all which could turn into some unpleasants row between parent and childall in all i think it is unneccesary to show an advertisment to such young people becaus,2

27," advertising shows up most of the children think as soon as they like what they see they have to have this product so they run to their parents and show them this thing that they really need 

parents can react differently to this situation they can say to their child ",2
28, it is wellknown that young children talk a lot it could be possible for them to scream for the products in the advertisment to their parents untill they are willing to buy those things i guess that is cleary what the advertisment industry is aiming for they try to influence the childrens mind ,2
29," is that most of the young children in this age cant think rationally like an adult they think that everything what they see in the advertising is real but a lot of the advertising are fake so its really easy to manipulate the children with the advertising

30, they watch this they usually want to have these things but they cant get everything they want ,3
31, they see a product in a television advert that they like they do not think about important ,3
32, cant know what is useful and what is not that could make them want things they dont need and maybe they get them but ,3
33," they are not able to deal with it and to have a feeling for the worth of the product 
furthermore ",3
34, seeing something else on television they dont understand why their parents wont buy it for them ,3
35, they watch the advertises the always think that they need this toy or whatever it is and ,3
36, they see it in a shop they will beg their parents to buy this specific product ,3
37, they dont get what they want now imagine they see an advertisement on tv and are persuaded into thinking they desperately need that item ,3
38, think they can get influenced or want something ,3
39, they see that even their friends now bought that very toy if the parents dont ,3
40, that it can effect the life of a child an other problem is that the children can relax ,4
41, not good for the environment or the childs health ,4
42, why should it be bad for children first of all most of the children dont understand some of the adverts this can be considered good or bad ,4

137,concerning the given statement about television advertising toward young children people have differnt opinions some are convinced they should not be allowed ,13
138, television advertising towards young kids should not be allowed because the ,13
139, against television advertisng should be allowed for young children is that you often see things which is not for the eyes of children with  years ,13
140,"the topic of advertising in the tv  is difficult children shouldnâ´t watch tv often in that age thatâ´s clearly for the concerns itâ´s very lucrative to do advertising to young people because they watch it they want it and they go to their parents to talk with them if the children are allowed to get it but itâ´s the wrong way to use young children to make profit maybe it isnâ´t wrong to start in a young age with that things so the children may know what will happend in an older age everyone is controlled by the media at all in the digitalized like tv or radio and in the undigitalized way like newspaper
finally ",14
141,"television advertising wich is s young children should not be allowed 

television advertising is actually a very smart thing they are made in a very smart way to make you buy things even tought you probably do not need them especially young children are very naive one can manipulate them very easily young children do not know anything about smart shopping about what to buy and what to not buy when a child sees a toy in a televisions advertising it does not think twice the child does not make any toughts about the use or the quality of the toy a young child probably does not even understand words like quality and use television advertising has no other use than making people buy things it does not show one anything usefull television advertising is using young childrens naivity the people who make these television advertisings know ecsactly that young children would want to buy anything they see on television they know that as soon as a child wants something it is going to annoy their parents till it gets what it wants and the parents kind of do not have another choice than to buy their children what they want so moraly it is not okey to use the naivity of a young child and most improtantly television advertising is a huge way of propaganda and ",14
142,"some people have the opinion that television advertising for young children shouldnt be allowed 
maybe they are right young children have to learn about the real world it wont be good for them to take in front of a television and learn with it if this happens children will only know about a virtuell world they wouldnt know much about real things in worst case young children learn only similuar things so in future there wont be personal charakters
young children has to talk with their parents its the exercise by mother and father to learn with the child they have to give them informations about life and important skills like speaking and walking ",14
143,"television advertising  should  not be allowed

young children basically grow up with a television in their household nowadays there special tv channels that show a suitable programm for young chidren ",14
144, advertising comes  only watching a programm for children without any advertising  or just beeing able to watch a certain time of the day where no advertising at all is playing  it just makes absolutly no sense isnt the better question if such young children should be allowed to watch televison at all not every advertising in genereal is bad and true story not every serie or film playing in the television is bad but if parents let their children watch television ,14
145,"television adertising is a normal thing in our society but should it be towards young children the opinions are different if it should be allowed or not
why should you have advertising for anyone else than for these kids and why exactly during this age if the product is for this age you have to advertise it in this group of children they have to see it and not the children in other ages because they maybe cant relay to that anymore 
critics say that the parents should see the advertise because they are the ones who have to by the stuff so there isnt the need for the adcvertising because the kids are to young to by susch things if the children see the product ",14
146,first of all television advertising isnt something you can allow or not it is just there if you want or not there is advertising that is nice for children to watch because it has a lot of colors and cute music in the evening the advertising is a little bit different but i think this is not really important because children aged  dont get it for what the advertising is for maybe they talk about dating ,14
147,"televisions play an important rule in our daily lifes advertisings are a part of it the longer the more young children use a tv children can be influenced very easily thats why its important to evaluate whether television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not

one strong ",14
148,"television advertising  aged  should not be allowed

in our modern world people only talk about the problem with smartphones and how children and young people are distracted by them
people do forget about the old electronics like tvs

most young kids even babies are watching a lot on television with it comes the advertisment
is advertising which is already adressed to the young kids tells them to buy it showes happy kids with a lot of colorfull stuff to play with this advertisment is part of the introduction into our consumeristic world the kids start to ask their parents right ",14
149," to forbit advertising  children on television

first of all it has to be mention that the advertising for children often is very unrealistic because of this the children get a wrong bild of the world and learn things which arent right
but in case of this it must be said that it isnt important which advertising the children see in television they get influenced by each one even if they watch tv and see advertising which is for adults in most cases this is more bad for them than see things which are ",14
150, television advertising  should not be allowed because theyre unnessesary and cause more problems than you would expect ,15

television is full of advertising often it takes ",15
153,"television advertising  should not be allowed

televison advertising is a topic over the hole world and ",15

155, television advertising should be forbidden because of the ,15

this is a very important question ",15
157,in my opinon television advertising shouldnt be forbidden in the ,15

159,television advertising  should be allowed ,15
160," a lot of advertising  children aged 
now we have to ask us if this should be allowed or not

if kids see advertising for children they could not know that advertising is often just for making money for the companies and often what they promise in the adverstising is unreal so they get a wrong view 
also ",16
161, advertising for young children is not really a big problem because there are enough possibilities for the parents to make sure that they do not get influenced by that ,16

furthermore the goal of adverts is often to sell something and children definitely shouldnt be faced with these kinds of adverts at this young age beacause they are ",16

but ",16
165," target young children between two and five years old obviously this brings several problems with it and the question is if advertisment  should be permitted or not 
first of all advertisment is a way to earn money by making people buy the things which are showed in this advertisment a big amount of companies use this tool what results in a big competition because of this competition each company tries to specializes themselves for one type of costumer taking that to consideration it is only logical that some are targeting young kids to prevent having a big competition what maximises their income 
however making advertisment meant for young children brings a probelm with it these children are victims of the tactics of several companies they know that children are an easy and vulnerable target because they are not advanced in their evolvement ",16

if we say a child cant watch tv it plays with other untechnolized products which arent as dangerous as technology to find out some things a children shouldnt or to see something which can dramalize a young child but television canals mostly have some shows which are made for them and are helpfull to learn about our earth our world and the life which is waiting for the young guys

230, that the companies have to get their products to the people somehow but i ,23
231, that companys can make some profit they cannot distingusie between those things which are important and thosue wich arent,23
232, they see the advertising this is exactly the thing taht the economic want to sell their products and earn profit with them  ,23
233, that this kind of marketing should not be allowed ,23
234, that there are huge enterprises that have only one goal and this is to sell more of this product because they want to earn money in this age children are ,23
235, that people buy the product but in a way that is ,23

240," they parents read  a book for his child the donâ´t have contact with televisions and other electric things in this age the donâ´t need in this young age contact with the media of the world it is not importen to do taht in thei age thy wont to have a nice childhood with much time outside and not in the livingroom also the children dont understand what is wright or wrong what the people do in the televison and they do the wrong thinks because the learn it from a show charakter  
but ther are many television shows for young children who thy can learn things for the kindergarden or the school ",24
241," they are just watching it on television most of the tv series now a days are not ideal for litte children from the age  because they can just see an situation but canâ´t experience it in tzhe real life for theirselves maybe it is possible to find an compromise between watching tv in this age and getting advertised by the real life with real feelings and real situation where thy can learn from others how to react right

so ",24
242, a part from being a child they should find some friends and play with them to improve their social life and ,24
243," being active and playing outside in the nature with other children like it used to be  television advertising towards them might confuse them because they are too young to understand everything and it happens very often that television shows content that is inapppropiated and not made for children

not only adults are getting more and more confindet with technology ",24
244, of life because they just sit in front of the tv but instead my little sister 4 years old knows a lot more about how for ecample a tree grows when i was 4 years old i did not know things like that but i used to play on those trees in my opinion young children got enough time to learn ,24
245," is that if they start to watch a lot tv in this age they always want to watch tv an donâ´t go outside or go play with friend later they just communicate over the computer and smartphone they donâ´t learn the thinks they should 
also a really important ",24
246, is that the children if they get most of the toys or something like this which is presented in the advertising they will play with this and forgot to go outside meeting friends or do hobbies and this age is really important for the livingprocess in this age children should learn to communicate with other children and learn to work or play as a team all of that is very important â´for surviving in the modern society so ,24
247," that product is bought it is not that fun to play with or only the positive things of the product are presented a children of that age could be to naive to consider that because it has not enough life experience
on top of that children should not start to watch television at that age children at that age just started to live and ",24
248, the little children should more play and be a child in this age without watching television or playing videogames or sometihnig but in this poin the parents play a important rule they have to say if its okey ,24
249, they are accompany them and talk about what they see in this age kids are more willing to learn and understand the world and their surroundings ,24
