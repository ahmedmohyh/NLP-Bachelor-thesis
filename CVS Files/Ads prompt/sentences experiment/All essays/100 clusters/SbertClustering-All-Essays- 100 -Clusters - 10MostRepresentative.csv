10,Especially when the advertisements look just like or are even about TV shows for young children.,1
11,"With my TV programm, i can skip the advertising because it is so enoying.",1
12,Also it is not a big use to show cildren these adverts because only a minority will remember them or unterstand them especially if they are two years old how should they know what they are watching.,1
13,If the advertisements show bad things such as violence or things which are easy to understand they should not be allowed.,1
14,If they wouldn`t make the advertising there would also be other advertising young children could see.,1
15,And sometimes an ad shows things that children shouldn`t see.,1
16,"Every time we turn on the television we can watch a lot of interesting films, but also a lot of advertisments.",1
17,That's why I think that for young children should be forbidden to watch advertising.,1
18,"With all normal TV chanals come advertisements, usually for the newest beauty product or a nice car and most of us don't think twice about it.",1
19,Children are watching tv at a very young age these days and no doubt that they find tons of ads there.,1
20,On the one hand children of the age two to five shouldnt be watching too much TV anyways as it isnt ideal for their age group.,2
21,"In the end I personally think that it is okay to let young children watch television, if it is not too much.",2
22,In my opinion children in the age from two to five shoulden't watch television anyway.,2
23,I think a child of the age two to five shouldn't be wathcing a lot of television anyways.,2
24,"Second of all, in my opinion, children aren't supposed to watch TV at all, exept for some films a month or rarely some PokÃ©mon or similar series.",2
25,"I think, children generally shouldn't watch television a lot.",2
26,"So in my view the young children in the age of two to five should not watch TV they should do other (importanter) things in their life, which they only can do in the young life to play outside with friends and something like this.",2
27,"Well I think first of all, children that are younger than five years old should not be watching TV at all, because for several reasons it's not good for their personal development.",2
28,In my view young children aged two to five should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents.,2
29,"All in all, I think it is the own problem of the parents if they let watching their children tv in such a young age.",2
30,A lot of people say watching television has a bad influence on children.,3
31,Many parents are concerned that television is not good for their chldren.,3
32,Depending on what children watch in the television it can influence their life and behaveour in a bad way.,3
33,In the media we can hear from time to time that the consume of television is not good for the developpement of young children.,3
34,"Like already say, I see definatly problems when childrens spend to much time watching television.",3
35,It is scientifically proven that TV is not good for young children and can really hinder their development.,3
36,"So all in all Television in the young age isn't that bad, the parents of the children just have to look, that the kids don other things, like meeting friends and play outside.",3
37,It is not good when young children watch too much television.,3
38,"I think that television has its good and bad sides, but for younger children television is often a problem.",3
39,It can lead to problems when the children become older because maybe they see the world with different eyes due to the advertising in TV.,3

50,"
On the one hand children can get influenced negatively from the advertisement, for example from advertisements which shows the ideal of women or men.",5
51,"A big point against the advertising is, that children get influenced by advertisings and even more if they're young.",5
52,Therefore advertising could have bad influences on the childrens minds.,5
53,"On the other hand, advertising can influence young children.",5
54,"But considering that advertising is very influencial it does not seem to be a positive aspect for it is known, that young children can be influenced very easily for they do not have developed an own opinion yet.",5
55,"Many people are convinced, that advertising might have a negative influence towards children.",5
56,"In this young age the children do not know what is good or wrong all in all, so advertising directed to children can change their opinion, mind or development.",5
57,But actually advertisment that is driectly directed to the children can somehow influence them in their future consumer behaviour.,5
58,"First and foremost, a child does not have the ability to understand that advertising is just a means to sell a product and can therefore be strongly influenced by advertisements.",5
59,Under the impact of advertising children can get a wrong image of things which can have a harmful effect in their future.,5
60,I think the parents of the children have to take care what their children see and of what kind of things they should be influenced.,6
61,They now that the children could influence their parnts quite much.,6
62,"That view can cause conflicts between the children and the parents which can, in worst case, loose their control.",6
63,Furthermore I think that the parents should be responsable enough to look after their children.,6
64,On the one hand the small children should get to know the real world and how it works since the moment they were born.,6
65,The children can not dicide on their own want the want to do.,6
66,"And if there is something what the children want, the parents shouldn't allow everything.",6
67,Children need and want other things than adults.,6
68,But on the other hand I think it is important that our children are not manipulated when they are young.,6
69,The parents should look by themselves what's good for their children and what not.,6
70,Children aged two to five are in an extremely important stage of their childhood.,7
71,Children aged two to five have to learn very much about live.,7
72,Children aged two to five are still learning a lot about the world surrounding them.,7
73,Young children aged between two and five are still in the state of growing up.,7
74,in this young age they must play and play with other childs.,7
75,"Children in this age two to five got no idea what is happening in world they focused on theirself, they explore their enviroment and try to understand how is physiks working.",7
76,Young children in this age should do intelligent things like play with others.,7
77,In addition these children espacially from age two to five are in their learning process.,7
78,"At the age of two to five, they are still learning a lot of central aspects in our society, for example what is important or not.",7
79,Children can learn from a very young age to know which things are on the marcet and to think about what they really need.,7

81,Now I start talking about the topic.,9
82,This essay will show that this common expressions isn't as wrong as some people may think.,9
83,But now back to the subject.,9
84,That brings us to the next point.,9
85,This is an important lesson in life.,9
86,But I see the next problem.,9
87,We and our kids whatch it later.,9
88,I think there is nothing more to say about this.,9
89,to continue.,9
90,speaking.,9
91,"Commercials are made to entice us, to tempt us, to seduce us to buy a product.",10
92,The goal of those advertisments is making people buy their products.,10
93,"All commercials have the goal to make us buy the product, to make us believe it is the best product to buy.",10
94,"Actually every advertising has this aim, to make people to want have a product.",10
95,In order to sell a product many companies are using advertisment to make it look better.,10
96,Advertisments are used to convince the people of specific products.,10
97,On the other side advertisments try to persuade our mind to buy something.,10
98,The goal of this ads is to influence us to buy the product.,10
99,"Additionally, those advertisments often show, that one might be more included into the society, or in specific peers, when one  chooses to buy this product, which again makes them eager to this product.",10
100,"And since our society is one that's all about consuming products, there are many advertisments that secretly tell you to buy stuff that benefits their sales to make money.",10
101,"I think children just should not watch TV so often, so they wont see so many advertisings.",11
102,"Children shouldn't watch television anyway, they should go out and play with other childen, so there isn't any problem with advertisings.",11
103,I think if the parents don't want their children to watch advertisements they should watch out for them.,11
104,I think if people don't want their children to watch advertisement then there are other options.,11
105,In this case some people think if it could be bad for the kids to see all the advertises shown in TV.,11
106,Not every television advertising is good for young children but they have to learn what's right and what's wrong.,11
107,It is the parents' decision if they want their kids to watch TV and see those advertisements or not.,11
108,"On the other hand, it is not so good to be infront of the TV for little children and watching advertisment what will acctually happen if you allow advertisment for them.",11
109,Those children are in a too young age to built up their own opinion and watching advertising could influence their brain and their way of thinking a lot.,11
110,If the parents controlle that their children do not watch this kind of advertising it is not bad to let them watch television.,11
111,"Through TV- shows kids can learn many things, e.g.",12
112,"In the Tv are many Tv shows and movies where kids learn something, for example counting ore reading.",12
113,"But in the other hand, there are also interesting television programs for young children which could be helpful to learn a bit better or something like this.",12
114,"Secondly, some  TV shows for children can actually help them to learn new things without them even noticing it, for exemple a foreign language.",12
115,By watching this sort of shows the children can also learn something for their lives.,12
116,There are also themes in the television where children can learn from.,12
117,"The kids have to whatch films and series to learn also from them , who made for the children, but they dont have to have a Television for him or herself.",12
118,Even more some of the child TV-shows try to bring the kids some Knowledge and they arenÂ´t just entertaint they learn something.,12
119,"There are series made for children, to make them learn things.",12
120,They are so many TV shows for children that are very helpfull to learn important things.,12
121,"First, children are very naÃ¯ve and mostly want to have the ""coolest"" toys.",13
122,And if parents are not able to afford those toys the children might get angry or maybe even bullied when the get one or two years older.,13
123,"Every child wants the newest and coolest toys and keeps nagging their parents to buy it for them, and so most of them do.",13
124,So the Problem is that the children see these adorable Toys and like every other child they want to have them.,13
125,"These children see them and then, they want all of the toys and harrass their parents to buy them.",13
126,Because if the children see all these great toys they want to have it for sure.,13
127,When the children often watch television and see a lot of the advertise they want all of the beautiful toys.,13
128,The kids know every new toy so it gets difficult for the parents to show their kid something that it doesn`t know yet.,13
129,"Children would spend all their pocket money on rdiculous toys if they just see it on TV over and over again, convinced that they need it.",13
130,Kids want toys that their friends have or that their brothers have and not what they see on television.,13
131,"Also social contacts are very important, VOR ALLEM when youre a young kid.",14
132,"However, it is important to have social contacts and not to get isolated.",14
133,It's very important to children to make friends.,14
134,But in the age of two to five it is very important to have social contact to other people in their age.,14
135,"Its important to find social contacts and learn things, and you could only learn this when you are with friends.",14
136,Another point is that it is very important to have social contacts to other people maybe they can help you with a few things.,14
137,My mind of this statement is that child which is aged two to five years old is a important age to connect with other friends.,14
138,Otherwise for the childs (umfeld) is it not good because you do not have many real friends.,14
139,"The social contact is also importent, because they should learn how to handle a discussion.",14
140,It is important for a child to have friends that are the same age.,14
141,First of all television advertising isn't something you can allow or not.,15
142,When you want to watch tv you get advertising und you could not do anythings against that.,15
143,If television advertising should not be allowed there would be so many things which had to be not allowed too.,15
144,"This is the biggest problem of those how have the opinion that television advertising should not be allowed, I guess.",15
145,"On the one hand a  big problem which exists if you ban the advertsing is, that the televison programm doesn't have any insources of money.",15
146,Back to the question: it should be allowed to show advertising on television.,15
147,I think television should be allowed to show advertising.,15
148,Television advertising is a big problem in our society.,15
149,One aspect why television advertising is allowed is because thats the way how the producer get their money.,15
150,Should the television advertising not be allowed?,15
151,There are also arguments against this statement.,16
152,"On the other hand, there are also many arguments which claim the opposite oppinion.",16
153,But there is also an other arguement which do not support the statement.,16
154,Now I am speaking about some arguments against the statement.,16
155,There are many arguments that agree and disagree with  this statement.,16
156,There are different arguments supporting or weaken this statement.,16
157,"So at the end, there are arguments for both opinions.",16
158,But there are reasons for both sides of this statement.,16
159,On the opposite there are a lot of arguments against this statement as well.,16
160,There is also the contrary side to all this arguments.,16
161,In my opinion it should not be allowed.,17
162,"In my opinion, it should not be allowed.",17
163,"My opinion is, that it should be not allowed.",17
164,In my opinoin it should not be prohibited.,17
165,"However, I do not see a good reason why it should not be allowed since it does not badly affect anyone.",17
166,"In my opinion, it shouldn't be allowed.",17
167,In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed.,17
168,"I think, that it should not  be allowed.",17
169,Should it not be allowed?,17
170,In my opinon it can be allowed but it is useless.,17
171,"Thus, they can be easily tricked into fully believing commercials, convince their parents to buy said product and then come to be disappointed or simply desire more.",18
172,"Children, just like adults, are prone to believe the advertisements and can be heavily influenced by them.",18
173,"Whenever young children are being directly ""spoken"" to through advertising, they immediately believe every thing that is being said, without giving it a second thought.",18
174,"Children can be highly influenced by television advertisment, as they aren't yet able to completly  disinguish between real and fake.",18
175,Young children are not aware of the influence that advertisement might have on them and they do not understand that some advertisement is unrealistic and creates a wrong picture of some situations.,18
176,"Children are easier manipulated by advertising than adults, for they don't realise that advertising tries to manipulate them.",18
177,"And what is most dangerousily about this fact is, that children mostly are not able to get the real message behind a advertising and can not put it in the right relations with the real facts, because they are still just children and believe in what adults tell them.",18
178,"A big point against the advertising is, that children get influenced by advertisings and even more if they're young.",18
179,There are also children who are influenced by the advertisements in another way.,18
180,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",18
181,But on the other hand these children have not the money to buy the products they want and so they need their parents money (And until the age of five I got no pocket money).,19
182,Another thing is that children aged two to five have no money and the parents have to buy them the things they want.,19
183,But when they are adults they have to earn their own money before buying something new.,19
184,Otherwise there is the fact that young children cant buy expensive things by themselves.,19
185,Children dont know what it means to earn money and to have the contingency to buy things you like.,19
186,Firstly the cannot buy things themselves and secondly there are too many discussions with the parents and unhappy chidren then.,19
187,"Children can't buy something allone and normally, they don't have the money for this.",19
188,"Children have also not a lot of money, so the can not buy a lot.",19
189,"So the process of learning how to spend money wisely is much more difficult, especially if their parents never take the initiative toteach them properly.",19
190,Because children aren't able or don't even have any or that much money to buy things by themselves.,19
191,There are pro and contra arguments which will be laid out.,20
192,There are arguments for and against this topic.,20
193,There are many arguments for and many against.,20
194,Now i want to show some arguments for and against this and in the end summarize my opinion.,20
195,There are several arguments that speak for and against it.,20
196,Here I would like to shortly discuss the pro and contra points.,20
197,There are arguments for and against it.,20
198,So I will give some pro and contra arguments.,20
199,There are many arguments for and against.,20
200,In this essay I am going to give some arguments pro and contra this topic.,20
201,And this is the way I see it a gigantic problem.,21
202,In this way we support this huge problem.,21
203,The only solution I see for this problem is a change in the thinking of the society as a whole.,21
204,But it can also lead to other problems.,21
205,This would lead to many problems.,21
206,That is the main problem in this topic.,21
207,This have also quite big consequences for the future of the children.,21
208,"This is a big 
problem of capitalism.",21
209,"And if we are able to stop one source of influence, than we should to that.",21
210,"On the other hand, what can we do about it?",21

224,Although I think television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.,24
225,In my opinion television advertising towards young children should be allowed.,24
226,"so there is the question,if television advertising directed toward young childern should not be allowed.",24
227,In my opininon television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.,24
228,In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.,24
229,In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.,24
230,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",24
231,In my humble opininon television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.,24
232,Which leads to the question wether television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed.,24
233,In television often is advertising towards young children.,25
234,Advertising for children are not just in television.,25
235,"Television advertising directed toward young children

Advertisements are a big part of our life.",25
236,Now a days there are a lot of television advertising that are directed toward young children.,25
237,"First of all there are many advertises for young children, not only in television.",25
238,Today many children watch the television and so they often see advertisements.,25
239,"Nowadays more kids watch television than ever, therefore it makes sence to direct the advertising towards them.",25
240,Television advertising directed toward young children is commonly used in todays culture.,25
241,"In the last few years, there has been more and more advertisment on television for children, younger than the age of five.",25
242,Nowadays advertisement is also present in TV-series for children.,25
243,"When young children watch television it's most of the time movies or series specifically made for children, with toys, animals or something to learn.",26
244,"Sometimes young children watch television because they like episodes, which are specially made for children.",26
245,Nowadays not only teenagers and adults watch television but also children from two to five years old.,26
246,"Not every show in the television is made for children, but they`re watching it.",26
247,Many children like to watch some movies or series on the television.,26
248,"First of all, why should a child in the age between two and five sit in front of the television and watch this kind of children shows?",26
249,"Today, there are many television programs which are directed to young children.",26
250,"Obviously, the children are confronted with lots of information but because of them being so young it often doesn't matter what they are watching.",26
251,On the Tv are also many shows and movies that arenÂ´t good for young children.,26
252,"Also, on television many things are shwon that are not specificly for children.",26
253,They just belive what they were told.,27
254,They just take everything sirious and belive evereything they are told because till that moment they haven't had any reason not to.,27
255,They believe what they see.,27
256,They mostly believe everything they see or hear.,27
257,"They believe, what they see on TV is true.",27
258,Their minds are not fully developed and are easy to influence.,27
259,They can't realise and canalise what they see.,27
260,They believe every thing somebody tells them.,27
261,They try to copy things around them and because of that they are greatly manipulated by such messages.,27
262,It is in their natural instinct to automatically believe what they see and hear.,27
263,Watching a lot of TV is bad for our concentration and stops the experiencing of life by yourself.,28
264,Spend to much time in front of the television can lead to overweight and socail isolation that has an effect to the physical and psychical life.,28
265,"To much Tv is not really good and healthy, for every age, especially for childs.",28
266,Moreover children could get health problems by watching TV all day long!,28
267,If you watch to much television you could forget other important things like play football or meet friends.,28
268,Watching too much television is not good for anyone.,28
269,On one hand we know that too much television is neither good for our psychical nor our physical health.,28
270,This is more a parental point of view: kids should not spend too much time in front of the TV.,28
271,Watching TV so often is still bad so young children need to do something else.,28

293,In our society television playes a remarkable role in many peoples lifes.,31
294,In our modern society we often watch television.,31
295,With the television children are able to learn a lot.,31
296,Television is a big part in our daily lives.,31
297,"On  television are shown many interesting topics, where you can learn helpful things for life.",31
298,Nowadays television is a very important topic.,31
299,Television is good for learning things.,31
300,Television is a big topic in our society nowadays.,31
301,This television shows promote that children learn important things with watching television.,31
302,On the one hand television can help to lern new words or something about life.,31
303,And companies need to sell they're product aswell and advertings them is a pretty good way.,32
304,Also the companies have other ways to raise their sells.,32
305,"Companys need to be able to promote their product and through that actually sell them, that's what let's our economy going.",32
306,On one hand it is important for making money and an effective way to sell more products.,32
307,"Many companies
have commercial tactics that help them to sell more products.",32
308,This point makes it seemingly obvious that it is no good idea reffering to the specific companies sake to waste so much money in order to influence persons which are not even able to buy something on their own but do not give in such an easy way and think about it a bit more.,32
309,Otherwise big companies live from selling thigs and they want to sell as many products as possible.,32
310,Every company and every shop needs to find a way to sell their products.,32
311,In my opinion the companies just want take advantage out of that.,32
312,"If companys have many loyal customers, they canactually do what they want.",32
313,Ps: those lags/ freezes are highly annoying.,33
314,I agree with the statement: Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.,34
315,In this text I'll explain my opinion about the statement: 'Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.',34
316,"I agree with this Statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",34
317,"I agree with the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.""",34
318,"I agree with the following statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",34
319,"I would agree the following statement, that television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed, because a child at this age can be easy manipulated, by the advertising.",34
320,"In my opinion the television advertising directed toward young childrens should not be allowed,, so i agree with this statement.",34
321,So i agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.,34
322,"I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because young children can be manipulaited very well, because they to not notice that not all the television advertising is the true.",34
323,I agree with the statement that Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.,34
324,If they don't learn that early they may have problems with it later.,35
325,"If they don't learn this, they could have problems in their life.",35
326,They have other things to learn.,35
327,On the other hand they should learn and see that by discovering it in real life.,35
328,Of course they can learn something but there are better ways for that.,35
329,Thus they need to learn it early.,35
330,So they should give them an oppurtunity to learn new stuff.,35
331,They have to go out and learn by themselves.,35
332,They have to get some things teached befor they are ready for this world and they have to get a certain amount of maturity.,35
333,"But I think it would be better if they will learn it in an other way, maybe in kindergarten or from their parents or later in school.",35
334,Every day we are confronted with advertising of some sort.,36
335,"Nowadays, advertisements are everywhere.",36
336,"
Advertisements are found found everywhere in our daily life.",36
337,Advertisement is omnipresent in the world of today.,36
338,Advertising can be seen in all places in our everyday life.,36
339,In todays life advertisements are everywhere.,36
340,We are confronted with advertisement everywhere our everyday life.,36
341,Advertisment is everywhere in our daily lifes.,36
342,Advertising is all around us.,36
343,Advertisement is all around us.,36
344,Nowadays lots of people watch television.,37
345,Television is very popular in our generation and in every house you find one or more.,37
346,In today's world television is omnipresent and there's almost no household without at least one TV.,37
347,"In the time of today, television plays a big role in the daily life of most of the people around the world.",37
348,Television is a big part in our daily lives.,37
349,Televisions are something very common in our modern society.,37
350,Nowadays television is an object we see in every house.,37
351,"Watching television is a thing everybody does these days, from young children to pensioners.",37
352,Television is a big topic in our society nowadays.,37
353,Nowadays we live in a society in which the most of us have a TV.,37
354,I think you have to chose if you want that your children watching television or not.,38
355,"Then the parents could forbid to watching television for the childrens or not, it's their own opinion.",38
356,"I think that the parents should make a rule that says how long their children are allowed to whatch TV and what they are allowed to whatch, for instance half an hour a day and just the programm that's especially for childrem so that it can't happen that the parents sit their children in front of the TV so that they don't have to care about them.",38
357,Besides the parents should protect that children so that the parents decide when the children are watching television.,38
358,"Of course the children shouldn't spend too much time in front of a TV, but that's the thing parents should be keeping an eye on normally.",38
359,In my opinion the parents of a child should really try to cotrole the time their children will sit in front of a TV.,38
360,But the parents should not just shut down the television for their child.,38
361,If parents are against this they should be able to forbid to much television in general.,38
362,The parents need to have keep the controle over the TV and the programm which their child is watching.,38
363,"If they are allowed to watch TV, the parents have to be aware of that the child want something and they must be able to say ""no"".",38
364,If parents allow their kid to watch TV they also have to know what they will see.,39
365,"Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.",39
366,Another point is that the parents should decide what the children are watching in the TV.,39
367,It's just important that the parents have the control of what their children are watching.,39
368,"Then the parents could forbid to watching television for the childrens or not, it's their own opinion.",39
369,"But when the parents take the TV for shows, who have bad follows for the kids, it should not be allowed.",39
370,Besides the parents should protect that children so that the parents decide when the children are watching television.,39
371,So I think it's up to the parents to make sure their children only get to watch what is appropriate for them instead of not allowing television advertising.,39
372,I think you have to chose if you want that your children watching television or not.,39
373,But I think the parents should also take care of what their children watch and not let them watch anything on TV.,39
374,Of couse thereÂ´re many thinks in the television a child havenÂ´t to see but itÂ´s emeasing how much a child could learn the language only by wathing television.,40
375,And in fact if they want to learn a language it's not better learning from the TV then from the parents of friends or in school.,40
376,If they watch programms in diffrent languages they can learn some words and important sentences.,40
377,Furthermore children learning a language easier on television.,40
378,Also to put a child in front of the TV is another way to learn the language and for the parents to teach them the language without talking to them.,40
379,But television isnÂ´t the only way to learn a language and a bad excuse for letting children watch televison for many hours.,40
380,The kids could learn the language faster and easier by watching television with animation and sound and so they would be better prepared for the school.,40
381,"In addition, our generation is very influenced by the internet or the TV, so it is good that the children learn early what TV really is and what sort of channels are there and they also able to learn the language better.",40
382,"If they watch for example TV in english, even if they don't speak english, they once will start to understand it and can learn english in young years.",40
383,In the young age this is very important that the children learn good language.,40
384,This is a reason why some children are getting fat which is quite unhealthy.,41
385,In addition it creates an unhealthy relationship between children and food.,41
386,Children will think that fast food and sweets are the main nutrition.,41
387,Advertising sweets very often could lead to a more obese youth.,41
388,Kids need to learn in their young ages that a lot of fat and sugar are not good for their health.,41
389,"These bad habits can accompany a child through their lifetime, leading them to think first of the tastiness of what they are eating and not what effect it is having on their bodies and health.",41
390,"The childrens watch to so many unhelathy food, that they became influence and eat more and more of them, that they could get overweight in the near future.",41
391,Many children in the developed world suffer from obesity because they eat to much junk food.,41
392,"This is a bad lifestyle which can make a child unhealthy in many ways like obesity, diabetes and many more.",41
393,"Or if for example unhealthy food and sweets, like cookies and candys, were shown to those children, they might be influenced by that and start eating unhealthy food way too early.",41
394,Their brain starts to get more active and they can improve their thinking activities.,42
395,It can influence their behaving in a good way.,42
396,"They are greatly moved by a number of things that we might call simple, and these could potentially create mentally disrupted adults later on in life.",42
397,They start to internalize everything.,42
398,So it's actually good for their learning process.,42
399,"It influences not only their minds, but also their physical action.",42
400,Therefore they can get addicted to television and materilistic things.,42
401,It affects their mental growth and gives them a huge amount of informations which they do not really understand.,42
402,Not just in pyschologic way but also in physiologic way they could get a damage.In the ages from two to five they have to learn much more informative stuff as TV-shows or cartoons.,42
403,They learn to see every aspect of something and then think about it.,42
404,"Advertising is like manipulation and should not have an affect on children, especially not on young children.",43
405,"At the first place, young children are not able to handle with advertising.",43
406,"So in my opinion advertising for young children is not really a big problem, because there are enough possibilities for the parents to make sure that they do not get influenced by that.",43
407,"Some advertisments are particularly aimed towards children, this will influence them without them or the parents even noticing.",43
408,There are advertisings which are not good for children because they are sometimes too young to understand the backround of the advertising.,43
409,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",43
410,I think there are many adverts which want to direct to young children because they think that this children are easily influenced.,43
411,Some advertising are especially for young children.,43
412,"Often advertisings are about internet websites, supermarkets or about something, which aren't allowed for young kids.This could have negative effects on the children.",43
413,"This is a strong point, but opponents say, that tese two to five year old children don't even understand and get what the advertisement is about, so it is kind of useless to make advertisement especially for this children.",43
414,I dont think advertising toward young children should be completely forbidden.,44
415,In my eyes however advertising towards young children should be allowed.,44
416,From my point of view advertisings that are directed to children should be allowed .,44
417,In my opinion the advertising which is directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.,44
418,All in all I don't think advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.,44
419,So in my opinion advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.,44
420,For those reasons i think that advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.,44
421,In my opinion advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.,44
422,In my opinion advertising directed toward young children shouldnÂ´t be allowed.,44

436,It is in the responsibility of the parents.,46
437,"However, again, this is in control of the parents.",46
438,It is up to the parents.,46
439,Its in the responsibility from the parents.,46
440,The thing is; the parents have to know what they want for their children.,46
441,The parents should have the control.,46
442,"It is clear that the parents play an important role in this case, but for parents it is hard too to say no to their own children.",46
443,The parents also play a big role in this subject.,46

456,"In my opinion, I do not think that this is fair and because of this, I agree with this statement.",48
457,It is influence and not fair.,48
458,I do not really think this is fair.,48
459,They should be able to choose without any in,48

461,But is that fair?,48
462,"Even tough it would be possible to make this rule, it is hard to control such a law.",48

464,Ihre Schreibaufgabe: Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?,49
465,It is up to them.,50
466,They should learn to see which other things exists but also to say sometimes no to them.,50
467,Otherwise it dosen't seem to be good for their future.,50
468,They should learn to be satisfied with what they have.,50
469,They have to learn that they not just allways get everything they want.,50
470,But if they allowed it to them it's possible that they have to deal with more things.,50
471,They should learn from their own experiences.,50
472,I think they have enough time to do this later in their lifes.,50
473,"First of all, they need to learn to have an own opinion.",50
474,I think they will be manipulated by media later in their life anyway.,50
475,"They do not think, if they could need it, they just want it or not.",51
476,They have expierience and can decide if they want to spend their money on this product or not.,51
477,They can't distinguish between what they really need and what they are just told that they need.,51
478,They do not have the ability to decide in terms of buying and get influenced very easily.,51
479,They can't buy what they want on their own.,51

481,"They do not know how to handle money, they can not really tell the differents between what they want and what they need.",51
482,They cannot decide wheather they really need this products or not.,51
483,Also they don't have any idea about money.,51
484,In addition most of them don`t have own money which means that they are not able to deal with it and to have a feeling for the worth of the product.,51
485,Nowadays young children spend a lot of time watching television.,52
486,Watching television is nowadays a very big part of a childrens life.,52
487,Nowdays a lot of young children watch television.,52
488,Young children tend to spend more and more time in front of the television in this day and age.,52
489,TOday alot of young children watch a lot of TV.,52
490,Nowadays lots of young children are watching television.,52
491,Children frequently watch TV already in a young age.,52
492,Nowadays watching television is part of the everyday life of children.,52
493,Many young children watch TV on a daily basis.,52
494,"Today, watching television became for many young children a part of their daily routine.",52
495,Often there is lot of advertisements during the breaks of a movie or a serie.,53
496,You can't turn on the TV and watch a movie without having some breaks for advertising.,53
497,When you watch a film in the evening on television their are always breaks for adverts.,53
498,And everybody knows this situation when you watch a movie or series and then the advertising break starts.,53
499,Many channels often make advert breaks after a short time of a movie or a show.,53
500,"So many parts of the today's television is the advertising, when we watch it in the evening there is an advertising break about all 15 minutes.",53
501,Nowadays after every show or almost every fifteen minutes there is an advertising break on television.,53
502,Everybody knows the moment when they watch a movie or a serie on TV at home and every fifteen minutes there is some advertising.,53
503,"Near to all TV shows, movies and so on, are interrupted by advertising.",53
504,When you watch tv there are allways breaks where they show advertising.,53
505,They will become children who want to have everthing.,54
506,"Futhermore, they would start to not listen to their parents from an early age which does not have the best outcome.",54
507,Children would grow up thinking that there is something wrong with them.,54
508,The children might learn how to deal with it and they learn to decide what they really need and what they should not buy.,54
509,They would be influenced by TV and the parents have it harder than ever to help their children grow up in a good way.,54
510,"They also could get the wrong idea of things in the world, which isn't good.",54
511,"Maybe they would stress their parents and force them to buy them this product, but that would not be a bad affection.",54
512,The kids would be manipulated to buy a thing or change their opinion for the rest of their life.,54
513,Especially their social activities would get disturbed.,54
514,They may loose the connection to the now and the reality.,54
515,The problem of this is that often young children just want everything and they can't decide what really is worth to buy and then the parents will buy it for their children to not disapoint them.,55
516,If childrens see something they want parents often have to give in and go buy it for them.,55
517,"When they see something they like, they will not stop asking their parents to buy it, until the parents give in and fullfill their wish.The problem is that children this young do not know what is necessary to have and what is not.",55
518,They may want to buy more and more and won't accept if the parents won't buy them the things shown in the advertisements.,55
519,"Even if the parents still are the ones who buy, they often can't resist in the hope of making their child happy.",55
520,"They may want for example the toy after they`ve seen it on television, but the parents have the money and can still decide if they want to buy their kid that toy or not.",55
521,When they now go to their parents and insist on getting that knew doll or the new lego set young children can be very complicating.,55
522,So they ask their parents to buy and the parents are going to get it or they start to argue with the kid.,55
523,The parents might can not offer so much money for this stuff but the children are so manipulated so they will get there parents to buy anything they want.,55
524,But for the parents this is really anoying because the childrens always want them to buy what they want and some of them just stop if they have what they want.,55
525,Especially at the age of two to five years a child learns a lot of things.,56
526,"In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life.",56
527,Children can learn from a very young age to know which things are on the marcet and to think about what they really need.,56
528,Children aged two to five have to learn very much about live.,56
529,Also young children can learn.,56
530,It is importat that children learn thing.,56
531,It can be a good thing for young children to learn about such things from an early age.,56
532,At the age of two to five children are supposed to learn a lot for exemple how to walk or to speak properly.,56
533,"In this time of their life, children are learning very much, for example how to communicate with others.",56
534,Children in this age want to learn as much as they can.,56
535,All in all I can say that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because they are too young to understand that they want to sell products.,57
536,"In my opinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed for young children, as they are manipulative and create a world which does not exist.",57
537,"To sum up, in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children shoud not be allowed as it is manipulating, influences their development and harms the environment.",57
538,All in all you can say that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it influences them too much and makes them believe in things that do not exist.,57
539,In my opinion television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because the children can be manipulated so that the children want something that isn't necessary.,57
540,In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because of several reasons.,57
541,In my oppinion the television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed but in a way where they don't get influenced that much.,57
542,"In my opinion television advertising toward young children should not be allowed, because the hard fact is that they just should not watch television at this Age.",57
543,In my oppinion the television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because the parents have to raise their kids tough enough to say no to such things.,57
544,"I think tv advertising toward young children shouldn't be allowed, because the children don't have the possibility to be individual when they are influenced like this.",57
545,Advertising is something that we are confronted with every day of our lifes.,58
546,Advertising plays quite an important role in our society.,58
547,Advertising is a part of our life and comtrolls our decisions.,58

555,"When young children see something new or something they would love to have, they may go to the parents and ask directly: Pls buy this or these for me.",59
556,Little children often want new things and the parents buy them the new things.,59
557,They will tell their parents how cool the product is and the parents doesn't have to search long for a christmas-present.,59
558,Children who watch TV and always see the advertisement for toys and other stuff they like will probably ask their parents to buy them these.,59
559,"If children constantly are spolied with adds of some toys for instance, they most likely want their parents to buy them that specific toy.",59
560,In stores for example there are a lot of toys and stuff presented for the kids.,59

563,The parents will buy it for christmas and they dont have the struggle of thinking the whole day what they could give their child to christmas.,59
564,So they put it on their list of wishes for christmas and the parents will buy it.,59

586,But I definitely thing it would be better for young children and also for their parents if it would be forbidden.,62
587,but many people think that especially for young children this should not be allowed.,62
588,In my opinion I think it's not a great idea to influent the mind of the children.,62
589,And maybe it isn't nessasary to say it shouldn't be allowed because it isn't intresting for the children.,62
590,Some people think that this could have a bad influence to young children between two and five years old.,62
591,That can be negative for the development of the children.,62
592,"Allthough there is deffinitely a point to it, this shouldn't affect children in a negative way because thats where the parents have their part to play.",62
593,As long the children are not afraid of it it should be allowed.,62
594,"In conclusion I say that it shouldn`t be strictly forbitten for young children, so I do not totally agree.",62
595,"On the other side, there are also negativ aspects.",63
596,"To concluse, there are positive and negative aspects.",63
597,Surely there have to be positive aspects.,63
598,I think it could have negative aspects but also positive aspects.,63
599,Even if there are a couple of positive aspects to it there are aspects which are not that positv aswell.,63
600,"There are not only positive arguements, but also negative aspects.",63
601,It can have its pros and cons whereas I think it does not have really somethign negative of which I could think of at least.,63
602,I think that there are some positive and some neagtive points.,63
603,"To this, there are many positive, but as well neative points to this.",63
604,It gives several positif asspects but also various negativ aspects.,63
605,"Another thing to keep in mind is, that most of these children don't understand what they are watching.",64
606,I think that young children can`t guess which pictures in the television programm are realistic and which are certainly not.,64
607,But in my opinion these children are much too young for this sort of media or visualisation- they just don't understand the meaning and are confused.,64
608,"Because of that they have to watch this series or movie, too, to talk with other children about this.",64
609,"In addition to that, the children are obviously too young to understand everything which they see.",64
610,"Obviously, the children are confronted with lots of information but because of them being so young it often doesn't matter what they are watching.",64
611,"The children see those images and they ""burn"" into their head propably they'll wonder why it isn't like this at their own home because they can't differntiate from the real life and an illusion of life.",64
612,For children it's hard to split the reality from the things they see in TV.,64
613,Young children are too naive to know the differnce between the real life and televison or fantasy.,64
614,Also I think that parents have to told their children that it isnÂ´t everything real what they see on tv.,64
615,In conclusion my opinioin is that advertising directed toward young children shouln't be allowed because children under the age of six shouldn't anyway be watching TV so often that there should be ads specialised for them.,65
616,In conclusion I would say that advertising directed towards young children does more harm then it does good and therefore should not be allowed.,65
617,I personally think that advertising directed towards young children should be allowed because now a days where else can you reach ot to children as easy as on television.,65
618,All in all the topic if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed is difficult to anwer but on my opinion i think these kinds of advertising shouldn't be allowed.,65
619,"So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should not be allowed, because in this age children started making their first social contacts, which is very impotant for their growing up.",65
620,"All in all, I think television ads directed at young children should be allowed if the parents are overlooking the whole thing and decide whether it's a good idea or not.",65
621,All in all I would agree to the statement that Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed because there are many thinks which would be much better for the young childrens.,65
622,"In conclusion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, beacause it doesn't really make a difference if it were not be allowed, in the world there are lot of advertisings and they aren't really interested in it.",65
623,In my opinion television advertising for young children shouldn't be allowed because I think it isn't very good for children if they always see things on television which they don't have.,65
624,"In my opinion, advertising toward young children should not be allowed since the advertisers use the childish naivety and simplicity to influence kids to their profit and since it can cause an addiction to toys or new things without the kids being happy with what they have.",65
625,"Televisions, computers and smart phones dominate our world.",66
626,"Television, computers, mobile phones and many other thing are used nowadays by billions of people all around the world.",66
627,"Computer, iPhones and of course television became a very central subject in our world.",66
628,In the last centuries media usage like television has risen especially in the younger generation.,66
629,In the 21st century technics and television are the most important things in life of the humaity  in the modern world.,66
630,"is an often discussed statement in this time, bacause the media with television, computer and smartphones is more present then ever.",66
631,Nowadays almost every household has a television and other electronical devices that provide us with entertainment 24/7.,66
632,Television and other medias like the internet are a huge theme in our society.,66
633,In our todays life the television is a big part of our world.,66

652,I think it is very important for a children to play outside or searching friends.,68
653,Young children will also go more outside and play with there friends games like hide and seek or football.,68
654,Children should play in the garden or in a park with other people and parents.,68
655,In hard words it's for the children an addicition in later life they can't without the television.,69
656,Besides the parents also can show their children that the television is not right everytime.,69
657,"So TV can also give knowledge to children, which they hadn't whithout TV.",69
658,Mostly for the reason that a parent has to decide when their kid is old enough to watch TV and when it might be better to keep their children away from it and do something else.,69
659,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,69
660,"For the children it can be interesting to see what happens in the ""world outside"", so they can be interested in things which they haven't never without the TV.",69
661,So that Television is an important source for young children for preparing their future life.,69
662,"Also for parents it is sometimes really practical, when the parents are busy the kids chan watch TV.",69
663,"Young children are supposed to do something, because they want to learn new things and if you don`t have the time to play with your children it`s very helpful to let them wathing television.",69
664,"So it lays in the parents' hands, that their children don't watch to often television and get addicted to it.",69
665,They should play outside with their friends and family.,70
666,They should play outside and socialize.,70
667,They should play outside and meet friends and play with them.,70
668,"They should go outside, play with friends and have fun.",70

671,"They should go outside, meet friends, talk and play with them.",70
672,They should play outside or play with teir family.,70
673,Instead they should be playing somwhere outside in the garden with their friends or exploring the nature.,70
674,The should play outside with friends or if the weather is bad they should draw or something like that.,70
675,"Actually, the advertising for products which are concepted for these young children is not for these young children, it's for their parents.",71
676,"Mostly the advertising for a product for a child is not for the child, it is for the parents.",71
677,"On the other hand, children might be to much into the product shown in the advertising.",71
678,Furthermore companies know that children are easy to manipulate and so they are more interested in convincing children to buy their product than honestly explaining their product and it strenghts.,71
679,"Kids at the age from 2 years to 5 years do not really have the understanding to realize, what the advertising shows.",71
680,"And exactly this is a problem with these advertising spots, childern only see the positive side of the products and they can't think about consequences or if they really need this product.",71
681,"Most children, mostly the children aged two, donÂ´t even know what is said in these advertisments and think because of that, that itÂ´s right what they say about the product.",71
682,It is very easy for a company to sell their products to children when they advertise it correctly so it is easier for them to keep the head above the water and stand out against the other companies.,71
683,"Even though they might get the product, advertising is not all about reality and the child might get disappointed.",71
684,"The companies actually manipulate the children because especially the younger ones, aged two to five, can't decide whether it is something they really need or if it was simply shown in an advertisement.",71
685,"Children should be just children and not manipulated by advertising, I think.",72
686,If only children would be manipulated by advertising then companys might not advertise anymore because if would not be profitable anymore.,72
687,First of all the children are mainly too young to understand the advertisings they are seeing in the way those were supposed to.,72
688,"At the first place, young children are not able to handle with advertising.",72
689,"Advertising is like manipulation and should not have an affect on children, especially not on young children.",72
690,Anyway the children can be affected by advertising which could change their personality as they grow up.,72
691,"Moreover, there's the risk of wrong advertising, that could have a bad influence for the children.",72
692,"I think the parents must manage it and explain their children, that the advertisements are not always complitly right.",72
693,Advertisement which is targeted at children has quite a big influence on our children and their lives.,72
694,In the end I think the ones publishing the advertisments and the ones that make it and pay for it just need to know for themself if they want to manipulate children or not.,72
695,Not every television advertising is good for young children but they have to learn what's right and what's wrong.,73
696,"To summarise, children can be extremly influenced by television advertising.",73
697,"To sum up, television advertising is part of our everyday life and have some influence on young children.",73
698,Young children also watch television which is why they get confrontated with the advertising too.,73
699,Television advertising directed toward young children is not perfect but the advertising is just a part of watching television.,73
700,Some people say that television advertising directed toward young children is the key to a good childhood.,73
701,"Nowadays, many children spend a lot of their time watching TV and are exposed to television advertising towards them.",73
702,Moreover to children Television advertising has a big influence.,73
703,"By directing television advertising toward young children, the kids get connected to the advertinsing and market world by this young age and are not able to develop their own mind and own opinion.",73
704,"I agree with the fact that the children should not be influenced at such a young age by television advertising, because the advertising could have a bad influence and it could be a promise of something the children could never get to.",73

715,Television advertising is something we see a lot when we watch TV.,75
716,In television there is a lot of advertising.,75
717,Television advertising is a very common topic in daily life.,75
718,Television advertising plays a big role in our life.,75
719,A big part of today's television is advertisement.,75
720,When we watch television we can see a lot of television advertising.,75
721,Television advertising is a very big theme in our society today.,75
722,In today's society advertising is a big part of television.,75
723,Television advertising is common in today's society.,75
724,Television advertising is something we live with in our every day life.,75
725,They just see a new toy and therefore they want it.,76
726,"They see something new and so they want it, no matter if they need it or not.",76
727,Often they see things they like and than they want them immediately.,76
728,"They see something and if they like it, they want it.",76
729,They start to want things because they see them in the advertising.,76
730,They see something and then they want it.,76
731,If they see a toy and they think it's cool they want to have it.,76
732,Their minds can't get off that thought that they want to have this toy for example.,76
733,If they see something cool they want it.,76
734,Furthermore they see so many toys and things they want to have.,76
735,The children will get a view about things that exist and how they can have fun with things they do not have.,77
736,It could help the children to learn.,77
737,It may even be helpful for the parents so they get an idea what children could like and what may be useful for their development.,77
738,It helps the children to develope their minds and creativity.,77
739,Parents think it can also help to improve the knowledge of theire kids.,77
740,Children have bigger possibilities to experience many new things and they may learn from it.,77
741,Also young children can learn.,77
742,The children are open minded and if you show them in their early years a childrenfriendly Sierie they maybe could learn something.,77
743,Furthermore the child can learn about moral and friendship.,77
744,"When the parents show the kids something like that, the kids have a good start in the life for the school for example.",77
745,Advertising plays with their minds and lurge parents into buying things that their child does not even need.,78
746,Also they are not able to think rationally about whether they really need something or not it is easy to manipulate them to thank that they need something shown in the advertisement to be as cool as the children on tv.,78
747,If the children want something then sometimes the parents buy it because of the advertisements.,78
748,As already said children want to buy the things they see in the advertising and do a lot to get them.,78
749,It could be possible for them to scream for the products in the advertisment to their parents untill they are willing to buy those things.,78
750,"Thats just the since of advertising, When a little child sees such a advertise and they like the sertain product, they want to have it.",78
751,Also children in this age are easy to manipulate and if the advertising tells something is good they will believe it and so they want to have it.,78
752,The kids belive what they saw in the television and they then want their parents to buy the product in the advertise.,78
753,"Thus, they can be easily tricked into fully believing commercials, convince their parents to buy said product and then come to be disappointed or simply desire more.",78
754,"Children might want to have the thing that is showed in the advertisment and when the don't get it, they're angry on the parents.",78
755,"A child sees that and bother his parents so long, until he or she has this toy.",79
756,"But when the mother refuses to buy the toy, the child gets mad and sad.",79
757,"And finally, the child would want the toy but the parents could not afford it so child would get sad.",79
758,"If the parents are annoyed enough, they will buy it the toy.",79
759,The children think they need this toy and ask their parents to buy it.,79
760,Even though the child gets the toy it doesn't has a perfect life as the child in the television who has a lot of fun with his new toy.,79
761,"What the boy then does, is to ask the parents if he could have this toy.",79
762,"This means that the next time the child mentioned is in a store with its parents, it will definitely want the new toy.",79
763,And that leads us towards the point were we all know it: Parents and their children standing at the shoppingmall and the parents try to explain to the kid why it cannot have this toy.,79
764,So the parents buy the toy for the kid.,79
765,"By far the best point to make is that no matter what the child wants, no matter how sad it will get, everything is always up to the parents.",80
766,the young child won`t understand this and be mad at the parents who are only caring about their child.,80
767,"On the other hand, you are the one who cares about your child, who wants your child to learn about the important things in life.",80
768,In this case the parents could spend time with their child and be interactive with it.,80
769,"When parents decide to have a baby then they have to spent time with her/him, even if it is a difficult situation.",80
770,It is their child and I think the parents know what is the best for their child.,80
771,"That view can cause conflicts between the children and the parents which can, in worst case, loose their control.",80
772,But this is a question of how to raise a child and this have every parents to deal with.,80
773,"Nobody wants their children to get unconcentrated students or lonely and normally if people get children they also want to spend some time with them, right?",80
774,"However, again, this is in control of the parents.",80
775,"These advertisments often make kids want the toys, or worse, make them want to be like the people in the advertisment.",81
776,"Additionally, the child possibly enjoys those advertisings since watching those funny advertisings becomes more exciting than actually playing with the toys.",81
777,They often like advertisements to discover new toys and there are as well advertisements which support the education of the children.,81
778,"Often the advertisment shows new toys, the children want immediately because they are so easy to influence and sometimes don't even know what the advertisments are.",81
779,"If the kids see an advertising, they think that they couldn't live anymore without having this toy.",81
780,"Plus, the advertisings are also a help for the parents to know what goods are on the market and which toys can actually educate their child.",81
781,Often the children woudn't want that toy if they just seen it in a store but the advertising has a psychologly effect on the children.,81
782,"Firstly, many advertising spots are about pruducts which adults or teenager would buy and not toys or something children would like to see.",81
783,"The advertisers state, that they must promote their toys somewhrere, whrere the children can see those and than want to buy those.",81
784,"Even if the ad just introduces new toys or games, children will get attracted to it and will certainly want to buy them due to the lack of rational decision skills.",81
785,"In my opinion, it wouldn't be correct to forbid to show such advertising.",82
786,My personal opinion is that we can`t and shouldn`t prohibit the advertisement because of two reasons.,82
787,In my opinion the advertisement should not be banned but somehow reduced.,82
788,"So should, as a consequence, this advertising be forbidden?",82
789,"So all in all i say, that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed.",82
790,So these advertisings don' make sense for me and I think that they shouldn't be allowed.,82
791,Some people want that those advertising should not be allowed.,82
792,In my opinion we should allow the advertisement but we should control it.,82
793,I think that advertisements in general are nothing that should be prohibited in general.,82
794,"In my opinion, the advertising should not be allowed anymore.",82
795,"But as often, the toy isn't that great in reality as it was in the advertisement when the child actually gets the toy.",83
796,There are toys which are not as great as it seemed at the advertisement.,83
797,"But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy.",83
798,"These advertisments often make kids want the toys, or worse, make them want to be like the people in the advertisment.",83
799,"In television advertising the toys look sometimes much more realistic, than they actualy are.",83
800,"Even worse is it, when the toy isn't so cool like it was described in the advertising, because it is often so, that things in television are described as the most perfect and best thing, that you really need and they leave out all the bad informations about it.",83
801,"They often show things in commercials, which arent there in the real toy.",83
802,"When children see television advertising about toys, most of the time they want to get this toy.",83
803,"In the advertissements every toy looks interesting and funny, eventought it is not in reallity.",83
804,Now if kids see advertisments on television about toys and how cool they are they want to have this toy too.,83
805,When they see something they like on television they're probably going to ask their parents to buy it.,84
806,"When they see something they like in television, they are going to ask their parents for buying what they saw.",84
807,The only thing they know now is just that they really want to own what they saw on TV and if their parents wont buy them what they want they will probably get sad about it.,84
808,"When they see something very cool in television the want that and they ask their parents allnthe time to get it, so the parents get annoyed and they might want to see the child happy so the buy them the stoff.",84
809,Most children like everything they`ve seen at TV and want their parents to buy it for them.,84
810,"If they want something from the television advertisment, the parents buy it.",84
811,"If they wanted to buy something because they saw this in the TV, the parents could decided to buy it or not.",84
812,"Kids in this age canÂ´t buy everything what they see on the tv, but they want to have it and talk to their parents and they will buy it.",84
813,After they've seen the adverts a few times they are are going to ask their parents about the stuff they've seen on Tv until they buy them for them.,84
814,"They can't buy the products they see in tv, their parents would have to buy it.",84
815,In my opinion advertisings are somesting for adults and they shouldn't be shown in children channels.,85
816,Maybe advertisment should not be allowed on kids channels.,85
817,In my opinion the television advertising shouldn`t be allowed on kids channels.,85
818,"My personal opinion is that channels ,where the producers know that it is directed towards children only, should be aware that ads aren't very effective and that they should be banned.",85
819,Channels for children should have children friendly content and if that includes advertisments that's okay.,85
820,"Furthermore children aged two to five shouldn't be watching channels, which feature a lot of adverts and most channels for children don't show any adverts as far as I am concerned.",85
821,"There are so many channels for children in our time, but as we know, a channel can't stay alive without showing advertisments on TV.",85
822,"To my mind, it is not a bad thing that there is advertisement on channels for children.",85
823,"Children shouldn't watch television anyway, they should go out and play with other childen, so there isn't any problem with advertisings.",85
824,"The Channel Owners just should know, what type of advertisment they show to the children.",85
825,A big part of today's television is advertisement.,86
826,"When they watch too much television, they see definitely advertising, which they shoudn't see.",86
827,If there has not been television advertising than they would just watch more movies or series.,86
828,They don't realize that all those advertisements are made from huge companys which want to earn as much money as possible.,86
829,Maybe that`s why people who often watch TV often get manipulated by advertising.,86
830,And when somebody watch television there is every time advertising.,86
831,Today's television programs consists of a lot of advertisements to.,86
832,But when they watch TV automatically advertisions are directed to them.,86
833,"Television advertisements are a thing, every television watcher is exposed to.",86
834,"If they watch them, they are automatically confronted with televsion advertisements.",86
835,But young children can not control their brain as much as possible to know what is good and what is needed.,87
836,"Children don't have the same abbility to overthink things and see behind what is being shown to them, as an adult does.",87
837,Young children can't really think for themselves yet.,87
838,Young children haven't developed fully and aren't really educated yet.,87
839,Children haven't learnt yet what is good and what is bad.,87
840,Young children haven't developed their own opinion yet and act very naiv.,87
841,"In the age between two and five, kids are easily influenced by what they see and hear and they can not yet distinguish good from bad and real from not real very well.",87
842,If children are about one to fourteen years old they aren't able to think responsible or make important decissons.,87
843,Children can't think rationally enough yet to see beyond their own desires.,87
844,The development of young children is influenced badly.,87
845,"When we are young, the world around us has a big influence on us.",88
846,As an adult we know what we need and what we do not need.,88
847,"And even if we do not learn this from an early age, life will not necessarily become easier.",88
848,"As one's maturity grows, you gain the abilty to distinguish between desires and reality.",88
849,For children it is also important to learn that they can not have everything they want to have.,88
850,It's a important thing to learn in the young age to not be infulenced by something.,88
851,Parents can even use this experience to teach their children important things about life and to teach them that they won't get everything they want.,88
852,In the young age it's essential to learn many diffrent lessons about life.,88
853,On the other hand young children has to make their own experiences to learn from them.,88
854,I also believe that it helps you to learn that you can't everything you want from a very young age on.,88
855,In their youngest years children can be manipulated and influenced very easily.,89
856,"As already mentioned above, children are very easily influenced.",89
857,Young children can be influenced easily.,89
858,Young children can be influenced easily.,89
859,"Because of that, children can be easily manipulated.",89
860,First of all young children are really easy to influence.,89
861,Children can be influenced very easily.,89
862,"First of all, young children are easily influenced.",89
863,Young children can be influenced very easily.,89
864,Young children are easily manipulated.,89
865,Another problem could be that there are some advertisements that are not even made for childrens attention and could influence them in a bad way.,90
