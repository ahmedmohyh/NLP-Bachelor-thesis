so it is kind of messed up that the companys are targeting already the very young children which are innocent and dont know that they are being influenced by the ads but from an older age like 5 years  in my oppinnion its okey because from there on the childreen tend to start wanting specific toys and to showcase them in an ad is really cleverso why not trying to get the childern already in an early age to accept ads in their function thaat later maybe they work as planned",6

finally ",15

first of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us

but the influcene of advertisment  younger children is probably even higher they do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use  convincing people to buy the product for example a young boy who maybe already has a lot of cars sees advertisment on a new one the advertisment tells him that this car is way better ",15

children in young ages often watch these television advertisings because there parents dont want to spend time with their kids for them the television is a cheap babysitter

first of all opponents of television advertising argue that children this young are influenced very easily by their surroundings amongst other things this can be their parents friends they play with and ",15

first of all it has to be mention that the advertising for children often is very unrealistic because of this the children get a wrong bild of the world and learn things which arent right
but in case of this it must be said that it isnt important which advertising the children see in television they get influenced by each one even if they watch tv and see advertising which is for adults in most cases this is more bad for them than see things which are ",15
157," but there are a lot of children who watch television anyway and are confronted with television advertising 
firstly television toward young children influences them in various ways if they see a girl wearing a rosa dress and playing with a doll they may think girls have to do that so they learn stereotype behaviours
others may say that television advertising has not that much power more important is the behavoiur which children observe of  their parents or of other children if they see the girl with the rosa dress but their parents show them that they can play with dolls or cars in most cases they will be influenced by the parents and not by the advertisment
secondly if children are confronted with advertisment they will want things that they do not really need they just want it because they have seen it on television and think



",15

one strong ",15

advertises are often shown in the tv they adress all ages even really young children and that might be a problem as many criticers say 
young children are easily influencable by television advertising so they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour

but actually advertisment that is driectly directed to the children can somehow influence them in their future consumer behaviour the advertisemnt and the way the parents treat their childrens wishes could optimise or make their former consumer behaviour even worse if a kid gets everything it wants it will possibly buy everything it wants as an adult too and gets selfish additional to that there is some kind of social pressure the parents of the children who are directly confronted with the wishes of their children probably can not afford the toys the comparism kids do about toys puts a thirtend social pressure on the parents and could ",16

but in the other ",16
163," they see an advertising with a toy they like they want it too and everytime their parents get annoyed of that because they have to pay for all the toys and they are expensive

 but ",16

another important thing is the knowledge of the children they actually never get to know different toys like barbie lego or even playmobil probably the parents dont go to a toy shop with their kids very often ",16
167," they will buy the advertised product to make their child happy and quiet after some time the house gets stuffed full of toys that nobody plays with because it is not as nice as it seemed to be and the kids didnâ´t really wanted it it is just something that somebody from the commercial told them to buy

after all those advertisemets should not be allowed because it is not okay to use the childish mind of a fiveyear old to make profit this is not humane  ",16
