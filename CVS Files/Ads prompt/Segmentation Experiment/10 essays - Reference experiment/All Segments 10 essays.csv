0,0,1162_aID1AD.txt," that it would be difficult to stop televison advertising which is  in the ages 
televison advertising could be helpful especialy for parents if they donâ´t have an idea concerning to give a present to their child 
but "
1,1,1162_aID1AD.txt, watching telivison advertising in these ages can lead to the missing ability to appreciate things which are advertised in the tv 
2,2,1162_aID1AD.txt, toys or electronic devises to play with if they always want more toys the parents maybe will follow their wishes to make their children happy and make these wishes come true which can lead to the missing abilities mentioned 
3,3,1162_aID1AD.txt," wouldnâ´t know the value of these things
my opinion to this topic is that televsion  advertising directed  should be stopped furthermore the parents have to have an eye on their children if they watch tv watching tv in these ages can "
4,4,1162_aID1AD.txt, be discussed whether itâ´s good for them
5,5,1164_aID1AD.txt,nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches tv in the television is 
6,6,1164_aID1AD.txt," and even small children watch television so it may occure the question whether tv advertising  aged  shoud or should not be allowed 

first you should allow this kind of avertising because it helps the parents to buy things which fit with the specific wishes of their children so the little child can watch tv and "
7,7,1164_aID1AD.txt, the adverts it says that it likes to have this and that therefor the child doesnt have to speak well its enough to say i want that and it 
8,8,1164_aID1AD.txt," on the advert then the parents can simply buy the object 
next this kind of advertising helps the companies to improve their sales and adress the specific group of people which the products are made for so they would do babytoyadvertisments only for young children aged 

on the other "
9,9,1164_aID1AD.txt, this adverts shouldnt be allowe because these young children cant do anything with this adverts the children get irritated and dont know how to react as an adolscent you know how to deal with adverts and that their content isnt always the truth but children 
10,10,1164_aID1AD.txt," young children dont know 
more important theses adverts influence the childrens mind and their psychological development thats not good children may believe whats said in the advert plus the strategy of advertisment is to create needs and children cant deal with that 

all in all adverts for children aged  shouldnt be allowed because of their negative effects on the children they create wrong needs and slow down the psychological development they only help companies to improve their profits and this is not good we shou"
11,11,1165_aID1AD.txt," inform you about television advertising
i am "
12,12,1165_aID1AD.txt," with this statement because the televison advertising have many negatives effects
the "
13,13,1165_aID1AD.txt," one is that the children often want the object in the televion they think that is cool and they often try to convince their parents if they dont get the object they start to cry or they are sad about the desission of their parents the parents dont like to see their children cry and they bought the object for them
forthermore the childrens often dont need the object the seller push their object in the advertising because he know what he have to say he only tells the posi and the children see that and in result they get it from their parents
in addition the parents should explain theire children how they have to handel with advertising the children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money if they dont learn this they could have problems in their life 
all in all the advertising isnt good for the young people it stress the parents and it could destroy the entership between the family and friends 
"
14,14,1166_aID1AD.txt,"television advertising  should not be allowed thats the way many people think about the influnce of media like televison on young childreni dont think it should be not allowed but i am not the opinion that its positive for them

 every parent should decide if he lets his child watching things  which can be dangerous for the development of his own child not everybody sees that as negativ because a lot of people doesnt believe that children "
15,15,1166_aID1AD.txt, aged  understand the things they seemany parents cant even imagine that many 
16,16,1166_aID1AD.txt, the growing process can have an influence on the futured personality of the kidsfor me its the biggest problem in todays community and forbiding of television andvertising directed to to the young children wouldnt be a 
17,17,1166_aID1AD.txt," for the probmlem

for me its hard to judge about this because i never thought "
18,18,1166_aID1AD.txt, intensiv about this topic maybe because i am not a parent 
19,19,1166_aID1AD.txt, for and against the statement manchend at the begiining
20,20,1167_aID1AD.txt," discuss the controverse theme if television advertising  should be allowed or not
on one "
21,21,1167_aID1AD.txt, itâ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children because the children in the age of  canâ´t say anything about there own opinion because they are to young to say it 
22,22,1167_aID1AD.txt," children maybe donâ´t want advertising that is  them the children aged  are far too young to think about there own opinion and to think about advertising being  them
on the other "
23,23,1167_aID1AD.txt, you could say that itâ´s good to direct the advertising toward young children 
24,24,1167_aID1AD.txt, they canâ´t say if they want to do that because itâ´s the only way to direct an advertising toward young children itâ´s 
25,25,1167_aID1AD.txt," important for the television advertising to do that
all in all "
26,26,1167_aID1AD.txt, it might be important for the television to direct advertising toward those young children
27,27,1169_aID1AD.txt,"young children should play outside more often that is sentence every child has heard a lot of times in her or his young years but why should they play outside

now a days a television and the outraging development of the technology is very normal to the young generation and there parent generation the only generation is the elders generation whom are not used to technology at all there are a few ones that do not have a probleme with the change but the most do so the snetence above is mostly to hear form the older generation  
the children should be allowed to watch television and use all the technology the presnt has to offer because we are living in a constant development of technology and in the future there will be more of that some say that it is all going to be compromized and going to be technical 
the only thing parents could do is to set a limit of tv watching for there children "
28,28,1169_aID1AD.txt, they can be social and hang out with there friends actually that is a thing that every child is going to do in that young age they are going to the kindergarden or to a kita and will only be watching tv in the mo0ments 
29,29,1169_aID1AD.txt, they are at home as you can see there are a lot of times where they do not have time watch tv 
30,30,1169_aID1AD.txt," they shopuld have a time where they are allowed to watch there series or there favorite movie that is what makes the children happy now a days 
furthermore more many child series and movies on tv teach many life lessons "
31,31,1169_aID1AD.txt," that the children will be prepared for life and their social life for example dora or other series there are some episodes where they solve math problemes teach you how to deal with strangers or hoe to treat your friends 
fact is that the series that they watch on tv prepare for school
the only thing that could be held against that statement is that there are "
32,32,1169_aID1AD.txt, horror movies and other bad stuff that children at that age should not watch for that parents can just install a code for those channels 
33,33,1169_aID1AD.txt, the children will not have a chance to watch these also to hold against the 
34,34,1169_aID1AD.txt, that children that watch tv are not interfering with there family anymore the parents could watch the sereies with them and make a game out of it 
35,35,1169_aID1AD.txt," they will make tv watching a family activity

in the end i can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 25 must be allowed to interfier with that in the future there will be more and more technology and we can not forbidm the children to not live that life"
36,36,1171_aID1AD.txt,"in the following essay i will show negativ reasons and examples for the statement  television advertising  should not be allowed
in my opinion i "
37,37,1171_aID1AD.txt, with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples the 
38,38,1171_aID1AD.txt, reason is that young children at the age  can not understand the main statement from the television because there brain can not translate or understand the film which is shown as a 
39,39,1171_aID1AD.txt, it should not be allowed my 
40,40,1171_aID1AD.txt, reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours 
41,41,1171_aID1AD.txt, they would  not focus on there future work lives the 
42,42,1171_aID1AD.txt, is that the television is a media which is lying fluently to have better quotes of the public to become famous and rich the children would grow up with wrong information 
43,43,1171_aID1AD.txt, they could understand the truth of the television and its 
44,44,1171_aID1AD.txt, on their there future lives could be mainly destroyed or would stay on the lies of the television my last reason is that children at the age of  are defintiv to young to look tv because of the risks and the 
45,45,1171_aID1AD.txt," of this media to themselves

yours jason"
46,46,1177_aID1AD.txt,"this essay will be about the ban of advertising spots on television directing to children between the age of two and five

on the one "
47,47,1177_aID1AD.txt, children are not able to think critically about the advertisement they cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant for example children do not need their own playstation 
48,48,1177_aID1AD.txt, they are really young they do not know that it is unhealthy if they use it too much 
49,49,1177_aID1AD.txt," that they get problems with their eyes et cetera  
on the other "
50,50,1177_aID1AD.txt," if the parents take care of them and pay attention the children will not get any problems but they will have fun with their new toy or other things 
but children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them they will be really unhappy for example if a child sees a plastic horse on tv running around and jumping it would think that this horse is really able to do that but it is not furthermore there would be some children who want to get everything they see on tv and for poor parents it would be really difficult to explain why their friends already own these things which seem to be important
but for the industry it is easier to persuade children than adults who reflect their actingthey would not profit of this ban "
51,51,1177_aID1AD.txt, watching tv for young children is dangerous and unhealthy 
52,52,1177_aID1AD.txt," these advertisements should not be allowed because for the children there is no benefit their health and happyness would suffer and the profit of the industry is not worth it 
 



"
53,53,1178_aID1AD.txt,in the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices in the following text 
54,54,1178_aID1AD.txt," which speak for or against the advertisment which is directed 

the biggest "
55,55,1178_aID1AD.txt, against the advertisment is that children are very easy to influece because they do not have enough experience to know what is wrong and what is write furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see 
56,56,1178_aID1AD.txt," the advertisment could have negative effets on the children
on the other "
57,57,1178_aID1AD.txt, children are learning very much in this part of life 
58,58,1178_aID1AD.txt, the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products but this 
59,59,1178_aID1AD.txt, is just valuable if the advertisment is supposed for children and does not have strongly influecing parts maby the companies could make an advertisment which gives the child useful information the information could be about important topics in our contemporary society 
60,60,1178_aID1AD.txt," about the responsable thing eith the nature

in conlusion "
61,61,1178_aID1AD.txt, that  a special advertisment for children should only be allowed if the advertisment is controlled by the parents or a kind of institute in the 
62,62,1179_aID1AD.txt,television  young people should  be allowed but the children should watch tv not 
63,63,1179_aID1AD.txt," often like adults because they have not enough concentration to watch an hour a day moreover it is bad for the childrens eyes young children must play with other friends and should not sit at home to watch television but often young children can learn something by watching television an example is that they learn to treat the other children in the kindergarten better or learn to say different words also little children learn what is forbidden and what is right but they should watch series which are made for young children with an age of if they look criminal series it is not good for their evolution and they can missundertand what the people are doing 
televison advertising is not good for the childish brain because they do not know what is important and what is not but i do not think that it is bad if they watch it
i "
