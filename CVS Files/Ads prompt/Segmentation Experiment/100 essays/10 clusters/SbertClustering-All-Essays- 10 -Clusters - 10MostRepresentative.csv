91," many children its too difficult to learn that parents often dont allow them to be outside until 9pm or like in this discussion buying some playing stuff from the advertisements for them they must accept that they cannot have everything and if they werent confronted by advertisements and the no of their parents they never learn it 
another important thing is the knowledge of the children they actually never get to know different toys like barbie lego or even playmobil probably the parents dont go to a toy shop with their kids very often ",9
92, they would want to have the item no matter what and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they cant afford a new toy for them thats why televison advertisement thats  causes trouble on the other ,9
