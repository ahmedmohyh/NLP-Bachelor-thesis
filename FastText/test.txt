Advertising in Television is becoming more and more clever.
Lots of those ads invade our subconsciousness and try to make us buy the product even if we do not actually need it.
When it comes to children, lots of them don't have enough money to afford these products.
They don't even understand the concept of money.
Even if they wanted it, they can not get the thing they were told they need.
Also lots of children that age are prohibited watching television by their parents.
That way they don't even see the advertisements thus the feeling of needing the toy is not created.
And also children of that age do not have any intentions of actually buying these things.
For example when I was little, i used to watch an advert of a Lego set all the time and then choosing another toy for my birthday.
I was not influenced at all by the ad.
Those were some points pro advertising.
Although they seem good and reasonable, there are also lots of contra-ad-points.
For example if the feeling of needing the toy is eventually created, the children will harass their parents until they get what they wanted or they got somehing else.
This is quite annoying for any parent as my mother herself can agree.
Even more convincing of a ban of such advertisements are that when the child does not get that thing and other children get it, it creates the feeling of missing out something that should not be missed.
For example I always wanted to have a scooter because all the other kids had one and I thougt I would have such a great time had I had it.
And even more so is that children this young are much easier to influence than adults are.
They can not see past the triks these people are using.
Their minds are still developping and should not be filled with unnecessary ads.
In my opinion, advertising towards children should be banned.
The adverts should rather be directeed towards the parents of the child.
"Should it not be allowed to produce television advertising directed toward young children at the age between two and five?".
On this question is based the following text, which shows advantages and disadvantages  including my personal opinion.
First, the main time a person is watching TV is during the evening.
Some people also watch a movie after lunch while they want to have a short sleep.
At this times a child aged two to five even sleeps too or it is playing with friends, so that the child can not see advertsisings.
However the television can be nessecary, because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep.
But during such a movie there is not more than one time advertising.
The most children are not interested in this advertsing and do not watch them, so that it is unnessecary to produce television advertising directed to young children, then they do not see them.
The most important argument is, that children aged two to five will never understand television advertising even if you show toys or pets, because they do not know the reason of advertising.
At my own opinion I will say, that television advertising for young children can be allowed, but it is not nessecary, because they do not watch much films .
Besides they do not care about the advertising and would not understand the background reasons for it.
In the following text, I`ll discuss the statement about the programm of television, which is directed to very young children by the age of two to five.
For me it´s an important theme to talk about, because the medias in our time can be very dangerous for the developement of children and also teenagers, but in this moment the age of the young chldren is important for the statement.
I think, television is something, which is fun and free time for you, but it also can change your opinion about some topics and meanings, which you have.
Young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but it´s not the right way, I think.
It´s better to show them, how to handle with television or games or something like that, because the children are learning for their lifes and not just for the moment.
In the statement, it´s described that very young children, from the age from two to five, should not watch television and for me it has something true, because in the age of two or three years, you should not watching televeison.
A little kid should play with its toys and parents and not watch televison the whole day, because it can be a negative point in its developement.
But I think, you can´t say no with a law, so it´s difficult to handle with this topic.
A solution can be, that the parents of the children have to handle right with this topic, because it´s important for their children and their developement.
Older children, like with the age of five or six or elder, it is of course right and possible to watch television with a time, which is given by the parents, so that the cildren can watch a serie for one hour and then it´s finished for this day.
So all in all, I agree at some parts with the statement, but not at all.
The main thing, that is important is the bad influence by television for too young children, so it could exists problems in future, which are developed by the television.
I think these argument would sure make sense if you want to protect your child against the capitalistic system we`re living in.
But it honestly makes no sense to let your child watch Tv if you`re against advertising.
Further it doesn`t really makes a different if the adverstising is directed toward a two year old girl or a 85 year old man, in any case the young child will get influenced by commercials.
The only difference is the way of how the child gets influenced.
Another argument against this statement is, that not only the advertising in television influences the children.
In fact the show they`re actually watching is far more influencing, than the commerials.
But in the other way you have say that this can be really bothering young parents, when their little son is coming downstairs and all he want is a new playstation because the television said only cool kids got playstations.
Sure you want your child to grow up without tv, but sometimes also the best mom needs a pause and places her son near the television so hes calm for a while.
My opinion is, that this statement doesn`t really makes sense.
If you want your child to grow up without beeing influenced by tv commercials, you don`t even buy a television.
In fact, you can buy your child an MP3 so it can listen to good music witch is much better and as highly entertaing as Spongebob Squarpants.
 For the question, if the advertising directed toward young children shoul not be allowed, you can think on some opinions for and against it.
The television advertising is sometimes very funny and beautiful for the kids.
So they can lough and be happy.
They show some carracters that show the kids how they can do something, and the children are learning something.
But also there are some advertising that aren´t very helpful to show children how they can do something or they can behave.
Sometimes the children learn something, they shouldn´t learn.
A situation for example for this is when a child is sad because another child took his car for playing away, so the kid is really sad and don´t know what he could do.
He saw an advertising where this happend and the solution was that the child hurt the other one, and that is not ok.
In reallife the kid who is sad, because he want his car back, knows that he can hurt the other one to get his car.
So it´s not ok to show them this kind of stories because they learn from it...
They should show how to play a game or to take part in other plays where he can play with other children.
Also I think that children who are at the age of two to five shouldn´t be allowed to watch tv because it´s not good for their eyes.
It´s better for them to play in the kindergarten or to play with their mum.
There are some little things that could make them happy... for axample spending time with their mum, so they can build a better feeling for each other, because they get to know each other better.
How I said in the begining there are some funny and beautiful advertising which make the children smile and be happy, but I think that they can do other things for being happy.
So all in one I think that the Television advertising should be allowed, but those who make the children learn something they shouldn´t learn shouldn´t be allowed.
So the advertising should be controlled by some people that know what is right for children aged two to five.
, I agree with this statement, because especially today, where the kind of advertising, that is showed, isn't really childfriendly.
As an example, little time ago my little sister and I watched a kids film on a regular channel and suddenly a advertising about sex toys came up.
Of course they didn't know what this kind of toys are, but honestly it is a shame, that the television allows that.
Kids ask questions, if they didn't understand  something, so maybe the parents won't tell them, what it is, but the bigger brother could explain them really well, what the practices are, that you do with these toys.
Through this they get much more involved in things, that are subject of grown-ups.
The whole fashion and cosmetic advertsing is also a huge problem.
The skinny, "beautiful" models present their products in a sexual way and talk in a seductive voice.
This can lead especially girls,but also boys, to think that this anorexic women or muscle men are the beauty ideals.
Because they are in an age, in which they are really manipulative and don't think for theirself, they are likely to  take over the opinion of the people and things, that are around them or are shown them.
They want to be just like the models, that are in television, so skinny, so trained, so beautiful.
But to reach such an supernatural body image, they have to lose unhealthy weight, which is achieved trough eating disorders, and of course photoshop, also it can lead to psychic problems and suicide, because they didn't see themself as good enough.
In general children shouldn't waste time on electronic devises, which aren't the real world.
They learn much more about a good life, when they are in the woods or playing games with their friends.
So they learn to socialize and to respect each other.
This are two much important points to have as happy, self-employed and honest grown-up.
In the following text the question is discussed, if Television advertising directed toward young childre (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
There is a conrtoverse discussion about that subject for long now.
But is that really so unresponsible from the advertising industrie?
As capitalist and CEO you have the absolute right to advertise like that, because your goal is  to catch eye-balls and to sell more of whatever product.
As a mother of 4 young children and not too much money though, you might not be so happy when your children always desire the fanciest toy.
So what to do about it?
For the advertisors young children are easy to connect with, because they do not have such a complex believe and decision making system as most adults do.
Therfore it is quite compelling for companies, to make cheap advertisements with good chance to succed.
On the other hand, it is exactly that, that young children are not able to distinguish useful and not useful information, that makes advertising toward this group questionable.
For the companies it is an easy way to get new customers, because when the children are growen up, and might have themself childern, they still will remember what they wanted in their childhood and so will buy it for their kids.
It is almost at the level of some kind of indoctrination so to speak, which makes it moraly unatractive to advertise towards young children.
In my opinion the resposibility lies by the parents of the children and not by the advertisors.
It is their problem, when they just let their child watch TV nine to five a day.
So they have to take responsibility for how their child develops and to control the input it gets from the environment.
Therefor i do not think one can prohibit to advertise toward young children.
The following text is about the named statement.
Television is today more impportant than in the past.
In the past the children go outside an play with other children.
So its different than today.
Most of children watch television so they are at their own.
I disagree with this statement because young children aged of two to five should be learn to play with other children at their age.
When they look tv the children are independent of this media so they can't live without watching tv.
So the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people.
The reason is that they are in contact with others and that's better for their future.
It ist so important because later they can meet new friends easier than without playing with others.
The children without playimg with other children don't know the contact with others.
So the relationship to other children is better when the children play with other children.
An arguement could be that the television shows pograms which aren't good for young children.
Also the pograms are for older children (aged seven).
Many pograms aren't real but the children watch them and think they want do the same.
So the television isn't real.
Many pograms could be dangerous for young children so they dreams bad and that's not good for their little life.
Much peeple say that television is good for their future and it's is the real life b ut it isn't it.
The shows are played of actors who leatn their text and then play it for the camera and the pproducer.
So it isn't the real life.
"The children can learn of watching tv" That isn't right because the children learn more in playing with toys.
Beside they learn the rules of their parents and they know in which their are allowed to something and what it isn't allowed to do.
So the children should'nt watch television because they are things which are better than that.
Also the independence of watching television is tall so later when they are older they want watching tv all the time.
Then they don't meet friends or do a hobby.
The age of two to five is the most important time of the life of a children because they learn so much about the life and deleope in a fast time.
The developement of a child in this age is
There are arguments for and against the prohibition of television advertising directed toward younger children, which I will summarize and analyze in the following text .
First of all it is well-known that little children are heavily influenced by their surroundings, so that they can get manipulated easily as well.
This can be used effectively by television advertisements, which portray them a false picture of reality, causing children to ask their parents for things they don't actually need.
This is often the case with toys, that are shown to be really fun in advertisements, while in reality they often are quite lame.
Additionally children can't even realize, when they are getting baited by a company, so that it is up to the parents to explain why a particular product is not as good as portraied in the TV, which most of the time can't be understood by children, which might lead to some sort of unhappiness.
Nevertheless one can argue if this is reason enough to prohibit advertisements directed toward young children, since it would be pretty hard to establish.
Nowadays it is common, that even little children spend some time in front of the TV and since there has to be some sort of advertising between two shows that are made for children, it wouldn't be too clever to put something in there, that isn't directed toward children as well.
Furthermore there are some advertisements that might have a positive consequence on children, for example if an ad promotes physical activity, like going outside and playing with friends, although this is quite rarely the case.
Eventually I think that it really depends on what sort of advertisement it is and what product is getting advertised.
As for the previous example with toys: if a false picture of the toy is portraied, to bait consumers into buying, that is obviously not the right way to do it.
However an absolute prohibition is, in my opinion, nearly impossible to to happen, because TV companies have to earn their money and companies that produce shows for children are no exception.
But as just mentioned, it's the quality of the advertisement that really matters, thus instead of wanting to prohibit them all, one should rather ask for more appropriate ads, that don't damage young children in any way.
The following essay deals with the question wether telivision advertising directed toward young children aged two to five should be allowed.
For children the ages two to five are the most important year of development.
They learn speaking and walking and a lot of other important things.
The young children should play outside or do other stuff than sitting in fornt of a television and watch some strange series.
Later in life they'll watch a lot of tv and in childhood they shouldn't spend their time with this.
If they watch series for example the "Krümelmoster" they may have the same ideas as the actors and do things they aren't allowed or get hurt while doing this.
The development in this young age is very importent.
One can't really tell them what to do ore not, they will experience this themselves.
But without watching TV they will meet some friends and are outside in the natur.
They create other ideas without the influence of television.
They get social contacts which they can't make if they only spend their time infront of the TV.
For example I got to know my best friend with the age of 1 because our mothers are friends and we only spend out time outside and played with the dogs or by bad weather we built thing and played memories.
We weren't allowed to watch television and later the only thing we watched was the sandman.
This only goes ten minutes and was nearly before our bedtime.
The age of two to five is the time for children in the kindergarden and there they learn how to behave with other kids, so it's important not to destroy this at home.
In my oppinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
With this statement the following text is occupied.
I´m going to compare advantages and disadvantages.
An arguement, why children should not be allowed to use Television with the age of two to five is, that they are to young to understand a lot of things, which are told there.
Parents should make sure that their children grows up with things, which are important fot theier future.
For example, children with the age of two to five should reed some books or play games like football.
Also they could draw some pictures or learn, how to spell theier names.
If children with young age only watch TV, they will do this also with older age.
An advantage is, that a children with young age often has to be alone, because the parents have to work the whole day or must have to do something, where a little children is not usefull.
Than they could watch TV, with the result that their fixed on the Television.
Also if a children watch important politically soaps earlier, it grows up with a better knowledge of the important things of life.
But it does not make sense that a young aged children is able to get important information.
A young children with the age of two to five has to learn the calours or how to differences animals with other animals, for example.
It is better to show them books with a lot of picures than to let them whatch TV .Young children should also play outside with friends, because they have to learn the difference of the real world and the world that is showed by the medias.
As a result I agree with the statement, because there are a lot of disadvantages and only a few advantages.
I think there are a lot of more things, children with young age could do much better than watch Television.
In my opinion, children, who look at pictures or learn the colours with young age have a lot of knwoledge more than children watching TV.
Television advertising is often directed to certain groups of people.
One of them are children who are between two and five years old.
There are some people who say that this kind of advertising should not be allowed.
In the following I will present my opinion on this topic.
In my opionion there are two sides to this statement.
I can agree with the people who are saying that this kind of advertising should be forbidden.
Children who are that young don't know how to compromise it.
The ads are making everything more colorful and brighter, and they do not necessarily show reality.
The children really want to have the product and might annoy their parents until they buy it.
It's also not fair of the marketing people.
They use young children, who might never had contact to any kind of media before, just to make money.
They know exactly what the children want and they use this knowledge, just to make themselves richer.
But on the other hand, there are some reasons why I disagree with this statement.
Even if the child really wants the product that was advertised on TV, the decisions if it's bought or not will be made by the parents.
The child can't just buy things on its own.
The role of the parents is another reason, why I think commercials should be allowed: the parents can decide when and how often children watch TV.
And it is their decision if they want a two- year old boy or girl to watch TV.
The other reason why it should be allowed is one simple thing: you can't hide advertising.
Sooner or later the kids will be confronted with ads, and it could be good to let them know early enough that it is out there.
When they become older they will know better how to handle advertisment.
Children will know, that they can't have everything they want and that not everything is like it is in TV.
The things shown in the commercials aren't reality, but it is the reality that commercials are out there in real life.
And if TV advertisment towards children isn't allowed, commercials in magazines, on the radio and especially on the Internet shouldn't be allowed as well.
Children get a phone earlier every generation, and with that they have the connection to everything that is out there.
And the internet is even harder to control than TV.
One decision must lead to other decisions as well.
All-in-all I say, that I disagree with the ststement "Television advertising directed toward younger children should not be allowed".
The parents have the chance to decide what the child does and what is bought in the end.
And children will  be confronted with commercials anyway, it is not just on TV.
My first thought was, that this schouldn't be a problem.
When children see advertisement, it has an effect on them, but they aren't able to buy something on their own.
When the kids get older they are of course able to buy something.
But at this age I think the kids should be more ore less informed and don't let themself manipulate to strong from advertisement.
But here i am talking about children who have an average TV consume.
When a kid spends more time infront of the television, the effects could be worse.
The influence of the mother is important I think.
When the  TV cosume is regulated and when the mother don't just leaves advertisements uncommented.
In general I think its better when the kids are confronted early with advertisement, because it is a part of the television programm.
When they see commercials at an older age they, they also have to learn how to handle it.
An important point for me is what is advertised.
If its for food, an action park, toys or other TV programms.
As is said food advertisement shouldn't be a problem, because here the parents can decide wheter to buy something or not.
When there is advertisement for other TV shows or films, it will probably affect the kids but also here the parents can help by just regulating the time her child is infront of the TV.
Important is that an advertisement don't scare kids.
I think the reasons why you should show little kids advertisement overweigh and I actually think, that isn't a big problem too.
Much more important is how the parents educate their kids.
Should advertising toward young children be allowed?
In this essay I will show off the advantages and disadvantages of this topic and comment on it.
Of course it is interesting for a little girl to watch TV and see a doll in the advertising that wants to play with her.
But what if the mother of the girl is so poor, she works everyday to be able to buy food and has no money for that doll?
The girls wants the doll so bad that the mother doesn't know how to react.
The doll can even talk and dance, but that is why she is so expensive.
Now imagine the girl never saw this advertising.
She wouldn't talk about this doll and her mother wouldn't be in despair.
In my opinion advertising toward young children shouln't be allowed.
Children don't earn money and can't buy things on their own.
Many children spend too much time on watching TV.
People go working and people have families.
Sometimes it is hard to connect working and having a family.
Exspecially if a mother thinks, that she can't make her daughter happy because of not buying a doll she saw while watching television advertising.
The following text discusses the statement if television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should be allowed or not.
Imagine, young children sitting infront of the television.
If those young children see advertising for the necessary or the right stuff it might be usefull that they watch this advertising.
Although they are directed toward the children the ads can be usefull for the parents.
But on the other hand they are just kids and so they would be totally influenced by this.
Even adults are influenced by advertising because it sticks to your mind and you can't influence which advertising you watch.
So young children who aren't grown up at all would be victims of those advertisings.
Furthermore if the parents don't control their kids they watch many of those ads so that in the end the children have a complete wrong view of the reality because they think thst those ads show the reality.
In my opinion, I would forbit those ads because I think that children should grow up without all the influence and should do other stuff then watching the tv.
So, I as a mother, would not want that my kid watches all the ads which show my kid a different way of the reality.
Did young children bacame addicted to modern technic?
In the following text I am going to discuss the question and will give my own opinion about the statement wether television should be allowed to young children or not.
I recognised that many children grow up  different since I bacame older.
Some of them does not know the old classics like playing outside "I build my one garden" or games which have to do with fantasy and your own imagination.
They replace their imagionation with a cartoon instead of thinking on their own.
I think it is important that you as a parent support the devolpment of your child.
Many young children are not really recognised by their parents.
Instead of spending their time with them they make their life easier and put them infront of a television.
I know that it is not easy to raise up a child, but you decided wether you can handle the stress and work or not.
You know that a child will bring up problems and(verantwortung) ......
It is not bad for the child if it watchs TV a few times a week, but it has to be controlled the time and easpacially what kind of TV they are watching.
Otherwise I think it is not possible to forbid television for children under five years, because each parents have their own way to let their kid grow.
It does not mean that television makes you child uncreative or stupid but showing your child how to handle all these unreal and given impressions is important for his/ her following development.
Finally I can say that I do not agree with the given statement, bacause if you forbit something it bacomes more interesting.
You have to know how to handle the modern development of technic in our world and not to allow something is not the right way.
Prepare your children right for the modern world.
In the following text i will discuss if "Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed"
General Television advertising influence of course all of the people,also young people,because the advertise is always shown in a perfect way without faults, because they want that everybody will buy the product,so therefore they will earn a lot of money.When young people see something very special for them on the television, they tell their parents that they want it, but they only want it, because it was shown so perfect and not because they tried it.
At the most time the products are very expensive and the parents do not want it to buy for the children.
But i also think that children with two years do not recognize the advertise so well than children with five years.
The two years old children will not react like five years old children, maybe they will strike or something like that,if they do not get that product.
But the two years old children will forget it and maybe their parents will buy another toy/product which is better and cheaper and the child will also be happy about it.
I think that the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" is right in a way, but i think that children until three years do not have the knowledge about that stuff, so that´s why i think young children until three can see television advertising, but for older young children until six or seven, when they come to school,it schould not be allowed, because they have the knowledge and can discuss withe their parents about it.
Many people don`t like advertisements for young children, especially for children from two to five.
First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.
And if they are allowed to - for  example half an hour, the parents (and the children too) doesn`t want to have different advertisements in TV.
The parents because they think it`s not good for the child, it may want something, it doesn`t need, and the child just wants to watch its series on TV.
Advertisements would only steal them their expensive and very short time.
Theres another argument against advertisements towards young children: Imagine, you`re a children at age two to five.
Would you be interestet in buying stuff to play with?
Yes, of course you would be.
So you ask your parents to buy these toys for you, and (as actually everytime you ask) they say no.
This is sad and depressing, isn`t ist?
So some companies may save the children from being sad and do the advertisements towards the parents, maybe with some deeper information for them.
But there are also some reasons for advertisements towars young children.
For so many children its too difficult to learn, that parents often don`t allow them to be outside until 9pm or like in this discussion, buying some playing stuff (from the advertisements) for them.
They must accept, that they cannot have everything.
And if they weren`t confronted by advertisements and the `no` of their parents, they never learn it.
Another important thing is the knowledge of the children.
They actually never get to know different toys, like 'Barbie', 'Lego' or even 'Playmobil'.
Probably the parents don`t go to a toy shop with their kids very often, so an advertisement is a good way to get to know some playing stuff.
And some of these different toys will show them tecnical and motorical skills.
So all in all I would say, advertisements for young children are a good thing to get them learn to hear a 'no' and to let their skills grow.
The only important point is the behaviour of the parents toward the children.
They are supposed to look for their children, to not let them too often watch TV and espacially not too long - it would be bad for the child.
Buying some (of course not everything they want) toys for the children and let them play with them or reading a book with them are much better opportunities.
Should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) be forbidden?
In  the following text I am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.
In the television there are several different ways of advertising for a product or an campaign.
For example songs that you will remember even four weeks later or situations out of daily life.
Besides you can watch advertisements in TV that show people who do embarassing things so that the spectators laugh about them.
That`s why there is the problem of advertisements directed toward little children in the age from two to five.
As they are able to sing the song that they listened to in television or want exactly these cookies that their star is eating in the advertisement too.
That these little persons are influenced by such advertisement is a sad fact.
One can pretend them from that by forbid them to watch TV.
Apart from television there are so much interesting things to do and let them know how things are working: for example showing them how to bake a cake, drawing pictures or doing other creative work.
But there are also reasons that are for the idea of allowing advertisements toward little children in TV.
The earlier they are confronted to advertisements the better they can resist them when they are older.
That would cause not buying the things that one has seen in TV but instead of that being independent from the advertisements.
All in all I would say that I don´t agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because I think that there is nothing to worry about if  little children come in contact with television advertisements.
So nobody cares when you watch them first.
It is clear that you are going to watch them ones and it could be a way to make people resistant to advertisements.
In the following text I am going to evaluate if I agree or disagree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Usually I would say that it does not matter to me what kind of advertisement they are showing during different shows or films, but this statement made me think about it.
And so now this is waht I came up with.
Advertisement is something that we all hate I guess I can say that.
But sometimes especially the ones for little kids are just funny and entertaining to watch.
Furthermore it is brilliant to see how happy kids can get just by watching the little clip of maybe just 10 seconds.
Also, isn't it just really nice to see all the new things they are inventing for them?
And sometimes you even feel like you want to be a little kid again just to be able to try all these brand-new amazing things.
But there is also the other side of the problem.
First of all I think that children in that age should not be watching as much television at all.
I feel like if they are watching all these advertisements between their movie they are going to want these things really bad most of the times.
We all know that situation don't we?
There is a new advertisement on the TV showing something really nice, you are going to get the feeling of really wanting to be owner of this.
So it can start to be really annoying, especially for parents, if kids will never stop talking about wanting what they just saw on the TV.
The parents, or somebody else, eventually has to buy it and after a while it gets boring or they are going to start wanting something new.
So people just keep spending money and more money on things their kids see in an advertisement.
Moreover industries invent toys or other things that are dangerous for kids.
If they are going to see that on the TV, they are going to really want to play with something like that.
In addition to that I can say that advertisements are rarely showing the truth.
Sometimes the toy or whatever isn't as fancy as it seems or people in the advertisement do not show the right behavior that the parents taught them before, so kids are going to question everything and we all know how annoying this could end.
Also, did you realize that we barely even have conversations in this time anymore?
We barely talk to each other and that is also because of people spending too much time with social media and other electronical devices.
I think the little kids from today should go outside and ask their friend about their new toy better than watching TV and seeing all the new things there.
I also remember me having fun to go outside and not having to worry about an television advertisement.
But I sure have to say that I remember me really wanting something from an advertisement as well.
As you can see this is a topic people could probably discuss about all day.
But in my opinion I have to say that I do agree with the statement above.
I think television advertisement toward young children should not be allowed, because there is so many more exciting things in this world they should see, and they shouldn't get jealous of other kids, because they have something new from the advertisement that they do not have.
And also, their parents would probably also have a much easier life.
In the following text I am going to mention some arguments for and against the statement: "Telivision advertising directet toward young children should not be allowed".
May one can say that advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, because it is allowed to be directed toward everyone in every age.
Of course it is a weak argument, but at least it is one.
Also one has to add that young children aged two to five normally do not watch TV that often.
Therefore it does not really matter if there is that kind of advertising or not.
But in case that the children watch TV nearly all day it could be helpful for later.
Maybe the children are not interested in this advertising in a way and do not listen to it or watch it.
So there is the chance that they won't be interested in advertisding later as well, so they won't be easily influenced.
But that is only guessed.
One aspect that is against television advertising directed toward young people is that it is not good to get influenced in this young age.
And if one thinks about it in a rational way, it becomes clear that children are interested in advertising.
Especially, if the advertising presents new things to play with.
Also, they do not really have the chance to have or to build an own opinion, because they are too young.
As a consequence they need to agree with the advertising or at least to believe it is true.
For example if it is about a new snack that is "so good for children, because it suppports them in becoming large and stong" but actually its main ingredient is sugarl.
So they believe in wrong things and regard lies as true.
This could be a problem for their later life, because they won't be able to see the difference between lies and  the truth.
All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.
That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+
In the following I tell you my oppinion of the question, if Television advertising directed toward young children between two to five years shuold not be allowed.
In my mind it is not a question of the age of the children, because i think that television is not good for anybody, but I think everybody has to chose for his self, because it is his or her life and not the life of the anyone else.
So I think, that the parents have to chose if there children are allowed to have a Television.
The children hast  to learn about the politics and know what is beeing in the world, but kids under five years would not be interested of the politics and the other things to learn in the Television, so the films and series for kids have to be kontrolled by the parents.
So they can not whatch films and series, which are not allowed for them.
The kids have to whatch films and series to learn also from them , who made for the children, but they dont have to have a Television for him or herself.
It is a part of the the youth of many kids, they not have to have a Television to have a good youth, because if the parents spend time for their children, they can also have fun without an own tv.
So if the parents dont want to allow a TV for the childs, they have to soend time for them.
But if the parents can say stop if the child whatched to much TV or watch movies and serier, which are not allowed to whatch for a child in  his age, then I think the Child should be allowed to have or watch TV.
To sum up, I am against this toward, because not every parents have time to spend time for his or her children and the Tv is a good alternative to entertain the children.
So every parents had to chose for his own child and also for themself.
Chlidren form the age of two to five have not been able to develop their own charcter jet, that makes them an easy target for advertisement, because they are easy to influence.
The Question now is, should advertisement directed to children, of the named age, not be allowed ?
Children of the age from two to five are the future of the human society, which means that they are the ones that will determ the things that will be bought, in the future, and the standards that will define our future society.
Advertisement for children does not have to be a bad thing, it can be used to influence them so that their behaviour will have a positive effekt on society and nature.
The promblem with advertisement, which is directet to children, is that it does not aim for a better futer.
The people that make the advertisment aim for money, they mainly see their own profit and not the negative influence they have on children.
By trying to sell their products, they can set unrealistic standars of beauty or material things that children may want to own one day.
The consequences of this can be depression, because nobody is happy with their body or with the stuff they own and they will simply be unhappy.
Children should have the chance to develop their own character as isolatet from advertisement as possible, so that they can find out for themselves, what they want to look like and what they want to own and in which way they can find pleasure and happines.
Bacause of these given arguments I come to the conclusion, that advertisment directet to children should not be allowed because it takes away their chance to develop their own individual charcter.
This statement is a very important question for the whole world.
It contains the whole earth and everybody is guilty for that.
At first I would say that television should not be allowed to young children, because they are to young and they should not sit next to the television.
The television could damage there eyes and that's not healthy too.
They should go out and playing, they have a lot of time in the following years to watch television or to work with the computers.
They should enjoy there childhood without the electric things.
But otherwise they can learn a lot in the television.
They can learn some new things with fun.
Especially with cartoons you can learn lot of new things.
There's no child who didn't likes to watch cartoons.
On the television you can learn something about the live, and you can be prepared for school.
Surely they are contra arguments.
The children can learn with other things, for example with puzzle or card games.
There are lot of other possibilites to learn something new.
At the age of two to five you start to explore the world.
You want to learn new things and you especially like the colours of the television.
My opinion is that the children should watch television, because when you are at the age of two to five you start to explore the world and the television is a really good possibility for do that.
You can learn a lot in the television, for example with cartoons.
Every child likes cartoons as apes bananas.
Surely it isn't so healthy to be next to the television all the time, but when you watch it regullary at many periods of time, than it can be really good for you.
I am definitely not agree to that .
A argument on the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".
First i will write the argument against the statement.
Children should decide themselves what they want and advertising helps them to gain information about the things they could possibly need.
In this age they are  already able to show us what they want.
The Children probably don't even understand the television advertisment, but the parents like the advertisment more when it is a well made advertisment.
Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.
Second i will write arguments for the statement.
The advertisment has an influence on the Children and in this age they don't know when they are under an influence.
Additionaly only the parents know what they can afford and the Children don't think about the price of something they just want it or not.
The Children might even get unhappy because their parents can not afford what they want, and the Children don't understand why their parents don't buy them what they want because they don't understand the use of money.
I think that television advertising that is directed towards young Children should not be allowed, but young Children should not watch much television and the parents should control what their Children watch.
Televison advertising to young children in the ages of two to five years should be allowed because they learn how to use the medium in a good way.
They should know which programmes they are allowed to see and which ones aren't good for their ages.
Televison adevertising can influence the children in a way so they would like to see all the stuff they hear and also see and have no feeling for a good amount af time they watch TV.
The televison can make dependant so the childrens have no feeling for how long it is good to look at the televison.
They only know the virtual world and haven't got an idea what else there is in the world.
The children haven't got lots of social contacts.
Later in school this can be a problem beacause they aren't able to work and play with other classmates or friends in the same age.
The televison also can make that the childrens which are often watch programmes suffer at being concentrated and have no feeling for a good amount of watching TV.
But the televison is usefull to learn important things like the colours or how to count or to learn the language.
But it is only good when they look at specific programmes which are especially made for childrens.
When they look at programmes which aren't allowed for their ages they can feel frighten.
In my opinion it isn't a good thing to advertising toward young children because they don't know which damage it can make when they look all the programmes which are directed to them.
But it can be a good thing if they watch at programmes which are especially made for them.
So they can learn to count, learn the colours or only to sleep better at night.
I think there shouldn't be televison advertising directed to young childrens becuase in my opinion the parents have the responsibility to their children if they are allowed to watch television and which channel their children are allowed to watch.
In the following text I will write a text about the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
First we live in the 20 century an it is impossible to use nothing technoligy.
Young children get up with new smartphones or other things.
The children in the age two to five get up too with the new technoligy.
Second I think young children haven't a own opinion and look at the persons at the television.
The persons give us a wrong point of view.
On the on hand parents have more time for oneself or other things.
And the young children watching Tv and have fun.
On the other hand the young children need fresh air and the conversation with parents or friends, wehn the children watching Tv all day, they are allone and haven't activity.
The televison has positiv points, because young children learn at the television colours or other things.
But a negativ point is that she learn things that she don't need for example bad words.
I think that it is important for young children watching television but it is important what they watch and how long, because they need conversation with other persons and activitys.
The question if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not is not very easy.
On one hand they might want to know what they could put on their wish list for their next birthday or christmas on the other hand these young children do not have much money or their parents guard it for them so they are not able to use money properly.
Personally I do not think much of the idea of television advertising directed toward young children aged betweent two to five.
Firstly I am convinced that these children won't know how to cope with the advertisings and they will want to have everything that the advertisements show them.
Furthermore I do not think that children aged two to five should watch that much television.
And if they watch there shouldn't be advertising in between the series they are watching.
If there are posters on the street advertising the new LEGOs that will be enough.
If they are intrested they will have a closer look at the advertisement and tell their parents that they want to have this new toy.
But i do not think it necessary to do television advertising for this young children since they will be confronted with advertising on computers and television soon enough.
In addition there are always pamphlets advertising for toys or something a small child would like to have.
If this advertising is also on television no one would dare to look at the pamphlet which is not the best version of a book but it is something physical you can go through at any time.
I am also convinced that there would be some advertisements that are bad and could harm children psychologically because the advertising of the one who pays the most will be shown the most.
To conclude I don't think it is  a good idea to do advertising directed toward children aged between two to five because they are simply to young to understand the meaning of an advertisement.
In order to benefit from their childhood they should not be watching that much television and my opinion is that there shouldnt be advertising interrupting their series.
There are different oppinions to the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two or five)should not be allowed."
In this essay I am going to give some arguments pro and contra this topic.
As children have Tv channels that are directly presenting shows for their age, it is logical that they have to get money.
TV channels like nickelodeon or KIKA are very common and the children like them very much so it would be sad for them to turn them off because the channels are not allowed to show advertising.
So it is important to show advertising to young children so the channels can stay alive.
Another argument is the industry that produces toys and other things for young children.
They really need to present their advertisements to children and not only to grown-ups because otherwise they would not sell nearly as much as they do now.
Children see the toys on the TV and ask their parents if they can have it.
When only parents would get advertisements for toys, most of them would not really care about it and they probably would not buy the toy the kid would have chose - especially the more expensive ones.
So the toy-industry needs the advertising toward young children to sell their products and get money.
Another argument for the advertising is that children always want to be treated as grown-ups so they like to watch advertising on television because it is a thing that is also on channels for older people and so they maybe feel more accepted as a child in the world of adults.
But there are also some convincing arguments against showing young children advertisings on TV.
The most important one is that the kids can be manipulated into buying things they see.
If a advertisement is really good and adresses the child with - for example - bright coulours and a catching name, the child is most likely going to want the toy or other thing it sees.
They will then ask their parent to buy it, but a lot of parents cannot spend as much money at toys even if they want to.
Some parents will maybe buy the toys and then do not have enough money left for other things.
If they would not buy the toy the child would be very sad or angry about his parents and probably also be bullied by other kids because they do not have the newest ball or other kind of things.
Besides that these toys can be really expensive, they also tend to be useless.
Especially kids at a very yound age really want to have a toy, then play with it for a while before loosing interest.
It will then lay in a cupboard and be forgotten.
After a while the child will fill its room with things it does not play with anymore and does not need it.
That might be not as bad at the first view but when the child grows older it is going to want a more adult room and then has to throw a lot of toys away or has to donate or sell it if possible.
In my opinion it is a very controverse thopic and I cannot say if I am against or for it.
I would rather make a compromise.
I think that we should allow companies to show their advertisements to young children and I think that we also should let the children watch it.
But in my opinion they should keep the amount of advertisements they show between kids TV channels to a minimum and they should also just play the advertisement at the end of a show so the kid does not get interrupted by it and as a result watches all the advertisements while waiting the show to go on.
Finally also the parents should keep an eye on their very young children so they do not spend all their time watching TV because TV itself is not very good for them either.
Is television advertising directed toward young children useful, unnecessary or should it even be forbidden?
In this statement it says that television directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I don't agree with this statement because I think there should be an equality between all advertiser and no one should be disadvantaged because of the fact that it is directed toward young children.
Almost everyone can advertise his products so why should these type of commercials be forbidden?
There are even commercials for health-influencing products such as cigarettes or alcohol.
This prohibition would cause an immense disequality which is unbearable fr today's society.
Although I must say that I don't think that these young children will be affected or influenced by these ads.
But still, it's in the advertisers own right to advertise their products.
The young children will see it on the television but most of the time they won't think about it for too long or they aren't even interested in what is shown to them.
It could be that they like the color or sound of it, for example when it's a toy, but even when they like the product it's still in the parent's right to buy it or not to buy it.
The parent's will decide if it's good for the child or not, because children aged two to five aren't yet able to decide for their own but the grown up people nowadays are able to decide for their own if they need the advertised product and if they want to buy it or not.
You can't take away the rightful freedom of these people, mostly parent's, to think and decide on their own.
To sum it up I think because of these following main reasons, the equality and freedom of advertisement and the people's right, most of the time the parent's right, to decide for their own whether they want to buy the product or not, I still disagree with the mentioned statement.
The statement is about ''television advertising toward young children'' and is a very complex topic with a lot of pros and cons.
I will start off with the pros, come to the cons after that and give my opion at the end.
At first children, especially at a very young age, are very easy to influence.
That is why parents always should pay attention about what they are watching.
They could get bad dreams about scary things they watch or develop a fear all of the sudden.
As they can be influenced so easily, they also might want to have every new toy they see on TV and rather look at these new things on the TV, than go out and play with the toys they already own.
Now I will talk abbout the pros of this statement: When the children see for example the toys, that they want to have, on TV, it is easier to buy them because their parents do not have to take them to the store.
If the child would come with them, they would probably find other toys and would want to buy them all.
Another reasons is that they would not even unterstand everything, so it is not important if they watch it or do not.
In my opion it is very important that children are protected from adversiting, because they are so easy to influence and probably believe the things that are said, even though they are not true.
I think that the channels should not be too influenced by that and that the always have to keep an eye on their children to prevent them from seeing something bad.
Todays selling strategies are especially about making money in any possible way and of course the advertising towards the costumer plays a big role for that.
But should there be an age limit that forbids it that younger children stand under the influence of the companies?
A well known strategy to make profit is adressing the costumer directly and in buisness all tricks are allowed, so why not make the product attracting to little children who are an easy target since they don´t think about the fact if they really need it.
Obviously it´s just an easy to make the commercial colorful and interesting so that the young kids get the feeling they despretly need that certain toy.
Of course it´s the parents that pay but the children are being annoying and loud for so long until they finally get what they want.
So some people might say those children are too young and shouldn´t stand under that influence because they can´t decide wether that toy is actually that much fun and laugh as it is presented on TV.
But that argument is quite small since the children might want something for the outdoor fun like a new special ball and so they want to play outside and stop sitting in front of the TV and that can´t be bad at all.
Finally I support the opinion that television advertising towards young children doesn´t have to be forbidden because it´s not just the influence of TV commercial even when they go to the shops with their parents the companies always try to get the young ones to be interested in their products.
So it wouldn´t make a difference at all for the children themselves just for the TV channels to reorganize the programm.
The statemant above leads to controversial oppinions.
So there can't be only one "right" oppinion.
Is varies from person to person because not everyone looks at this the same.
But I personally agree with this statement.
I think nowadays advertisings influence us a lot, even though we think they don't.
And young children are the ones that can be influenced easily.
I think it's really cruel taking advantage of that and making television advertisings to, in a way, "poison" young children and make them believe they need something only because it is said in the television.
Because in the end, children don't know what they really need and what is only a waste of money.
But of course, not a lot of parents can refuse a wish of their children and so in the end the winner is again the "money industry" which manipulated young children with the help of this advertising in case to reach their own goal.
It could also be the case that some parents just can't afford expensive new toys for their children.
But young children of course don't understand why they didn't get what they wanted and that makes them sad and angry.
And if other children get what they wanted and then play all together with it, it could be the the child whose parents couldn't afford a new toy gets left by alone and doesn't feel accepted.
And all of this only because someone made them believe they need to have this certain toy for example.
So yes, I think televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because only the money industry takes advantage of it and the manipulated young children and their parents are the only ones who could suffer from that, even though they're not aware of it.
On the one hand, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it's unhealthy for them to whatch television too often since that could cause that they don't move enough.
It's important that children go outside and move instead of sitting in front of the TV the whole time.
Moreover, they could get used to technic too much when they already whatch TV in that young age too often.
They want to use computers, smartphones and tablets etc.
in their future way too often because they think it's just normal and everybody does it because television advertising directed toward young children was allowed.
So they stay in their room all the time and don't go outside because they can have contact with their friends by using their smartphones which is very unhealthy.
On the other hand, television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because it's very interesting for them because they can learn something.
For instance, there are many shows on the TV that are especially for very young children and that try to teach them something by having fun which can be very effective.
In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed but the parents shouldn't let their children whatch TV too often because it's very important for their health and social life that they also do other things, for example play with their friends.
I think that the parents should make a rule that says how long their children are allowed to whatch TV and what they are allowed to whatch, for instance half an hour a day and just the programm that's especially for childrem so that it can't happen that the parents sit their children in front of the TV so that they don't have to care about them.
It's very important that they undertake something with their children, for example they could go to the playgroung.
In the end, I'd like to say that young children should be allowed to whatch TV because it can be interesting for them and they can learn something.
But their parents have to whatch that they don't do it too long.
In the following, I will write an essay discussing the prohibition of television advertising toward young children.
On the one hand, there seems to be no need for a prohibition of especially this type of advertisements since most of the children aged 2 to 5 are allowed to watch television anyway and are therefore confronted with other advertisements, that might have an even more negative impact on their development, e.g.
alcohol advertising.
On top of that, there is the chance that these advertisements create an interest the children can dedicate their life to, e.g.
playmobil toys of Ancient Rome may create a passion for this epoque.
Nevertheless, this includes the risk of bad habits that may have a negative influence on their further life.
So, on the other hand, we have to consider this kind of television advertising as dangerous, as parents cannot realize their ideas of education anymore if they allow their children to watch televion.
For example, they might consider a close contact to nature as necessary, but due to an advertisement, their child is completely fixed on the advertised toys and does not want to leave the house anymore.
All in all, I think that it is necessary to differentiate.
Advertising addressed to young children can create both a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing one's life.
Eventually, it depends on the content of the advertisement and how the parents can include this in thei
First of all what is declarated as a television adverising?
TV, I think that was not that hard but what about smartphones, computers, consoles and so on.
There's basically no difference young children sitting in front of a screen or a monitor.
The main problem is that you can't really stop it because everybody else is doing it, Elders have a bad influence because we watch TV and use smartphones, so the children want to have this as well.
There's no international limit for TV or other electronic devises so how can you say it should not be allowed.
Sure it's sad that there's basically no longer a childhood without those things but I think today it's normal that you have a TV at home.
Don't get me wrong, it's sad to see like two are three years old children just sitting there and watching TV all day and for older generations that not normal but the world and technology are changing.
Today you plenty more options that you haven't like 30 years ago or even 10 years.
It's normal that todays activities are different then those back years ago.
The main problem I see is who controls whether the two to five years old are watching TV or something like that or not.
And what is the penalty if they do?
It's really hard to control that, nearly impossible because almost everybody has those television devices at home and it's really easy to ge them so you can't just stop it.
In my opinion this statement is just silly because you can't execute it and in todays world television advertising is a part of our life.
Some people don't like this but it is what it is, you can't really do something against it.
I see the point of this statement, I think it's not good too when a seven year old already has a smartphone and three year olds watching TV all day but today this may be declarated as "normal".
Young children can be easiliy influenced by everything.
So if they watch TV, an advertisement could easily make them want to have the product shown in the advert.
So there comes up the question, should TV advertising dirceted towards young children be forbidden.
There is the question, how far we are gonig to go, to protect our children.
And although an advert could heavily influence them they are most likely not going to grow up, if they don't get in contact with adverts.
Because if they don't get adressed, while they are 2-5, they are going to be when they are 6.
So how is there any difference.
If they dont get the experience of watching adverts, they will not be able to deal with them, even if they are  older.
Furthermore these adverts don't damage the kids at all.
They are just showing new toys, of cereals.
And even if they are trash, why ahouldn't the companies have the right, to show the world, what they created there.
The children have to learn, that not everinthing is like it looks in the advert.
And even if it makes them cry, it will form their character.
Finally, the adverts might want to make a child force their parents to buy a toy for them.
And if it cries because they wont, then it will have to learn its' lesson.
And if the parents want to give their sweetie anything it desires, and they have to buy every f***ing toy it sees in an advert, then don't blame the advert, but blame the parent.
In my opinion, there is no real reason to forbid such TV adverts, because the experience of such things are very importat for children of that age.
There are no convincing arguments for this ponit and I am sure, that this is never going to happen, because it doesn't make any sense at all.
BUt
Concerning the given statement about television advertising toward young children, people have differnt opinions.
Some are convinced they should not be allowed while others don't mind them.
In the following, the statement will be evaluated.
On the one hand, children are constantly confronted with all sorts of advertising, as they watch television.
Ads that are directed toward people their age would be better for their intellects than those that are meant for adults only.
To keep them safe from sexual and violent subjects, it would be helpful to show the right ads on channels they watch.
On the other hand, chidren aged two to five should generally not be allowed to watch television regularly.
If parents are responsible with their childrens' time management, there is no need for TV companies to show ads directed toward them.
It is important to mention that children do have a say in what their parents buy them.
Having seen an interesting ad about a toy for example can have them begging for it.
But actually, those children are not customers yet.
They don't have a say in what their parents buy them.
Therefore, advertising about toys and other childrens' products should also be directed toward parents, since they are potential customers - not the children themselves.
In conclusion, even though children are an important part of today's economy, they should not be confronted with advertsing directed toward them in public media.
Advertising follow us through our whole life.
Even young children are used to listen and see advertising.
But is that right?
Should young children be influenced by television advertising?
In the following I will discuss this statement.
On the one hand young children have to learn how to deal with advertising.
For example that not everything what is said in advertsings is right or usefull.
If they don't learn that early they may have problems with it later.
On the other hand advertising could be an bad influence either.
If young children are confronted with so much advertising that they didn't even realize that the things in advertising aren't real and in cause of that they will believe in things that aren' real and build their world on wrong thoughts.
For example that little girls could think that unicorns and elves are real because they saw that in TV.
It could be hard for the parents to explain their kids that the unicorns are only animated and that they don't live in the real world.
Such a statement could be shocking for a young child.
But it is normal for kids to believe in things that aren't real, like princesses or fairytales.
If they grow up they will realize that they lived in castle of fantasies.
It is a normal experience for kids and nothing to worry about because it worked for generations of children.
Furthermore the parents could prepare their kids.
For example it is necesarry to talk about the advertising and the parents should explain their kids that you can't buy everything just because it looks fantastic in the advertisement.
They could make a trip through the supermarket and show their kids the toys of the television advertising and show them either that they aren't that fantastic.
Besides they are confronted with advertising anyways for example in the supermarket or the streets or magazines.
It is hard to completly isolate children and protect them from advertising.
To come to a conclusion I am of the oppinion that with the right leading from the parents even young children could navigate through the jungle of television advertising and they will learn how to deal with it.
It is the best way to prepare kids for the future.
It isn't nedded to forbid television advertising for young children because it isn't needed to protect them from anything if they know how to protect themselves.
Television advertising has a big role in modern society.
Cigarettes, snacks or smartphones.
Almost everything has its own advertise.
But what about toys for kids?
Do they need advertises directed to them or does it has a negative effect on them?
Should television advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?
Advertising has an effect on everybody, no matter if he or she is young or old.
Nevertheless it's not a secret that little kids are likely to be influenced by such things.
If a kid sees that this toy is the best, like it is said in the advertise, it believes that it is tne best.
But sometimes things are to expensives to affort for some families.
A kid who believes only this toy is the best could be frustrated or sad if it does'nt get this toy, a situation that could be strenghten by other children who have this toy.
Furthermore could the other kids begin to bully a kid who has not got the best toy like they said in the advertise.
Anyway the modern world is full of advertises.
Not only in TV but also in the internet at train stations or on walls in cities.
So where is the difference between an advertise that says :"Parents buy this or that for your kids because it's the best", or if it says:"Kids look, that's the best toy in the world".
The message is the same for children.
They see this toy is the best and they want it.
Especially kids aged two to five can not differentiate between advertises directed to them and advertises directed to other persons.
Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.
They have to make them clear that not everything said in television is right.
On the one hand a confrontation with this kind of advertising could be bad on the other hand children can only learn from it if they are confronted with it and learn to spectate advertising from other perspectives.
I think rather than ban advertises directed to kids from television it is more important to teach the kids how to deal with advertises.
If they'd just be abandonned the kids would never learn how to deal with things or persons that try to manipulate them.
Maybe they would even be easier influenced by populists than other persons if They did not learn howe to say :"No!"
Nowadays, many advertisments on television feature cute toys, aiming to attract young children to want them.
Because these children are usually at a very young age, it is discussed whether to ban these ads or not.
Many parents know the struggle of their kid seeing something quite expensive and useless on TV, like a flying barby-doll or a self-destructing car.
The kids might be sad if their parents decide not to give these items to them.
They might even become angry at them, throwing a tantrum if they want something really bad.
This is not just bad for the atmosphere in the family itself, but could also affect the childs mental health, if they feel like they never ever get what they want the most.
On the other hand, if the kids stay nice and quiet, they might have the chance to get the thing they want for christmas.
Without the ad about it on television, they maybe would have never known that this special thing existed in the first place, and if the parents decide to give it to them for birthday or christmans, the child will be very happy.
One cannot forget though, that children aged two to five may not have a sense for rational thinking or are conscious about money's worth at all, so they might see some completely useless and easily breakable item on TV, which they then want to have for christmas.
And if they parents don't look up details about that item and just trust their child because it makes it happy, the child might end up with a broken toy, which will make them even more sad.
By far the best point to make is that no matter what the child wants, no matter how sad it will get, everything is always up to the parents.
If they decide not to buy something, their kid will just forget about it after a while (we've all been there) and everything's just fine.
And if the parents have a lot of money and don't care about what they buy in the first place, why not show these children some cool toys on TV to make them happy?
Concluding, I'd say that ads aimed towards young children shouldn't be banned, because as one can see, really no matter what, it's always up to the parents.
If the kids throw a tantrum, they'll get over it sooner or later.
The ads are perhaps the best way to get to know new products, and I think the children deserve to sometimes (not always!)
get what they want, even if it is not the best thing to buy.
This way, they can also learn from it and maybe develop a sense for what's good and what's not, so they can better decide what to buy for themselves when they're older.
As technoglogy evolves more and more product selling companies find more ways to advertise their products and trick people into believing they need those products, this being achieved by making use of several psychological tricks and methods.
And since there aren't only products for adult people the focus is also on teenagers and children.
In fact a lot of companies only sell toys for children, making this an essential part of our economy.
But keeping in mind how companies find ways to manipulate their potential customers the question arises whether or not advertising, in particular on television, directly addressed to children should be prohibited.
In order to support this statement one could argue and say that due to their childish minds and behaviours kids are much more easily tricked into doing an believing things than adults, making it much easier to make them want to have certain things.
Someone may take this to an extreme and say that kids' childish natures are being abused, which is highly questionable from a moralic point of view.
Furthermore children influenced by tv ads are going to to try and make their parents buy those certain products which they most likely won't thus frustrating the kids and all in all causing unnecessary tears.
Despite having taken the negative aspects into consideration the opposing side should have jusgt as much attention.
So eventhough tv advertising might influence children there is no sign that it causes any major negative effects or even damgage to them, it does not hurt them after all.
Has there ever been a child being seemingly damaged by wanting a new toy car?
Doubtful.
In order to answer the question as to whether or not such tv ads should be banned or not the companies' perspectives should also be taken into consideration.
From their point of view advertising is essential to find potential customers.
And also if they suddenly weren't allowed to show ads on tv anymore they'd surely find another way to advertise their products, for example via smartphones.
Giving attention to both sides we can conclude that tv advertising should not be banned.
The statement "TV advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" is about what impact ads can make to humans especially to young children.
It depends on their parents.
If their parents are strong and do not buy their kids everything they want to have, ads will not have a big impact.
It also depends on which ads are showed.
If there are only advertises about things that kids do not need like insurances or cars no one will bat an eye.
It will get interesting when advertises are shown with kids as target.
The children will try to force their parents to buy them the things they have seen on the TV.
But if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine.
So it is very important to show the children who has the power.
In addition children from two to five are not that good in arguing.
They will just say something like: "I need this toy (please) buy it Daddy!"
and if the parents are smart they will tell them that they do not need it so the parents will not buy it.
The children have no other choice than accepting this, except for begging or crying.
But if the parents stay cool and maybe ignore the children while they are crying they will soon stop doing it.
Another fact is, that some ads which children should not see are shown at night or in the late evening.
So there is no danger that children could see ads they should not see.
So I disagree with this statement because smart parents are stronger than any advertise and if they are not they should think about their role as a parent.
If you've ever accidently switched to a TV channel for kids while watching television or have children yourself, who  watch these channels, you've probably encountered the high amount of long advertisment blocks in which products like expensive toys, sweets or lemonade are being presented.
In today's world a lot of parents use modern media to entertain their kids, because of what it is important to question the effect of these advertisments on the younger generation, especially on the not yet developed children aged two to five.
These ads are a big part of the marketing campaign of the toy and sweet manufacturers; banning them for being inappropriate would seriously harm these companies as there wouldn't be many ways left they could reach the kids, there target group.
The ways left would be the internet, which is also often used by young children, and the direct advertisment in the streets.
Yet, one should consider that the advertisments are always flashy and show the happy children who use the product.
They never show what effects the lemonade has on their health, if it is unhealthy and full of sugar.
Their effect is always hidden as the parents wouldn't allow their kids to buy the advertised product.
It is wrong to sell an unhealthy product to innocent children.
Also important is that the children aren't really developed yet; they haven't had many experiences with money and aren't able to decide whether the board game they wan't so badly is overpriced.
Often, the parent would give in on their child, which is not going to give up on that toy.
Considering all of these facts, it is somewhat clear, that the target group of children aged two to five isn't yet ready to be influenced and also manipulated by the toy companies.
I
Advertisment has an big influence on our society.
It can have a big impact on how we behave and what we spend our money on.
So should young children at the age of two to five have contact with advertisment for their age already?
First advertisment directed toward young children would be very effective, because it would reach not only the children but the parents as well.
Parents are often not able to resist the wishes of their children.
That is why the profit of companies selling for example toys would rise.
Futhermore advertisment is needed to inform the public about new products.
It is important to inform the customers, buying toys, clothes and everything else for young children, about new products and innovations, too.
On the other hand young children at the age of two to five can not make their own buying decisions and they are not able to handle money.
Becauso of that it may be more effective to publish advertisment directed to middle-aged people, because they as parents decide instead of their children.
Even though young children have contact with advertisment every day, advertisment directed to them would have a bigger impact on them and their behavior.
They also do not know about the risks in our society and whether something is good or bad, because they are just at the begining of their developement.
That is why they can be manipulated very easily.
Advertisment can be developed in a way that may have a hidden influence on their opinion later.
Summarising all points I can conclude that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because of the negative impact this could have on their development and because of them being not reasonable enough to make their own decisions and to realise whether something is good or bad
Advertising has always been a very controversial topic, even in the early days of printed media, there have already been provoking and oftentimes rather strange means used by certain companies to advertise their products.
But since the implementation of television in the last century, it has quickly began to develop into an even more pressing issue.
Mainly because the audience who is exposed to said advertisements is growing ever younger, with children as young as two years of age already actively watching television.
This of course raises the question whether or not these children should also be considered a potential target group by companies, with advertisements directly targeted at them, or if this process should be strictly banned in order to protect those children.
Certainly one could argue that advertisement has no measurable impact on the behaviour of children, and while that might be true, it is also worth considering the fact that the exposure to advertisements requires a basic understanding of the market, of being able to manage your income, carefully determining whether or not an investion really is worth it.
Young children obviously have in most cases not yet developped these abilities, which means that they cannot make an informed decision on whether or not to like a certain product, but rather are lured in by the most mesmerizing advertisment.
And this isn't really what the free market should be about, although it may cause great profit to certain companies, it undoubtedly exploits young human beings for the sole sake of earining money, which I personally would deem immoral.
Of course it is now possible to state that while the advertisements might be directed at children, it is ultimately their parents who are at fault, firstly for exposing them to television at such a young age and secondly for letting them spend their pocketmoney on everything they want without supervision.
And this is indeed the case, yet only partially, because parents can't be blamed for exposing their children to something they had no prior knowledge of that it even existed.
They simply were naïve enough to trust the advertisors, assuming that they would never resort to such despicable means.
But it also has to be conceded that parents should at all cost supervise their children while they are spending their pocketmoney, especially at such an early age, and this has become a problem of quite some magnitude, as many parents no longer show real care for their offspring while shopping, a phenomenon which can easily be observed by visting a store of choice at a busy hour of day.
In conclusion, I personally would argue that despite the partial irresponsibility which can be attributed to the parents, companies should be strictly prohibited from directing their advertisement towards a audience too young to understand even the underlying meaning, the concept of advertisement.
And while it might not have an impact on them directly, it still exploits them.
Thusly I would describe companies directing their advertisements towards young children as being exploitative, driven by greed rather than compassion, and downright disgusting.
I can understand that companies direct their advertising towards young children, because in that age, children can be manipulated very easily, and while adults and other children are better able to decide wether they actually need the advertised product, they only care about the great video and not about what the product actually is.
And while they usually are not able to actually buy these things, they are often able to heavily influence their parents when insistin on wanting to have something.
This means, that this kind of advertising can be very efficient, because more and more younger children watch television on a regular basis, so more and more companies direct their advertising towards this age group.
This means that children are manipulated more and more often, and in my opinion that should not be allowed.
When children are heavily influenced by advertising, this leads to children trying to convince their parents of buying a product much more often as they already do, and this habit puts a much greater strain on the parents, who will probably give in to their children more and more often, because they have not got the strength to have similar fights over products over and over again.
As probably mostly sweets and things to play with are advertised, children will probably eat more sweets, which could lead to more children being overweight.
And as people often keep eating habits when growing up, this might increase the already big problem of obesity in the future.
Additionally, parents will spent more money on sweets and mostly unneccessary things, which can be a problem in families which are not wealthy.
Therefore, I completely agree with the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed", because forbidding this kind of advertising could reduce many problems in families.
In a few points I'm disagree with the statement because I think it't sometimes important that children can watch television to learn something about the wolrd or our culture for example the tales from disney are full of important things like moralism and that the feelings are more important than good looking so how it is in "The Beauty and the Beast".
But there are some points I'm agree with the statement.
For children it's very important to go outside and learn something from our nature and maybe to get dirty is also a part from being a child.
They should find some friends and play with them to improve their social life.
And I think when their outside the children learn more from physics and their see with their own eyes how the world functions.
Chidlren can watch television maybe when the wheather isn't optional for playing outside or when there's no one who they can play with.
And there should also be a maximum given from the adults, they shouldn't watch television for more  than four hours a week.
For children from this age it is also very improtant to have a lot of contact with their adults to make a good relationship.
The children have to learn how to feel and how to react to other people feelings.
This is why I'm agree with this statement.
I think the children would get some squared eyes.
I agree with the statement.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Because I think that televisions for itself have a bad influence.
Children don't learn anything useful when they watch TV, they get lazy and television advertising directed toward them is very bad.
Aged two to five are not able to think like adult people and they could get the advertising wrong.
It is likely possible that they are, after they have seen it several times, convinced that they need to have for example this little car.
Then, parents are pressurised to buy the child the car or the child would be very sad.
Also his or her friend could make fun of him or her because the child does not have the car.
The marketing industry takes advantage of the normal behaviour of young children and I think that this is not very human friendly.
The only reason why I could disagree with this statement is that the effect of televison advertising direced toward young children is not very well known.
Maybe there is also a positive influence.
Maybe the future children can handle money better than we do now.
Over all there are better things to do for young children than sitting around and watching TV.
And if they are not watching TV they can not see the television advertising.
Problem solved.
Television advertising is as popular as never before.
As we know advertising wants to make us buy products.
What most people don't know is that they create ads which stay in our mind unconsiously.
This means that we can think of a product which occurs to be silly but in the end we buy it because one saw it in an advertising before.
This strategy is dangerous espacially when it is directed towards young children.
They are influenced easily and get obsessed with something before you know it.
Should it  really be allowed to play with childrends minds just to enhance the profit of the industry?
Advertising is probably one of the most important aspects in terms of selling and promoting a product.
If one set boundaries for certain companys it would create an unfairness.
A free market is what most of the people are looking for.
We must consider that we already have some products which are not able to be advertised in televison, for example cigarettes.
Why is most certainly obvious, it harms people.
Directing advertising to children could be harmful too, doesn't it?
Maybe not physically but mentally.
It gives them an unrealistic illusion and can lead to problems for parents too.
They have to deal with their needy children.
In my opinion advertising directed towards young children mustn't have a greatinfluence.
It is the wrong way to make people buy their products.
The causes of this should be taken into consideration.
Especially young children are getting easily influenced by television.
Nowdays, advertising is a normal part of the television.
The question is if this advertising should be forbidden because of the influence that it could take on young children.
A lot of children may not be even able to understand advertising in normal television, so they would be rather nerved as influenced.
There are some products that may not be shown to children.
For example alcohol.
Children should not think that alcohol is as cool as it is getting presented.
Advertising on channels who are made for kids are something else - the way the product is getting presented will be a lot more interesting for a kid than for an adult.
An easy way to prevent children from this danger is a regulation of the time a child is watching TV.
Too much TV time leads to a bad eyesight and maybe to a bad social abillity because of the fact that a lot of kids are watching TV for hours and hours without speaking to everyone or to get in contact with new friends or kids.
For me advertising towards young children is not a problem.
The parents should care about the time their child is sitting in front of a TV and if the child is watching something that is meant to be for his age.
Imagine that there would not be advertising anymore - where is the money for the channels coming from ?
Some channels would not be even able to exist.
Advertising is one of the main money makers for channels and it would be a really hard challenge for some of the smaller ones to keep showing the same content as before.
Another point that can be discussed wether good or bad is, that children get inspired for their whishes on christmas.
I think this is something that can be as good as bad.
I will arguement regarding to the statement:"Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" in the following lines.
The television advertising directed toward children could confuse the children because they dont know how to deal with the situation.
There could be, for example a bid teddy bear on the television, who tells the children, that they should buy him and that he is the best teddy bear, that they will ever have.
Young children aged two to five won't notice, that thos is just a PR strategie and that this teddy bear can not speak with them.
But it is also a good train for children for learning how to deal with treat from the internet or the television, so they learn how to handle in situations like these.
Most of the time the parents can tell them, that th eteddy bear can not speak and that the things he says in television are just a lie, even if they still want the teddy bear, the spreadings from the parents are mostly deeper and more respective for the children than the ones out of the television.
There is also a problem given by television advertisement, because a lot of children are feared by the figures or symbol in the advertisement spots (clowns, big bears,lions, etc) so they cant sleep at night and are scared to go outside.
This is a problem for their process of growing up, because they'll always have the picture of the big clown they saw when they where four inside their head eventhough they dont notice it specially anymore, but it will still be on the inside.
But television advertising towards children with two years is not a big problem, because the children with two years will not notice, that it is towards them and they wont notice what is going on in these advertising spots, so the parents can be calm, beecause it isnt a big problem to deal with.
Furthermore these advertising spots can bring the children to bad ideas, for example, when their parents will not buy them the bid teddy bear, they just go inside the shop and steal it, because the teddy bear said, i want you to own me or cuddle me.
There are a lot of children who get treated by those spots.
This can be a start for an criminalisation of the children.
All in all I can say, that these advertzising spots towards children with two to five years are unnecessary and lean them to do criminal things.
None of the children in these ages will have enough money to buy these stuff, so these spots should not be allowed.
Kids in this age can´t buy everything what they see on the tv, but they want to have it and talk to their parents and they will buy it.
Also I think that parents have to told their children that it isn´t everything real what they see on tv.
But I think children are very easy to manipulate, so on some tv channels for children there isn´t television advertising.
For example the german tv channel 'KIKA'.
Also children don´t know the risks of television advertising, they have to learn it when they will grow up.
Another aspect is that children believe in everything what they see.
For example they see on the tv that you are cooler if you eat 'Fruchtzwerge', children want to have 'Fruchtzwerge'.
In this case parents have no choice and will buy the thing the children want to have.
So I think that television advertising toward young children should be not allowed, because they are too young and can be manipulate.
But companys earn a lot of money with this television advertising, so it would be hard to forbidden televison advertising toward young children.
Sould advertising directed to young children (aged two to five) be allowed or not?
This is a very controversial question and it is hard to decide between yes and no.
I would like to evaluate the two options and come to a conclusion, answer or solution.
A lot of people believe that it is unethical to introduce children to the world of this kind of economy at the age of two years.
These young children should not bother about whether they want a pink barbie doll or a blue pegasus-unicorn just from looking at television advertisements because they could have been influenced too much.
It might be possible that they don´t even want some of the things shown in the advertisement but beg their parents anyways just because they´ve seen it on TV.
Sure, there are other people who say that thats the concept of advertising but most people do not want to buy some things to their children and experience that they don´t use it or play with it.
Another argument against advertising directed to children is that it might not be worth it for some companies to direct it to children.
Not many children watch television at the age of two or don´t understand the content of the advertisement.
That sounds like the companies that make adverts for children lose more money by putting the advertisement on national television than for actually selling the product.
However, the parents of the young children might want to buy some of the products because they believe that they are good for their toddlers and that they might enjoy it.
Seen from this angle, those television spots aren´t directly produced for young children but more for parents of young children.
I belive that television advertisements should not be directed toward young children because I believe that it is just a waste of money and time for the companies that decide to produce a  television advertisement because I belive that young children don´t need to watch television and they shouldn´t be talked into  things they don´t truly want.
In my opinion, advertisements can be directed to children aged five and older because I believe they can handle the input of information better that chikdren younger than five.
I will talk about the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five)should not be allowed", in the following essay.
In our generation it is normal that children have a mobile phone and a "I pad" or something like this.
When they do not have the best of the best they were uncool and sometimes they get bullied by other children.
The parents try to get them back to the old times, like playing in the garden or reading a book.
When I was 5 years old I`d love to play with my friends or with my babyborn.Furthermore, I do not even really now what happens around the world or what televison can be.
Sometimes I watched movies for children but never a ducumentary.
Nowadays, children at this age have their own TV in their room and there are many shows whitch are not good for them or things they can not understand at this age.
Moreover, they here something about political stuff in the trash tv and they think it is right if its not adressed to them.
So, firstly the positive thing is that the children can learn something about the world very early and they do not need to talk to their parents or read a book but thats really sad, for me.
Indeed, the show were adressed to children and so there would be a lenguage for this age to understand and the surrounding would be great to see.
But children will watch this the whole time and do not even know how to read a letter or a book.
Likewise, I agree with the point that it should not be allowed.
Yes, children need education but in the age of two to five they are to young.
They do not must know this stuff and they do not buy anything.
So, they should play or read and for me this tv advertisings should be allowed at the age of 12 because there you can start to think about what they talk about.
Some people say that children need as much education as they could get but not at this age.
Think about your childhood ?
Can you imagine to watch and important is to understand what the people what from you in this advertising.
At this moment, I totally agree with this statement and it should not be allowed, everything else is to much for this children.
Also, when it is adressed to this children we do not know if they show bullshit there so the parents were not happy when they see the trash but I must tell at least that the children would only watch this shows and not everything else what is badly for them to see like a horror movie.
But that did not change my opnion!
Medias have become a big part in a human's life.
Almost in every corner of our life there are machines and therefore displays.
As we know, the influence of medias begins in young ages because children like to watch TV.
But what do  children want to see?
Of course the program.
But between the end and the beginning of a new program there are breaks  -advertised breaks.
So is it a good or bad for a children aged between two and five to see these advertisings?
First of all, it can give the children a sense for technology.
They start to understand that technology is important and that this has to be improved.
During the advertisings they get to see other machines like planes, computers etc., other machines than a TV.
This can support their interests.
Secondly, even they do not realize it, they start to learn.
They learn how many interesting things the world has to offer.
Therefore, later they are motivated to learn more about the world and its cultures, toys and people.
For example, there is a chinese toy on the TV.
Later the kid asks itself where the toy comes from because he could not find the toy in any stores in its country.
In addition to these arguments, there are far more negative aspects about the television advertising.
In young years the creativity is very important for a child.
They learn to understand and discover many things by doing things.
For example transforming a wooden stick to a knife of a king.
They can create their own ideas and have fun to do things because in comparison to the TV there is no one who says them with which toys they have to play in their age.
Secondly, the influence is too strong and kind of dangerous for them.
There are girls' and boys' toys and these are presented by very smart kids.
Sometimes by unreal kids.
That means that even in young years they start to doubt in themselves and ask themselves if they are good enough for the world.
As it shows it can very dangerous for children.
Finally, television advertising should not be allowed.
Because the danger that children start to doubt in themselves is too big.
They are not secure about themselves any more.
This can lead to very big problems in their entire life.
Therefore, we have to protect the children from this kind of bad influence and stop television advertising.
For first it should be said, that a directive like this propably never will happen to the television, because would get´s more and more digital.
But thinking of the consequenses of some kind of Television this might be a good way to keep that kind of stuff away form this young children.
For example Psychomovies ore Some Thrillers or Actionmovies.
This basically has nothing to do with the normal programm young children watch today, but if they get used to watch TV every days since they are maybe 3 years old they might start watching this kind of movie ways earlier then they should.
Another problem could be that this children might have some problems to make friends later bcause they are so used to watch TV all the day that they maybe keep doing this when
 the´re already in school.
Even there school grades would be a problem if they are just watching TV all day on regular basis, and do not learn vokabularies or for some class test´s.
On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.
For exapmle there are several knowlegde shows for kids on TV they can watch to learn a bit more about the world and some other things that might be interesting for them.
This is an easy way for these kids to get some general knowledge and gives there parents some time to do other things then working or having a look at what there child is doing.
In my opinion there is no way that the gouvernment ore anyone else then the parents can say how much and when there children are allowed to watch TV.
I  do think that there are to many children watching allot to much TV nowerdays but as I said, the important thing is to show the maybe futural parents what could happen if they do not handle this problem.
But according to the specific statement from the adversiting i say no it should be allowed, because if the parent regulate the TV usage of there children right it has allot of advantages for there further live.
Should television advertising directed toward your children in the age of two to five years be allowed?
On the one hand the small children should get to know the real world and how it works since the moment they were born.
It might be quite a good lesson for young children to consider diffrent options of living.
In the young age it's essential to learn many diffrent lessons about life.
One of the most important one is to understand, that there are milions of people living in this world and that there always will be different thing, you wanna buy.
The lesson, to not always get what you want is quite important and necessary for life.
A television advertising toward young childern might be an amazing help for specific lessons in the education.
On the other hand television advertising toward children can be followed by extremely deep familyproblems.
If children, not having a big amount of money in the family, everyday get to see this advertising with happy children playing funny games, they really get to  belive that other kids might be much happier than them.
They get to see how money leads to positiv emotions.
The good thing about children is to see how happy they are and how much fun they can have requireing nothing.
If childern in their early age get used to see people beeing happy because of investigated money, they will always in life tend to think that richness leads to happiness.
A young kid will never understand that advertising hasn't anything to do with real life.
Many of aus us it every day.
the smartphone.
the tablet.
the computer.
and there are critics an people which see a chance in the using of this new technology.
but is it ok to give that high technology devices to children aged two to five?
Or shouldnt it be allowed to give them to young children?
I can see this situation very often for example in my family or also on public places.
The poblem with this is that the children cant imagin that its not real what they see.
And its the same with tv advertising.
When the children with two years lern to do the things from the tv advertising, they maybe start smoking with twelve years.
On the other hand the advertising could help the parents find out what the children want.
E. g. for present for the birthday or christmas.
but there are also prospects.
I thing that the young generation shouldnt see the advertisment on the tv for themselve.
But when the companies will be allowed to make advertising spots only for young children the parents are able to take of the tv or when teh children see something, the parents decide if they buy the product or not, because they are in the need of paying it.
Personally I think that the Television advertising directly towards young children should not be allowed because the children are in they own developement aged two to five.
The advertisment should also expect the consumer to buy and that are in this age the parents.
In the following essay we are going to discuss the statement, whether it should be allowed to show television advertisment, which are focused on children between two and five years old or not.
On the one side it should be allowed to show such as these advertisments, because the children are more informed, what is in trend and can compare with other children.
They usually don't read newspaper or magazines, so they can see things from the televeision.
But there are many problems if children see advertisments which are focused on them.
The brain of children in this age is not so developed like a brain of an youth or an adult.
They believe almost everything.
Children can also be influenced more easily by different things.
If you tell a child that Santa Clause exists, it will believe.
But an adult knows that it is not true.
They also do not have this critical thinking of things that adults have.
In my opinion it should be not allowed to show TV advertisments for children between two and five.
They see something colourful, beautiful, etc.
and for them it seems to be the best thing in the world.
They will annoy their parents to buy this thing.
TV ads are just made to manipulate a child's brain, because of the straightforward thinking.
In todays' life it is very difficult to keep children away from electronic media.
Because everyone has a TV or something similar in his home.
So the advertisment companies use this as an advantage and manipulate a child's brain.
Now i will count on some arguments for the statement.
Television should not be allowed for young children because they would see pictures they don't understand and which are not made for young childs.
They shouldn't see that pictures, because they could be afraid of things they should not afraid of, like Zombies in a Horrormovie.
Additionally they need the time to play outside and experiance the world and they can't do that because the TV is always more interrestic for young children, it' normal.
Furthermore young children could start of having an unreal view of the world because they just see the suggerested pictures in the television and don't try to find it out themself.
So in this important time for a child to grow up and learn things they should do it without TV, because it's an lonely live with just watching TV and they need the social links.
Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.
They just need to switch it on and they are in a new world where they can see what they want and expriance what they want.
The television is part of our future, so why don't tell them early how to use it?
The televison additionally could make friends or link familys, because it connects people.
If they watch a funny quiz or if the watch a dramatic dokumentation, they do something together and that's the point.
In my view young children aged two to five should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents.
For example once a week an doumentation which is specially made for young children is good to learn something and learn what the TV is.
Anything more than this makes the points I wrote about the bad things on TV come true.
Sure ther are some pedagogical helpful series for children, but there is just to much crab on the program and sadly this part overweight.
Sure, for parents it is quite comftable to just let their children hanging arround infront of tv: They do not make any work and they are silent, make and may the learn something from a pedagogical helpful serie, but hardly most of the shows or movies they watch are not.
And there are many other bad things about let children gamble in front of a television.
I know that they will enjoy it at this moment, but some years later they probabely will not adore anymore a life like this, because it brings many bad aspects with it.
It is really unhealthy to watch television too often, because of your all day long by your own and just sitting.
There is not any possibility to make friends or to get a social life.
Those children who sit at all the time in their childhood will be inivertal and lonely and thats a really bad thing for mental health.
The human is a social species and needs other idividuals around him.
Also for physical health it is terrible.
The children are just sitting arround and likely are eating amounts of snacks, mosetly unhealthy sweets.
There can not grow any muscles which would be necessairy for a healthy body also for the higher age.
Instead the amount of bodyfat would increas and those children will get overweight and may get worse health issues.
Thei should not sit all the day in a room and just see the world on a screen.
They should learn the world know through their experiences with all their sens and not just join via a screen.
I think television can forming minds and so the children will not get the chance to develop their owne thoughts about anything.
I agree with this statement  becouse young children shoud go out side and not in the hous.When a young child often befor the tv sit,he don´t  can do frendchips  with other children  in his older.
The sozial aspekt is in this  moment very importent because when your child is the hole day in the hous becaus his tv show  is there  and when he is older so he don´t know  how he shold speak with other people in his older .
Maybe they could watch tv but not the hole day and not when the weather is goog and you go outside ,but when the weather is bad an you don´t can go outside you musst play with your  playtoies and when he is older he know a litle bit what is good and what is bad.
There are various reasons, why television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Nevertheless, in my opinion a prohibiton would have more disadvantages than advantages.
First about the advantages of not allowing television advertising towards young children: Children aged two to five can be manipulated very easiliy.
This leads to a wrong upbringing.
They learn to have a constant need for new products.
As adults, they may not be able to destinguish between what they realy need and where they have been manipulated by advertisements.
On the other hand, there are also seversal disadvantages: A big part of the income of TV channels for children are the advertisements.
Without them, a lot of TV channels can not survive.
In addition, a fewer number of TV channels decreases the growth of the economy.
Furthermore, it is the job of the parents to protect their children of the harm an advertisement can possibly have on their child.
The parents must not buy everything the child wants.
Is this the case, the child will learn that it is not possible to recieve every product is likes.
Eventually, I think that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
The probability that a child is harmed is too small compared to the disadvantages it would cause for TV companies.
Now i will discuss, if television adversiting directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Today there is a television in each family and the parents and the adults in the family are watching tv.
Children in the age between two and five spent almost all there time after the kindergarden with his mother or father.
In the evening adults often watch tv and if the children are not going to bed so early, they are sometimes watching tv with their parents.
In the programm for adults the tv often adverts direct to the audience, but today also the kids channel do that.
The children maybe see a new toy and happy children says that it is so cool.
Every child would want the toy.
That is a problem because parents do not want unhappy childreen and then they have to say to their child, he would not get the toy.
A nother probolem is that often the "Werbung" manipulates the audience.
For example Playmobil: There is a child playing with the new playmobil castle and there is a dragon which can act.
It can spy fire or is flying in the clouds.
In the reality that is not possible, but younger children would trust the television and think it is real.
THen when they get the new playmobil dragon and want to the it spying fire, they are sad becaus they thought it works.
I agree with the statement because i think if young children are watching tv, the television should not adverts direct toward to the chidren.
I don't think that we should vorbid this, because it doesn't hurt somebody.
If the content does not match what the parents think that their children should see then it's their job to prevent them watching TV.
Normaly if you watch TV on a normal time, not at night, the advertising is pretty child-firendly.
Advertising has always been and will be to leed us buy somthing.
To do that they will try to enfluence us and I think that it doesn't harm them on the other side they maybee learn even to not fall in the traps that the advertising company do.
An other point is that children at that age should not have enough money to buy their own toys or at least their money should be managed by their parents.
So you can prevent that children spend to mutch of their money.
Finally I remember when I was a child my parents asked me for every birthday or christmas what my wish was.
I think if I didn't saw some interesting toys on TV or in a magazine then I wouldn't know and this is probably pretty annoying for the parents to find every birthday etc.
somthing new that their children like.
Because of these point I think that I disagree.
We shouldn't vorbid Television advertising toward young children.

Television advertising directed toward young children can be allowed.
On the one hand there are many reasons to support an advertising free TV programm.
First children in this age even do not understand, what advertising means and, how it can influence them in a bad way.
That's why parents have to keep an eye on their children during their watching period.
Not every parent is able to do so, because they can have lots of work outside the living room.
In addition to that, there is the question wether showing advertising and influence them is moralic right or not.
Because it isn't not really neccessary for the once, who want to advertise their products.
And why should someone pay so much money just to show such things like toys to children, who sometimes even can't talk in their age.
But one the other hand they can learn new things like new words or something about food just by seeing it, because they do not see such things in their movies.
Advertising keeps contact to the reality while fictional movies don't.
Also there is the chance, e.g.
when there is TV advertising for a specific toy, that the children like it and the parents can buy it to them.
And it helps parents to confirm their young children to turn the TV off, because there will be a five minute break full of advertising, which is boring to see, anyway.
In my opinion it's not neccessary to show little children television advertising, but it doesn't have to be canceled.
The parents have to decide, what is the best for their children.
That's enough.
Essay

In our technical world the television in a big part of our life.
Espacilly younger children get influenced a lot by these media.
So is it a good idea to confront this young children already in this age with Television advertising?
As in verios studies proven young children get more influenced by any kind of adverting than young adults or older people.
These young children are very naive and so it is very hard for them to understand what is the truth and what is not in the TV.
Also would a children try to buy everything, which is showen in the TV, because they just want to have everything.
And this were the parents have to do their work and sometimes have to say no.
to.
For example when the children wants to buy a knife.
But as alreday mentioned before we life in a techinical world and to understand and to life in this world every people need the skills on how to handel advertising.
Because it is such an important skill it is important that the next generation lears this skill very fast.
And there is no place better than in your family over a long period of time.
Of cause some content is just not right for children like zigarets, alkohol or other kinds of violent games.
These advertisements should not be allowed to see in the Television befor eight at night.
So all in all i say, that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed.
But advertisement is a allday thing so if they would not see it on the TV they would see it in the streets, radio and big city.
So for me banning direct advertisement is not the right way.
In the following essay I'm going to discuss the statement that it shouldn't be allowed to show advertising content to children below 5 years of age.
If you look at the statement, you can see that it only means "television advertising".
The most advertises are related to the content that is sent between those advertises, so in a show for young children there won't be a car advertise for example.
The people making this advertising will try to guess what kind of people will watch their content so they catch the right crowd which probably buys this kind of things.
If you look at the financial part, the tv channels also have to make some money to run their business and the content shown.
If I combine those facts and if the advertising content shown to the children is nothing harmful, my opinion of showing television ads to younger people is that they are okay in a way of financing the channel.
But I also think that if kids see too many nice things on tv they like, they may will be way too greedy on those things which their parents might not even be able to afford.
They shouldn't be teached to that much consuming like it's often shown on the television, but it's not that bad if they don't see too much tv and advertising at all.
So if their parents are sitting right beside them and are also looking at the stuff their children watch, the tv can be switched off when an ad comes and parents can protect the kids from unsuitable content or advertising.
But they should keep in mind that if they don't watch it between the ages of 2 and 5, they might watch it after that, and for sure parents can't keep an eye on everything their children see; the modern world is just too full of that, not even on tv but also at the streets, radio or newspapers.
Our life includes more and more technic.
It brought many advantages for our live for sure but it has a negative side too.
Technic became a big part of our live and with it television.
So a point for letting children watch television at young age is, that it could be good to confront them with it already in a young age.
There are also themes in the television where children can learn from.
For example a film about animals or other cultures.
On the other hand the mother or father could, instead of showing their child this film, look with it at a book about animals.
In this case the parents could spend time with their child and be interactive with it.
But if a child only sits in front of the television it will have less time to go outside, play with children of the same age and do what children are supposed to do: Playing, running and use their creativity.
That brings us to the next point.
The evolution of the creativity of a child could be more difficult.
And I think that is the worst part about this.
If the child has never learned to occupy himself it won't be able to when it's olter too.
It will continuou sitting infront of its television or computer.
To build relationships will be more difficult.
So I think you deffinitely can't forbid children in young age to watch television because their parents are responsible for the education of their child.
But I think one should give the parents more informations about the effect an overdosed consume of television could have in some cases.
The question if children between two and five should be the audience of adverstising is difficult.
Young children are very easy to control and to influence.
If they see something, they are not capible of nmaking up an own opinion.
That is why advertising on telvision in between kids program is not good.
Children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product.
Then  the parents are in the situation to forbid their children something the television says they are allowed to get.
But in the most televion channels for kids, there is less advertising in the morning, when espiaclliy children age two to five watch teelvision.
There is less of an optertunity for them to see advertising, so the question is if there really is television adcertising direceted to only this age group.
Still there is the chance of seeing advertising and the wish rises of getting more and more toys.
The value of one product gets less, because of the high onsume.
I think it is not right to manipulate children through advertising.
Even though they might get the product, advertising is not all about reality and the child might get disappointed.
On the other hand children get conftonted with advertising daily.
Even when the television is turned of, there are enough adverts in kids magazines or on big posters wich are hung up all over the place.
The child can not not see the newest products, that his parents should buy.
But the problem with television advertising is, that you do not have to know how to read the posters or buy the magazine.
It is free to turn on the television and watch at all the concerns, wich try to sell their "newest" and "best" product to little kids wich do not know better.
I think that not allowing television advertising directed to children aged two to five would not make such a big of a change.
Our whole society is about buying and selling - consuming.
You can not protect you child fully and forever.
But I do think that we have to start somewhere.
We can not ban all posters and magazines.
But we can decide wich shows and programs our child should watch.
In shows like "Toggolino" or " zdfTivi" there is no advertising in the morning.
As a kid I watched "Sandmann" in the evening and there was no advertising aswell.
So no, it should not be a law or a rule for all channels to not show advertising.
But in the primetime for younger children to watch television, it should be at least reduced.
That would be copmromise.
To ban it completitly will not stop the child from beeing influenced by adverts.
Children between two and five years don't really know, what they want.
They see something and if they like it, they want it.
But often, after a few days they forgot what they wanted and then they want something new.
Because of their kindness, they can't assess, what they need.
For the enterprises, which produce specifically for children, it's perfect, that the children don't know, what they really want.
I agree with this statement, because chrildrens are the stakeholders with the lowest influene of their buying behavior.
If they like the product, they want it.
Often the parents of the first child, wants to make their children very happy, so they buy them everything they want.
In this age it important to say, that the kids can't assess if the toy they see is really interessting.
The toy loss on value with the time.
This time is often a short period of time.
From the perspective of the enterprise, the children are the perfect target group.
Especially, because the parents wants to give presents to their children, they are extremly attentively in case what their childrens want to play.
The parents can't assess, if a toy is a good toy or a bad toy.
It's difficult to recognize if their children could have fun with this toy.
Often the advertising don't expect like the reality.
It the advertising,the players walk to a farytale and experience a lot of things.
This is the childrens imagination.
But in reality it's just a boring game which you can play on the table.
And with this phenomenon, childrens don't get, what they expected.
In hour time are the technical abilitys in a very high level.
Whil our parents and we ourselfs are grown up without a mobile phone the children which become teenager now know since they were 4 how to handel with cellphones and  all the other technical staff.
They watching TV at least every second day.
But is it good for them that they are all the time confronted with the advertisment on screen?
The children in the age of two are to young to watch TV.
They can't realise and canalise what they see.
All this advertisement they watching is influencing them without notification.
If they see a brandnew teddybear in the television, they want to have it.
If the parents now buying them this teddybear the children are thinking that the can have everything they want.
The next time they are seeing something new in the television the partens may don't buy the thing for them and the boy or the gir lwill be sad.
They were thinking: "If I want something in the world, even if it is impossible, my parents will buy it.
An other argumet could be that the children cann become hoocked on watching TV and as an effect they will also watching the whole time advertisment.
In our western world we are so previliged.
We are having everything and if we want something we can have it.
But not the whole worl is such priviliged as we are.
There are so many wars at the time, so many children who are starving because they can't effort they money they need to buy food.
But our children don't see this if the are watching just advertisment.
The think everything is given and the world is pink.
So in my oppinion it is not a good idea to let our children watching the whole time TV because as effect they're also watching advert.
Nowadays our world is full of advertising.
We see it everywhere at anytime.
Of course one of the most important ones is the television advertising.
Everyone has a televsion, so the most efficient way to catch their attention, is showing them on the television.
But how does this influence our kids minds?
Would it change a thing if we prohibited to young children?
First of all this kids live with their parents, who are responsible to look after them and the usually know, what their children need.
So why would it be necessary to shot down this television advertising, if the people who are responsible of this children allow them to watch it?
Why should people lose their job because of something that even their parents watch?
We should let the parents choose, what they want to allow to their children or not.
They are called parents for a reason.
Another argument is that even if the kids try to get whatever they want, because they saw it on television or outside, if the parents don't agree with it and don't want to buy it, this kids won't be able to buy it by themselves.
So don't matter what the advertising shows, if the parents don't want it, this kids aren't going to have it.
And I repeat myself by saying that the parents are the people, who control their children and are responsible for their education.
By prohibiting television advertising, we also control their way of education their children.
In the other hand we know that children between two and five see adults as idols and they want to do and to have whatever the own.
So there is a big probability that their minds are influenced by what they see on television.
And will try to do it or get however it goes.
In order to be like the others, because they don't like to be different.
To sum up, no matter what children watch on television or outside, they will always want it but what is really important is how the parents react to it and what the do to educate them.
In my opinion we should let the parents choose if their children should watch it or not.
We are all free to choose what we
Our society is made of consumers and sellers.
We have the urge to make economics.
We also seem to be in a battle with other people.
Who earns more money?
Who is better at selling?
We are living in a world where technology affects our daily life and where we are dependent on it.
This could  be the reason why we create televion advertising.
However, not only adults are effected by advertisments also young children who cannot differ between information and manipulation.
So should television advertising directed toward young children be forbidden?
In this paragraph you will read arguments why commercials for children should be unallowed.
At the young age of three or four children are starting to develope the conciousness about themself.
Thex figure out that if they say 'I' they are meaning themself.
At this age of confusing realizations children can be manipulated very easily.
Because they are unenlightened they obey what the growns ups say.
Even if they are in a television.
That is why it could be unmoral wanting to convince children to buy a product or even be something they later would not chose to  be.
Furthermore, children cannot make own decisions yet, they are controlled by their parents or adults in general.
So what sense would it make to advertise towards children, if they cannot determine to buy something if the intention is not brainwashing?
Especially advertisment about special group of people like parties or organisations could be dangerous for children, since also adults gets convinced by them and start to think that it is not bad to treat people with certain skin colours or religions worse than other people.
However, there is a reason why maybe advertising toward children should not be forbidde.
Although children cannot decide what is good and what is bad for them, they have opinions.
By forbidden television advertising one would take a away the right of children to make up their own opinions and discover a capitalistic world.
If that is not enough reason, one could also claim that companies should have the right to advertise.
Everybody should have the freedom to be what they want to be unless they harm other people.
Yet they do not harm children by advertising their products.
They only show them a possibility.
And every children should have the right to have possibilities and chances.
By hiding commercials it would mean to hide a whole society.
And that could be even worse.
To put it briefly, television advertising can be dangerous for children since they cannot decide what is good or bad for them.
They are unenlightened and do not question absolutes.
However, companies should have the freedom to promote their products no matter what age the consumers are as much as children should be seen as person with own opinions.
Moreover, people should stop wanting to hide the possibilities that are offered, and this does not only refer to television advertisements.
In my opinion, people should not have the urge to protect children from everything.
It sounds harsh but we have to accept that there are people in the world that will use us, they will manipulate us.
But it does not make it any better if we try to hide it in front of children.
We should rather inform them.
Television advertising directed tword young children is a little step into a world that acknowlegdes problems and give every one the choice to believe what commercials say or not.
We live in the 21th century, the century where electronic stuff and internet media gets more and more important.
The next generations will grow up with this media like its for them such a normal thing.
But is this right?
In the following text I will discuss the thesis, if television advertising directred toward young children should be or not be allowed.
If we'd go 50 years back in the past, we would see that kids and young adults had more complications to look up things.
They had to go to a library to look up informations.
Also for young aged children it could be helpful.
in the past and also in my generation we learned things very early with plays or childrenbooks.
The coming and existing media will open new and in a few things much easier oppurtunities to get something in mind of a young kid.
Apps are a good example for that.
There are existing lots of apps to let the young children understand few things, that they can bring in experience in their age and this the apps try to message in a way of playing games.
But do we need that?
Do a children in the age of 2-5 need media or apps to get something in his or her mind?
Just ten years back in the past the young children went outside to meet the nature and learn things about it, they played outside and had toys to understand some first easy things.
Also social contacts are very important, VOR ALLEM when youre a young kid.
The first steps are important to know how you deal with your social area (family,friends).
I agree with the statement, that television should not be allowed toward young children.
Sure, the media brings new oppurtunities and easier ways to bring something in the mind of somebody with it, but I do not think that a e.g 2-years old children need media to understand the first things of life.
It is more important that it can get the first social contacts, can go outside and play with other kids.
In my opinion the television advertising shouldn't be directed toward young children.
The thirst reason is that the children in this age are very influencable, so the advertisments just have to put a few good looking pictures in the television and all the children want these things.
This is very bad for there parents because they can say that the thing isn't as good as it shows but the child won't believe it.
So the parents can buy the thing to the child and loose money so that the child is happy for about one or two hours, or they can say no and the child will feel bad as long as it won't get it.
But the advantage in the second one is that the parents don't have to loose lot of money and also that the child learns that he won't get everything he wants.
The child in the thirst example will after two hours be as happy as before and the next time he sees an advertisment he will again want the thing in it , because he know that he will probably get it.
This problem is very big for many problems: If i give the thing to the child it will be quiet and content but it costs money and the child learns out of that, so it think that it just have to cry to get what it want.
But at the other hand if I won't give it to the child, I'm maybe a bad mom/dad and the child doesn't like me.
One point for the opposite is that it would be unfair if all labels or shops could make television advertisment but not the one for children.
I think it's a difficult question but I have the meaning that it isn't correct to sell his product just because the parents wanted to be good to there children, although the children didn't really want the product for real.
In the follwing text I deal with the topic of Adds for young children(aged two to five) and at the end I will give my own opion.
I'd like to start with the argument that he young kids are getting perpeard if they watch adverter in that young age.
Becouse in that time children doen't watch allone TV they often have they farther or mother next to them.
So that they can controlle how long they kids are watching Tv.
I'd like to add to this po A new point I want to manshen is the fact of the industie behind this Add.
That mean that compernies can make a lot of money with the slots for this Add's .
And that mean that the channel have more money to produce a better Tv shows.
That would also help the children that they dont need to watch bad Tv.
On he other side is the argument that it isn't good for yound kids to watch more the 30 min a week Tv.
But this Add maked for the would inspirat them to watch more.
That would be healy!
Also they aren't the one how goes in the supermarked and bought the Thinks promoted in this adds.
For example the two years old kids see a Add for Ice cream in the Tv them this Kid would a ask this parend that is that ?
- Becouse they dont know that  is in the Add.
And if they knnow that it is they would just ask can you bought me that or this ?
So the parent need to dicisde.
All in all I wouldn't allowed advertising in Tv for young children becouse of the strong aspects meanshen earlyer.
In the following text I am going to write a discussion about the statement if television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
On the one hand you can say that it should be allowed because there are many products or toys that are helpful for children in this age.
They learn things from them like how to behave in some situations.
On the other hand you can say that some of those toys and products are extremly fictional.
Because the children learn so much from them and sometimes want to be just like the character they are playing with they often try to do thing like them but are not able to do so because they are humans.
Another example why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed is that those children can choos which products they want to use or which toys they want to play with.
All in all I would say that television advertising toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed as long as the products or toys are helpful for children in this age so they can learn from them.
Televison advertising to children between two to five - a controversal topic which is often discussed.
In the following text I am going to explain some arguments in favour and against the topic to get an answer.
First of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us.
But the influcene of advertisment directed toward younger children is probably even higher.
They do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use - convincing people to buy the product.
For example a young boy who maybe already has a lot of cars sees advertisment on a new one, the advertisment tells him that this car is way better then all others - the boy will probably believe that and will feel the need to get this car.
While an adult is maybe going to understand that there is no need for this new car because the boy already has a lot and the new car is not better at all.
Another point ist that when young kids see advertisment about new products everyday they will not be satisfied about what they have because they always see that there are new and better products.
One point against this two arguments is that this unsatisfaction and the feel to need the new product is not just by young kids also grown-ups can feel that way because of advertisment.
Another point ist that there is not just advertisment on television but also in the shops or by games on smartphones.
For example at a game with little monsters there maybe is advertisment for the monsters as figures to buy.
Such advertisment is also not directed to adults but to younger children.
And in our society it is not unusal to play with smartphones even at an young age.
Summing all up I think it is clear that advertisment is not good for younger children but we cannot do a lot against it.
Advertisment is everywhere and even if parents do not let their kids watch TV or play on smartphones the children will get in contact with advertisment you cannot protect children from it.
The only thing we can do is to teach younger children that they do not need everything shown by advertisment and to think critical about the facts told by advertisment and maybe for this it is even better to start at a young age because advertisment belongs to our everyday life.
Advertising - essay

Nowadays, a lot of young children are sitting on the sofa infront of the TV and watch cartoon serials, suddenly an advertisement pops up which is directed towards those little kids.
In those advertisements, most of the time it is about a toy with unique features on it.
And the reaction that every child is probably that they want to have one of these toys.
So the question is , if the television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed or should be allowed.
Obviously, little kids are very influential, and through those advertisements they can get influenced very quickly, just by watching it once.
So the creators of those advertisements, they put many special effects , a good background-music in the scene to make the kids think: "This looks very cool, I want one of these."
The next point is that young children should not sit infront of the TV for a long time.
This kind of habit, can make them to become more lazy, their body gets more stiff, and your eyes can feel tired, cause of watching TV for a long period.
In their young ages they should be playing outside with friends or spend some time with their parents.
The thing is, those advertisements are getting used more, because of the popularity it has.
Young kids are sitting more and more infront of the TV and it reaches them a lot faster due to the technological progress we have made throughout this time.
Personally, I think television advertising towards young kids should not be allowed, because the first two points I have wrote
On the one hand, young childrens can easly get influenced by television advertising because in the age of two to five, usually they believe everything they see or hear.
So when they see other children playing for example with a new barbie, they want to to the same.
Some of them will always tell it to their parents and when they don't get it, they will cry.
For their parents, this can be very annoying.
But on the other hand, television advertising directet toward young children can also be good.
Because sooner or later, they will get in touch with television advertisning.
It's better when they learn how to deal with that when they are young.
I disagree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
In my opinion, they parents have to pay attention on what their children watch in the television.
If they don't want that their kids see the advertisment, they can buy for example a dvd.
Nowadays, a lot of the global advertising is being done in the visual sector, which include printed and digital media.
The way how children spend their free time has changed since the invention of the television.
Children tend to watch television more frequently than 30 years ago.
The advertising segment has adapted to this change and as a result, even on programs targeted especially towards children, there are a lot of adverts advertising children stuff.
Should adverts targeted towards children be banned?
First of all, children aged two to five are usually not able to read.
Thus, they cannot inform themselves about the product of desire.
The only other way of receiving information is by hearing or by pictures.
It seems obvious that the best way of presenting a toy to a child is through the television.
On the other hand, children cannot judge a product as an adult or even a teenager would.
They do not understand a lot about the price, the usage and lots of other aspects, which are taken into account in order to buy something.
Furthermore, the children will eventually produce a desire after a certain product or toy and will not stop asking their parents about it, just because the child has seen others at his or her age playing with it in the ad.
Sometimes even if they have something similar already.
In my opinion, television advertising should be banned because children are not able to make a smart decision concerning the worth of buying something and this leads to an unnecessary preassure on the parents.
Television advertising is something that nobody really likes but is is essential for the income and survival of every TV channel.
If there wouldn't be any advertising on TV we would have to pay a lot more taxes in order to support the national TV channels.
A ban of advertising directed towards young children is complete nonsense.
Children aged two to five shouldn't be watching TV all day.
They should be doing something useful and learn something.
But parents nowadays just think that having children doesn't take so much time and effort.
That's why the also want to give their kids away during the day to a children daycare while they are working from 9 to 5.
They also want to make the taxpayers pay for it, just because they didn't think of all the consequences that having a child includes.
But instead of spending time with their kids they rather just put a screen in front of the child's face so they are occupied.
These are the people that don't think of effects that their behaviour and actions have.
They just do what sounds pretty and feels good.
For example letting all asylum seekers stay in the country and generally letting everybody into Switzerland.
It may sound pretty at first because we are such open-minded people but you know what.
I don't care.
If we would all support and share this opinion our home country will go down the drain.
We would be foreign in our own country.
When you look at the birthrates of a Swiss woman and a for example Afrcian woman you see that soon there will be more foreigners than Swiss.
This scenario really scares me.
As a proud Swiss I don't want our home country to be invaded by Africans.
I sure am open-minded but the idea of the global citizen gives me nightmares.
Being Swiss is part of who I am.
Not feeling welcome in your own country is a horror scenario.
It seems like this is far away but already now I can hear "fuck Switzerland" and so on from immigrants who should be grateful to live in this country.
Switzerland will soon be the country of foreigners if we don't stop this.
I agree with the statement that ads shouldn't be directed to little childern.
There are a few reasons, the first and for me to most important is that the childern don't really understand what they are seeing.
They can be manipulated easy, even easier than adults.
If they see an ad on televison they probably will go and stress their parents, and thats sure not what those ads are for.
But the conflict isn't only moral conflict, it's also a simple financial conflict, because most companys won't make ads directed to young ones because they simply don't sell off.
There is a too small target group and the ad will probably cost more than it earns.
But there are also arguments against my point, as an example, when a child series comes on television, what kind of ads are they supposed to broadcoast?
I don't know if it comes out good if they will broadcast ads from parfumes or stuff like that because the small childern won't need it and the contents of some ads isn't supposed to be watched by 3-year-olds.
But then there comes the point with the manipulation again.
I don't like it when small childern are raised that early as a "perfect consumer".
They should learn to have their own opinion and not to listen just what the television tells them, like sadly a lot of young people do.
Actually, I'm completely against the idea of young people watching tv, I think it isn't good for their later life.
Of course when they start to understand what they are watching, then it's completely fine, but I don't support the idea of sitting young people and babys in front of a TVor a smartphone just to keep them quiet.
There needs to be another solution, and then we wouldn't have to question us if we should direct ads to babys and childern.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Nowadays the television has become a much more frequently encountered household item.
Hence it's not surprising that companies and marketing experts adapted their advertising tactics and now mainly use TV-spots to promote their products.
There are advertisements for all theage groups, but the mainly targeted audition are kids.
But is it morally suportable to manipulate our youngest?
Or should advertising directed toward young children be banned?
Out of the point of view of, for example, a toycompany it would be a fatal blow if advertising directed toward young children would be banned.
Because quite frankly, less and less people nowadays read magazines or other printed media, so by not longer being allowed to advertise their products on television they would lose their most important platform.
Besides, in my opinion, a TV-spot doesn't really do any harm to anyone.
Sure, little kids are naive and easy to manipulate, but as long as their parents don't always give in on their demands for new toys, I don't see a problem with these advertisements.
On the other hand it's quite easy to understand peoples concern about the whole situation.
The advertisements could manipulate young children so much that they wouldn't rest until they get what they want.Plus, like I allready mentioned, children arenaive.
They believe what they see on television and being tricked into buying a product that doesn't keeps what the advertisement promised can b
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Advertisment is everywhere in our daily lifes.
It's trying to trick us into buying stuff we actually don't really need.
But is it right that we let advertisment influence our youngest children?
In their youngest years children can be manipulated and influenced very easily.
If they see an toy ad, especially an ad full of colors and other kids having fun with a toy, they want it.
They can't yet assess if they need it or have the money to buy it they just want the product.
So they go to their parents and beg them to buy the toy for them and somewhen the parents agree.
So television advertising directed toward young children basially forces the parents to buy useless toys.
It's taking advantage of kids to make profit.
Secondly avertisement often goes specifically after gender roles.
Girls should play with pink puppets while boys are shown with cars and weapons.
This influences how the kids see themselves, how they think their life has to be.
This is very harmful for such youn kids which still have to develop their identity.
Another important point is that this toys are often produced in poor countries under bad circumstances and horrible working conditions.
So with making the kids wanting those toys and the parents buying them, they support this terrible circumstances.
A point in faviour of television advertisment is that it surely creates jobs and helping the economy but at what cost?
To sum up, in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children shoud not be allowed as it is manipulating, influences their development and harms the environment.
Advertising is a part of television.
Any child who is waching television will watch advertising.
Today in the 21th.
century is advertesing a part of society.
It's not just in televison.
Chlildren have also a right to know what they could by or what is possible to buy.
Even if they don't have pocket money, they could ask their parents to buy them the things which they have seen on television.
Young children could also have fun while they're watching the advertising.
Most of the advertising are made funny and don't just informate about the product.
For example advertising for toys is made funny that the children want to play with it.
Then the children will ask their parents for the toys.
If there aren't advertisings for toys most of the children wouldn't know about them and their parents would have to search for them specific in the internet or in a toy shop.
With the helping Advertising they know what and where to buy it.
But if you look at this theme in an other context, you would agree that so young children can't decide by their own what they need and what's good for them.
In this context, advertising can manipulate young children realy good, because they don't have that much expirience to think carefully about the advertising.
I think that television advertising directed toward young children ( aged two to five) should be allowed.
When I was a young child I liked to see the television advertising to know which new toys are in shops to buy.
Sometimes I get one of these toys from my parents.
But I think also that young children can't think about the advertising carefully what's tho goal of the advertising.
They can be easyly manipulated by it.
At the end their parents have to think about it and decide if they would buy something of the advertising for their children.
Advertising is nowadays a big part of many peoples lives, and today I will discuss in this essay, if it should not be allowed to make television advertising toward young children.
In our day-to-day life's advertising has become a big part, even for the children.
Every Company should have the right to advertise their products.
It shouldn't matter how old or young their audience is.
But children with the age of two until five are easily manipulated and many companies will take advantage of that to sell their products.
The companies can easily make the children believe that they really need their product.
That leads to the children crying about that product until the parent feels forced to buy it for his child.
Forbidding television advertisement toward children could prevent that from happening.
But prohibiting advertisment is against the freedom of speech which also isn't allowed.
So prohibiting the advertisement can't be the right solution.
Another proble with advertisement toward children in general is that materialistic thinking is allready taught at a very young age, which can influence their behaviour in the long run.
Advertisements showing that having the newest or the best looking toy is good can lead to the children thinking the same about other human beings.
In general I think that advertisement toward children shouldn't be banned but I think it should follow clear orders and rules so the children don't get influenced mentally.
Every time we turn on the television we can watch a lot of interesting films, but also a lot of advertisments.
These are influenicing us in every age, especially when we are young.
Children, who are aged two to five, are in a period of life where they learn a lot of things which they need for their further life and it's not that unusual that they ask questions beginning with "why".
So I'm going to talk about the question if television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not.
Young children can be influenced easily.
Many of us remember the series we liked as a child, but also the other things we saw in television.
So when we saw something we liked, we wanted to see more and wanted to have it.
So it's not a surprise that the toys we saw in the advertisments were laying under the tree on christmas or were given to us on our birthdays.
Children want to have many things they see, even more when they are looking exciting and interesting and many parents want to give them what they want to make them happy or just to stop them being annoying and exhausting.
The advertisments are manipulation the children by attract their interesting and showing the product as a great and exciting thing which it needs to have.
For this reason I'd forbid advertisments for children in a young age.
But one the other hand the parents still have to decide what they are going to buy and even if they are letting them watch television.
Especially around christmas are toys advertised very much, because the people need presents for their families and friends and when a child see toys and books and computer games everywhere it's not surprising that asks it's parents for more than one christmas present.
This time is very good for the economy.
Summarized I can say that young children can be influenced easily by advertisments, so they want to have more and more.
But on the other hand the parents are still deciding what they are going buy and if they are letting them watch television at all and in the most cases the children have to accept their decision.
Also it's good for the economy if they are buying toys and other stuff for their children.
For this reason I disagree with the statement.
The other day whilst watching television I saw an advertisement, which was directly telling children that they should go to a certain water park.
I was quite apalled by it and thought about the reasons for this ad for a long time.
I came to the conclusion that television advertising aimed towards young children should be prohibited.
Children are very suggestible and if they see an ad they are very likely to believe it.
The might pester their parents about beeing alowed to buy a certain toy, or go to an entertainment venue.
Through advertising directly to the youngsters, the advertisers bypass the parents and get the children to want to do something that the parents are against.
One might say that it helps children make their own decisions or that parents, who don't want their children to  be influenced by the media, shouldn't let them watch television.
I however think that television, atleast certain channels, should be children safe.
They should not in any way strive to influence or scare a young child.
Children under five may also not understand the difference between a normal television programme and an advertisement.
This may lead to severe misinformation.
Even though an ad directed to youngsters will not be of a scary or harmful nature, it will be ingrained in the mind of a child and through this influence its decisions till adulthood.
Parents, confronted with a whiny child, or even a tantrum, may forget all their education values and buy the item.
This sets pressure on the parents and the child, as children may not learn that no means no.
It can also teach them that everything materialistic that hey want, they can get.
Because advertisements can greatly impact a child and the family dynamics, I came to the conclusion that telivision advertising directed towards young children should be forbidden.
In the following I'm going to show the pros and contras to the topic: Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
First of all I'd like to say that this is a question of faith and also of the way parents raise their children.
For exemple there are a lot of diffrence between the Moslems and the Christans in the way of what they eat or what clothes they wearment could be that it's important for the kids to learn early about what life is really about.
But in the most of the hollywood films a situation is shown too bad or too good than it really is.
The only thing that matters is having a big audiance.
The problem is now when kids are watching television or making a film they don't know what is realistic and what not.
In this case it would be good if television advertising directed toward young children were not allowed.
But on the other hand there are also positive aspects if it would be allowed: The young children can early learn the language corretly and this is a thing they thankful their whole life.
I think the environnement around the child is the thing that matters the most.
That means that the parents can influence the child significant.
If the parents think it is a bad thing giving their permission to the kids to watch television it should not be allowed and otherwise is should.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should be forbitten because it effects the child in this young age of only two to five age badly.
I agree with the following statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".
Young children must not the advertising while they are watching a movie or something like this.
It is not good when young children watch too much television.
So without advertising the movie is not so long and the kids can play outside.
For example: the child watch always television and is in the house it can get ill because the body is not so strong when a disease is in school or childgarden.
In the garden they can get stronger!
Often the advertising is full of crap from electronical stuff like a flying Barbie or something lika that.
When they watch television and there comes an advertising they see something and the parents have to say: no you can`t get it.
But it can be useful if young children have no idea for birthday or chrismas.
So they can inspire their selfe with the advertising.
Any child know this.
Chrismas is coming but their is no idea.
So they can watch one hour television and then they now many things.
But only children who are older than four should do this.
For younger children television is not good.
It is okay when they see a little passage from a movie but not longer than ten minutes, without advertising!
Later they get bored from adverts and eat some chips in the break because they don`t enjoy the advertising and they become too fat.
In my opinion too much television or advertising is bad for young children.
They become stupid and want all things from advertising.
Later in school they want watching always television and all the things from the advertising and they get bad marks at school.
So it is important to regulate the time sitting in front of the TV and watching adverts.
While their is advertising the parent have to talk with their children.
The advertising in television should be regulate from the people who make the TV-program.
The best way is when the parents regulate the watching time and also what they watch!
Not too much advertising!
Concerning the question whether there should be television advertisement directed towards young children personally believe that they should not be made.
This is due to the fact that young children are not yet able to tell apart between an advertisement and reality.
This problem has already been adressed in the film and gaming industry for example by introducing age restrictions.
While the problem in advertisement is not mature content it can still cause problems.
This is due to the nature of advertisement especially that which is directed towards young children.
Those ads are mostly colourful and show the product to be far more alive than it actually is while also giving it abilities which their real counterparts do not have.
While an adult knows that the things depicted in an ad are only big exaggerations of the truth a child might think of them as true.
This is simply because of a childs nature of still having lots of fantasy which only adds onto the graphics shown in the ad.
Companies of course know these things as well which is the reason for creation of such ads in the first place meaning they willingly exploit the childrens fantasy for personal profit.
Lastly a possible threat those ads may pose might be that the ads might lead children to believe they had certain abilities which could cause them to unknowingly kill themselves.
To sum up I would say that adds for young children should be prohibited from being played on TV as they exploit the missing characteristics in children to make them want to have things.
The reason why this is especially important for TV adds is the fact that the medium of television allows creators to manipulate children into thinking a toy has way more abilities then it has in reality.
I agree with the following statement, that television advertising dircted toward young children should not be allowed.
In my oppininon television in gerneral is not good for kids betwen the age from two to five.
Watching television in that young age could not be good for them.
They can do better things in that age like playing games outside.
On the other hand you can say that they have to decide for themeselve.
but arent they too young for that?
I havent watched TV in that young age and i think that it is not an disadvantage for me.
I see more advanteges by not watching television.
My parents took that decision for me and they knew what was good for me at that time.
the most things you cann see on Tv at are things you can discover for your self.
You could collect your own experiances.
But you can not see that in general.
If you take other familiys you would find other oppinions.
Perherps some familys would think it´s good.
They could argue with the creativly of the kids.
TV could make theme more creatively.
So they could have an bigger horizion.
All in all it could have two sides of view.
In my oppinion it is not good for young children to watch television advertising directed toward young children.
Televiosion advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed


More often parents of young children hear: "Mom, can I have this new toy which was shown in the tv?"
or "Wow, Dad, look a this cool toy!
Do you buy it for me?"
These children who watch tv get influenced a lot by television advertising.
Should it be allowed to manipulate them with these tricks or should it be forbidden?
Here we go:

Important is, that young children dont go often (or probably never) in the city for shopping.
Just the parents and they decide which toy the little boy or girl will get.
So it is totally clear that we have to bring the toys to the childrens home: by television advertising!
So they can decide themselfes what they want to play with.
So they will have a happy and exciting childhood.
But more important is that the children are a lot influenced by tv or smartphones already on this age!
They are addicted to this "toys".
So it is now our job to bring them real toys to home and help them to not be so hoocked on technic!
But there are a lot arguments which want to disallow television advertising: Important is that such little children are too easy to convince, they cant really decide!
They get manipulatet and cant decide themselfes; the advertising "decides" for them.
Is would be better the parents decide what is "good" for them and what is "bad".
The parents anyway just want the best for them, didnt they?
Most important is that the children shouldnt anyway watch tv at these age!
They should go outside and play with real friends.
The television advertising makes them even more addicted to the technic and at this age it isnt healthy!
Now it is totally clear that television advertising shouldnt be allowed!
Never!
I would understand if someone says that there is no differance between advertation and manipulation.
But it is not that easy, you need to check many other factors which influents opinions.
One stong arguement againt advertising towards young children is that they don't realise this manipulation.
If they watching theese ads theyre just like "Oh mama i want this".
They dont think about specific stategies which companys could use to make the people buy their products.
Another opinion could be that the eventually decision is made by the parents.
They decide it.
But there may be parents do everything for their children.
And really mean everything.
But in my opinion thats part of our economic system.
Everbody need comercial at least someone who has an company.
Whitout advertation its very difficult to get new customers.
But there is not just the company lead ads.
There is oral propaganda too.
I think it's okay if children want to watch television.
But it's also important to think about the consequences.
When I was in the age (two to five) I've loved to watch it but I think the main reason was that my parents didn't allowed me to watch it.
Me and my siblings were allowed to watch from 7.00 pm to 7.50 pm.
It was a tradition and everyone looked forward to these fifty minutes.
All in all I'd say it's okay if children are allowed to watch TV.
But it's also important to think about what could happen if they watch too much.
In my opinion it's not that intelligent to let kids watch TV the whole time.
But why?
I know that children have to play outside and do things without any technology.
I'm from the generation where the media got important.
I'm lucky that I had a childhood without a phone or a computer - all these things were something my parents didn't allowed me to play with.
I remember the happiness i've felt when my father gave me his phone for a minute or when my parents said that I can watch a movie that's longer than forty-five minutes.
In fact I'm lucky that I wasn't in the gerneration where phones and other technologies took over.
Now, when I see all these five-graders with a cellphone bigger than their heads, I'm happy my parents forced me to play outside.
Back to the question - I think there are positive things if parents let their kids sit in front of the TV but they have to watch over them.
One hour is totally fine for young-aged children.
In my opinion parents have to - especially nowadays - be stricter with children or young teenager.
You can see what phones and computer did to them.
The only thing they care about is what their new profile picture should look like or why they have not that much "likes" at their Instagram-picture.
It all started with the television because it's the first technological thing young children can work with.
If parents don't watch over them they don't stop watching the TV.
And, in my opinion, that's not far away from using a mobile everytime.
All in all in think it should be allowed for young-aged children to watch TV but parents have to take look if it's not too long or what movie is on the TV.
That's another point: Many parents don't care about what their child actually watch.
It could be a documentation but also a movie that's not allowed for children under eighteen.
So my opinion is that TV is okay.
Me and my family always enjoyed it and I want this for other families, too.
But there has to be a limit.
If parents know what's good for there children, they can say how long they're allowed to watch.
I'm sure that parents who know the consequences are able to say when their children have to stop watching TV.
If parents are trusting and caring with the fact that their kids use a technological product and a thing that can make "abhängig"(?
), it's fine.
But it's important that - especially today - someone watches more over the technological use from children.
Television advertisement is nowadays used to get the consumer's attention and to attract them to buy a company's products.
Therefore, firms use the most abstract way to potray their product publicly.
Children watching these advertisements are often influenced by the product's appearance in the media.
The consumption should be determined by the quality of a product rather than the appearance.
Of course, firms like ToysRus have to adapt their advertising to the group they want to target to get the best possible outcome.
But considering that today society is dependent on media more than ever, the influence ads have on both children and adults is increasingly high.
Especially kids should not be raised in such a materialized society.
They cannot differ between the appearance of the product in the advertisement and the realistic relation between price and quality.
That will lead parents to buying products they would consider too expensive or not appropriate under usual circumstances.
Why should a three-year-old girl want anything else than the new robot-barbie, that is praised to be the one and only toy in advertisements?
These advertisements are created and designed for one purpose only: They're supposed to persuade children to want the product bad enough to beg their parents to buy it.
In my opinion, parents should keep their children away from TV-advertisements as long as they cannot differ between real quality and the quality the products are promised to have.
Otherwise, advertising will overcome rational consumption.

Advertising - especially in television is prone to be controversial.
Its goal is to show the best side of the product which is tried to be sold.
Even if the product has many drawbacks the advertisers and marketing people try to hide them.
The audience has to develop an own feeling which statements can be trusted an which you should maby overthink.
Should children be exposed to heavy marketing in a young age?
It is freedom of speach and general freedom to be able to make almost every advertisment (even tough in some peoples opinion there should be more control over what ads are on for instance national TV).
To sort of lie about a certain product is not considered illicit.
Every person exposed to advertisments (today you can't escape the PR and marketing) should have developed a sense of whom can be trusted in advertising and who just tries to sell you a bad product.
In the early stages of life my parents decided for me what was good and bad to be influenced with, for example if a toy is .
And just as my parents did, most parents try to protect their children in this age.
Of course they have to develop an own sense of justice and own view on things.
But because young kids are so easily influenced (for good and bad) it's not wrong to want to protect your little kid and want to give them your view on things on their way.
It's the parents decision what their kid is exposed to and influence with, but advertising especially for kids is like exploiting even the youngest generation.
In our generation where we're  srounded by media, there are different ways to make advertisements to  increase the selling of a product.
One exempel is the television.
From this media we constantly get informations, also from brands that are trying to reach the highest sellings.
Not only adults are confronted with this type of aim also children are not save from people who want every little space to fill it with their advertisements.
But, is it okay to speak to children this sort of message?
In the one hand, I don't think that this is the right way because than the children learn in their smal age to consume and to spend money.For instants, when the marketing manager are advertising with barbie, than they do it in a unhealthy.
That means that they put barbie in a better spot.
From her body till her image, there are many  ways.
In the other hand, the children learn to get used to this stuff and they learn, with the help of their parents, to be wide awake of manipulation.
The topic of advertising in the tv to young children is difficult.
Children shouldn´t watch tv often in that age, that´s clearly.
For the concerns it´s very lucrative to do advertising to young people because they watch it, they want it and they go to their parents to talk with them if the children are allowed to get it.
But it´s the wrong way to use young children to make profit.
Maybe it isn´t wrong to start in a young age with that things.
So the children may know what will happend in an older age.
Everyone is controlled by the media, at all in the digitalized (like tv or radio) and in the undigitalized way (like newspaper).
Finally I agree with the statement.
I think that shouldn´t be allowed because the children have to play outside with friends or get wet from the rain without any problem.
They should not controle by the media so early.
Watching TV can be truely upsetting.
Everyone can relate to the moment during a movie or a season of your favourite show when there is a interesting moment and out of no where the advertisement starts.
We have gotten used to it but what if the advertisement ist directet to young children?
Should such advertisement be banned?
Advertisers are very free in their doings and controlling every step they are doing would not be benefitial because too much regulation and control is never good.
The parents can always say whether or not the child shoud be watching TV and if a child sees a toy he wants the parents are free to decide whether to get them the toy.
Today almost everyone has the possibility to just fast forward when there's advertisement or you can just change channels and not watch it.
It is always up to the person to decide and a two to five year old will not be watching TV alone anyways

On the other hand children aged two to five should not be exposed to suggestiv advertisement.
If even adults can be highly influenced by different advertisments what about brains that are not fully developed yet and with a high possibility do not even understand the construct behind advertisement.
It can also lead to a even larger consumption community with children as young as three years old always wanting the newest toys they see in advertisements.
In my opinion it is the parent's task to decide whether they want to expose their children to direct advertisement.
Because advertisers are only going to play ads as long as there are people watching it and as long as there is a demand for it.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Television advertisments directed towards young children serve but one cause: Causing the child to be excited enough for it to bother its parents to buy whatever the product may be.
The child, however is not able to tell, wether the product is something it really wants or needs.
It solely decides based on the emotions conveyed through the advertisment.
It is very simple to manipulate a young child into being excited about something.
The use of a few simple elements, such as catchy songs or cute mascots, can be enough to convince a child of a product, without them even caring about the product itself.
Therein lies great vulnerability for the parents, who are often cornered to buy something by their children, without being able to tell wether the child was manipulated into liking said product by an advertisment or wether they actually like it for its concept.
Children being manipulated into  wanting certain products is obviously not optimal.
The question that needs to be asked, however, is wether the responsibilty towards the protection from such manipulation lies within the government, which would have to create regulations about the advertisments, or wether it lies within the parents.
It would be a possibilty for the government to create regulations which would stop marketing agencies from creating advertisments that are directly targeted towards young children.
Such regulations would be very complex though.
The distinction between what is, and what is not directed towards a child of the age of 5 or 7 is most likely not accurately possible.
Therefore, most advertisments concerning anything that has to do with kids would most likely be influenced so that there would be no risk of violating the regulations.
Placing responibilty in the parents' hand would probably be much easier and also more reasonable.
A parent should not let a child as young as 2-5 years old watch television on their own anyways, therefore it should not be a problem to change channels whilst advertisments are on or to stop the development of excitment in its tracks, should the child still get to see such an advertisment.
More and more little children are used to watch television hour for hour, so they are also used to advertises, but should these ones affect them directly?
It has to be said that some advertises could have a really bad influence on the thinking of a little child.
We have to consider that a child at the age of two to five years is not able to make a difference between reality and the world of the television.
It believes that, which an adult or whatever tells him and if in the advertise someone says that coke is very healthy, the child thinks that this is true.
Such influences on opinions of little children can have really bad consequences, which could actually become a global problem.
But in contrast to that we should also bear in mind that advertises could also have a positive effect.
If a advertise is made well it teaches the child something,or it helps him to build a one opinion, which would be great for the following years and its whole life.
Mostly, children are not interested in advertises either and they prefer to watch cartoons and so one, in that case they would switch the channel.
So why should it not be allowed?
My own opinion is that it should be allowed, because if parents think that advertise threatens their child, they should not let it watch television.
I think at the age of 2 to 5 children are too young to watch television by their own anyway and if adults are there, they could change the channel if there is a bad advertise or a terrible scene.
And if it is allowed each person can decide by his own if he wants to let his child watch advertise or not.
The television is on, a random movie plays and in an intermission there are some advertisements.
Probably one about a new and shiny toy for children of very young age.
But couldn't that be a problem to show advertisments to such a young audience, to be more precise, to an audience aged two to five?
Because these children are very unexpierenced in life they can be easily manipulated.
That's why probably want the advertised toy after they have seen the advertisement.
But simoutaniosly, that's a positive too.
If young children woud never be confronted with such temptations they probably wouldn't learn to resist them.
Another opinion is that it woul restrict our economie that is based on consumption.
In addition, it's up to the parents of those children to from that advertisement.
It's also said that the range of the age two to five was complete rubbish, because two years old children would not even realy realise what a commercial is.
I think that it shoul not be resitricted because it helps the children to develop a healthy commons sense, to distinguish between things they need and things that are unnecessairy.
Secondly, if a child would show any issues concerning advertisements I think that it is the parents responsibility to look after their child and maybe don't even allow it to watch television.
Television advertising is a big industry in our generation.
People see products in these advertising and they buy it, because they see the product in the television.
But is it a problem or a risk for young children?
Which advertsing could influence children in a bad way?
Today every child watchs TV and as a consequence also the advertising.
There are many advertisings of really thin and beautiful puppets such as barbie and other dolls.
They are very attracted by this puppets and they want to have one of them.
Because of this unrealistic ideal of the women, it could be that the child want also to look like this and that causes depression or other self-confidence problems, which are very unnessersary in this age.
Another point is the costs the parents have, if they have to pay there children what they want, because they want to have there child happy and the child stresses them so much, that they think it would be better for themselves if they buy the toy to have a silence.
Toys aren't cheap, the price is rising and I could imagine that not every familiy has enough money to pay for a expensive toy.
Also there is the trend changes very fast.
It isn't a very economical way, because every day there is a new toy on the market and the old one isn't good enough, so at a point the parents have to through away the old toys, because of place problems.
On the other hand why should we ban the advertising towards young children?
It's not proven that advertising influences the life of a child.
Children watch TV because of the series they want to watch and they go on the toilette when the advertising comes.
In addition the advertising isn't as long as the children could remember, what they saw.
And also there a many other ways to influence children to buy something.
Other children in kindergarten, who all have the same toy or nower days every child has instagram or other social medias, who have advertising, which fits on your age or the things you like, so if we ban television advetising, we shouldn't allowed any kind of advertising for children.
In my opinion it's a realistic problem.
The number of advertising per each televisionshow is rising and the advertising show solutions for our daily problems.
When I was young I also wanted to have every thing I saw in television.
But I didn't get anything.
My parents resisted.
Nower days you have to have the trendy things to be cool.
But I think, you can't solve the problem, if you bann television advertising toward young children.
You should do praventition very early.
So I think you allowed televison advertising.
The statement, that televisions should not be allowed to young children between two and five years is sometimes correct.
Children in these years are in an important part of  their life.
For example to learn the first things for school.
Some kind of them have to find new friends when they begin the time in the kindergarden.
Now it`s important to concentrate to get a correct circle of people.
In this chapter of their life, they normally have to play outside with friends and don`t have to sit in their room and watch tv.
It`s bad, that they maybe see things they souldn`t have to see maybe some scenes of terror or something like that.They don`t understand it and they get fear.
It´s important, when the children have to watch tv, to choose the right program.
A good point is, that some kind of them show news for children, so they can understand it, or show some series with animals.
I think it´s important to draw a line between playing outside, doing homeworks and watching tv.
I share the opinion that children in this chapter of their life, have to play outside.
After the kindergarden or school, if they finished their homeworks or other things which they have to do, it`s okay to watch tv in a cutted time.
In my opinion it`s sad how much children in this chapter, become bad in school or can`t speek very well, because they only watch tv.
All in one I think it`s okay, that children watch tv in a small part of time, if they don`t forget to do important things for school and playing outside with their friends.
Many children spend a lot of time in front of the television.
Television inclueds advertisments.
And children can be strongly influenced by them, especially in a very young age.
That's why commercials which are directed towards children should be forbidden.
Advertisments are all about selling things.
Children's advertisments are often about toys.When a child sees toys shown on television, it probably wants to get them all, because the chidlren in the commercials always seem to be happy and having fun.
Now the parents either buy them those toys and spoil them or they don't and the children end up being sad.
The picture which a child has of the world, can be influenced by those commercials too.
For example when there are only people with the same nationality shown, it keeps them from being open-minded.
Or when the girl in the commercial always has long blond hair, children may think that's what girls are supposed to look like.
The following text is an essay about the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.".
On the positive side of advertising stands the fact that companies make a lot money from the parents which got affected by their children to buy them their toys, candy, and so on.
Tv channels also make a lot money with advertising too, which is also a good thing.
In the end advertising directed to children is a big and important part of the economy.
On the negative side stands that young children between the age of two and five are easily affected by what they see in TV.
So they want almost everything they see, and they get it, because they´ll bag for it until they get what they want.
In the first time that does not sound really bad in any way, but if you really think about it, it is.
Because the first years of a humans life are probably the most important ones.
We learn the most in this years, and if we get anything we want, if our parents always buy our favourite candy at the groucery; we learn that it is normal to get anything we want, and that it is normal to always get and eat our favourite candy.
Out of this facts are resulting a lot of problems, like people which think they always get what they want.
And people which instinctively think it is okay to eat a lot of bad food, and then getting really obese and fat.
All in all I don´t really agree or disagree with the statement.
I think comercials for children should be limited, and controlled.
And that in a way that they won´t get affected by them in the wrong way, but still learn how to handle them; because they will always face comercials in their lifes.
Children at a young age are a great audience for big buisneses, who want to sell their stuff.
But as always there are some disadvantages and some advantages, for the children, their parents and those buisneses.
In my opinion young children should generally just spend a small amount of time watching television.
They got easily distracted by it and they also got influenced by the advertising in television.
Little children can't understand that the toys or sweets that are shown are rarely the way as we see them in TV.
They start asking their parents, if they may have all this too expensive things.
Often the parents won't allow them buying those things, but when children get confronted with this "cool stuff" their friends in kindergarten may have, they get sad and won't be part of the group.
Buisneses are spending a lot of money on advertisings in general and they know exactly in which way they can reach everybody, from small children to old people.
For their younger audience, they use bright and shiny colours and cool effects.
They often know, in which way they may influence the parents of the children too, they make them believe, that those things are good for their children.
At least, I agree with the statement, advertising should be used on older peolpe, but not on kids at this young age.
Children shouldn't get to know the way, money, beauty and  expensiv stuff in general influence everyone of us and how they affect our daily life.
In the following Text I will find arguments for and against the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".
A Point for con side is that parents could find out what there children like and dislike playing with.
They could look at the reaction of ther children.
An angurment that it should not be allowed is that the children like the Television advertising so much that they dont want to leave the Television and look way to much of it.
My next Point against that statement is that children could enjoy the advertising between ther series, they dont have to upset when ther serie is ending because ther is an advertising adressing them and not just ther parents.
Another Point for the stament is that children could like every spot so much that they want everything what they see and so the parents have to tell the children why it isnt possible to buy them all what they want to have.
The most important point against the statement is that the children could enjoy what they are seeing, they could even have fun during the advertising.
The most important point for this statement is that the children should not sit in front of the television all the time, they should go and play outside on a playground whit ther parents or ther friends.
So if they like the advertising to much they could forget playing outside and when the children are young you could bring them much more easier on your side, so that they do whatever you want.
I totally agree to this statement, because it could bring the young children to much to the television and could them let forget to play outside.
Its much more important that young children learn something in books or outside then watching television advertising just made for them and in the young age its easier to get in that children mind and to let them think what they should think about ther product, so that they want to buy it or the parents should buy it and when they dont buy it the young children are sad.
And two to five years is way to early to watch much televisison and television advertising.
Today children are already confronted with the permanet influence of social media and technology at a very young age which seems to be a chance for companies to sell their products by using advertising in a clever way.
That's why I'm going to discuss the following statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
On the one hand there are arguments against such a law.
For exemple one can say that permanent advertising is a part of our time today so that children have to learn how to handle it.
Also adults and teenagers are always confronted with advertisemen - for example last week I saw a new car in the TV but I wasn't able to buy it because of a lack of money.
Furthermore getting to know many toys they would like to have by television advertisings could help little children to accept that they won't get everything they wish in their life and that they have to be happy with what they get.
But on the other hand there are also arguments for television advertising toward young children not to be allowed.
A law against it could be understood as resistance against the money-ruled society we have got today.
Critics say that children have to be protected from this "bad world" to enjoy their childhood and develope in the best way.
They will become an adult fastly enough.
For example its seems to me as if my childhood has just ended and now I'm already confonted with the force of earning money next year - after leaving school - to become independent and live the life I want.
In addition parents might be happy about TV programm without advertising directed toward young children because they wouldn't suffer from an annoying child who really wants to have the toy car it has just seen in TV and cries now the whole time because his parents won't buy the mentioned car.
Especially because of the two last arguments I'm agains television advertisement for children.
In the first years of your childhood you creat your future.
Parents who are working a lot and don't have much time to look after the childern are using the television to entertain their children.
By watching television you can learn a lot and it's good for your mind to educate more things.
You have to plan it so they will have something to look forward to.
In the age two to five your child needs love, attention and time with his parents.
This three things are more important than anything.
So spend time with your children outdoor to have fun and make some experience.
They will remember this and it will make them happy.
Sure you don't have to look to good after them because they also need some time to figure out things by themselves and have fun with friends.
But they need you as a parent and in this age they learn to walk, to eat, to talk and in every way they're making their first steps.
It's important you are there with your kids when these things happen.
I think that it should be allowed but you need to plan it.
So that the kids have regular sleep times (if this is possible) and eat a lot.
It's important that you spend as much time as you can with your children because the time will be gone and soon the will be 17 and have their first boyfriend, have sex, their heart get broken and all that stuff.
Time runs fast so you have to live in the moment and enjoy it as much as you can.
Some day they will leave your house and sure they will always be your children but they will be gone (not forever of course) but you're no longer directly responsible for them.
They bild their own lives and you have to be proud of them.
Teach them as much as you can they will remember the important things you said to them.
And maybe they will take some things with them and do it just like you.
Make the time that you have with them memorable and give the best you can give.
If you turn on your television, you usually see at least one channel on which there is advertisment running.
There are so many different typs of advertisment, so that can be sort them by the things they present or by the possible future client who should buy the promoted thing.
Nowadays, even young childeren (aged two to five) used to look thier films or soaps on television.
The television channels exactly knews who is watching to them, so that they can show adverts for the watcher.
In this case for young children.
But isn't it manipulation?
Should adverts towards young children should be prohibited?
Firstly, even enterprisies who produced stuff for children should have the right to show their products on TV.
They also need a good reputation for selling thier things and how could you present your things better than in an advertisment?
On the other hand, we must say, that children don't have a feeling for things they really need.
So if they see something on TV they really want to have - they are unstoppable.
An other thing is that, children often look television with thier parents.
So the parents could see what they could buy for the sons or girls next birthday or christmas.
However, at the end there are almost everytime the parents who decide what they would or should buy.
The biggest problem would be the child who's crying until he or she has seen something better, maybe in the next advert.
Finally, it may be a problem especially for the parents.
In my opinion, advertising directed towards young children shouldn't be prohibited.
The children could learn, that they can't always buy the things you want and at the end, there are always clear thinking parents.
Pro:
In the 21th century, a big amount of people have a television at home.
It is more and more likely that young children watch television and that they are used to electronics.
There are a lot of films and series for children and babies.
So why not television advertising directed towards them?
It`s more fun and interesting for the children to watch advertisings about games and plays than about mobile phones or restaurants.
With advertisings it`s also easier for their children to make their birthday wishes or christmas wishes when they see new stuff on television.
Contra.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
The children are too young to watch televsion.
They should go outside and play with their friends or someting like that.
The society should not treat them like adults, they should have a different life.
They are too young to be influenced by the media.
My opinion:
I think that it should be allowed to do television advertising directed toward young children, but I also think that it isn`t necessary.
These children are too young to realize and remember what they see on television.
Children don`t make their opinions about the media.
They enjoy watching films but afterwards, they are not interested in the advertising.
If they want something new to play with, they see it in a store or at a friends house.
So on my opinion it is not very useful to make advertising directed towards young children.
In television there is a lot of advertising.
From food to computers and everybody sees the ad.
Each ad has its direction toward a specific group.
But shold it be illigal to make ad directed toward young childern, aged two to five?
First of all I have to point out, that these young children do not even have the money to buy the advertised product.
So the danger of young children buying products only because the have seen it on television, does not exist.
The only thing they can do is asking their parents for buying the wanted product and throwing a tantrum, if they did not get it.
So that is the worst thing, I can imagine, that could happen if a toddler sees an ad.
So in that case I would like to say, that advertising directed toward young children, who are aged two to five, shold be allowed.
But on the other hand, children could be tempted to steal money from there parents in order to buy the product,which was mad ad for on the television.
So in other words children could be criminalized through ad.
But this has not only to do with the ad, it has something to do with education too.
Young children should live their lifes and should not have to build their own opinion about something.
I think, they don't even care.
They are so focused on their playing that they don't even see those advertisings.
If a bank hangs up their poster to get people attached that they open up an account at their bank, and they specialise the advert for children, if the grew up they do it at this bank, it is too much.
Children at this age don't care for this.
There is no reason that they get confronted already with such econmic things wich they however don't understand.
But if it's for a good reason, for example WWF, why should they not get informations about their environment?
It's good to know, in this case now, that there are animals whose species are in danger.
Most of the children love animals.
That's why it is easy to attract attention only with a poster.
The children grow up and have memorys at these posters and go spend their money for organisations like that.
In my opinion it depends on the field for what the advertising wants to get a look on it.
If it's something with that children have nothing to do about, the advertisings shouldn't direct towards people who doesn't even have to know about such things yet.
If it is easy to understand and it is for a good reason,then I think it is okay to influence the children a bit that they know about it later.
There are a few different reasons why television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
First of all, young children aged two to five aren't able to recognize if it's true or not what they are told and what they see on television.On television advertising, there are used many tricks that make the people believe they will be happier and their life will be much better with the product that is shown.
The children believe every word and can get a wrong image   of what is realy important in life, because they do not have any experiences like that yet.
On the other hand, they can maybe also learn something within watching television advertising.
Even on such a young age they can also make their own experiences with consum.It could be a way for them to experience that advertising is not always the truth.In my opinion it would be good, if children learn the difference between what they are told as a (Zielperson) ,and what things are realy like,on a young age.
It would be important to take care, that the children are not confronted with advertising too often.
Otherwise it could have a negative influence on they
When it comes to young children parents tend to protect them from outer influences as long as possible.
On the one hand you could say parents are overprotective, children must learn about the actual reality and have to deal with the triggers people send with advertisements.
Parents themselves often cannot recognize the triggers in advertisements and watch them daily without fearing an influence by media.
So you can question why there would be a potential bad influence for their children.
On the other hand the young children's brain must firstly learn when truths and when lies are told before they can be confronted with advertisements which influence children's thoughts.
Television advertisements manipulate the brain by sending out triggers often not recognized by the mentality.
Children cannot tell if people tell the truth or a lie at such a young age.
To not leave children with this manipulation is not overprotective it is good parenting, which protects young children from problematic influences until they can do it themselves, so I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, but only until they do can tell truths from lies or triggers, they cannot be cut of reality because of potential influences for their whole life.
There are several reasons why television advertising toward young children should or should not be allowed.
I think that Children in the age of two to five are too young to understand that they are manipulated by the commercials.
They will believe everything they are told and by that are easy to manipulate, so that they want to buy all the products the commercial is showing.
Children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them.
That's why televison advertisement that's directed toward young children causes trouble.
On the other hand it's good for the economy if many things are sold, but I think, that children don't understand the advertisement and just want to have the newest best toy and in the advertisement every toy is shown like it's the best of them all.
That's why it's unfair to show children these commercials.
The advertisement could also show the children the variety of items and make them understand, that they don't need everything that's shown in the commercials, but I think that they are just too young to judge.
In the social media Television is really present.
So there are people, which think that television has a bad affect to young people.
Athor people say that there's no danger to people if they consume a lot of TV.
So I want to explaine should Tv advertising toward young children not be allowed ?
I want to begin with a really important theme in case of television.
The biggest probelm is that experiences over years showed that the consum of television can be affected to young people.
The reason is that they are too young understanding, making a difference between the reality and the ficitonal history.
As I mentioned before there is a risk that young people can be addicted to television.
Now we are talking about the television advertising.
The series, films itselves are a potential risk for young people.
If we now also watch a lot of films in the television there is a potential risk that the children are getting addicted by the television.
Despite of the fact that many scientifique researchs showed that it's possible to be addicted to television advertising, I think there is no risk at all.
I also watched films and series when I was a kid but my parents told me if I can watch or not.
So if there are parents, which are looking for his children, I don't see a problem.
I also think it's a bit too much if the state won't allowing the television anymore.
An other point against the question is that you have to make a difference between a serie/film and a documentary.
Television isn't bad at all.
It depends on what you watch on Tv.
I can remember that I watched many documentaries about the nature, the sun system, the danger of plastic in the sea etc.
So I learned more on Television than in the kindergarden

So to sum up I think there are some points, which I thijnk is important to take care of them.
That contains the addiciton to television, loosing contact with your friends and others.
But I think you shouldn't disallowe the consume of Television, because it's also a big part in the world today also with the digitalizing..

Advertises are often shown in the TV.
They adress all ages even really young children.
And that might be a problem as many criticers say.
Young children are easily influencable by television advertising.
So they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour.
On the other hand we could say that it is part of the parent´s job to decide if and what their children watch in the TV, to give them the right values.
Another point might be that children aged two to five are not interested in advertises and even if they are they have no opportunity to get what they want without their parents.
So the parents can control their children nevertheless.
And every child has to learn that not everything what is said in the TV is good and that they can not get anything what they want.
This is a really important process in the life of a child and the understanding is easier when it starts as early as possible.
So I would say that television advertising toward young children should not be forbidden but the parents might know that they have to control the TV activity of their children.
Television is in our time an important source for news for adults or teenagers.
But also young children use it for education.
There are many movies or series with an educating backround.
But the question is if it is so good that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five years) and if it should not be allowed?
In the following part i will explain and answer these questions.
Firstly children get influence by television.
And specially young children who arent educated or who start to learn are a part of these.
Children aged two to five years start to speak and to create their own personality.
So that there are also bad influences, what have follows for the future life of these children.
For example If young children watch 'Teletubbies', who aren't speaking with words the hole episodes, they maybe also wouldn't speak.
This discussion about the 'Teletubbies' are public in the world and politiciens think about stopping the production and to stop selling the DVDs.
But an important thing is also that there are lots of educating movies and series which help the children to live or preparing their life.
They can learn about the right and the wrong.
What is easier to understand when you watch it.
How to handle with another children or how to prepare for school.
So that Television is an important source for young children for preparing their future life.
So I'm disagree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.
These are a too important education source for them.
There are more positiv follows for young children, who watch TV than negative ones.
In the last five years more children in the age of two to five started watching televion for more than three hours a day.
The reason for that is that the television advertise directly toward young children.
On one site children can learn from some of these chanels for young people.
Many chanels started producing movies and series for young children where they show how to learn for example languages like english or french.
As a consequence of this children already learn even in a young age how to speak an other language, so they will may be better when they will come to school and started learning this language there.
On the other site if children started watching television in their freetime for more than one to two hours a day, they have no time to do other things, like going outsite and playing with friends.
But in the age of two to five it is very important to have social contact to other people in their age.
So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should not be allowed, because in this age children started making their first social contacts, which is very impotant for their growing up.
But if the children are just sitting in front of their television they have no time to make these contacts, so it could be that they later may have problems making friends with other people.
All of the younger generations are often seen as the generation of the internet and social media.
But many children nowadays also watch more television instead of playing with their friends.
In fact, more and more parents "plant" their kids in front of the television to have some rest or because the child is more calm.
This effect is often used by huge companies, directing their advertisements towards younger children, in order to raise their sales figures.
This can be seen as exploiting the children's innocence, since they tend to wish for things they saw and that excited them.
The companies actually manipulate the children because especially the younger ones, aged two to five, can't decide whether it is something they really need or if it was simply shown in an advertisement.
So should, as a consequence, this advertising be forbidden?
Personally, I don't consider this solution as efficient or neccessary, even if children are nothing but the medium to their parents' money.
Enterprises have chosen this method of advertising because they are on current with nowadays' methods of "raising" a child and that televisions are often a part of it.
If the parents now think of this advertising as ethically wrong, one also has to think about who is letting two to five year olds sit in front of the TV.
So it is actually the parents' duty to raise their kinds sensible to what they are seeing or hearing.
For sure, children are manipulated by exciting advertisements and are used to make their parents buy these products, but if parents are upset with that, they shouldn't allow their child to be manipulated.
Instead of blaming companies of their poor skills raising their child, they should put more attention to what they are transmitting their child and enlighten them about possible manipulating advertising, even at that young age.
Letting a two year old sit in front of the television is not the right way to silent them and there are a lot of other methods to use in order to excite one's child.
So, play with your kids instead of telling media to stop such advertising.
You don't need to worry about something, that has no impact on you or your children.
I'm agree with the following statement that television advertising directed toward young children in the age between two to five should not be allowed.
In this case you have to know that television advertising can be negative for the growing up of little children because in many television advertising, there are bad stuff.
It's right that little children in the age between two to five don't understand much about a lot of things but I think that the television advertising would influence them indirect in their growing up.
On the other hand, I think it's alright if there is television advertising especially for their age group but if there's television advertising for teenager/adults it's not okay anymore.
Television or any other media stuff is a big factor and influence in our world for all people.
You have to think how little children feel aswell but not many persons do that.
They only think "they are small, they don't think, they understand nothing in their age" and for them it doesn't matter how they feel.
But you have to see it in a different view, little children maybe know what's going on in this situation and television advertising is sometimes, not always, a part of their growing up.
Maybe they don't understand a lot but they know, or better to say they feel all of that what's happened.
In my opinion the worse thing and you can't do it aswell is that nobody asks them how they feel or if they want that.
All people think of themselves and this is in character very egoistic/selfish.
In conclusion, you see sometimes it is important that television advertising directed toward little children in some cases (if it's not television advertising for adults/teenagers) but summarized it should not be allowed.
Growing up in the times that we live in, it's not unusual to watch television by a very young age.
That's also the logical reason, why producers initially created some series only aiming at very young viewership.
But unluckily, there's more to watching TV than just having fun or even learning from of the series small children watch.
They are already, and I mean at a very young age, forced to see advertisement, whilst the small breaks that the TV producers need, to get back the money that they initially burnt making the series.
In this essay, I want to argue wheter or not advertisements should be sent on channels, which directly point at a very specific viewership of very young people.
The first aspect, already mentioned in the introduction above is that the producers of certain or rather all TV shows for children have to get back their money in the end.
The movies, films, series etc.
that they show to the children, weren't made for free, so it is necessary for them to even produce content for the children.
However, it would make no sense for them to show them advertisements which are produced for adults, because it would not make any economic sense, to let children watch advertisements, the producer of the advertisement can't profit of / the children aren't interested buying in.
The second aspect is the psycological side to this whole question.
Despite of producers having to make money, the series for children should be made for education, learning or even entertainment purposes.
At the age of two to five years, many children are very unconscious of what they are watching.
It should  not be allowed for TV channels, to show advertisement which is directed to such young children, because they don't usually have the awareness of what advertisement does to them yet.
By showing advertisements, they influence small children which mostly don't have their own opinion and, because of that, are very influencable.
Taking influence on them that they are unaware of should not be aloud because it's taking a huge impact on a childs thinking without the child even realising it.
Having watched TV for a few years now, I can come to the conclusion that there should not be advertisements directed toward young children.
For me, it's rather the ethical aspect and the psycological influences that let me come to the conclusion that they should not be allowed.
It's just not right to influence a child of this age, not being able to make their own opinion yet and unaware of what the advertisement tries to do to the child.
So in the end: Money isn't every
They controll our childreen.
Nowerdays childreen spend lots of their time watching television.
As many smaller childreen (aged two to five) believe in evrerthing they hear or see because they are not able to bild their own opinion yet, they are a popular victim of advertising companies.
There are ads for toys, kids food and the newest sport articles.
The ads are often  straight directed towards young childreen with the use of childish language and by creating a happy and concsious atmospere with backround music and certain matching colors in the spot.
It leads to different behavior of your childreen, as they want more and more because they get to see the newest and hottest toys erveryday, that is why soner or later nothing will be good enough for them anymore.
On the other hand your kids are always well informed about the newest trends.
Therefore it is possibly the best way to find a way between getting your childreen some of the goods but not always and when ever they want.
But advertisement also creates a wrong image of reality.
Articles shown in ads compared to their real quality and outer aperience often contains a big differnece.
In the ads everything looks perfect, ervery girl or boy is smiling and ervery product is shining as the products are are made looking perfect for the ads with the help of modern computer technology like photoshop.
That's why I think there should be certain rules for the advertising companies which they have to follow, for example to downgradse the use of photoshop to influence the childreen.
Because they bring parents into difficult situations where it is hard for them not to upset their childreen when they see the actuall product compared to the image which was presented in the ads before.
this text is about my meaning about the statement, Television advertising directed toward yound chidren (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
I think, that young children can't even know and don't understand what the meaning of the advertising is.with the new technologys, the most televisions can skip the advertising, because nobody cares it.
I think it isn't that dangerous for children (aged two to five), because they can't deside something.
For example, there is an advertisnig of an barbie in the television and my ittle sister want to have it, my parents can deside if my sister get this barbie or not.
Also they can play outside and don't have tobe the whole time inside and watch television.
At the other hand, little children can cry about something they like and maybe the parents have to do what the childrens want, because it isn't that funny to have a child who always cry.
For me it doesn't matter if there is a television advertising directed toward young children or not.
When i don't want to watch it i can just skip it.
But maybe when i get older and have children by myself, it can be bad to always have unhappy children, because they see something better in the television that at home.
I think it is a stupid desition to make that not allowed.
In the world we have bigger problems instat the television advertising directed toward youing children.
Children should not get in touch with televisions too soon.
A television is nothing good at all, it is a waste of time.
That does not mean, that I do not watch TV in my spare time.
But you do not have to start in your early ages, if you do so you will most likely get used to it.
But there are a lot of other things you could do in your young ages, which you will not do if your grown up.
Parents should help their children to have a happy childhood.
That means for example motivate your child to go out and play with friends.
I think that this is importent for the development of the personality.
A child has a lot of power avaiable, and it should make use of it.
If you are sitting in fornt of the television you do not move.
This could lead to overweight.
As we all know there is a big chance that people with overweight get diabetes.
This is very tragic because those people have this illness for the rest of their lifes.
In america there are a lot of people diagnosed with diabetes type 1.
This type of diabetes you get from eating food with big amounts of sugar and fat in it.
If you do have bad eating habbtis and you do not move enough, because you are sitting in front of the TV you will become overweight or you even might get diabetes.
My opinion to that statement is divided.
On the one hand I think that the television advertising which is directed toward young children could lead to a higher television consume at a younger age, because the young children are willing to watch the advertising which is meant especially for them.
In this case, they would spend more time inside the house and not in the nature playing with their friends.
The parents have to keep an eye on their children to protect them against too much television advertising and television consume.
On the other hand I think that it is not that necessary to not allow television advertising directed toward young children, because it is in the hand of the parents or everyone else in general how to handle this situation.
In our modern times and the technical improvements it is clear that companies search for ways to improve their advertising aswell.
That is why they use the televison to spread their advertising for their products all over the country on the easy way with putting it into the televison.
In my opinion the companies hope to reach with that kind of advertising, with cute little children in it, the parents and make them buy that product for their child too or to buy it just because that advertising make them feel in some way.
I think parents identify easily with televison advertising which is set up like this, because they think about their own child directly.
But I think everybody have to think about that statement on his own to have an own opinion about it.
I can not make a point in that case, because I can understand the companies acting in that way, but i can also think of the fears people might have about television advertising directed toward young children.
All in all it is a exercise for all of us to find a good way to handle this situation, because the technology will improve and improve and there will be more and more companies using this way of advertising.
First of all, I would say that it would be difficult to stop televison advertising which is directed toward young children in the ages from two to five.
Televison advertising could be helpful especialy for parents if they don´t have an idea concerning to give a present to their child.
But on the other hand, watching telivison advertising in these ages can lead to the missing ability to appreciate things which are advertised in the TV, such as toys or electronic devises to play with.
If they always want more toys, the parents maybe will follow their wishes to make their children happy and make these wishes come true, which can lead to the missing abilities mentioned before.
They also wouldn´t know the value of these things.
My opinion to this topic is, that televsion  advertising directed to young children should be stopped.
Furthermore, the parents have to have an eye on their children if they watch TV.
Watching TV in these ages can also be discussed, whether it´s good for them.
In todays society mostly every familiy watches regular television.
It's not unusual that young children are also there watching.
So why shouldn't be these companies be allowed to send advertisment directed directly to these young children.
First I want to say that the parents have to watch their children.
This means that they have to figure out if the program and ads are harming their children.
If so they must switch the channel or better let those kids play outside.
But if the parents can't stay with their kids checking what kind of programmms come.
Then we should take into account that those small kids can't yet figure out if thos adverts are misleading.
So those kids are unprotected strayed to those companies.
This means that those companies can influence the evolution of their personality.
For sure we don't have to think now about a society like in brave new world but it can be dangerous.
I am a supporter of the free market so i think the best is if we let the companys do whatever they want.
Because the custommer in the end can chose if he will buy the product and consume it.
Nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches TV.
In the television is so much aadvertising like never before and even small children watch television.
So it may occure the question whether TV advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) shoud or should not be allowed.
First you should allow this kind of avertising because it helps the parents to buy things which fit with the specific wishes of their children.
So the little child can watch TV and after the adverts it says that it likes to have this and that.
Therefor the child doesn't have to speak well, it's enough to say "I want that" and it points on the advert.
Then, the parents can simply buy the object.
Next, this kind of advertising helps the companies to improve their sales and adress the specific group of people which the products are made for.
So they would do baby-toy-advertisments only for young children aged from two to five.
On the other hand, this adverts shouldn't be allowe because these young children can't do anything with this adverts.
The children get irritated and don't know how to react.
As an adolscent you know how to deal with adverts and that their content isn't always the truth.
But children especially young children don't know.
More important, theses adverts influence the children's mind and their psychological development.
That's not good.
Children may believe what's said in the advert.
Plus the strategy of advertisment is to create needs and children can't deal with that.
All in all, adverts for children aged from two to five shouldn't be allowed because of their negative effects on the children.
They create wrong needs and slow down the psychological development.
They only help companies to improve their profits and this is not good.
We shou
In the following text I will inform you about television advertising.
I am agree with this Statement because the televison advertising have many negatives effects.
The first one is that the children often want the object in the televion.
They think that is cool and they often try to convince their parents.
If they don't get the object, they start to cry or they are sad about the desission of their parents.
The parents don't like to see their children cry and they bought the object for them.
Forthermore the childrens often dont need the object.
The seller push their object in the advertising because he know what he have to say.
He only tells the posi and the children see that and in result they get it from their parents.
In addition the parents should explain theire children how they have to handel with advertising.
The children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money.
If they don't learn this, they could have problems in their life.
All in all the advertising isn't good for the young people.
It stress the parents and it could destroy the entership between the family and friends.
In my oppinon its not a problem the make advertisment on TV for young children.
I mean they also see new/ other toys they would like to have when they are playing with an other child.
That has the same influene.
In my view the parents have a big influence on their child and they can controle what their children are watching.
So it's in the hands of the parents what they think is the best for their child.
And yes it can also be challanging for parents, when their child wants to have something that it saw in an advert, but you as a parent can use it wisely and can show their child that it can't always get what it wants and that it has to wait for something.
I think for the economy its really important that they can advertise on TV because thats the most efficant way to advertise in these days.
Not many people specially childrend, are looking in a magasin to choose their new toys.
In TV you can also choose exactly who should watch your advert and who doesnt so the advertisement is very efficient.
On the other hand children cant filter the information they get.
So if in the advert a plane is flying, the child thinks that the plane is actually able to fly and thats not fair.
If they then get the plane and realise, that the plane cant fly, they will be very disappointed.
I think that we cant say that advertisment in TV is not allowed towards young people.
We should make strict rules on how the advertisment for young people should be made.
An imortant rule in my view would be, that there should be no lies allowed or graphical tricks.
The rest should be in the hands of the parents.
There are TV channels just for children without any advert in it.
If parents disagree with it they can just make their child watch one of those channels.
''Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed``.
Thats the way many people think about the influnce of media like televison on young children.I dont think it should be not allowed but i am not the opinion that its positive for them.
Every parent should decide if he lets his child watching things  which can be dangerous for the development of his own child.
Not everybody sees that as negativ because a lot of people doesnt believe that children for example aged two to five understand the things they see.Many parents cant even imagine that many aspects while the growing process can have an influence on the futured personality of the kids.For me its the biggest problem in todays community and forbiding of television andvertising directed to to the young children wouldnt be a solution for the probmlem.
For me its hard to judge about this because i never thought so intensiv about this topic.
Maybe because i am not a parent yet so its hard for me to find more arguments for and against the statement manchend at the begiining.
In the following text, I will discuss the controverse theme if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
On one hand it´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children, because the children in the age of two to five can´t say anything about there own opinion, because they are to young to say it.
I think children maybe don´t want advertising that is directed toward them.
The children aged two to five are far too young to think about there own opinion and to think about advertising being directed toward them.
On the other hand you could say that it´s good to direct the advertising toward young children even if they can´t say if they want to do that, because it´s the only way to direct an advertising toward young children.
It´s also important for the television advertising to do that.
All in all I think the statement is correct even though it might be important for the television to direct advertising toward those young children.
I think television advertising toward young children should not be allowed.
Children aged from two to five years are just in the beginning of their development as humans and do not understand the consequences.
Teenagers and even adults have often problems with getting influenced by advertises so how could we think they would not even more harm to these small children.
In these days when there is advertising everywhere it is almost inevitable that the children see it too.
But the advertizes directed straight to them are the probably the most harmful.
As an example a commercial from fast food restaurant in which they offer a free toy with the meal can be really damaging to these young children.
They do not understand consequences of eating unhealthy food.
There of course advertises of positive things as well and it would be hard to regulate which advertises are allowed and which not.
I still think we should try to do our best to not get the kids influenced by advertising because of the numerous bad side-effects they cause.
In my opinion it isn't as harmful as some of the publicity which little children are confronted with.
Children nowedays grow up with electronic devices and it is quite normal and safe to say that children see things which they shouldn't see or what they should not see yet.
Advertising isn't harmful, it is the content in it which isn't okay.
The content should be checked before some companys publish it.
But children could learn from advertisement.
They could improve their language and their vocabulary just by listening to the conversation or what is being told in it.
I'm sure the children don't know all of the words which they hear while watching TV so it is an improvement.
At this age children are keen on developing their abilities, even though they might don't know it yet.
It is important that they have a basis to build on.
It isn't useful for anybody to keep the children isolated from the environment and slow down the improvement of the abilities thich they will need in the upcoming future.
On the other hand the advertising is directly directed to children so the companies which produce the adverts won't use difficult words.
They have to make sure that even the youngest children are able to understand what they are saying.
So the fact is that children won't learn that much of new words because of the difficulty, which isn't really given.
Children from two to five are there in an age where they start building longer sentences with words they start using from hearing and picking up whereever they are.
So to be honest, I don't mind giving the companys that much of freedom to let them produce adverts for young children.
It is a win-win situation in which the children learn something and the companys make profit.
I'm not sure whether it should be allowed or not that isn't down to me to decide but it I have made my point and I see more positve contribution than negative.
"Young children should play outside more often" that is sentence every child has heard a lot of times in her or his young years, but why should they play outside?
Now a days a television and the outraging development of the technology is very normal to the young generation and there parent generation.
The only generation is the elders generation whom are not used to technology at all.
There are a few ones that do not have a probleme with the change but the most do.
So the snetence above is mostly to hear form the older generation.
The children should be allowed to watch television and use all the technology the presnt has to offer because we are living in a constant development of technology and in the future there will be more of that.
Some say that it is all going to be compromized and going to be technical.
The only thing parents could do is to set a limit of TV watching for there children so they can be social and hang out with there friends.
actually that is a thing that every child is going to do in that young age they are going to the kindergarden or to a kita and will only be watching TV in the mo0ments when they are at home.
As you can see there are a lot of times where they do not have time watch TV so they shopuld have a time where they are allowed to watch there series or there favorite movie.
That is what makes the children happy now a days.
Furthermore more many child series and movies on TV teach many life lessons so that the children will be prepared for life and their social life.
For example Dora or other Series there are some Episodes where they solve math problemes, teach you how to deal with strangers or hoe to treat your friends.
Fact is that the series that they watch on TV prepare for school.
The only thing that could be held against that statement is that there are not only children series on TV but also horror movies and other bad stuff that children at that age should not watch.
For that parents can just install a code for those channels so the children will not have a chance to watch these.
Also to hold against the argument that children that watch TV are not interfering with there family anymore, the parents could watch the sereies with them and make a game out of it so they will make TV watching a family activity.
In the end I can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 2-5 must be allowed to interfier with that.
In the future there will be more and more technology and we can not forbidm the children to not live that life.
In the following essay i will show negativ reasons and examples for the statement " Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed".
In my opinion i agree with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples.
The first reason is that young children at the age from two to five can not understand the main statement from the television because there brain can not translate or understand the film which is shown as a consequence it should not be allowed.
My second reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours after hours tv and so they would  not focus on there future work lives.
The third and important reason for me is that the television is a media which is lying fluently to have better quotes of the public to become famous and rich.
The children would grow up with wrong information before they could understand the truth of the television and its consequences on their.
There future lives could be mainly destroyed or would stay on the lies of the television.
My last reason is that children at the age of two to five are defintiv to young to look tv because of the risks and the consequences of this media to themselves.
Yours jason
I think my children will never watch TV until they're over 6 years old.
My parents threated me like this and I have the same opinion.
For those parents who will let their children watch TV before this age or they watch with them in a very young age, the eyes of the kids will develop in a bad
way.
I used to watch TV when I was 12 I think but now I don't watch anymore because there aren't good programms anymore.
Maybe there are some good series for kids which can help them to learn speaking or reading that would be great but i don't know if it's better when they learn this in school.
I also think that children in the age between 2 and 5 should either play with real toys like a car or puppets and  I think it's especially important to be outside in this age.
For example I played a lot of soccer with my dad and my sister was dancing everytime, for me things like that are better to do in a childhood.
Maybe also to learn some threatments with other young children.
Like me and my sister, when we were five years old, we were staying outside at our neighborhood playing with a lot of other young kids with the similar interests.
Television has been a big thing over the last fifty years and with the TV there came the advirtising.
It is very important for companys to promote their products so that the people actually want to buy them.
The question is if this manipulating advertisment is harming for little children?
On one hand children aged 2 to five are of course very easily manipulated which can lead to annoying children beggin for money to buy those things.
Its important that children not get affected by those ads so that they not get the will to have everything they see in this world which is already filled with greedyness.
On the other hand children need to learn as early as possible that in this world you have to learn how to resist and to know what is good for you and not fall into every marketing trap they show you.
Its for sure that those ads also helps the children to get to know all those products.
All in all it probably hasn't the best impact for little children and I think you should keep them away from this marketing stategies as long as you can but I also grew up with television advertisment and it hasn't caused to much harm in my case.
I believe the parents have the responsibility to explain their children that what they see isn't always how it isin real life when you actually buy those things.
Probably the first thing we tink about is: "is it good or is it bad for the children?"
- But before we think about the children I want to take a look on the other side...
If it wouln't be allowed to do Televisom advertising the Television-Business would have a big Problem.
They would not be able to keep on streaming.
They get a big part of their money by getting those TV advertising on!
An other point of view is if we don't allow Television adversiting to young children they'll never get used to it.
I mean we all know those stupied or boring adversiting but we are used to it and we don't bother if we see.
It's somthing we see all day and little children should be able to see it too.
We live in a time where everything is bad and getting worse but the truth is that the older generation had to go through the same things and they are still alive...so please don't make a drama out of everything!
On the other side we all know that television for little children is not that good.
Some people even say that its very unhealthy.
They have a problem with understanding everything and we all know that a lot television advertising is real shit.
Some are filled with black humor others with sexuell jokes I don't know how children are supposed to understand anything.
It also makes some people and even children addicted to it.
They start buying things out of those Television advertising and can't stop doing that... 
Addiction to television is something really bad and if children suffer from it they need halp!
My opinion is that children should be allowed to watch television even with Tv advertising in it I mean they should get used to it... if we make everything kids-friendly they never get used to the real world!!

The whole day, when I'm in school, series for children are shown in the televisoin, including advertisements.
Should it be allowed to show children aged two to five advertisments?
On one hand, children see new things, know what's existing through othre sources than only their parents and maybe the kindergarden.
A marketing group that wants to sell their products is quiet interested in television advertisment for young children.
They are influencable very well and they are fastly convinced from such advertisements.
The advertisement can also be fitting to the serie that the children are watching.
For example, that an advertisement for horse-toys is shown during a series about horse-stories.
This is also a positive point for the ones that want to sell their products.
Children aged two to five have a lot more impressions of their environment.
Their parents, siblings, kindergarden-guides and other children.
But also very important are the stories that they hear, the movies and the series which they watch.
And they are not only influenced by the movie or the series, but by the advertisement too, because especially children can't difference from the movie or series and the advertisement.
In case of a leadership of a dictator or a very radical party, especially children can be victims of propaganda.
And that propaganda can be made very well in television and in the advertisement that is shown there.
As a conclusion, if they stop allowing advertisements during children series, I would stop allow some series at all and ot only the advertisement, because there are many childrens series that make the children dumb.
And that is also a kind of propaganda and it's more influencing than the advertisement between.
Through that, the marketing effect for the sellers is still here what is an positive effect too.
This essay will be about the ban of advertising spots on television, directing to children between the age of two and five.
On the one hand, children are not able to think critically about the advertisement.
They cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant.
For example, children do not need their own playstation when they are really young, they do not know that it is unhealthy if they use it too much, for example, that they get problems with their eyes et cetera.
On the other hand, if the parents take care of them and pay attention, the children will not get any problems, but they will have fun with their new toy or other things.
But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy.
For example if a child sees a plastic horse on TV running around and jumping, it would think, that this horse is really able to do that, but it is not.
Furthermore, there would be some children, who want to get everything they see on TV and for poor parents, it would be really difficult to explain why their friends already own these things which seem to be important.
But for the industry, it is easier to persuade children than adults who reflect their acting.They would not profit of this ban, although watching TV for young children is dangerous and unhealthy in general.
To conclude, I think, these advertisements should not be allowed, because for the children, there is no benefit.
Their health and happyness would suffer and the profit of the industry is not worth it.
In the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices.
In the following text I will write about the aspects, which speak for or against the advertisment, which is directed to young children.
The biggest argument against the advertisment is that, children are very easy to influece, because they do not have enough experience to know what is wrong and what is write.
Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.
On the other hand children are learning very much in this part of life, so the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products.
But this aspect is just valuable, if the advertisment is supposed for children and does not have strongly influecing parts.
Maby the companies could make an advertisment, which gives the child useful information.
The information could be about important topics in our contemporary society for example about the responsable thing eith the nature.
In conlusion I would say that  a special advertisment for children should only be allowed, if the advertisment is controlled by the parents or a kind of institute in the aspect of influece a learning.
Television directed toward young people should  be allowed but the children should watch tv not so often like adults, because they have not enough concentration to watch an hour a day.
Moreover it is bad for the childrens eyes.
Young children must play with other friends and should not sit at home to watch television.
But often young children can learn something by watching television.
An example is that they learn to treat the other children in the kindergarten better or learn to say different words.
Also little children learn what is forbidden and what is right but they should watch series which are made for young children with an age of two to five.If they look criminal series it is not good for their evolution and they can missundertand what the people are doing.
Televison advertising is not good for the childish brain because they do not know what is important and what is not but i do not think that it is bad if they watch it.
I disagree with this statement because it is not bad if little child seeing television advertising in this age but they should not watch it so often.
Younger people than
This essay is about the topic if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
Companies which sell for example toys or games are doing much television advertising directed toward young children.
Children are easy to manipulate and if they want something really bad they often get it because their parents can not stand their cute child.
So the companies make much money with these advertising especially at chrismas time.
So it is kind of good for the industry and the TV channels.
But kids should not think they can have everything and those whose parents have not much money should not be shown what they miss.
Besides should the media not be directed to so young kids.
Children in this age should go outside and enjoy their childhood and do not sit inside infront of the television or other media.
I would prefer it if the advertising of toys and other childish things would be directed to the parents and not to the child so that the parents can choose what they want to buy and the kid is happy about that one thing and does not want every toy in the advertising.
I would say the answer for this is very difficult.
First off all it seems to manipulate the young children, because the things named in the advertisings are used to atract these young children.This works because they don´t even think about the price and if they really need these things.
Nevertheless, these children aren´t allowed / can´t even buy these things by themselfe.
So in the end the parents are the people who have to buy these things and have to spend their money on this.
But when they don´t do this, their children start crying and behave absolutly stupid.
So in the end both, children and parents, are mad.
On the other side, advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television.
That is the normal reason to produce advertisings.
It is the same aspect when you see some advertisings for adults, like an advertising for some good beer or a new video game.
Also trailers of movies works like this - they have to make people interested in the topic of the movie.
Nevertheless, chilrden are much more open minded for advertisings, so it works much better with them instead of adults.
I partly agree with this statement.
First of all I think it is useless because none of the children is interested in advertising it is just annoying for them.
Another reason why this is useless is that the person who buys the product are their parents or other familiy members.
The only way the advertising is affecting the children is when the children like the colours or animals in the advertising spot and then they long for it.
This could lead to a quite embarassing moment for the parents when they are at the supermarket and their child starts complaining or even  screaming until they get what they want.
In the other way the advertising could affect the children in a positiv way.
For example when the advertising shows a monkey eating a banana the children tend to eat more fruits or when they see how other children are having fun playing outside the childer might tend to go outside more often, which personally I think is really important nowadays.
But I don't think that the producer of television advertising is interessted in how they can affect a children's health life.
So generally it's maybe a bit hard to not allow those television advertising I just think they are useless.
A positive aspect is that television advertising is an etertainment for children.
Sometimes you can learn while wachting television, when it is a documentary about something.
On the other side young children between two and five years shouldn't watching television.
At first it isn't good for the eyes, and when the figures in television not speak correctly children learn the language false.
Children shouldn't watch often television, because then they seat all the time.
They need activity, they must go out and move.
In this age children learn a lot for life and television don't help they for that.
My opinion for this is, that young children don't need to watching television.
In this ages the children must play with each other and have contact with other childrens.
I think in the age between two and five children need many activity and must learn things they need later for life.
Finally we can say that television advertising isn't good for young children but it should be allowed.
Then the parents could forbid to watching television for the childrens or not, it's their own opinion.
Television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society.
There are some good points, but also many bad ones for the children.
In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life.
Television advertising can be good for a children, whose parents are very busy and do not have many time for their child.
Many television channels have learn programms for children, where children can learn for example languages or easy vocabulary.
But it is not good for the children, to just sit in front of a TV and watch channels.
They need influences of their parents and of other kids.
They need to go out to the playground, play with their friends and get social.
I think that children, who sit the whole day in front of a television, will not educate as good as the ones, who go out and learn from their parents and from their activities.
The other children will not learn, how to get friends and to communicate with different people.
They will also not have a good relation to their parents, because they did not spend much time with them, when they were young.
I think, that it is really important for a children to have a good relation to their mother and father.
The position of parents is so important for children, because they learn from them and act like them.
When they do not spend much time with their parents, when they are young it will have aftermath, when they are adults.
When they go to school, they will possibly be a misfit, beacause they did not learn, how to make friends and be social.
To conclusion, I agree with that statement, because the television advertising is not good for a well education of the children and the relation to family.
"Television advertising directed toward young childern (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
This statement should be discussted very well because children haven't built an own opinion yet and so they belive everything that they see.
So what are the arguments against and what are the arguments for this statement.
First of all as mentioned before, children can be influenced very easily when they are younger and there are ads everywhere.
So if children see how the children in the ads play with many different toys, they want to have that too and they grow up with the idea of having everything in their lives.
With our ads we create a society of people who belive that owning a lot of things is important and do we really want that?
On the other hand you could say that small children can't really do things on their own, expecially if they are 2 years old.
So it's in the hands of the parents to look after their children and decide wether an ad is important or not.
In the end you could say that it is in the interest of the parents how they want to raise their child and how much they let their children be influenced by the media.
The question weather television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not ins't that easy to answer.
On the one hand the children are so small that they aren't able to reconize the fact that they get manipulated plus the fact that is pretty easy to do it because they don't have th ability to reflect things.
On the other hand ads can be an insparation for the kids independet from their parents.
They maybe get introduces to some different things which show them the diversity of the world.
An other negative point is that the childrens aren't abled to judge things regarding their quality or the need of it.
They are simply very easy to impress which makes them making desicions about spending money they don't have and can cause a lot of frustration if they don't get it.
But here we are at the point where the parents take place.
They are finally the one who decide weather to buy the advirtised product or not.
They have also the exercise to teach their kids the handling of money, the use, treatment and importance of things and the moral behind it so that they have the power/need to change their kids minds.
All in one it is a big industry which is interestes in the childs opinion because they are good selling customers.
It can be seen as ,regarding to the moral, false or as, regarding to the industry, good.
In my opinion there is nothing bad about directing television advertising to the children because they get into the diversity which exists and learn about the parents how to handle it.
The only problem which occures is that if the parents don't theach their children they might get too much manipulated and materialistic.
Should television advertising be directed toward young children?
This is a well discused question and in the following I try to answer it.
On the one hand a pro argument of showing these advertisings in Tv is, that the products have mostly a pedagogic aspect, so the child learns new things.
There are, for example, dolls, that talk with the child and it learns to speek.
Another good thing about the advertising is, that also the parents see them and might find new toys for their kids.
Something they might not found without watching the advertise.
On the other hand children of this age have a high level of influence.
The companies could sell them whatever they want, if they make the advertise colored and happy enough.
At his age children can not decide what is good and what is bad, so if their hear for example: war is good, they maybe think this is true.
Also children in young years should not watch television too much.
Making advertising for them, shows that there is a high number of children watching tv and if the companies would stop it, maybe not as much children would watch television.
Watching too much tv is at this age not really good for the evolution.
Last but not least, the kids can become mad, when they see what the advertising offers and what they have in their room (e.g.toys).
They wont be as happy as they were, because the children want more and more things but can not always get them from their parents.
In my opinion television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed.
I think kids at this age should go outside and play and not watch Tv the wohle day, and if they do, they should not be influenced by consumorientated companies, which just want to earn money and do whatever they can do to get it.
In our century it is totally normal to see some children playing with the smartphones of their parents while they're talking with other people or just don't have enough time to look after their childs.
So why should television advertising not be allowed?
The children are to young to really understand what they are seeing in the Tv.
They can't understand the real background of advertising so they wouldn't be affected by it.
But maybe if they at the age of five years they can learn something for life by watching the advertising, as an example: watching this things about healthy food or just anything about a healthy lifestyle.
Of course they don't understand this things at this time but maybe when the grown up they remind something about the advertising and then they understand.
So in one way advertising supports the education of the children.
On the other hand you can say that watching Tv at the age of two years isn't really good for their eyes.
Because if I watch TV for too long, my eyes begin to hurt and I can't let them stay open so I have to close them to stop the burning inside and I think that if you're just two years old that would be many times worse.
So too much TV  is really unhealthy not only just for the childs.
They could also be perplexed by the crazy and sometimes really stupid advertising which were playing between our films and series.
I think also that if you have a child between two and five years you could do so many beautiful things with it than just watching some stupid Tv shows.
In my opinion the child could learn so much more about life outside in the forest than inside on the couch.
Especially the advertising never shows the real world.
Every advertising in the Tv is re-worked by photoshop or some other programm that makes the pictures or the little short-films more pretty and nearly perfect.
As a result the child doesn't get to know the real society out there and so they don't learn really anything right about life.
Sometimes this advertising affects a child so much that it want to be like their idol in the Tv that it falls into a down and is really unhappy with him-self.
In my opinion the advertising has not to be forbidden for the children but then the parents have to say them if something isn't right and is just invited stuff.
So in that way I think that advertising is good for them because then they could learn something about the life that they have to live when they have been grown up.
But the medias should also don't do longer this stupid, not really helpful advertising which is just stupid.
I can't say if i'm agree or disagree with this statement, because there are reasons why it is good for little children to watch television but there are also reasons why it isn't good.
First I would say that it istn't bad to watch TV, but only if you don't watch to much.
I think also that litte children could learn something important or perhaps they could learn new words.
And of course if you are have boring, you could watch television so that you haven't boring any more.
But as I told at the beginning there are also reasons why it is better that children plays with his toys instead of watching television.
The first reason is that little children should communicate a lot with children with the same age.
And if the watch TV it isn't possible to talk to other children.
A second reason is also that the screan is not good for the eyes, so it could be possiple that they have to waer glasses later.
For little children it's also important to go a lot outside and play in the frish ear and not to stay inside and don't move.
Because sport is also very important and if they always sit in front of the television and don't move it's not healthy.
So I would say that if the children (aged two to five) don't look to much television it should be allowed!
In the following text I will discuss the question if television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not.
The first argument against ads for young children is, that they will probably not understand what the purpose of an ad is, so they will want to have the advertised item.
This will be expensive for the parents or the child and the parents are going to fight over it.
An argument for advertising directed towards young children is, that they will see new things to play with and maybe they will get a bigger imagination or just new ideas.
But watching too much TV in general is not advisable for young children because they should play outside and think for their own instead of just getting their stories delivered through the TV.
But also an argument for these ads is, that children can choose a new food they want to try or a new game they want to play because they have seen it in an advertisment.
They will quicker learn new things.
The next argument against advertising is that the companies who make these ads should not use the not-knowing of the children to make more money.
But the opposite of that argument is also an argument fot these ads if you see it from the perspective of the companies who then gain money.
Gaining more money because of these ads is good for the companies and following from that also good for the economy of the country in which these ads are allowed in.
Another argument for these ads is, that if the children watch TV they are occupied because with different ads the TV program is different from day to day.
So the parents can do housework like cooking or doing laundry without really caring for the child for a few minutes.
The last argument against ads directed toward young children is  
In my opinion the advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because the companies should not use young children in that way to get more money.
I think it is wrong.
Although to mutch consume of digital media like Smartphones, Computer and Television is´t good at all for young children because it takes big influence on the way their brains develob in a negative way.
So responsibl parents shold act in a way not let their children whatch all of this ''junk'' TV.
But if children of the age of two to fife years whatch TV, in germany they are often whatching ''SuperRTL'' and in this childfriendly program they publish many scenes showing violence and there is a lot of advertising to.
And in the advertisin they show the newest and coolest toys and when these young children look at them, they emidiatly whant to have them.
so in some famylies they get the new toys as quick as they publish them but some parends would say no and then, because of this normality of violence showen in TV, the children start to behave the same and not just at home but also in the kindergarden and at their friends homes.
In my opinion advertising should be banned out of childfriendly TV and they should also renew and think about what they show in this kind of TV and if this might be realy childfrtiendly.
I think televesion towards young children in the age from two to five should not be allowed, because children in that age can be manipulated very easily.
They can only watch it and cannot understand, what is shown in the advertisement.
When there is a happy child in their age, which is playing with a specific toy from a specific brand, for the advertisement of this brand, the child wants to play with this toy too and it will try to make his parents give him that specific toy, because it can´t really understand that the advertisement it trying to make this effect.
When an older child is watching television and sees an advertisement it can understand the things that take place in the advertisement and can see that the advertisement is only an child, who is only playing with this toy for the advertisement and they can make a differce between toys they really want and toys they only want, because the child in the advertisement seemed to be happy, while playing with this toy.
But I think televison advertisement towards young children cannot be forbidden, because we live in a democratic state, where everybody can publish, what they wrote or filmed.
I think you can only stop advertisement towards young cildren, when it is affecting them in a negative way and then you can only stop a specific spot.
But the most advertisements are not affecting the children in a negative way, they only make the children want a toy.
And I think that is a very important way for companys to sell their products, because this is the most affective and also the easiest way to reach the children and earn money by selling them specifc toys.
So I think advertisement for children sould not be allowed, when it is affecting them in a negative way and sets them under a bad influence.
But when televison advertisement towards young children is not allowed it doesn´t stop that young children can be manipulated very easily and want most of the things they see.
So I think advertisement towards young children should be allowed.
i think children from 1 to 5 shouldnt watch television at all.
they should go outside and play and not sit inside and watch television.
in our society today all kids just sit inside and play with their tablats or phones that is very bad they dont receive the experience from playing outside the advanteruse in the forests or the scary dog from your neighbor they just knew the internet.
my generation ist i think the last who doesnt have phones or something in teir childhood we play outside with our friends and doesnt text over facebook or snapchat.
its scary because when you say to your child stop watching television and go outside  they have no idea what to do.
advertising in the television is not just bad for kids from 1 to 5 its also bad for adults.
the advertiser are very tricky and they know exactly ho to catch the people to buy things from them.
advertising should be stoped but  thats impossible because the concerns are too big and cannot be stoped.
advertising should not be allowed for kids up to 18 because its very dangerous and many kids buying things that they dont knew they really buy.
Finally i think it should be stoped but its impossible.
Advertsing is too big in the society today.
The only thing we can do is to take our kids away from the tv and take our time with them so they dont want watch tv anymore.
The following essay deals with the topic of allowing television advertising for young children from age two to five.
There are different reasons either supporting this advertising or not.
A good side of television advertisement is the fact that some products for children can be presented on TV and the children will talk to their parents about it.
if the ads would only run on channels for adults, they probably would not listen or react to it as much as the young kids do.
Many adults simply do not watch television advertisement.
Having the children informed through television would be specifically great for selling the products as well as knowing all the products as a parent.
There are more bad things about this topic though.
The children could be annoyed in their young years by this form of advertisement.
It would always interrupt their shows and they really just would not like it at all.
In Germany there is a TV-channel called KIKA which does not show any ads.
It makes watching the channel way better and the kids are not confronted with the breaks for advertisement.
In addition children would only see the product and what they are worth.
They would be teached to think about prices and owning products more than thinking about feelings and ethics.
They would want to have everything and that is a bad thing for our society in general because it should be all about what you think and how happy you are and not about owning every toy or all the money you can get.
All together i would agree with this statement.
I would say that television advertising should not be allowed on channels for children and for children in general.
It teaches wrong ideas of living in abundance and owning everything.
It is the parents' work and job to teach their growing youngs that things are just that much worth as you think they are and the advertisement shows a different idea just thinking about capitalism and making profit.
It would be hard to classify the advetisement.
Is it for children aged two to five or for older kids?
The companys sponsering the ads could just claim that they´re not aiming for the younger children.
But it would be very good if those television advertising would not be allowed anymore because those little children are very easy to manipulate.
For companys who produce products for kids aged thwo to five it would be a huge disadvantage if they can´t advertise their product anymore and would damage the financial situation of them.
On the other side are the parents the ones who have to pay for the toys, sweets, etc of their children and the company use the kids because they are easier to manipulate to get the money from their parents.
Using kids as things to get their parents money is ethicly bad.
I think it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward young children because they are innocent.
They cant think of the consequences of their own acting and if they see something they like they want it.
This effect can be used to advert something with a lot of coulor and shining.
But the two to five year olds dont know that the ad just wants them to buy things.
Advertisement for adult people is oaky, they know the sence of an ad.
In this essay I will write about hypothetical situation.in which, television advertsising, which is directed toward young childern, isn't allowed.
With young children I mean children which are aged from two to five.
Most of the childern in this age are allowed to watch television.
All the parents are in a worry about the series.
But what about the advertising?
On the one hand a  big problem which exists if you ban the advertsing is, that the televison programm doesn't have any insources of money.
Because with the help of streaming advertising they earn money to cast the series.
On the other hand you have to keep in mind that the children and especially their future.
If they watch lots of advertising, they always want to have everything, which is streamed out.Or they want to live like the children in the advertisment.
And when they are younger, parents often buy most of the things, which their children want.
So they don't learn how to deal with money or stuff.
But you shouldn't forget that there is advetising for everything in the TV.
And if the parents watch televsion, they get ideas what the next present for their children could be, if they haven't got any clue.
Our society wouldn't be like that, if we wouldn't have that amount of advertising, because advertisment has got a big influence to us.
Children are a good subject for the project of environements to try out some new theorys how to influence people that they buy the product.
So children are threaten like an object.
In my opinion the advertising which is directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.
Because I think it's a negative influence to the children which should have stopped.
And if we are able to stop one source of influence, than we should to that.
Television advertising on specific products for children like candys or toys is designed exactly for their younger minds.
You can find this image also inside a supermarket.
The sweets are placed right next to the counter, with the reason that the children ask their parents while paying their products if they can have some "Haribo" for example.
The leaders of the market know exactly that they can play mindgames with younger people and earn more money in this way.
One reason for this is that young children don't have the experience to see if a product of their favour is useful or useless for them.
They also can't tell if it's worth the prize of it.
It is a skill that a human being achieves together with the process of growing up.
So adults are choosing more wisely which product they can effort and which not.
The only question is if the advert is for children and has no other thoughts behind or is designed to earn more money with a product that otherwise wouldn't sell that good.
I think that it's also the job of the parents to inform their kids to not believe everything what television adverts want to tell them.
So i would say that television advertising designed for young children is probably a bad thing for their parents money bag but should be allowed still for the reason that adverts for children most of the time don't want to steal your money and just want to show the product like every advert for an other product also does.
I think it gives facts for and against this statement.
Television advertising can have a big influence to people.
And people from one to 90 years old watch television.
Television advertising is an important fact because the technology becomes better and better.
The reasons to agree with this statement are, that the advertising on television has a big influence to children.
And when much advertising is on television the children are more happier.
The thing is that the advertising for children is cool.
It has cool music, many colours and happy children.
The children want to watch more and more television.
But the advertising isn't the reality.
When the children only see television advertising they want to have the same games as it shows in the television.
But for the children it is important to see the real world, to play with other children and be thankful for what they have.
On the other side it is also good when children are in contact with the technology.
They also have to learn things.
So they learn what an advertising is and what influence it has on people.
Maybe they also learn that not all the advertising is good and that the most things are false.
And that they don't have to buy this things because not all is necessary.
And they see how the world is focused on money.
People want to make money with their products, but also for advertising you need money.
I agree with this statement.
For me the advertising is too much for children.
The influence is too big.
The children can have a good life without this.
Without the advertising the children see the good things in the world and are thankful.
With advertising they want more and more games or other things.
In this essay i am going to talk about my personal opinion on this statement.
One of the reasons why young children shouldn't be allowed to watch TV is of course because they get distracted very easily.
So if you let them watch TV whenever they want they will get to comfortable with it.
Young children can get faszinated for anything and if they like something they want to watch it again and again.
But of course there is not only bad stuff on Tv!
Children from age two to five are learing very fast and i think if they are able to learn with pictures and videos their learning will improve.
On one side i think watching Tv is a lot of fun and there is no reason to not allow young children watching TV.
On the other side i think especially for young children it is important that they're learning by doing.
They should play with other children and explore their surrounding.
One of the most important factor in realtion with TV is that watching TV should be kind of a treat if the children ,for example, played outside the whole day.
We are living in a time where young chlildren grow up with the internet and all the electronic toys.
So to not allow watching TV at all wouldn't make any sense because they're going to watch TV anyway.
For me personal it is very important to have a healthy balance between having fun while you're watching TV and watching TV because you're just bored.
As I already mentioned children from age two to five are learing very easily and as a parent you lay their foundation for their future.
You should make sure that they're watching the right things on the internet and on TV.
In conclusion I think that televison advertising directed toward young children isn't in general a bad thing but if you as a parent aren't under control it can turn into a very bad thing and can influence the future of your child.
Television advertising for young children should not be allowed because young children are easier to influence than older people.
So if they see advertisment for a thing they normally wouldn`t want to have they may will be convinced   
that now they want to have it.
So than the parents are gonna have this problem with their children that they are going to cry as long as they don`t get it.
On the other hand those really young children possibly don`t even make up their mind if they want to have something or not and just get what they need from their parents.
If you look at it from this perspective you could even claim that young children are gonna learn speaking and reading better through these spots.
Also normally young children often times don`t watch the television stations where many advertising spots are showed or don`t watch much television in general.
It also could have a negative impact on those children because for food advertisement is mainly made for unhealthy food.
So if a child sees this advertisement for soda for example, it want to drink it and maybe becomes used to it so this child gets heavy and gets in way too much sugar accasionally it could lead to diabetes.
In my opinion this advertisements don`t really effect what young children buy because they ain`t buying that much for thereselfs anyway, but it could effect the health as well as the way these children see the world.
For example many little children who lived in the city thought, that a cow is purpil because of a specific chocolate brand named milka and they never saw a real cow.
The critical age between two to five years is a period of time in which a child's brain is the most flexible, which induces the ability to learn as much as possible.
Wasting their mental resources on targeted advertising, which would distract theirmindsfrom learningessentialbehaviour, would definitely put harmonto their congnitive capability.
Moreso, brains fromchildren agedtwotofive are not developed enoughto seperate economicallytargetedinputfromother stimuli andthey might bring their parents tostressby expressing their needs.
In contrary to the arguements inapproval ofthe suggestedlaw,parents who expose theirchildren to targetedadvertising would still bring normal advertising into theirlife witherto the fact that advertisingistargetedor notwouldnot change the fact thatthey arebeing shown advertisements at all.
What parents expose their children to should be in their responsibility.
[Note]The spacebar on this computer is faulty
There are different ways to think about this theme.
On one site people say it is very good for childrens to look TV, because there are important facts and ideas about the life, which childrens can learn from shows or films on the TV.
Most parents have to go to work, so they are not at home all the time.
Why shouldn´t it be a good way to have some "education" when the parents aren´t at home?
Another opinion is, that it is really unhelpfull for young children to look TV.
There are a few arguments which pointed that out.
At first parenst have the fear, that their children forgot the world next to the TV.
They think it is possible, that their childs stop meeting friends outside or having fun with conservative toys, like action figures or something similar.
Parents also say, that there isn´t only good stuff shown in the television.
The problem is that there are many shows, which are not good for young children.
Most films are not made for children, so the plot is a way too hard to understand or it is very cruel.
The result out of that would be, that the childrens get fear or even panic of daily things, because they recognice films where dangerous things happend in the situation in which they are now too.
Another problem of the TV is that the people watching do not move in this time, so when the childrens start early with just sitting around and do not use their body, they will never understand, why it is important to move and do sports.
The result of no sports at the start of the life is, that the childs get heavyweight pretty early.
That means that they do not know another stadium of their body and will never reach to a healthy way of life.
Both of the arumentations make sense to me, on one hand there are many important things to learn especially on channels especially for childrens.
On the other hand it´s reasonable, why childs shouldn´t watch television anyway.
So my result or idea is to have something in between these two opinions.
Maybe it´s good to block channels which show plot for adults for childs.
So the childrens can look TV and the parents do not have to have fear of showing them bad stuff.
The problem with social contact with other childrens and the body movement could be solved with a build in timer in the TV.
The childrens have a time per day to watch TV, maybe 1 hour.
So they have to do other things than watching TV and just sitting around.
For me that would be a grat opportunity to use the good offer for children on the television, but also do not overuse it.

It is discussed a lot about the new technology and what's good about it and what are the negative things about it.
I think it's very important to think about those questions, because may be they can change our future and the future of the next generations a lot.
The new technology is very useful and we don't know what we would do without it.
But in my opinion we shouldn't use the electronic devices too much in our daily life.
Especially for young children in the age of two to five it could be dangerous for their health.
We don't know it yet, because this new generation has to get older first.
The best for those young children is to go and play outside and enjoy their childhood.
If they are the whole day in front of the television they have never lived their childhood by playing with other kids in their age.
A reason for this change could be, that people work more.
In a lot of households the mother works too and doesn't have time for her children or she is just stressed about the work and doesn't want to play with the children.
That's why more and more children just sit in front of the television the whole day.
I think this is not a good developement, but we can't change it and we have to accept, that the world is changing every day.
May be television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, but we can't make a law out of it.
Nobody could control them if they do it correct or not.
It's everyones one desicion how to raise their children.
The only thing we can do is to memorize the parents what would be the best way to raise their children, but we can never say that there is only one correct way to raise their children and we have to accept that.
In the end we can't make a law out of this statement, because it's everyones own desicion how to raise the children.
We have to accept both opinons, because we don't know what is going to happen the next years.
May be a child who always watched TV in the childhood doesn't have a good social life.
But it could also be, that a child who never watched TV in his/her childhood is going to have problems in school or his job because they don't know how it works.
We all watch televison.
To relax after a long day of work, to inform oneself or just to let the kids enjoy nice, colorful animated series and enjoy the peace and quet for a moment.
But what about the advertisements in between the series?
Adults are animated to buy products by them; but so are kids.
But as kids can only use the money of their parents, is it okay to advertise things to children?
Firstly, children who don't visit a daycare or are in contact with other children only have the toys they get form their parents and they only know about them.
Advertisements are useful for a child do get an idea what they could wish for for their birthday or for Christmas.
They also learn to distinguish between what they like and what they don't like.
Maybe they even invent an own new way to play with their toys they already have, which is important for children.
It may even be helpful for the parents so they get an idea what children could like and what may be useful for their development.
In addition, all the child can to is ask for it.
They can't go and buy it themselves, especially at the ages of two to five, so why is it a problem?
Parents can always say that they won't buy it or tell them that they would get it for their birthday or another occasion.
Children also forget about things they don't see anymore and once the advertisement for the product is no longer shown, the demand for it will also end.
Lastly, children at the ages from two to five experience an inmesurable amount of things throughout their day.
The advertisement is just one little thing and if children don't watch TV six hours a day, they won't be influenced as much as they are influenced by their mother or father, the nature or other children.
Children will like the toy but even if they never get it, if they are raised right, there is no need to be worried about them.
They also learn to deal with it at an early age.
They will be in contact with advertisements their whole life and if they know what to do with the information they get from the TV as early as possible, they will not be influenced as much later.
In contrary, people are way too materialistic.
People own too much and when you have children, you get to know that even more.
Everybody gives you loads of things for your newborn and you're practically being suffocated by all the things you own.
Making advertisements for children will only support this even more.
If children go to daycare they meet other children with other toys and of course they always want to have the best toy and as this is always the one in the latest advertisement, you should stop advertising directly towards children aged two to five as they can not know what it means to buy more and more stuff.
In conclusion, advertisements towards children isn't a bad thing, in the end it all comes down to how the parents handle the situation if their kid always asks for more and better toys.
Toys play a major role in a child's life and are important to develop creativity and an understanding of possession.
Advertisements can help develop an understanding of what is necessary and what isn't.
If you wanted to prohibit advertising towards children, you should also prohibit advertising towards adults as there are also people who don't know how to spend money, neither do small children.
If the guidance is right, advertisements can be a supporting factor of the development of a child.
Advertisement towards young childern; should it be prohibited?
Television has become a highly popluar media in the last few centeries and especially the younger childern always enjoy watching their favourite tv shows whenever they can.
However, apart from the entertainment factor which is being brought by the vast viartities of series, television has also given the abilitiy to gain money through advertisement.
But is it fair to gain money with adverts on younger children, why should it not be prohibited?
Firstly, advertisement is made to gain new costumers who should buy there products.
And especially young children are easily to be convinced when they are seeing their favourite toy in an advert on tv.
The one toy they were always dreaming of.
Next to the informations about the product, there is always a person demonstrated which is similar to the costumers themself, in this case the person is a child, who is playing with the toy and seems to be happy.
Not only is the interes of the child itself gained, but also does the child actually want to have that one toy which will make them even more satisfied, just like the child in the advertissement.
The main reason of the advertissement has been succeful and the adults have to buy the toy for their child, because they want them to be happy.
And why ist it like that scenario?
The answer is simple.
Children can be convinced much easier then elderly people, because they believe nearly everything which is said in the advertisement.
In conclusion, advert towards young children acutally should be prohibited, because the affluent and huge company gain their money from young people who can be convinced easily.
These company should make money with creative adverts on older people and not on young children which will believe everything their hear.
"Tlevision advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" thats the topic today.
First of all I have explain what I understand with the expression "young children", "young children" are kids aged two to five.
Is it okey to let the children watch televiion adversitising?
Somepeople are strictly against it.
But why?
A child is easy influencable it can see a toy adversitising on the television and it really wants it.
Finally the mother has the decision between a child which cries the hole week long or to buy the toy.
An other point is that the child can get a wrong idea about a product e.g something to eat which seems to be healthy but in real it isnt.
Eventhough how can we know on which server all those children are?
How should we be able to bann the advertising exactelly at the time and the program where all the kids are?
That sounds impossible for me.
Wouldnt it be unfair for those who wants to sell the products for children, whereals should they make advertising?
And dont forget, the child sees the product at the television and he fall in love with it, but his parents are the one who buy it.
Personally I think advertising is good, the child can see toys which he might whish for the next birthday.
That means it makes children to decide by there one what they want.
And the most important thing for me is thath the parents still have the final word.
We have to think about that these children that we are talkking about are in a very early period of their lifes.
Children in this age can easily be influenced by their surroundings.
Bad advertising can have bad influence on their further development.
In extreme examples governments could even use ads to spread their thoughts to the youngest.
As we see, the potential is huge.
In our days electronic devices are more and more used by younger people.
TV chanels use this fact to specificaly target these young people and sell their advertisment time to for example toy manufacturers.
For them this time is litteraly a gold mine.
As long as they makke their ads "cool" in a sence of showing how awsome their new toy is the kids will beleive them.
The children also don't care if they allready own a simullar toy, they just see the newer and awsome one.
Because of that kids do not learn to be happy with what they allready own.
They usually don't ask themselfs about the nagatives of what is advetised.
I would say that this is normal though.
This influencial power can and should be used in a positive way.
Telling them about environment, solidarity and moral would be possile.
It had to be packed into a good ad though.
In that way the earlier mentioned potential would be used to teach important stuff to children.
In my opinion advertising targeted towards young children is dangerous and should regularly be controlled by adults.
However the possibilities are to big to just not use it and I really think this potencial has to be used.
Children and Television

Television advertising toward young children have to be allowed because it helps children to lern saying what they want.If they want seeing a particular show in de TV because they like it or if they don't want because they dislike this kind of television show.
Television advertising helps parents with her children because if children are able to say what they like or dislike it's mutch easier for the parents to go along with their children.
there are less fights between them because the parents knows what their children really want.
Televison advertising toward young children have to be stopt because it's absolutely not necessairy that young children have to be confronted with such things.
If anybody makes advertisment toward children in TV it's dangerous for the developpement of the childrenhood.
Children have to play and move and not just looking TV.
Children aged two to five are in that particular age where they are very influencable by something.
So Television advertising toward them should not be allowed.
Every serie in TV have some elements which influence you and make that you want to see every episode of them.
so it's a kind of a druge for people especially young people.
I think it should not be allowed because the Television companies knows how they get new people or how they influence them.
I think it's not necessairy that kids in this age look TV every evening because they don't want to miss a serie.
Let the kids be kids.
Let them play outside because later they have so much things to do with electric things so i think in this age you should play and don't worry about somethings.
And television advertising is able to give them a wrong perspectiv of the world and which things are importent and which are absolutely unimportant like having a special product for beeing cool.Advertisment can make a cap between children because it says them what is cool and what not.
so  mobbing in their later years could be a big topic if they never learn what is really important.
Has advertisment a bad influence on young children, so that it should be permitted to air it on TV?
I think so.
First of all it influences the opinion of young childen so that they don't grow up in the way that their parents teach them but instead they see what's new on the market and, just like children are, they obviously want it.
Where as without television advertising the parents can take their children to the stores the want and trust.
Second of all, in my opinion, children aren't supposed to watch TV at all, exept for some films a month or rarely some Pokémon or similar series.
If the young generation spends enough time in front of the television to see commercials often enough that it pays off forthe conmpany I think we should do something against it.
And where will the sense of adventure and exitement go that we had when we explored the cool stuff when we where shopping with our parents?
I think it's much better when someone brings something new to school that no one knows about and surprises all of the other children.
Then they go home and tell their parents about it and slowly the trend establishes.
If the kids already know it from the television it's just not quite the same experience.
Advertisement just supports children to buy way too much things and all of the conversations on the schoolyard are just about what they've seen on the television.
It is friday night.
You want to watch your favourite movie on TV.
While your watching there are the normal pause with advertisement.
You will not pay attention to it.
But a child aged two to five will pay attention and maybe want it.
Should because of that television advertising directed to toward young children not be allowed?
Firstly, you can influence children very simply.
If they watch an advertisement and they like it, they want to have it.
And afterwards they will beg their parents to buy it.
Maybe they will go on their own an will buy it.
Young children are creative and they will find a way to get it.
Even if they have to buy it on the blackmarket.
Secondly you can brainwash the children for your own reason so they support you and you will rise and be the emperor of the hole world.
On the other hand you should not allow your child to watch TV.
They should stay outside and play with other children.
It is important for their social life.
If they are allowed to watch TV, the parents have to be aware of that the child want something and they must be able to say "no".
This is an important process in the life that you learn you can not have everything you want.
An other reason is that the broadcaster need the money from advertisement.
There are only a few which get paid from the governement like SRF.
You can not only have advertisment in the evening.
Only you would like to have two hours ads in a 90 minute movie.
Because of the reasons I told I think advertisement directed towards children schould be allowed.
It is in the hand of the parents that their child learn their life lessons early.
Using media especially television is a often discussed topic which is good because we're confronted with it's advertises and problems each single day.
We're living in the year 2017, television has become a great method to entertain young, annoying children.
But don't we have to accept the fact that it's a generation which we aren't able to stop?
There have always been things that haven't been accepted by the last generation but once it was invented for a while people got used to it and didn't see any problems with that because it  was part of their daily life.
The same scenario can happen with television.
Some parents nowdays are still not used to this huge consume of television but time will come when nobody will talk about television as a problem.
A lot of parents use television because they are to lazy to look after their children and take care of them.
They put a TV in front of their childrens bed so they can watch Hannah Montanna all day log.
But what if children have questions nobody answers them or they a frightend of anything and none of the parents is there to explain things.
On the other hand, television is a great way of entertainment for parent that don't have a lot of time because they have to be working a lot to gain their lives.
The most important arugument to me is that it is proven that TV series such as Spongebob makes our children stupid because they start to believe that it's possible to make a fire in the sea.
Alltogether i think it's not the right way to watch a lot of TV while we're young but I don't agree with the statement that it should not be allowed because it's our generation.
Television
Watching tv is so in commen like healthy food.
In nearly every home is minimum one televison and the people use it three hours by day.
Not only the adults also the little ones.
There are a lot of different series for our youngest family members.
Between the shows there are a lot of commercial.
But what do they do to theme?
Haters will say: They destroyed the intelligence and the fantasy from the children.
They havent to think anymore and just sit there, don't move.
So they will loos also ther fitness or worse they never form it.
So this chirdren will get fat and lasy.
In addition they will have more problems to find friends because they never lernd to form social contacts.
An other suite is the anger they have inside.
But what's about the adverising?
Do they also foster all this things or is it not so worse?
"Even worser!
", say the specialist.
The commercial let the children no chance to make a one think, because they say them what they have to think.
"Not at all!
", contret Mr. Kouwn.
The television and the addet advertising haven't a connect with the fatness or anything alse.
The worse thing you can say to it is, that it is a freetime taker, thats all.
With the advertising tthey just want to show there now products, no less no more.
And they aren't just fore the kids also ther perents watch this canels.
On my opinion the people now days watch to much television.
They shoud go aut and do sport.
There also to much advertising.
They shoudent be so lot.
Should television advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?
In the following essay we will focus us on the question if televison advertising directed toward young childrn (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Imaging a toddler is watching tv and sees an ad occuring on the screen, specially modified for its age group.
Is this ad going to have an influence on the later life of this little child?
Or not?
I guess on the one side we live in a free country, where freedom of speach and the press is a common good.
Therfore if you say that ads towarded young people have to be banned from tv, it could be seen as unfair towards the guys who want to advertise for their products, when they are just not allowed to make PR for it.
On the other side, advertising always has a critical point because it's main job is to manipulate people in order to make them buying the products from the advertising company.
Now one could say that toddlers won't even regocnize the content of specially modified ads and that the material of these ads therefore won't have any influence on the child, but you could also say (and this I guess is an even stronger argument) that especially toddlers sense a lot more from their environment than we might think and that due to this fact, such ads definitely have an influence on the child, wheter it's conciouss or subconciouss.
So in my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be definitely banned from the screens, because we don't want to manipulate the next generation in a way some company leaders would like to.
I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because young children can be manipulaited very well, because they to not notice that not all the television advertising is the true.
Therefore when a person in the television something said a young children can not know is it true or false.
But a older person can say that is true or false.
Young children also become more wishes, wich the parents have to buy for the childrens and when the child does not become his wish, it will be sad.
Childrens do not know how much something is and something cost, with five years you start to learn to count at ten, so they can not know how much, for example fourty, is.
Therefore they have no feeling for numbers, so when the person in television said that the price is very good, a young children would trust him.
Children have also not a lot of money, so the can not buy a lot.
When a five year old child buy something for example for ten francs, it would have no money left.
So I think that the advertising in television about children products, should be directed towards the parents and not at the young children, because the partents better know what is could for their child and they also have enough money to buy something.
Therefore my opinion is that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Nowadays, every family has got a television in their house.
That means that all children have the possibility to turn it on and watch any programm they want.
Between the programms, there are advertisments played the whole day through.
But should it be allowed to advertise towards children between two and five years?
In this essay I'm going to discuss this question and write my own opinion about this case.
It is a psychological fact that children are very easy to manipulate.
The companies make use of this found.
They try to convince children that they should also have a certain toy in their home.
When a small child watches an advertisment in the television where another children smile and are happy to play with a toy that a company advertises, they suddenly long for this toy and ask their parents to buy it.
Unfortunately, not all parents have the financial capacity to buy everything their child would like to own.
These parents may try to deny the request of their children, but they don't always succeed.
This leads not disappointment of the toddlers and they might beginn to not like their parents anymore, because they don't get everything they ask for.
On the other hand, the adverstisment is the best way to raise the profit of a company.
Without advertisment and the people who buy the product, the green numbers that a company writes wouldn't be so high.
That means it depends on the amount of people who watch an advertisment if the company profits or not.
To resume, there are to possible ways to look at the advertisment : From the sight of the customers (in this case parents) who are not always able to buy everything that their child sees in an adverstisment and from the sight of the company for which is the advertisment one of the main resource of marketing and profit.
In my opinion the advertisments for children between two and five years should be banned from the television.
If I were a parent and my child would ask for every toy it has seen in the commercials, I wouldn't be very happy about it.
For first, I wouldn't have so much money to buy every single toy and for second, my child has to learn that it doesn't need everything what it sees in the television.
Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
Television ads towards young chilred, meaning children aged two to five, are mostly made by companies who produce and sell food, toys or clothing.
They are often very colorful and lively, to attract kids and make them want to own the advertised products.
But should these commercials even be allowed?
A big part of the income of a company, relies on their advertising.
Since this is, what is supposed to attract new costumers and give them the feeling of having to buy a specific article.
So for a company that specialises on children's products, it would be fatal if these kinds of ads were no longer allowed.
Also, many young children enjoy whatching ads, since they can't tell the difference between ads and TV programmes.
So television ads don't really bother them in any particular way.
But on the other side, children shouldn't watch too much television anyways, since it is damaging to their brains and it causes them to lose the ability to entertain themselves.
Instead, they just sit in front of a TV all day long and stare, just consuming whatever they see.
So if there are more and more ads directed toward them, they will watch even more TV.
Another point is, that young children will immediately want the things that are advertised on television and they will bother their parents with it all day long.
So, many parents have to deal with their unsatisfied kids and this can cause stress and in some cases even anxiety.
Also, children don't even need that many new things.
They should learn to be satisfied with what they have.
Children in other countries are lucky if they've got one single toy and they never wish for anything else.
And a hundred years from now, the kids didn't have a TV or that many toys.
They were just entertaining themselves and had just as much fun doing it.
So our generations' kids shouldn't be presented with that many new things to buy every single day.
Because then, they'll just want to get the newest and best things available at the moment and they will never learn to truly appreciate what they have.
So I believe, that television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be fully forbidden, but it should be limited to a certain amount of time per day, so that kids these days don't get flooded with all the new information and that they can learn to appreciate what they have in life.
Nowadays many children are allowed to watch television once, twice or more often a day.
Television advertisings are advers mostly visual and auditive.
Do children understand advertisements in the television and do they have an effect on them?
This essay evaluates if television advertising directet to young children aged two to five should be allowed or not.
Firstly, children in the age of two to five have not a huge television consume during the day as well as in the evening or at night.
In addition, on chanels which are created especially for children there are only adverts for children presented and none for adults.
In fact that, most children are allowed to watch one or two episodes of their favorite children serie, so they do not see any advertisements, so adverts directed toward young children are not really effective and a loss for the company who set up the adverts.
On the other hand, it is proved that children love to spend their spare time - and children have a lot of it - in front of the television.
But for the kids it is often prohibited from their parents to watch too much or too long television.
Outstanding, children realize much more than adults think.
In the modern time, the kids are earlier in understanding things than the todays adults were.
Overall, television advertising directed toward young children can be allowed.
But if they let the companys make a profit is unclear question.
In the point of view form the parents side they should be prohibited because their kids can be affected from the adverts and it could be difficulte to make the kids understand, that they can not get the things from the television everytime.
Television advertising is often designed directly for children.
The directors of the advertising know exactly what children like and how they have to present their product, so children want to have them.
Young children are very naive and they can't tell very well if something's right or false.
Because of that fact it's very easy to manipulate young children and force them to want that product.
When they finally get this toy, or whatever, from the advertising and recognize, that it isn't as pleasureable as shown in the advertising, they're not very happy with it.
For example, a little boy sees a LEGO police car in an advertising.
it drives around in a city with other cars and houses and the light on the roof flashes in red and blue.
Of course the little boy is very excited and wants to have that toy.
When he finally gets it he builds it together and recognizes, that a police car without flashing lights, lost and alone on the carpet in his oom, without any houses or other cars isn't that exciting.
Allthough I think, that this kind of television advertising shouldn't be forbidden.
It's the parents quest to
It goes without saying, that children are a lot easier to influence with television advertising, than adults.
But this does not necesseraly mean anything bad.
One argument, that a supporter of this statement might bring up is, that children will be influenced to wanting something which is not particulary good for them.
While on the surface this looks true, if we think about it the argument is actually not such a solid one.
Why is that?
Because there will always be a parent who watches over the kid.
This adult can and should be able to explain to the little ones, why they may not have this certain thing.
Moreover it is also not nice to forbid young children from watching television adverts, because a numerous amount of children enjoy watching adverts from their favourite toys.
It might seem odd for us grown-ups now, but I personally also enjoyed watching the advertisment of the newest build-set from Lego, or whatever product it might be.
And I think I'm not the only one with that opinion.
One question that I'm asking myself when I read this statement is, how the advertisment specifically directed towards children would be bad.
The companies who pay for the advertisments on television, most certainly wouldn't want their advertisment about the newest beer brand to be played on the disney channel at four o'clock.
To conclude would I say that this is a really conservative and overprotective thing to do.
Whilst these are just some of the reasons, why I think this regulation should not be a thing, there are certainly many more.
I think television advertising is not a bad thing.
But it's a problem for little children because they are easily convinced.
If they see an advertisement they would love to have that thing and it's difficult for the parents if they are in a store with them and doen't want to buy toy's.
But in my opinion that's a problem for any parent because of the big and coulourfull packages with advertisement on them.
This even happens to parent's with children who doen't watch TV.
So television is not the main reason for that sort of behavior.
If the society thinks that's a problem al sort of advertising directly toward young children should be forbidden.
It's the parent's resonsibility that there children doen't watch to much television.
A child between two and fife should not watch more than half an houre a day in my opinien.
In that short amount of time they normaly doen't watch to much advertisement.
From that point of view it's irrelevet for me personaly that the television advertisement is directed toward young children.
I think advertisent on TV towards children is not good but it's the wrong way not to allow it.
In the following I´m going to explain the arguments supporting and against the aforesaid these.
One point to support the Television adverstising toward young children is that they learn to how to threat the modern technic.
It is an advantage because in the world nowadays HighTech plays an important rule in every branche.
For example they see a teddy in an advertisement and connect the TV as something positive, so maybe they want to learn later on how an TV works and this can be an whelthy experience in the learn progress during the life.
In contrast to this it is not necessary for young children to live an life with much technic, this comes automaticly when they grow up and get informatic lessons at school or somewhere else.
In this beginning years of a life children don´t need to come in contact with the modern technic, it is better when they learn to improve their motorical skills and speaking skills.
This can be achive with the modern technic: there are so many apps and widgets for tablets and smartphones with the goal to get the childrens attention, but another important part of the growing-up (?)
is to know how the reality works and don´t waste so much time in front of an TV.
To sum up my opinion, it´s good when children have interest on the modern technic (which is an effect of the advertising) but it is not necessary to advertise for children in this age because they maybe do not understand the advertisement.
The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" is very controvers.
Every person, who live in today, can imagine a situation like a little child sits infront of a big television and looks at small animated pets.
More and more children look often television.
As consequenz they are confronted with more and more advertising in television.
This is childish advertising but also a way to influence the children and theire parents.
If some child sees a nice toy it will go to the parents and wants to have this new toy.
To speak for the advertising advertising is just a form of market, so that it is normal and if parents dont want that theire children look at advertising they have to forbit television for theire children.
Also the children are confronted with advertising in all of theire rooms where they are in contact with newspaper oder radio.
A point against the advertising in children television it con be said that yooug children con not difference between real and not real news or in this case advertising.
Furthermore children do not can buy something, so that the advertising is more added to the parents of the children, who look television.
But also children in age of two to five do not have to look much television and with this the advertising.
Children have to go outside and play with other children in the same age.
In addision to this point children do not learn to challenge with differences with other children because they are not together.
To sum up young children are today confronted in much areas of theire live with advertising, therefore they have to challenge with advertising, but on the other side children, who are aged two to six, are not able to challenge this.
So I think, that the advertising be controlled for children.
They have to learn that they have to challenge with it but they also be satisfied by theire parents because children have to be putside and play with other children.
In this case the parents challenged two problems in one solution.
The children dont look taht much advertising and the children are more outside.
The 21 century, a time where technology controlls the world and the people living in it.
A time when a five years old girl or boy gets an IPAD as a gift for birthday and children get mobile phones a tthe age of eight.
So should we support this developpment and take it even further to even younger children?
If not television advertising must be illegal directed to children at the age two to five.
Television advertising should not be allowed to children two to five because they can't decide by themselves what they are watching and by what sources they are influenced.
In this time where technologies are everywhere and everyone uses them why should it be illegal to advertise it to very young childdren.
We should throw away the thought of a childhood when playing outside in the forest or on the street were the things to do during the free-time.
Things change people change so the childhood does.
Our thinking of a good childhood is the wrong thought.
We should accept it and get along with it.
That leads to why it should be legal advertising to young children.
Mobile phones and Ipads rule the childhood of the kids.
Today it starts at the age of 9 maybe some yearse arlier or later.
The question is, do we want to support this developpment and in some years everyone from the age of five has a phone?
No,a future like this would be awful.
The talking skills decrease and people get even more isolated.
To conclude, I'm totally against advertising to young children.
The developpment of the childhood drom mine to the ones now is bad.
Seing all the kids with phone at an age when I didn't even thought of mobile phones is bad and we should do something against it.
"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be not allowed.
This statement is very interesting, especially for parents and also relevant for the future of TV advertising, so let's discuss the pro's and con's about it.
Firstly young children could grow up in the wrong environment, whenn they gets in connection with TV and advertising in that young age.
When they always watch TV and see the advertising, that looks good for them, they want to have whatever they want to sell them.
So they learn early, that they have to get the latest products on the market and always have to cosum more and more.
This way of thinking could stay also when they're adults, so that's just for the companys to let the people buying more products, because the people will never stop, they learned it like that.
But in the other hand children in the age of two to five might not remember much, so they might forget about what TV wanted to show them.
In this age you normally just started remembering things, because your brain starts working, but not more than the relevant events.
That means such memories like the TV advertising could be easily forgotten again and children will not remember it later.
However it is also possible, especially because their brain just started working, that the easily learn to trust advertising.
A lot of advertising is wrong, like when they told you "it's the best phone in the world" or "with this washing product you clothes get soft as a fluffy dog".
So when they learn by a young age to trust the advertising, they will never anymore change their opinion and this is what the advertising is for, to make people think their product is the best in the world and they need to have it.
Even though there's also advertising for young children, most of the advertising the young children will not understand, because it's for older people or they don't know what it is, so they have no idea of it and are just not interested, so why would it be so wrong to have a lot of advertising in TV, when the young children will not understand it though?
Furhtermore their parents will ´watch normally with them togheter television, so they will look, what their childrens are allowed to see and what not.
Normally if there's advertising you also don't watch it, but change the channel, so that there's no way, that children can see it.
In my opinion there should be not much advertising, that is directed towards young children, but I also would not let my own children when I'll have some, watch a lot TV.
We all remember  those toy-adverts from our childhood in which there's a child running around in a toystore and picking up all the toys he or she desired.
And secretley,we all wished that that could be us.
And when we finally got the chance to make a wishlist for an upcoming birthday or christmas, we wrote down all the cool stuff we had seen on television.
But is it good for a child to want all those things?
What an advert of a toy shows you is just latest version of their product.
Then they advertise it in such a way that kids believe it's bigger and better.
Take Barbie for an example: Actually it is alway the same doll, ust fressed differently and put in different clothing.
Immediately all the little girls sitting at home, watching some kids show want to own her.
And theadverts are smart.
They make sure that it seems to be a totally new thing and is nothing like the previous version.
And it is not just Barbie.
All the bigger toy brands do this.
When a birthday or christmas come up and you ask a child "What do want me to get you?"
They can immediately give you a whole list of toys they want to have.
This way you will never end up buying something the child might not like.
And when you walk into the store they make sure that the toys that have been advertised a lot are placed in a spot where no one could possible miss it.
This makes shopping for toys much easier for everyone involved.
Maybe advertising so many toys and products for young children makes them become gready.
They will alway be able to see that a new toy or model had been released.
But speaking as one of those children who grew up watching all those adverts, I know that they don't do that much harm.
They might make me want to have new toys, but in the end itis the parent's choice to buy it or not.
I also believe that it helps you to learn that you can't everything you want from a very young age on.
In my opinion, television advertising directed to young children should not be forbidden.
Young kids will grow up too and learn not to believe everything they see or hear.
And they will learn that you don't need the latest toy to have fun and be happy.
Television advertisment is, as long as you have a TV a part of your life and almost evreywhere.
but should even young children be targeted by television already at the age of two to five?
well at first it must be said that the channel itself has the right to show anything they want as long as it's legal and so people who don't want their children to see advertisments can decide themselves whether they want to switch the channel.
furthermore it can help young childen develloping interest if they see things they like and they can start up their own opinion.
but there's also many reason's it shouldn't be legal.
children at a young age aren't independent and get influenced very fast, so they think about the things they will see in the advertisment but only want to have them.
after this the parents have to tell them that they can't have the things because they don't really need them, which the children won't understand, putting the parents under a big pressure.
to sum up I think that it shouldn't be allowed to direct ads to small children because they get influenced way too fast and then set their parents under pressure to buy them things they don't need.
Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
This is a really discussable topic with many different opinions.
I think in generel advertisment is just a marketing strategy to influence or force people to buy something.
You can influence young children very well and I think this is a problem.
Children live, even if they are young,under extrem high society pressure and the advertisments often lie or show these young children things they can`t have.
Besides the parents can`t afford the things their children would like to have and think they are bad parents.
Moreover, advertisments can show the young children new things and in their following life they see advertisments everywhere and every time.
All in all you can say that advertising toward young children can leed to society pressure, but you can`t hide the children from advertisments, because advertisment is a part of our material society.I would like to add that it is really difficult to say to what age advertisments should not be allowed.
As a child i enjoyed to watch television.
The moving pictures realy atteched me, even if it was just a annoying advertisment.
But should those advertisments be allowed for children?
First of all you have to say that it won't matter if the advertisment is directed to a child or to an adult.
If a child want something it saw in the television, it has to ask his parents who will say yes or no.
Anyway some people will say that this advertisments are used like propaganda, but should'nt they ask themself if the advertisments for adults are the same?
In addition those advertisments for children are most of the time very colourful and creative.
So if a child watch this advertisment and tell his friends what he saw they will make a fun game out of this, so you can say that this advertisments will teach the cild creativity.
Neithertheless you have to say that the desire for the thing the child wants could cause trouble in the family.
The child could get angry and uncontrolled and destroy things in the room.
This is a common problem for parents who can't control their children anyway.
As a result i would say that it should'nt be not allowed for advertisments to use the young generation as the person they want to get to buy the things they produced.
After all the parents will choose and not he child so advertisment industrie should ask themself if they "talk" to the right people.
I am agree withe this statement.
It isn't good for the young children to do such things, because the have to discover the world and play with other children.
It is important that thys young people can see many things on the world.
So the can have there one live.
It can't bee good to seat infront of the television the howl day.
I think it is the answer whey so many peoble habe a glasses.
The scream of the electrony things isn't good for the eyes ant the body.
On the television you see many fiction things, that can't bee real in the world we live.
Children should play with other children.
Therer can be a conflict and they must find a answer for the problem.
In real situation the children must find one answer to problems for example they cray or say something when they are hungry.
On the TV are satch situation don't showed to thechildren.
The people on the TV live in a ficten world.
There are offenshoerd problems, witch arent important in ouer live.
But the real problems aren't showen.
It is alsow important that children learn things from older people.
The television schowed many things, but we don't realy now if this things are right.
The young children should learn things from the parents and they have to go to school, so the chan learn thing that are importent.
For example write, read, and other things the can learn in the school.
For me there are many reacens whey children sholudn't do that.
It is important that the parents say that to the children then they have tolearn the right things.
In the age of 2-5 the children don't now what in right and what is wrong.
So the parents and other people of the familie like the older sister or brother can help the young children to finde the right way and the right answer.
This is my opinian.
Children should not be allowed to watch televiosion.
Sorry for not writing anything.
I don't know what happend, but I started panicking.
In our society technology brings big dvantaged on daily bases, but unfortunately there are also many problems.
One of the most discussed one is the influence on our children.
On one hand every television serie has the right of free speach.
There are certain themes they cant speak about or show us but thats very rare.
But they never would have this kind of stuff in series for young children.
ALso its the parents decision to let their kids watch a tv serie or tv in general or not.
Its also to cosider that these special series for young kids could help them developing certain skills if the producer direct the series at them, they might be really happy and inspired by the stories and pictures they see.
On the other hand is it possible that our little boys and girls get manipulated by economic interests with comercials and series.
In my opinion its a chance and a risk.
But if i would be a father I'd have to take the decision myselve if my children watch a serie or not.
And i like to make this decision my selve, because of this there is no need for me to  let this statement be regulated by law.
Should television advertising not be allowed for children in the age of two to five?
A main point against this restriction is that young children could learn to ignore and get immun to those ads because they're watching them since their early years and know how to don't get influenced by it.
On the other side though, the influence could be so strong that those children don't think for their own anymore because they don't have to think.
They get leaded by those advertisements; which shampoo you should buy to fix your hair or that you really need to buy this pretty barbie doll.
Those advertisements also try to use tricks to let the products look cheap but actually they're not and if you watch those ads as a young kid they could lose the awareness to see those tricks.
If young children watch TV ads it could change their 'view at the world'.
At some time replaceable things could be more important than the actual important things.
I think TV ads should be forbidden for children in the age of two to five because you just don't know what effect it's going to have later.
Adults who can't think by themselves will probably bring major problems to the world.
Televison advertising is a often discussed topic.
Especially young children become influenced by the advertising, which can become a problem, when they get older.
But is that an argument to forbit advertising directed toward children on television?
First of all it has to be mention, that the advertising for children often is very unrealistic.
Because of this the children get a wrong bild of the world and learn things, which aren`t right.
But in case of this it must be said, that it isn`t important, which advertising the children see in television.
They get influenced by each one.
Even if they watch TV and see advertising which is for adults.
In most cases this is more bad for them, than see things, which are especially made for them.
An importatant argument for advertising to children is, that the partents have to control the consum of their kids in the end.
They have to pay attention to the programm, watched by their kids and forbit it, if it is not godd for them in their opinion.
In my opinion all these arguments are, why it would make no sense to not allow Television advertising directed toward young children.
It`s in the hand of the parents, which programm their children watch and also they have to take controll of how much their kids consum and get influenced of advertising because of this.
Day for day humans are constantly influenced by advertisment.
For a grown up person this seems just normal but how should we handle advertisment directed towards the youngest ones of our society?
To start off doesn't it seem unethical trying to use little children to make money?
This may be true, but are little children after they've seen an advertisment really going to take their money and buy a cool new race car?
No they are not at the end of the day at the end of the day the parents are the ones to decide and little children at this age usually have no money.
So television advertisment directly towards little children from two to five could be more seen as an advertisment for their parents and what they could maybe buy for their children.
On the other handy when a small kid sees something it really likes it isn't going to let go from it until his parents buy it for him.
Now we would be at the point saying the advertisment influences the kid, who as his next step tries to "blackmail" his parents to buy him stuff to play with.
Looking at this argument wouldn't that just be bad parenting by the father or mother if he or she agrees to every of his little kids wishes?
Yes kids at that age constantly see something new exciting the really want and there may be crying if it doesn't get everything but that is all part of growing up.
In my opinion little kids from two to five may be influenced a lot by television advertisment but at the end it is still its parents who are going to take the decision wether to buy  something or not.
So as long as television advertisments fit to the age of the child and include no sexual content etc.
advertisment is totally okay.
Today there are lots of televison advertising directed toward different targetgroups.
Should be television advertising directed toward young children allowed?
In this Essay we will give an answer.
Concerns need advertising to sell their products.
If they couldn´t sell their products they won´t make other product for children and haven´t money for those people work in this concern.
So at least the concern will close and lots of people lose their jobs.
In advertising it´s never said that children have to buy the product of a concern.
But with special effects and wrong arguments they want that children think, they need to buy those products.
Fistly the concerns often lieng about their products and these products were shown better and cooler than they are in an advertising in a televison.
The "Kids" don´t see these false facts and just see what is cool on the product.
Secondly children haven´t money on their own.
They need money by the parents.
Young children even don´t know the meaning behind money.
They haven´t the answer for the question how expensive are 100$ or how much cents are 1$.
Another argument is, they can not understand or find out what is good for their own or what is bad for their healthy.
They need everytime the opinion by the parents.
At least you can say that it is better to target parents for products for childrens because they can find and think about the negative and positive facts of a product.
Who can understand his children better than the parents.
There are just parents who know what is healthy and good for theri children.
I do not think there should be any legislative attempt towards restricting television advertising towards young children.
The purpose of government is to protect the natural rights of its citizens, not to interfere in their lifes.
Those natural rights include the right to life, to liberty and property, all aiming to give the people a maximum amount of freedom.
Now, obviously a child does not posess the same ability to make choices as adults, so placing them under authority is essential to safe adolescence.
This authority however, must be a parental one and not one of the state.
It is completly unnecessary to restrict advertising because when growing up, parents can do a far better job at restricting influences on kids than the government because they have direct knowledge of their mental state.
Normalizing the grabbing of traditional tasks of parents could lead to an increasingly dangerous amount of power concentrated within legislation.
In the following text i will discuss the following statment "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
This statement confronts us with an actually theme.
Much children in this age watch much Tv and plays also games on a computer or tablet.
But is this good ?
Nowadays it gives much fims and series extra for children in this age, some who they learn something and other to have fun.
The most series want  to tell something to the kids an want that they learn much while they looking the films.
So they have a good aim.
The most things children must learn they learn when they have some people arround them and explore something on their own, they must amke their own mistakes and experience and not a computerperson, who tells them something.
Another point is that children needs much activities and must learn, how they can move their bodys correct.
When they sits in front of the TV and watch series and films the whole day, they don´t know how they make a thing by theyself.
Also they don´t build a own creativty or a own meaning, based on their experience, because they don´t have own experience.
When children have the chance to play in the garden and learn their something about the nature around them it´s really much better and niecer for the kids, as a television advertising.
On the one hand the films want the children to learn something what they need in their future and for the school, but on the other hand they confront them with unrealistic computercharacters, which looks really unreal.
This is so since a few years, before it gave some nice series for children and not so much like today.
The maincharacters their were normal animals or real humans, which talk to the kids.
At the end you can say, that it should be not completly not allowed, but the children must have the chance to make their own experience and they should not be directed with television advertising every day.
A little consum is not so bad, when the parents vote a good serie.
At the end you can they
Advertising at the TV is a very useful way to speak to the people, but can young people, children, stand against the advertising?
At first you have to say, that young children should not watch TV to much.
If a child doesn't watch TV, the question of advertising you don't have to ask.
In addition children can find a present for his next birthday or for next christmas.
It would be eassier for the parents to chose the right present, because they know, what the child wants, for example a new car or a new barbie.
Futhermore the children learn to say no to the things the advertising wants to sold you.
This knowledge is something they have to learn for their live, so why can they learn it aged two to five?
On the other side it give also many arguments, which are against the advertising at the telivision toward young children.
The children have got many toys with they could play, but if they see the advertising they are not proud of their toys anymore.
The toys on the TV are much better then their one, they think, so they want it.
This argument followed to the main statement you have to say at this topic.
Children want everything.
It doesn't matter, if they have a car or a barbie, the toys on the TV shows better then their one, so they need a new.
Children don't understand it, if they don't get it, because they have something at home, but the parents can't buy everything, which is shown fantastic on the TV and this doesn't understand a child.
So in my opinion advertising for children between two and five should not be allowed, because the prior arguments.
If the children a little bit older, they can decide, which they really need and which not.
Television advertisement is something completely normal for us.
However, should it be directed to young children or not?
It can influenz the children and change their personality so that they only look at their own needs and don`t take other people into consideration.
They develope a need for everything they see and get self-centered.
Children shouldn`t even watch TV long enough to see these advertisements.
Instead they should play with other kids outside and learn to share and communicate with them.
But some TV programms can be useful, if they educate the children and increase their kreativity.
Nonetheless there are advertisements on these channels, which might be good for them and the companies who placed these advertisements but it doesn`t help the children learn to share and play with other children.
In my opinion there shouldn`t be television advertising directed to young children, because it only benefits the companies who make money with it.
These advertisements are only aimed at the money of the parents of the children.
Furthermore, the children get the feeling they can have everything they want and don`t learn to value money.
I agree with this thesis because young children especially at an age from two to five are more likely to be caught by an advertisment.
While they're watching his or her daily programm, which has an educative meaning for the children because it is the age in which they can learn the most and they schould do learn the most, the advertisements will lead to a feeling of need which would be connected with a greed.
The parents where 'forced' by crying or similar to buy a product which the child doesn't want but which it has to have.
Advertisements would manipulate children at all an in peticular at this age.
For example the christmas business.
The time where all companies can make and want to make the largest profit possible.
Therefore they will make more advertisements and the cycle starts again.
Another argument is that the time wasted by advertising spots could be filled by educative content like movies, series etc.
so instead of interrupting the childrens programm with manipulative advertisements they could be prepared for life in the long run.
In order to conclude I would say that advertisements in the television programm of children is just a manipulative and somehow criminal way by the companies to gain as much profit as they can out of children, the weakest part of our population.
Therefore the government should strictly prohibit something like that.
Televison advertisings towards young children is a discussed theme, because it can influence them, positive or negative.
Is it necessary to disallow these advertisings to children?
The children spent a lot of time in watching television, more than before ten years.
The companys know about this fact, and try to reach the children in advertisings where they talk directly to the children.
It can be annoying for the parents, when their child wants everything, what seems to be attractive in the advertising, and also the children want to spend more time in front of the TV.
I think, it is not necessary to disallow advertising towards young children, because on the one hand, they often don't understand, what is said there, and only see the product, also if they make an advert for a car, and on the other hand, the parents should rule the TV consume of their child, so it doesn't sees adverts like that all day.
Is your child attracted by advertising in the television?
This is a problem many familys have nowadays and this question is disgusted a lot lately.
People are arguing if it should be allowed to make avertising for children aged two to five.
From a economic point of view this sector of advertisement will open new doors.
It is a good sector to invest in because it's new and not complitly  used up.
New companys can be founed and new innovative ideas can be made.
Furthermore it is also not a bad this for the children because the can develope pretty early a sense of what they really want and what they don't want.
Like this strong personalities will be built.
On the other hand the parents are definitly in a bad postition.
They never can fullfill the amound of wishes their children will have because of the appearece of this advertising sector.
Children want more and more and won't be satisfied if they get it.
This could be caused by the overfloting of the advertising marked by new products the have to have as two year old, according to the advertisement.
Additionaly, the children are practiclly born into a world of consumption and this will take their innocence and childhood away.
They are overstrained by the amound of this they don't actually need.
As a conclusion I suppose that advertising for such young children will make a huge change in society.
Ifen if it is good for the economie of many companys, I'm convinced it has just bad impacts on the children itself.
Their childhood won't be the same if they have to deal with this world of consumption so early in their lives.
If this stays allowed there are just disatvantages for the children and for their parents too.
They should be allowed to stay children for a little longer than just for two years.
In the past few weeks many people especially parents care about one big problem.
They criticize the use of television advertising directed toward young children.
But does this topic really brings this much problems or is it not even bad?
On the one hand adverts towards young children is a great oppotunity for the concerns.
The kids have a strong will and the parents want to do them a favor and buy the products.
But on the other hand children can hardly understand what it means to buy something.
They do not understand what money means.
If the parents don´t have the money or even just do not want to spend it it comes to argues between the parents and their children.
Another argument for the use of advertising toward young children is that they can decide what they want and that they learn fast that there are many toys but they can not have all of them.
They learn to understand what it means to get something they want to have.
The concerns set themselves on an higher level than the parents.
If a mother does not want their children to know this toy she has to forbid them to watch TV.
Furthermore the shops just use the kids.
Surely they know all this points but they just ignore them because they want to sell as many things as possible.
To sum up this topic really is a problem.
On the one hand you cand understand the shops that want to make money but on the other hand you have the parents that just want to protect their small children.
And I can totally agree with the parents and the statement on the top.
It can not be respected that the children can see anything even if their parents don´t want to.
In the newspaper there was a discussion about television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
In my essay I will discuss this question.
Young children aged from two to five should not be allowed to direct television advertising, because they don't know anything about television advertising.
They are too young and perhaps in advertising there will be shown how little children have to behave.
On the one hand they could learn something but on the other hand their parents show their children to behave differently.
This is the reason why children get confused.
In some ways if the children look every time this advertising, they will behave like it was shown in the advertising.
For children aged from two to five it is necessary to interact with their parents because parents have the most influence of their life.
Otherwise they don't learn anything about communication and often the advertising doesn't reach the young children.
Advertising was created to earn a lot of money, that people watching the TV will buy what was shown in the advertising.
In some way advertising can have a big impact on somebodys life and this isn't positive.
In my oppionion I think television advertisng directed toward young children should not be allowed, because as I said above, they are too young.
In their first years they have to learn how to behave by their parents.
Televison advertising can have a lot of negative things because most people don't think about it and they do what was said in the advertising.
An argument for the television advertising directed toward children (aged two to five) is they can learn something about the products they are , in some cases, interested to buy or let buy.
Consequently they could choose a game of many others that seems to be the coolest or funiest, if they compare the different advertisments.
Thats why kids would be more often settisfying because the parents could buy things the children are want to, if they agree with their selection.
There are more and stronger arguments against advertisments for young children.
One of this is that boys and girls in this age should not be confronted with so much media which would be more if they also must look for a lot of advertisments, if they want to have a new doll or something else.
The most important argument is that kids are not able to handle with advertisments because they don not understand something about trading.
The reason for this is that kids aged two to five have not the ability to quote about the advertisment and exspecially about the products, because the seller has a big influence to the feelings, with this always positive advertisments about the products.
Thats why children want things which are for example not even worth to buy.
To summ up this theme, I am against televesion advertising direct toward young children, because there are much stronger aspects against it.
Parents should decide what is worth to buy for their kids.
Television advertising toward young children

The statement above doesn't make any sense to me, because I have never seen any advertisement produced for children aged two to five.
Additionaly I think that children at that age don't watch advertisement produced for them and understand it by 100%.
Furthermore children aged two to five shouldn't be watching channels, which feature a lot of adverts and most channels for children don't show any adverts as far as I am concerned.
Even if they understood the advertisements, it would be a better idea to show them those advertisements instead of advertisements directed toward adults, which might include adverts for alcohol and cigarettes.
So to conclude my "essay", I can't really disagree nor agree with the statement, because I am not informed about TV advertisement in general, neither about TV advertisement directed toward young children.
I also don't know the behaviour of children aged two to five and how much they already understand if they watch an ad on TV.
Television advertising for so young children has good and bad sites.
It's important which progam they are watching and what kind of influense this program has.
It is good when the children watch a television program that prepares them for the school but television that has an bad influense and dont prepare them is not good for them when they watch it too often.
The parents have to controle the children and what they are watching, so that they can protect them towards those programms with such a bad influense.
But it doesn't make sense when the parents of these young children don't care about what their children are watching and the producers of these television programs often don't care too cause they only want money.
It's not important wether the children sometimes watch those series or movies which don't teach them so much like series who prepare them for the elementary school or the complete school in one thing but they shouldn't watch the too often.
I don't agree with this statement because i think that children should have fun and a good childhood.
Television is included in our modern social life and we should allow them to grow up with these things.
Some children are very good in elementary school because they watched such teaching children-series like "Dora" or "Toggolino" and some are not so good and too hyperactive because they always watched series like "Spongebob Schwammkopf" and only that so that only this fictional cartoon character was they
If the children for example watch televsion for one hour a day they dont really get much information about that, but if they watch very often television they can do bad things with the wrong knowledge.
Also it is important which series or canal they watch because every programm had other content to "get" the people to watch it.
Would the programms show the children important stuff for the whole life like school knowledge then they would do very good work, but with series which only show stupid people who do some activitie like hiting a other person and then laugh about it or something like this, then can the children do this at home and dont know its wrong to do that.
I dont really agree or disagree with this statement, because too many factors are to punish this statemant and to much situations which say its good or bad.
I agree that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed, because kids at the age from two to five are easy to manipulate and the guys who make the advertisement know that.
So they use or rather abuse these young naive kids for their egoistic moneymaking.
They show tons of advertisement for toys, barbies and other stuff during the beloved series of young kids.
The children then run to mum and dad, and cry out for these so important toys.
Its if just at that moment it came into their mind that they really really need the new barbie or the newest lego castle.
The trick with dumb children is, they don't stop crying for these advertised items unless the parent goes imediately to his or her car, drives to the next store and buys these bloody useless pieces of garbage.
The parents should rather throw the television into the rubbish and make their kids stop watching stupid shows.
They better let the kids play outside, breathe fresh healthy air and learn to survive in the cold hard nature.
They learn much more their life from being in nature instead of in front of the tv.
Television advertisment directed toward young children should be allowed.
I do nott think that advertisment in tv got that much influence.
Sure, they are in an age, where they gonna grow up und learn all the things they see.
But advertisment in tv got strict rules so they can not influence young children in theire political meaning or something like this.
They are free to grow up with any obstacles.
Advertisment in tv for young children can be something about the latest "Playmobile-Thing" or "lego".
So how should Toys influence the grow up of children?
Toys could have a political meaning but strict controling of it prevends that toys with political meaning get on the free market.
Children search some heros where they can copy their behavior.
Advertisment can influence this cognital process but not that much because children do not sit 24/7 in front of the tv-screen.
They spend more time with their parents/friends or someone so they got enough other people, who can be their heros.
Advertisment cutted on young children aged two to five have to be interested for them like any other advertisement for other groups of intrest.
They can not discuss a toppic, which might be controverse in society.
Children in this age two to five got no idea what is happening in world they focused on theirself, they explore their enviroment and try to understand how is physiks working.
They meet friends, learn how feelings felt or how social interaction is working.
They don not think "who is Donald Trump?"
or something like this, it is more interesting how they learned speaking and interacting with other people and advertisement cant influence this behavior.
If advertisment can influence this behavior then we should think about our standards on tv.
It can't be possible that advertisment in tv can show how to treat someone badly without any consequences.
I totally disagree with this statement "televison advertising directly toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Children can't be influenced in their grow up.
So advertising in tv is completly acceptable.
The topic " television advertising directed toward young children" is a good example to show how people addicted to television.
Young children grown up with it and do not understand that their are addicted to it.
It is possible when their older that all activities are watching TV or playing games and chilling at home because they don´t know what means playing outside with friends or going to swim.
They are addicted to the little piece of glass which isn´t their fault because their parent aren´t better then them.
Also when the children looking TV with their parent they also look series they don´t make for their age like " How I met youre mother" or "The big bang theorie".
Their dream about something like that and can not sleep anymore.
On TV it´s given series like " Spongebob Squarepants" or "Timmy Turner" which got an negative effect on them.
I think younger children should be addicted to play outside or playing with things for their age like Playmobile or Cars.
It is tested that it's not very good for the brain if you look to much television, it could be that you afterwards have a brain disease or your head hurts.
I think it's not very good but it can help your intelligence when you start to understand things.
I agree with this statement because with the age of two or three years it's not important to look television to train your intelligence, you can train your intelligence as well with playing some games with cards or something like this.
It is difficult to abolish the television advertising because you can't test if one makes it or not.
This is a question for the parents of this children they should decide if it's good or not.
If I would have children in this age I wouldn't allow them to watch television they should play outside or if the weather is bad they should play inside with cards or some plays but not games on the computer or handy because this would have the same effect as if they could watch television.
Finally I would agree with the statement because its not good for your health and the most time in the television you can watch more or less just nonsense and this is not good for your intelligence this helps you nothing.
The children aged two years wouldn't understand something of what happens they would only watch the pictures and that they can do as well with some picturebooks or they draw their own little pictures.
In our society many children have a handy at the age of ten or younger and they could watch television whenever they want but this is a question of the upbringing of their parents if they won't play something with them or the children haven't learnt to play alone the parents would let them watch television but we can't abolish something like this it's the bad outcome of our new society.
But we can abolish it in the nurseries and this we should do.
The nursery teachers aren't there to watch television with the children they are there to look after the children and play with them.
If we could we should make an initiative to abolish televisions in all nurseries in Switzerland or as well in other countries.
But in our age it isn't possible to make something like this we haven't the right to do this.
YOung people shouldn't watching television because it isn't so good for young people to watch the hole time television.
The children should go to the outside and to enjoy their life and to play with their friends.
If the young people wathing a documentarie in the television it doesn't matter because they learn something about the world or something about the nature.
But some families don't watching a documenteration because they like to watch cartoon or to watch some movies for a example a roman or a thriller, it doesn't help their child to learn about the life or something like else.
Children should read more, because thats better for their life and it helps to be better in school.
As I was a childreen I was playing the hole time outside with my friends and I hadn't time to watch television or playing with a gameboy.
To watch television the hole time isn't so good for their future because the most children aren't so good in the school if they looked as a children the hole time television.
To read a book is even better for their future and it helps to understand the world and the nature.
In some countries in the school the used televisions or computer for their lesson, because they tink it is better for the students, but to sit the hole time in front of a telivision isn't so good for the eyes of the children.
And the most children are at home and wathing television and now why the schools do this.
So it's okay to watch television but not the hole time and to watch series about the world or something like else.
I agree with the following statement because I think that children at the age of two to five are able to understand what the advertisemnet wants to say but they aren´t able to really think about it and if it´s good or bad.
They can´t have an opinion about that so it´s unfair to let products look good to them but they can´t know an disagreeing argument.
Children at that age believe everything they get to know or see because they aren´t able to know it better and as we all know that every advertisemnt is only made to convice the people to buy the product, children might only talk about that product after watching it in television.
Another contra is that if there were people in the advertisement who do kind of strange or dangerous things, the children might want to do them as well.
On the other hand it depends on what kind of advertising the children see.
If it were an advertisement that teaches the children something it would be okay to do that.
If the parents have the opinion that thier chuild shouldn´t see that advertisement, they still can switch off the television.
Even though it could be that the advertisement is teaching something good,I still think that it shouldn´t be allowed to show advertisements for children that are at the age of two to five in television because it´s not necassary ( the children can´t buy the product themselves anyway)  and there might be some risks.
In the following essay I have to answer the question, if television advertising shouldn't be allowed to young children.
I agree to the statement, because young children are way to manipulative to get advertising directly towards them.
In my opinion the advertising which are ment to be for the children are too aggressive towards them because they often say that they have to get that thing.
Children don't have the control to say no when things around them like ads repeat they have to need that one thing now or they will be less cooler than others.
A other reason why I think they shouldn't be allowed is that many children go to their parents and say that they need it until the parents get sick of them for only want this one thing.
Mostly the advertisings are about games and dolls or things like this but often the things are useless and only for consuming.
I also think that children are too poor to get robbed without knowing it by big companys who only want to make money also when their parents buy that things for them.
I think that children shouldn't get advertising but more shows where they can learn something from without any ads between them because it has more perspectives for the young children.
There are things on the market which are good for children and where they can learn from but mostly they don't get enough advertisings because of all the other hyped things which get more ads in the television.
Today technology has a big impact on our lives.
It can influence us in a very powerful way and we are always connected.
To stay updated and not miss any news, families often watch the news on television.
But not only does the television provide us with news, but it also offers many other options for one's entertainment,for instance TV-shows or documentaries.
Due to the everyday use of televisions in homes, advertisement is unverzichtbar.
Children watch televison quite frequently nowadays to get attention and be entertained.
Most parents aren't concerned about what an influence this device can have on their children.
But should they?
Children at a young age are easily influenced by all sort of things.They do not know what is right or wrong, and are open to new ideas.
In fact, it much easier to attract a child with advertisement than an adult.
Children can not protect themselves from the real world.
Parents must take care of their children and shield them from "bad" things.
Though that is exactly the point, it is impossible to protect one's child from everything, there is way too much to look out for.
With prohibiting television advertising toward young children is a safe way to make sure that the child can buils their own outlook on life without being interrupted by advertisement.
in fact
Almost every childhood was influenced by the sesam street or the Teletubies.
Girls usually watched movies like Cinderella or Barby and Boys watched the Powerrangers or Blue's clues.
During a movie or episode there are advertisments like every television channel does.
Every boy or girl saw the new toys and immeadiatly everyone wanted it.
Clearly, this advertisment isn't meant to be for adulat, but is it even fair to influence those inncocent children through advertisment?
In the following text I will discuss if televison advertisment directed toward young children should be allowed.
On the one hand it should be allowed, because children who watch television get influenced anyways by the movies or TV shows, so why shouldn't it be allowed to advertise new toys?
Instead of adverstising those new toys hidden in the shows, they represent it clearly as an advertisment.
So the companys are actually giving the child a fair chance of deciding and judging because they can see that this is an advertisment.
In addition, we have to look at the economic opportunity children have.
The companys can earn a lot of money by advertising directly to young children.
Often relatives, like the grandparents, love make them smile and this can be made through a new toy which children see in advertisments.
So the children will be happy with their new toy, the grandparents because the child is happy and the companys because they earn money.
Everyone wins.
Also, children who watch advertisment in their young ages are later more able to handle advertisments.
When you are influenced by those early you also leatrn early that some advertisments might be lies or just not always the same as you expect.
With that knowledge you are prepared for the futurte live.
So the companies are actually doing good by advertising directly to them.
On the other hand, we have to look at the downside of adversting children when they are young.
There is a study that states that children who watch television get strongly influenced and get pushed into a gender stereotype.
The big businesses decided that boys like blue and cars and girls like pink and barbies, not hte children on theirselfs.
Especially advertisments targets those stereotypes and influences children.
An other point is that through those advertisments children always have to have the newest toy, which sets pressure on the parents or close relatives and on ther children too.
The only winner will be the toy company, becuse they earn and the family looses money.
My last point is that children in that age aren't able to judge and decide weather this is a trick to influence them or just to show them the newest toys.
Children are innocent and have no chance to defend themself from that advertisments.
It is simply not fair to influence them in that kidn of direction.
All in all, there are many points to look at in that discussion, but I think that we shouldn't allow this or only with regulations, so the children have a chance ti decide.
Today more and more kids watch TV, play video games oder do other things on technical devices in their freetime.
Also the young children in the age of two to five oftne watch TV.
But is this really good for the children or should they better watch TV if they are older?
In my opinion young children shoukd not watch so much or best no TV, because they should use their freetime otherwise.
They should go outside, meet friends, talk and play with them.
Today there are a few programms which only shows series for young children.
Often the series in TV are not important to learn something.
They tell stories which aren´t important for the kids and their future, maybe they are bad for them.
Most of the kids usually don´t understand this storie, because they are too young for understanding them.There are already a lot of television series for young children, in which they can learn the number oder the ABC.
But I think it would be better if they will learn it in an other way, maybe in kindergarten or from their parents or later in school.
If the children often watch TV, they want to watch more and more TV and one time they just wanted to watch TV the whole day.
They don´t have any friends, they just sitting in their rooms the wohole day, do´t get any fresh air an activity.
Today technics are more and more important and the most kids are sitten inside in front of them but this is not good for their body and for their sociality.
So in my view the young children in the age of two to five should not watch TV they should do other (importanter) things in their life, which they only can do in the young life to play outside with friends and something like this.
Also in older age, people actually should not watch so much TV, they sould go work, do sports, meet friends ore travel and don´t show it wrong to the kids.
The television advertising directed toward young children, aged from two to five years is not good, because their are many bad television programms for kids and they can destroy their hole life.
In the children television today are often series which are not good for kinds.
On Kika are many series that are aged for twelve years.
Some kids make things that they see in the television, and thats not good.
For example some kids will cut their stomach, because of the Teletabbis.
Another bad thing is, that the eyes from young children grow in these years.
When they often watch television they must wear glasses in young years.
Also it is not good to sit often on the couch and watch television.
They must go outsite and play football or play playmobil to learn something and to move.
When they play football or ride a bike they can met friends and have fun together.
In the age from two to five, they cannot understand words so good an they go not to school.
The television advertising directed toward young children, aged from two to five years has not so much poistive aspects.
One positiv aspect is, that they can learn something in the television.
Maybe they can learn to speak an to understand, or the watch some learning series for young children.
Also the children relax, when they watch television and they can sleep better.
In my opinion the television advertising directed toward young childrens should not be allowed,, so i agree with this statement.
The youg children must play something an go outside and not sit every day on the couch an watch television.
Parents should say, whats good for their childrens.
But in my opinion its not good for the childrens.
They often must wear glasses in the age of ten, because they have bad eyes when they watch every day television.
While you look Televison, you often see advertising between your program.
The advertising is about differint things und should influencesequences of that?
First of all in my opinion a young children who is only two years old, should not watch TV that often and they  the people to buy the products and to convince them of their new product.
But is it okay, if an advertising is directed toward young children who are between two and five?
And what could be the problems and coneven shouldn`t watch programs with advertisments, because there are even programs for children which are without any advertising.
But after that children are much more easier to influnce than older people who should know what is real or who should know which advertisment they can trust.
Young people always want the products or the toys they see in Televison and they believe in everything they see in TV because they can´t know that the people who designed this advertisment only want to sell their products as good as they can.
This methode is only good for the people who desined it or for the people who get their money with this advertising because they maybe get more money because the parents buy the stuff for their children because they don´t want that their children are sad.
To conclude I would say that children should not watch TV that often and because of this they don´t see the advertising, but in my opinion it isn´t a good solution if you don´t allow this advertising because many people get their money with this job and in the end it is always the decision of the parents if they buy the things to their children.
Everybody can decide on their own because everybody has his own opinon which shuld be accepted.
The question if television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five ) should be allowed or not is often disscused.
Many parents don't want the television advertising directed toward their children because they have fear that the advertising chance their children and that they want everything which appears in the advertising.
It might be that they will called names in preschool because they don't have the newest things, which are on TV.
They also have fear that the advertising leads their children to watch television very often and that they won't meet with friends anymore or do their hobbys.
Other people think that the advertising won't harm the kids and won't chance them because the parents have still the control about the kids.
I think television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) isn't neccesary because they are very young and maybe the advertising will form them.
I think it's also unessesary that children watch television and that people in such a young age want everything what they see in the advertising but I also think that it depends on the form of the advertising.
A memory advertising, which they created with a friendly atmosphere for example is better than an advertising for a coputer game, where you have to kill people.
pro: 

- bad idol
- did a lot of bad things in his life
- many kids take him as an idol


contra:

- was a young, nice kid
- did nothing bad
- no connection between his kidlife and adultlife
- to take care, because he was only a kid and after that he did bad things

To public an advertisment is not easy.
It could be risc for a lot of people but it could be also a good thing for other peoples.
Noone can make the perfect advertisment for something.
It will have everytime a guy who doesn't like it.
At the end of a day, all advertisment are good and has sense.
In my opinion everyone can show them whatevere they want.
Only if it's rasicm or hurts other people shoudn't be allowed to public them.
A lot of people thing that the tv advvertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed, because he did bad things and he will be a bad idol for many other kids, who watch the advertising.
They think it could be dangerous to show them this advertisment, maybe the kids want to get like him.
Another part of people think, it isn't really bad to show them this advertisment.
Because Chevalier was young, nice kid like every kid in the world, actually.
He didn't do anything bad in his age, so why we shouldnt't see him on the tv like a 5 years old kid?
It has no connection between his kidlife and his adultlife.
People should difference between his life as a teenager and his life as a "rich man in Switzerland or as a prisoner in Venice".
To show them Toward as a child could be maybe a good thing, because then the other kids can take care not to get like him.
Evereyone is a good kid, but not everybody would be for ever a good person.
I want to say, that I think it's not a problem to show them people this advertiment.
Everybody knows that the Chevalier get bad, but as a child he wasn't really dangerous, and why they shouldn't show us him?
At the end of the day it isn't necessary what he did in his late life.
At the newespaper you often read that young children often watch television as often as thei're parents do you agree or disagree with this statement?
In many familys the kids often watch television so the parents can relaxe or do something that they want and did'nt play with the kids.
I think it should be allowed when they watch only an half an hour or something like that.
But when they often watch television, they didn't play enough time outside or with friends.
Sometime the television is something you can learn from.
The parents should give them a timeline for example only one serie before they go to bed.
The parents didn't watch telesivion so long too,because the kids think it's right what the parents do.
I think when it's not be allowed the kids demonstrate with this and it's often hard to life when the kids are sad or something like that.
The kids can often be angry when they watch to much television and watch the false series too.
An other thing is that the kids very sad about it when the parents did'nt play with them and only watch television is bad for the parents too.
It's okay when the whole family watch a movie at weekend night then they do something together and it's something that the whole family like.
It's also okay to show the kids the news on television because to show whats happend in the world and that the kids learn something about the world.
I think it's important to have time with kids and not with the television .
At the end the parents say that is okay or not,but I think it's not bad when kids watch television but they need a timeline.
The question whether or not televison advertising directetd towards young should be forbidden is a quite controversial one, as young children often enough can't voice their own oppinion and there are good arguments on both sides.
A point against this would be that the mind of a young child can be influenced way easier, than an adult mind, what could potentielly lead to big companies showing ads directly targeted at young children, so that those stick to that very same company for their rest of ther lives as the memory about this company ,and how good it presented itself, is deeply ingrained into the childs mind leading it to subconsciously preferring the products of a certain company in their adult lives.
This can be seen especially good in the buying behaviour of old people, as they often tend stick to a certain brand for the rest of their lifes, that they know from their childhood on.
Another argument against this is that children can not actively protect themselves from those advertisements, as they often even don not know, what they are being shown.
Furthermore most parents can not protect their children from those advertisements aas well, as they can not check on theri kids every five minutes, as a matter of fact there are even parents who do not controll, what their children watch at all, showing a rather careless attitude.
Then again there actually are arguments for advertisemenst being targeted at children, because it just can not be avoided, that at some point iof its life a child watches an advertisement.
So the actual question is, do we want it to see a child friendly advertisement that will trick them into buying the products of a certain company or do we want advertisements that could be potentielly harmful to a childs mental health, causing them to get anxiety, certain phobias and so on.
An example for this would be the advertisement for a particular violent game or something comparable.
Personally i think that, there should not be advertisements directly targeted at children and if so they should not be too influential, because either outcome can be bad for a child.
In a shop full of toys, a mother and child are looking around.
The child suddenly rushes over to a shelf were hundreds of the same dolls are lined up neatly.
It runs to it's mother and says: "Mommy, Mommy look!
It's just like the one i saw on TV yesterday!
Can I have it?
Please ,please, pleeeeease!"
The mother looks up and says: "Ok sweetheart but don't be sorry if it doesn't do the same stuff as it does on TV, you know they always oversell these products.".
Without listening to her mothers full awnser the girl runs to the counter and gets her new doll.
When they get home and she openes the box she's clearly dissapointed.
"It doesn't even talklike it did on TV !"
she exclaimes.
And after two hours of playing with it, it's lying broken on the ground.
"So much for good quality merchendise...", the mother murmurs as she puts it away.
This scenaryo happenes more often than you think.
With kid advertising on TV always more children start only buying things they see in commercials.
If they get something handmade there disapointed because it's not the same as the one they saw on the tellie
.
Then again it might also be the case that they start learning at a very youngage not to trust everything that is said on the TV.
But also there are always breaks between their TV programms with only advertisements, where they can't watch their show.
So naturally they go wake Mommy from her nap to play because there's nothing on TV.
.
On the other hand they might learn a lot about new things and words and how to use them.
So should it be aloud to make Television advertising directed towards young children?
I personally think it should be forbidden, because young kids shouldn't have to deal with advertising.
Besides at a young age children are so impressionable so they fall for every advertising trick in the book.
In my mind kids should be able to be kids and enjoy their childhood and not have to think about stuff like advertising and if their toys are good quality or not.
I say we put a stop to kid advertising!
The statement " television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" is not easily to answer.
Then it is right that young children at that age have to learn much from the natur and from all outside and that the television is not telling the truth.
But young have also a lots of energy and some adult could not be able to play with their children all the time and some adults have not the time for such a young kid.So they are putting their kid in front of a television for some free time themselfs.But now we know that the latest television is too high for a three year old child, then there are too much pictures wich appears at one sekund and the young brain could not work with so much.
So taht the kids could not sleep at night, because the brain is after three hours still working to overlook all this information.
That is one point that defeat one of the excuses for sitting their children in front of that thing.
Then when the children could not sleep the adult have much more work to do with them, when there are tired too.
So the parents should teach the childrens early as they could to play on their own, like drawing or playing Lego or something like that.
Maybe they could invite other kids too.
But the televions could also show the kid a new fantastic world with fantasy or a childhood hero, but then the televison time have a limit like for an four years old child a half hour a day.
There is also big problem there when the kid see things like a murderer or something like that, then then the child getting nightmares.
So my personally opinion is, that children under five years should not watching television because they have much more opportunitys for their freetime wich all are better than watching TV and getting maybe problems when they want to sleep.
And if the parents have no time for their child or no friend has time to play with them, then the telivision is no option.
Then childrens could do something on there own because at that age are all humans creative.
My statement is about televisoin toward young children.
Is ist bad or not?
My oppinion is that it must be allowed because children would watch TV either.
Maybe they go secretly in the livingroom to watch TV and if this is the cause the children would watch television for adults and no program for them.
The television advertising is directed toward the children with learning programms so the can learn something for a better understanding and knowledge.
An argument against it could be that the children watch TV oftener as usally and didn't go out to play for example with a ball and friends.
The parents could use it to get the childrens quiet if they will be noisy and loud.
It's a pitty that the television is mostly about witches and stuff that didn't exists.
Many people say that television make people stupid.
But if the television is direccted toward children and have an lerning effect I would disagree to the statement that youg children should not be allowed to watch TV.
It must ju be so long.
Television advertising which is directed to young children (directed to children aged two to five) should not be allowed because the children are not able to understand this adverts because they are just too young to understand.
Maybe if there is an advert for a new game for young children aged up to three or five the children thought that they just have to own this new game because it is new and brillant but if the parents buy this game it is used maybe once or twice because after playing it it can be boring because you know what happens and how it should be used.
So just the parents of the young children have to decide if they will buy the things or if they will not.
The Children are not able to  decide wether they would have this things which are directed to them in adverts maybe in TV or in magazines because the parents have to decide if the new things are good for their own children or if they could change the children in a bad way.
If there is any new food in an advert which is pronounced as healthy and good for children only the parents could decide if their children gets it because it could be bad for their children because of an allergic reaction or something else.
So my opinion for the question if television advertising which is directed to young children (aged two to five) should be allowed or should even not be allowed is that it could give some adverts for that aged children but i think that this should be not much because the parents should decide if they would buy it for their children or even if they would not buy it for them because it is not good or healthy for children.
Maybe once or twice a day television advertising could be directed to young children between two and five years because children should not watch television all day because the childhood is just too short to watch television all day.
Children should play outside and went playing with their friends because friends are a very important point in life so you have to use all time you have in life and make it brilliant.
The statement if Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, is a difficult question because there are some different opinions.
So it is bad that the young children learn to watch Tv for a long time on a day and maybe they can not be so concentrate in the future.
Also they should have friends to play with outside and do not sit in the house and watch Tv for the whole day.
In the age between two and five they learn a lot and they should not learn it from the Televison because they have to learn it from their parents or there friends or somebody else and not from the TV.
Also it is really realistic that the young children be addicted to watch TV and when they learn it in this age maybe they do nothing else when they are in the age to go to school, so they do not learn for the school or do their homework because they come home and start whatching TV and that is not good for their future.
But today there are a lot Tv shows that shows something where the children can learn for their future but some TV shows are not good for the children and should only entertain and not tell something for their future.
So I thing it is not the right way that children should watch TV in the age between two and five the whole day but when they do not do that I thing that is okay.
But it is important that children learn to communicate with other people and not sitting home for the whole day.
And what the children learn in this time they do their whole life when they do not learn it in another way.
Children, aged two to five, shouldn't watch TV so often, because they are in the most important Age of their life.
At this age, they are learning to speak, to walk, maybe to read and so on.
Television advertising could cancel these exercises.
The television advertising could support the children to watch TV all day long and they want something from the Television advertising, toys or somthing else, like smartphones.
But Television advertising is also helpful.
The children can find some thimgs, which are useful for speaking, walking etc.
If the parents are poor, it could also be, that the children can' get everything they wan't.
This could be helpful for the education of the children, because they can concentrate more on things they have to learn.
It is like in school, if children have things they like more, then studying or doing homework, they will do them mostly before homework, etc.
In my opinion, children should be allowed to watch TV and see the Television advertising, but not so often.
They should go outside and learn something from the nature and have fun.
It doesn't need electronical devices every time, to be happy.
But to be honest, the most children nowadays dont even now the Nature, because the're sitting all day long in their rooms and play video games.
"Mommy, daddy, pleeeease, can I have this?"
Every parent knows the struggle.
As soon as the child spots a cool teddy bear or a new doll in a TV commercial it has to have it.
This often brings parents in difficult situations.
They don't want to spoil their kids with new products but often can't handle the following drama when the kid doesn't get what it wants.
So wouldn't parenting be so much easier if television advertising toward young children weren't allowed?
A big pro argument is the already mentioned situation.
As soon as a kid sees a new toy in the TV, it wants it.
Parenting would be much easier without these commercials because the kid wouldn't even know that these toys exist.
People that are against this law claim, that the kid always sees new toys.
In preschool, in kindergarden... there are always other kids with different toys.
Their statement is that the TV commercial doesn't make that much of a difference and shouldn't be forbidden because ot that.
An argument against this new law is the fact, that children have to learn to deal with commercials as soon as possible.
Nowadays, advertisements are everywhere.
It is better if the child starts seing them with three and can learn early how to deal with the fact that there is an endless amount of toysand that it can't have everything.
In conclusion, there are many different opinions about this subject and not a simple solution.
The problem is real and a new solution is needed.
In our day and age, it is normal that nearly everyone has at least one television at home.
But is it essential that young children have to sit in front of the TV nearly every day?
A main advantage of televisions is that we get to information very easily.
We can lay on the couch and listen to the news, so we don't have to concentrate, which is really relaxing after a heavy working day.
Another advantage is that you can learn something when you're watching TV, for example when you

However, there are also some disadvantages.
Firstly, TV's are often used as a babysitter, so a lot of parents sit their children in front of the television and don't look after them by themselves.
Secondly, all those gadgets have a bad influence on us, espessially on the children, because they can get addicted to them.
It is important that they can play with other children to make friends and that is not possible if the sit nearly the whole day in front of a enormous display.
On the one hand, people have many points in favour.
They can be a vital factor in deliver us a lot of information.
On the other hand, there are also a huge number of negative aspects, like the bad influence on the young children, which are not able to controll themselves.
In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, but the parents should take care after them and look that they dont
These days the biggest topic of our community is money.
I mean everything runs on money the whole economy runs on money.
And so I have no doubt that they also want to make money with children I mean no wonder; where they see a good possibility to make money they take it without any respect of the children's life and the life of the family.
They don't even think about it, many of them don't think around the corner and just see their goal.
And so disrespectful are also the makers of the ads between the children's favourite sopes, I mean everyone wants to sell its products of course but I guess it it's a bit of a mean but in the same time clever tactic to make use of the children's immaturity.
With all those plastic toys kids see in the advertising these little poor things sometimes think they live in a lila plastic world and live way beyond the reality instead they get told from some mean moneymakers that they can live a happier and funnier live with their talking plastic dogs or with their new collection of Power Rangers.
And in the same time as I remember my childhood these sorts of things were totally funny and I still think that it was somehow sweet that I collected thins and that and my friends did so to and we had a happy time but I was a lucky kid that wasn't influenced so much by the ads as my mom didn't allow me to watch TV that often.
But nowadays children get spoiled spoiled by the electronical industry parents are somehow naive and let their kid play with their iPad twentyfour-seven, probably because it's easy for them that time the kid sits before the TV or iPad they don't have to take time for their kid, what is in my eyes completely irresponsible.
So it's not only about the bad moneymakers but also about the parents who let their children play with their electronics such as iPad, TV, mobile phone etc.
it also lays in their hands whether their children get in contact with the many ads.
The moneymakers just take their opporunity.
Parents should be confronted more with the good aspects of not letting their children watch TV that often.
I guess many children would become much more social, creative and more ready for life when they can joy the beauties of life outside in nature where they learn to play with that what nature offers them and where they learn to 

So as you may see
In my opinion there are different reasons to say that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not be allowed.
On argument is, that the children in that age won´t buy things without their parents knowledge.
The parents know better than the children what is right and what is wrong and won´t buy the things from the advertising if they are not worth it.
Another argument that television advertising should be allowed is, that children in that age don´t watch much advertising.
They feel bored very fast and will switch the programm when there is advertising.
So there is no reason why it should be forbidden, because they don´t get to watch the advertising.
On the other hand, there are also many reasons why it should not be allowed.
Children in the age of two to five don´t have an own opinion.
They are influenced very fast by media, people or Television advertising.
Children can not understand that an object of the advertising is not that good in real life how it is descriped in the advertising.
They don´t know that the advertising shows an idealised picture of the product and want to have it, although it is not that good in the reality.
As well children haven´t got so much money.
They only have their pocket money and the money that them was given.
But children don´t own their own money, because they don´t work.
So it is not fair to let them buy the things of the advertising, because the children should not spend all of their money.
Children should rest money for the future.
The kids will be disappointed if they buy an object and it isn´t so how it is descriped and they will regret that they bought it.
All in one you can say that there are more reasons why television adverting should not be allowed.
The children are to small to understand the sence of television advertising.
Nowadays, advertisments on technological devices are getting more and more habitual.
For instance, television programmes are regularely interrupted to add a new product or the latest magazines.
This essay is intented to give pros and cons about children who participate in an advertsimnent what is undoubtfully a moving question?
To begin with, the privacy of a young person who cannot make decisions on his own is published by a performance on tv.
Despite a refuse of the children the parents can arrange an advertisment.
Another factor to be considered is that an intensive and demanding work in a tv stuio may be too exhausting so as not to feel comfortable.
Producing and creating an advertisment is a long process which is why the children cannot bring neither enough motivation nor any experinece.
On the other hand, advertisments can bring valuable money, new connections and important experiences.
To start with a show career, an early start is as useful as habitual training.
Therefore, there are just a few grandparents who can show their future children a tv advertisment of them.
Last but not least, tv performances or other participations is fun for most of the young children and bring a new experience in order to widen their horizons.
All in all, advertisments wit young children bring more advantages than disadvantages.
A new experience and a day with professional producers puts an exhausting and too demanding work into the shadow.
I am of the opinion, that these young advertisment stars should keep going and that there is no deciding factor to  prohibit to build up a new generation of tv stars.
In my opinion there are no problems about the statement below.
On the one side i can understand that some humens are not okay whit that but i think it is a normal procces in the new modern world.
So one say that it would be bad for the kids and they have problems in their social life.
The kids have no friends because of the television consum they have.
But In our modern world whit so much war and political statements i think it is our oppotunity to informate the young humens.
So i think that Television is not oly bad when it used safely.
Also it is a normal rising process to watch tv and play video games on playstations.
I don't know even one child who doesn't do this in their childhood.
And that they don't get freinds is a not truth point, because every kid do this and every kid get so 'online' friends who also are friends.
Es ist ja nicht  so, that the kids are every day in the house and watches all day long tv and play video games.
The school or kindergarten is there a very important point because the cildren can talk there to ech other and can social contacts knüpfen.
In my opinion it should give more high quality information sources also in the internt were these children can learn and have fun.
I think the children should have there fun and learn by themselves.
To the end i can say that it should'nt be forbidden but it should be verantwortungsbewusst used.
Televison advertising directed toward children in the age two to five is a general topip wich should be discuss.
The question is if should not be allowed or if it is okay to confront young children witch this kind of advertisig.
For the first point it is important to say that in general children should not spend time with televison.
They should go outside and get their cognitive skills.
On the one hand it does not care if advertising directed toward young children because they don not have the age to decide what to buy.
They need the go from their parents.
On the other hand they could be influenced for the future.
The struggle is that nobody can control what kind of andvertising dirceted to these children.
Another point against advertising for the little is that they could see something what they could not get.
For example because of the money condition of the family.
This could be not good for the selfconfidence of the children.
It is a big disatvantage to show children in young age how ,,important'' material thinks are.
I think televison advertising for young peole should be not allowed.
On reason for that is that in my eyes it is unimportant for the industrie.
Things for those kids could directed to the parents maybe.
Another reason ist that young people do not need any kind of advertising, they are not in the age to know what is important for them.
They would just begin to thikk about material things.
Should Television advertising directed toward young children be forbidden or hould it be allowed?
In general young children are learning at every time of the day.
They get visiual informations about all what they are doing and what they see and hear.
Specific Television concepts could be useful to teach the children important things like counting, reading, colors or something like that.
Also in the social sector it can be useful.
On this way parents could be helped by rasing the children.
Without specific studies about the topic over a long time, nobody is allowed to write a paragraph saying that it is forbidden to let children watch Televisison.
Children are just in a process, where the way of getting visiual informations is important.
If the children watch Television much time a day or week, they get the feeling that they always have to be entertaint and maybe they will get problems to concentrate in situation, they have to or get less focus on them.
So they do not learn to be creative themselfs.
Also they do not get children experiences like beeing outside and learning by seeing something new.
It also could by critical for the childrens healthy.
People who spending most of their free time in watching Television would not do hobbies, sports or investigate in social contacts.
They might be fat and social isolateted.
All in all i think that it is not important to watch Tv in this age and they have to learn by experiences and do not have to count or write.
Things like that working without that.
In this time, where all works with computers, it is important that by seperate using this things for a better life and making this things to our life and this should happen by rasing children.
But i also think that it is unrealistic to forbid duch a maual thing.
Noone could proove it and a liberal country like our is, parents are selfconfident to raise their children with own methods, as long as the children do not get physicl hurtness or something like that.
Nowadays, if you watch Television it offen happens that you come across an advertising directed towards kids.
I think these ads shouldn't be allowed.
First, they could be annoying for some grown up people, and in my opinion, the television belongs primarely to them.
Kids should be playing outside, have fun and eventually do homeworks, they shouldn't watch TV all day long.
That's why it is unnacessary to run commercials directed to little children.
Second, it's no secret that ads make people  want buying more things, that is their purpose.
Grown-up people can ignore this strategy, little children on the other hand can't.
They want to buy nearly everything they see in the TV.
No wonder that kids are being spoilt nowadays, because their parents want them to have a good childhood and buy their children everything they wish for.
They need to understand that working is an important thing in their life, and that, unfortunately, money doesn't just grow on trees.
Third, a big part of the commercials are food ads.
They advertise all kinds of foods containing sugar and other harmful chemicals.
Kids need to learn in their young ages that a lot of fat and sugar are not good for their health.
If they watch plenty of ads in which other kids seem to have fun while eating unhealthy food they'll think it could also be a good thing for them.
I can understand that it isn't possible to permit the kids watching television, but we need to teach children in their young ages to be healthy and to handle their money well, they surely shouldn't buy everything they see, their parents work hard for the money, so should they.
The statement that television advertisments which are directed towards young children shouldn't be allowed is a rather stupid statement.
These advertisments aren't in any way bad for them.
Let's look at a Play-Dough advertisment.
In this kind of advertisments there are just children playing with dough and having fun or for example an advertisment for Playmobil or Lego these advertisments are meant for kids and they don't do anything bad for them.
There are just kids playing with things.
A Barbie advertisment is a kid palying with Barbies, does that could really do anything bad for them?
Could that actually be harm for young children?
For example an advertisment for Toys-R-Us is directed towards children.
They do not put anything sexually or harmfull things in these advertisments.
On the other hand these advertisments show a specific gender playing with a specific toy.
Do you ever see a boy playing with a barbie or a toy-kitchen?
No, because the advertisments show that it is supposed to be for girls and not for boys.
And the toy Hot-Wheels or Lego is supposed to be for boys, but why?
I once read a story about a little boy having his mother buy him a pink stroller.
He was very happy with it and ran around with the stroller through his neighborhood.
When one woman came up to his mother and asked why she would let him play with a girls toy.
And this is a problem.
Through these advertisments we show boys that they cannot play with Barbies or anything pink and we show girls that Lego or colours like blue aren't for them.
So rather than saying they shouldn't be allowed you should change these advertisments in some way.
In my opinion we should let boys and girls just play with what they want.
Pushing gender-roles onto them is like telling them what they cannot do or be or saying what they are supposed to do or be.
Do we really want to tell children that playing with a stroller if you are a boy or playing with a racing car if you are a girl is bad?
I think we should just let them wear and play with what they want and that these advertisments are just pushing girls and boys into a specific gender-role which they maybe don't even want to be in.
Banning them isn't helping anyone, but changing them, showing that boys can play with a toy-kitchen and girls building a Lego-house is way better.
It would show kids that know that they don't want to play with any toy for their gender that they can play with or wear whatever they want which is just the reality.
The statement"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed", is a dificult theme for the childrens and for the parents.
An advertising with the Television is a good option, which every body could see.
But should it be allowed for young childrens?
First you have to say that television advertising directed toward young children is a reason for the them, to watch more television or play some games in the internet, because they recognize that somebody directly talk to them.
They  will sit more inside in the house and maybe dont go outside and play with some friends in there age.
You also have to say that television advertising toward young children is a trick against the parents.
When young children see something new or something they would love to have, they may go to the parents and ask directly: Pls buy this or these for me.
But you have to say that televison advertising toward young children also have good reasons.
With the television you could talk to everyone all over the world.
For example, when you see something in England in the television, you can order it when you are back in your home country.
As a parent you dont have to run from shop to shop to see the new things for the young children, you see it in the television and then you will order it via Internet.
You could say that television advertising toward young children is good for the childrens but not for the parents.
Children seeing adverts for toy-tanks in the TV and want to have this.
Many parents are shocked about this and the call to ban advertising for young children from the screen gets louder.
In our time media is an really important thing of the lifes of many children in the world.
So you have to think about how to bring media in a healthy way to them.
And there the controverses begin.
On the one hand there are the parents who see toys adverts in the TV and think this is horrible, on the other hand there is the industry which wants sell things.
There you can see this group of consuments is very important for the economy and yes it´s the future because when they are grown up they buy things and with the advertising you as a company can manage which products they will buy in their later life.
No one wants children to play with tanks and going to think war is a good, a normal thing.
But there you can say there is much more other advertising on the sreen than for tanks, so why is this not good.
The children get to know the latest toys outside there and can wish them from there parents for example for birthday.
And the parents know what their cildren want and can buy the best, the latest toys.
But there ist a problem with this.
Children can´t reflect and know the intention of the adverts.
This is what´s dangerous.
The child only sees this wonderful thing on the TV but does not know the industry wants to sell things.
Children are manipulated and they are going to think it´s good what others tell and show you.
This would have consequences for their later life.
They do not reflect and can´t see the real intentions behind.
So looking on the different sites my point of view on this topic is real clear.
Ithink advertsing for children, and not only for the youngest, should be banned from the screen.
It´s not good for them.
Our society uses television a lot.
You rarely find a household where there isnt a tv.
And we are also surrounded by advertising daily.
One way to bring people things near is to place the product in breaks of tv shows.
Almost every show is seperated in different parts and you can have 10 minutes of advertising till you can carry on watching.
Some of these advertising may not be for children.
They could not deal with some of the pictuers of the advertisement.
But we have different channels for different ages.
We have disneychannel for kids or some channels where you can only watch crimes, thrillers or documentaries.
I think we have to keep an eye on what kind of advertisement is shown on which cannels.
But my opinion is that we cant keep television advertising away from young children completly.
If its no bad content it wont be bad for the children.
My view is that all the television advertising for young children are also for the parents to get them to buy the products for their children.
The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed."
is a little over the top.
Children get to see advertisements for their age anyway because there are more mediums than tv.
They could also see that in magazines, on posters in front of the shoppingcentre or on the phone of their parents.
So its useless to forbit television advertising for kids but we chould check their content and design.
This essay is about the statement "Television adversiting directed towad young children should not be allowed.
In my opinions it is a statement, which has a lot of positiv and negativ sides.
The people, who put the advertisings into the televison are doing this to sell their products.
We're living in a capitalistic system, so everyone tries to get money.
It does not really matter, if they try to sell it to little childs or old people.
But it's not fair, that they're using manipulation in the television.
Its easier to manipulate the young children.
And they're abusing this.
They know, that the children will try everything to get the products in the television, and they know, that a lot of partens will not say "no" to the whishes of their children.
So they not only manipulate the children.
They also manipulate the parents of them.
They're right and wrong in my opinion.
Right, because they just want to make money and sell their products, but also wrong, because they use young children for that.
My older sister has three children, and I know how it is if they want something, they have seen in the television.
They're crying to get it, and its not easy to say no like with older children.
They also put children in their advertising, which are laughing and having fun.
So the children, who watched the advertising think, that they'll have a lot of fun, too.
But after four days, they're not playing with the toys anymore.
If someone would forbid this advertsings, it would not easy anymore for them so sell their products, but its better for the children and for the partens, who cant buy new products all the time.
They should forbid the advertisings in the channels, which are specially for children, like "Disney Channel" and "Cartoon Network".
But then, nobody would see the products and buy it.
And then, the channels would not make money anymore, because its the main source of money for them.
And if they dont have money anymore, they need to shut down the channel.
And I think, that the children would more cry if they can not watch cartoons , then for a toy.
I disagree with the statement.
The channels need the advertising and the children need the channels.
And the channels are the reason, why young children are muted.
So the parents need the channels, too.
Television advertising especially directed to young children is a very complicated topic.
First of all I would say it depends on the intention of the advertising.
The intention of advertising can be very different in many ways.
Some commercials are worked out to show the people, in this case children from two to five, the real quality of the product and just want to give you some ideas to buying stuff you could need.
Beside that there are many Commercials which are trying to manipulate you and have the intention to sell a cheap product for a high price.
This can be dangerous if children are involved.
Children in the aged of two to five cant think about that like grown up can.
They watch the commercial and want to buy it.
They can't decide whether the money for the product is woth or not.
After that the parents of the kids have to tell them that this is maybe just a typical plastic product which is not worth to buy.
And argument for the advertising directed to young children is that they learn how to figure out what they find interesting and which things are shown in the wrong light and are not worth buying them.
For them who will not think about that at this age it can be still dangerous because they will not detec whether someone tries to steal your money by selling you a shitty product which is not like they thought it would be.
Over all I can say that commercials directed to young children can sometimes be really nasty and it should be controlled that the commercials are free to watch for kids and dont try to manipulate their brains.
If the concers advertising their product correctly and just show the young viewers neutral the product to give an idea of buying it I personally would say that it's okay.
It just depends on how the commercial is made.
Nowadays it's normal that even very young children watch television quite often.
Of course if they want to see cartoons or something like that, but they also see quite a lot of advertising between the different movies.
Should it be forbidden to screen those advertising toward young children between the age of two and five years?
A positiv aspect of adverting is that you get more open-minded if you see whats going on all over the world.
The television companies screen adverting from a huge number of different countries which gives even young childrean an idea of life in other countries.
They get to know the diffrence between countries.
On the other side the advertising form a channel for children involves mainly toys and food which is especially produced for children.
Obviously when they see all that new kind of toy which seem to better than the toy they already have, they ask their partents to buy them a new one.
As we can imagine the parents aren't happy to get something new again, so they say no.
Consequently the children begin to scream and beg until the parents agree to go to the toysshop.
And that is exactely that, what the main aim of the advertising is.
As I said most of the advertising includes stuff for children but it's not unusal as well to screen aderverting which isn't directed toward young children but nevertheless they see it.
Nowadays there are quite a few unpleasant situations all over the world and children shouldn't be confronted with problems from all over the world.
As well as problems they shouldn't see adverting of cigarettes for example.
In my opinion it should be forbidden to direct telvision adverting  towards young children if it's a channel especially for children.
I think they will see enough advertising when they reach their teens.
Of course I understand that without advertising a television channel cant survive, but it isn't correct the direct it extra to young children who obviously can't estimate whats the aim of the advertising.
I don't agree with this sentence because I think it can be helpful for the young children to learn some manners or to learn a language better.
When the children listen to an English and German cartoon, they can learn two language at the same time and I think it's more easy to learn a language when you are young than when you grow up.
It could be that some catoons are not good for children because of the bad influences for example people who are rude to the others or it could be that children start to act bad and don't understand the moral of a story.
I think the parents have to look what their children watch on the television.
I think when the young children watch cartoons that show the young the world and how to behave good or when they learn new words and new things it would be a good thing.
But when they watch TV series for the old or cartoons with bad things then it's not good.
And something that are very important is that the parents shouldn't leave the children for a long time watching TV series.
A little bit is okay but when the children only watch TV and don't go out or don't do something else it is not good.
Children should learn to play with other children or learning new things like baking with the mother or do something else.
Most television advertisments have to do with dolls or other things, that direct to young children, mostly to children that are aged two to five.
Some say that these advertisment shouldn´t be allowed, because it has an big negative influence on the children.
But is it really that big of a deal or just some random thing, that will be forgotten in a few months?
These days children are watching more television than a few years ago and it isn´t a surprise that the parents try to find a programm that help their children learn and not to show them some advertisment.
Because the advertising toward children is a danger for them.
Most parents think that, the children get corrupted by these advertisments into thinking they need this stuff to be cool or trendy or beautiful, so they want the heavy advertising directed toward children to stop.
Most children, mostly the children aged two, don´t even know what is said in these advertisments and think because of that, that it´s right what they say about the product.
It gave many incedents were children just wanted some product, that had a good looking advertisment but a bad influence on the child itself and many others were children just bought things like makeup and nale polish, to look like the children that are shown in advertisments.
That is a huge risk for the children, because the don´t know how to use these things and might do something really risky for their health.
But on the other side are parents the ones who buy their children these stuff and it´s their child so they have to look after them.
If they don´t want the young children to do or buy those things they shouldn´t do it either.
Because some parents just buy the stuff their children want, they don´t figure out what of an influence it could have on the children.
It´s a parents duty to watch out for danger for their children and if they think, that advertisment is a danger they just have to stop their children watching television or stop them from buying products that are shown in advertisments.
It´s something the parents have to watch over and they also have the duty to educate their children, so that their children won´t even ask for things in the advertisments.
In the end not all television advertisments are wrong and bad for children and if there is one the parents and the child itself has to notice it and turn the television of.
All in all I think that the advertisments are a bit too directed to children, and that it should turn down a bit.
But I also think that the parents have to look after their children and they don´t have to buy stuff that has, in their eyes, a bad influence on their children.
I say that both sides have to watch it and that they both have to think about the children and not about selling risky things and and buying these risky things.
I disagree.
I think that television is not that bad for children even if they are just two years old.
Its good to get used to technologie as early as possible,because you will need it anyway in  the future.
Some aspect might be bad for children, for example Rtl with its stupid shows.
In my childhood television was a big part.
When I came home after Kindergarten or some years later from primary school, I always watched Pokemon, One Piece, Naruto or Yu-Gi-Oh.
Today i am 18 and I am still watching some of these series.
It is also nice to talk with your friends about series they watched and what they liked most.
These series and the advertising coming with did not hurt me.
I will do my Abitur next year, I never had bigger problems in school and I did not had a bad childhood.
Even while I was watching a lot of television, I was spending most of my time outside with friends.
We often played what we were watching in Tv, for example Pokemon Trainer or with Yu-Gi-Oh cards Duelist.
These experiences made my childhood better than it would have been without television.
I also think that it is difficult to keep children away from television if it wouldn´t be allowed for them.
All in all i would say that television wont hurt our children, if we, as parents, brothers or sisters are taking care what and how much they are watching.
I think we all know the sentence " Go outside ans play, the sun is shining."
Television advertising

Today we are discussing about:"If Television advertising should not be allowed directed toward young children.Is it goodwhen young children watch advertisings in the young age?
Or does that no matter?
I think that is an important point to discuss, because the advertisings can influence their mentions.
That can be bad in the future because think thatthis things are real and they going to be naiv.
That will have bad consequences, because of that the society will change in a bad direction.
On the other side, it helps to be more creative, because they see in the young age a lot of creative things in the advertise.
But they can also be creative outside, for example painting pictures om the street or build things in the sand.
I think it is better, when tehy are creative outside and not by watching televisoin.
I think, that in that age they are they should not have to much time in front of the TV.
It is better when they play outside with their parents or other young children in their age.
If they pass too much time in front of the TV, they lose to much time in their young age.
Advertising is very important for selling products.
Cars, hair shampoo, food und drink, shoes or holiday flights - all can be advertised.
A good marketing is the A and O.
But some television channels show advertises for very young people.
Is that correct?
Sometimes people think, there's too much advertising on TV.
Childs can see so much things they want to have.
But look at the age of them.
A three years-old child can't understand the world.
Sure, it's possible that a young girl sees - for example - advertising for a new Barbie product and want to have it.
But so young childs wouldn't go alone without the mother (or father) in a toy shop and they need money to buy it too.
So the parents decide what they buy their child and what not.
And advertising for such products is in special magazines or on the street too.
When the child isn't watching television, she looks over the shoulder of her father in a magazine.
You can't save your children from all types of advertising, that is impossible.
An another point is, that it's difficult to forbid such advertising.
It can be, that a ten years-old girl likes the same things that a five years-old likes.
So it isn't realistic, that television advertising for young children will be forbidden in the future.
There are tv channels like "KI.KA" who don't send advertising and this channel is for young children.
So I think that television advertising for young children should be allowed and I don't see a chance for people who think, it shouldn't be allowed, that they will have success one time.
Television advertising direceted toward young children has been a thing ever since television started to be a platform for advertising.
To see advertisement every day, as soon as we turn on our TV or computer is a very normal thing for us today.
Is it good, though, to be manipulated from the very start of life?
Advertisements are everywhere, as soon as we get out of our house or apartement, turn on the TV or the phone or reading the newspapers.
It's normal for our daily life to be confronted with pictures, logos and catchy phrases which are intended to make you want to buy a product.
One argument against the banning of television advertising directed toward young children is, that they will need to get used to it and be able to cope with it eventually.
Furthermore, it's good for their education if they can see the methods with which the companies use to make their advertisement good.
On the other hand, such a yound child can never extinguish truth or exaggaration and it cannot see how it's being manipulated.
I wouldn't want the kids of the future to get manipulated into wanting thing they don't necessarily need from the very start of their lives.
If you aren't aware of it and just see it without thinking about it, the media is manipulating you into wanting the newest iPhone, Body Lotion or Ice Cream.
That could be very bad for your wallet.
Also, it's very unhealthy to plant ideas in the heads of the kids, that happiness can be bought and that that's the only thing that matters.
Finally, the parents feel a pressure coming from those advertisements.
The spots tell them, how they can make their kidi happy with buying that one product, which is not true, obviously.
I agree to the statement that kids should be prevented of seeing the advertisement and think, that the kids should not get manipulated into an object of our economy.
They're sinply too young to know and understand whats happening and too naïve.
Generally in the 21st century, in this technological century, is a lot of advertisement on TV or on PC (or other devices).
The advertisement´s task is to motivate the consumer to buy the pruduct.
But not only mid- aged people see these advertisements, everybody can see them and can react different to them.
So for example an older woman could be motivated to buy the product, so the advertisement reaches the goal of it´s task, or she could ignore it.
But when an for axample a younger boy or girl watched the advertisements, they would´nt see these advertisements, they´d see something different because of their age, they would´nt understand the advertisements as we do.
For us an advertisement is just sometimes an annoying message from a store to buy some products in there, but smaller kids just see humans or fruits ( or any different products).
Smaller kids get "infected" with new behaviours they see on a screen.
Kids in generally are´nt resistent against behaviour- changing trends or advertisements like social media, you can see that the younger peaople are more respectless than the younger people from the generation of 2000.
So they reflect these new behaviours they learn on screen.
So it´s not only advertisments´ fault that they´re like that, but advertisements have a small percentage of these 100%.
Young people wont go out to play with friends like we´ve done, they sit inside and watch TV or You Tube ( or any other social media device).
They get confronted with it very strong.
I completely agree with the statement, the times have changed, new "trends" got injecteted in our community, maybe life changing ones.
It´s not only the advertisements fault, but it takes part of it.
In this essay we will research the statement "Televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed".
It gives different reasons for and conter this statement.
One of the main question is not, why shouldn't be allowed to show advertising, it is why are such young childern (aged two to five) allowed to sit in front of the televison?
In this age they should play with other childern their age in the garden and to have fun in the reality, not on the televison.
But when we know that it gives young childern which sit often in front of the television, then we should also speak about the sense and influence from the television advertising.
What think the childern about advertising?
Do they understand the advertising?
Are they really notice the advertising?
The parents should ask all these question themeselve.
I think it gives childern which watch televison only that they have something to do, not really for fun or maybe because the parents don't want to paly the whole time with their childern.
And then I think the childern don't notice or understand the advertising really.
They only want to look after picuters, listen to animals who speak and to music which sounds.
I think childern don't become influenced by televison advertising.
In my opinion I'm not whole agree with the statement because I think that childern in this young age shouldn' be in front of the televison and I also think that such young childern don't notice the advertising.
I think for older childern (aged six to twelve) the televison advertising should not be allowed, because they always want to have the toys which come in the advertising, but younger childern didn't notice this and because of that it dosen't matter if the advertising is allowed or not.
The topic that television adversiting directed toward young children between two and five should be allowed is a is hard to discuss.
On the on hand its not necessary for them to entertain and they could do lots of other things.
Another point is that there is no informatic point of television they can use because of their age.
On the other hand there arent any reasons why they should watch television at their age.
But the reason that anybody or in their position their parents should decide if they are allowed or not because there are some series that even a little child would like and learn from it even if its not as helpful to learn as other thing their parents could teach them.
The next argument is that that many young parents do both work in the morning or even in the afternoon so they arent able to take care of their child the hole day.
There they coukd use a babysitter but if they dont earn enough money to pay such a babysitter its way easier to keep the child happy.
In my opinion it should be allowed just because of the earlier named reasons.
The television advertising is focused on many different groups of persons for example old people, teenagers etc.
Commercials aged for two to five year old children are very profitable for the advertisers because the young children wanna buy it so they ask their parents if they can buy it.
The parents agree and buy it.
That wasn't the only commercial focused on young children so they will ask the parents again and again.
The advertiser receives a lot of money with that advertising strategy but for the parents it is very annoying and financially a hard task to manage.
For example a young boy wants to have a remote-controlled car that he saw in the commercial but the parents already bought eight other toys.
The parents won't buy any toys for this boy anymore because they think that he has enough toys he can play with.
The boy has another opinion.
The eight toys he already has aren't so good for him anymore because he wants something new.
He never had a remote-controlled car, he has never seen something like that before, he wants to test it wether it is fun to play or not.
It is not only looking very fun and interesting for him.
The problem is that the parents don't want to waste their money over and over again for their little son because they could invent it for somethimg different that is more needed than a toy.
A young child doesn´t understand something like that because he/she isn't confronted with financial problems.
When the young boy listens that he won't receive that remote-controlled car he will be unhappy and sad.
The parents doesn't know what to do, he is crying without a break.
They think the only way to stop the crying of the young son is to promise him that they will buy another toy that they are financially able ti buy.
The advertiser makes a lot money with that and the parents have to suffer from it.
Is that really fair?
I don't think so because it is obvious that a child will receive toys, for example in his birthday, New Year's Eve etc..
The commercials are making it more difficult for the parents to manage that.
At some point i think of young children and if Television advertising is allowed to them.
It is a very specific question.
I think that it is different.
Maybe they have to watch their own television.
So that they don´t have to watch some movies whitch are for children at the age of 12.
There must be some movies for kids in which they coulod learn something.
And not that they have to watch molvies in which words were said which they don´t have to hear.
But if you say that this isn´t allowed to young children from 2 to 5 they weren´t learn something from other kids.
Maybe television is important to young children because they can learn something and get comfortable for the school which includes 10 to 13 years.
Maybe you can do movies in which the kids learn to read or to think of interesting thinks which they never heard before.
But if you say that kids between 2 to 5 shouldn´t watch TV and it isn´t allowed they must play at their own and never learn something before going to school.
And if they don´t learn something by using the TV you have to look what you can do.
Maybe you must learn with them or they must play with other kids.
But if you do movies in which kids learn something, parents has freetime of them and can do what they want.
And the biggest point is that kids learn to think of something and if they were fit for school they didn´t have a big school probleme.
The Education of young people is very important for the world because the politics were in 20 years not on the top so young people must get fit and go on top.
Without television in our time kids wouldn´t be interested in politics or sports.
Television shows them how interesting the life could be and how interesting sports or politics can be.
Kids could learn whith TV what they like and what they want to be in 20 years.
I think TV should be allowed for young children between 2 to 5 because they should learn in what they are interested and in what not.
If you watch TV you can learn many by asking your parents or something else.
It´s a comlplicated question.
You have to look at the different shows, which are shown in the television.
On the one hand they are shows, who are very bad for young childrens like ''Teletubbies'' or something like that.
This interrepted the education for the young childrens.
This shows have bad follows for the kids.
That shouldn't be allowed for them.
But on the other hand they are shows to learn about different languages or about different cultures in the world.
When the parents show the kids something like that, the kids have a good start in the life for the school for example.
When they are looking bzw.
hearing music or playing games on the television, the concentration of the childrens could be better and so they are preperated for the future.
So you can give a easy answer to the question, if television advertising directed toward young children ( aged two to five ) should not be allowed.
When the parents show the kids learnvideos or music on the TV, there aren't any resaons to not allowed it.
But when the parents take the TV for shows, who have bad follows for the kids, it should not be allowed.
Or the other way have to cancel the TV programs, which make the bad shows.
Television is a general tool of modern society, but it might not be as beneficial to young viewers as it seems.
Escecially cirtain advertisments aimed specificly towards children and infants are a constant controversial topic.
Many parents and adults suggest that they should completely  be banned, in order to protect the savety of the younger generation.
But is this really a necessary procedure or might advertisments not be as dangerous as they are portrait to be ?
I  personally support those who are against advertisments directed towards young children.
Because in my opinoin, children have to learn how to develope an own opinion and those advertisments could be a threat, manipulating children with colorful pictures and loud voices.
Young kids are very likly to follow the lead of the people in their environment, viewing them as an athority and if people in television tell them to buy things and act cirtan ways, it might cause children to develope bad habbits, such as being to reliand on konsumism, always wanting the newes toys and best games.
But showing them those images from advertisments aimed towards them could also cause them to have low self-esteem because they dont look like the people on televisoin or they dont want to play with the dolls the kids in those advertisments play.
Children would grow up thinking that there is something wrong with them.
That they are differnt from others and by banning those advertisments, kids would be able to grow up in peace and without constantly worrying about fitting in.
Because I think that being yourself and accepting who you are is very important, especially at a young age, where you are already trying to find your place in society and by banning advertisments aimed towards children, they would have the oportunity to do so, without being manipulated by brands and markting tactics.
To conclude I think children would only benefit from the banning and their savety would be insured.
There is a lot of television advertising that runs on our TV all day.
The fascinating thing about these adverts is the fact that they manipulate us to buy a certain product.
And of course they also manipulate the young children because they are easy to influence and if a child has a wish many parents want to make it true.
But because it is so easy to manipulate young children one could say that it shouldn´t be allowed to do television advertising directed to these young children between an age of two and five.
In my opinion this kind of advertisings should be allowed.
Yes children are very easy to manipulate.
They don´t know the tricks of the marketing-companies and think everything they see on TV is true.
They could really get a wrong picture of the world and of life if they see these advertisings.
But this isn´t the fault of the advertisings.
It is their job to manipulate us so that we want this perfect life that is showm in this advert.
And we shall think that we can get this life if we buy these products.
I think it´s the responsibility of their parents not to let them think everything in the television advertisings is true.
If children see something fancy in the advertisings they want to have it and they are getting on their parents nerves until they buy it.
Children can have a very strong will and parents see theirselves forced by the advertisings to buy things the children want to have.
But again the parents are responsible.
They are the ones that buy things they have the money they make the final decision.
And if they don´t get manipulated by the television advertisings and they don´t want to buy things thier children want to have they don´t have to buy them.
That´s how easy it is.
And another thing that every parent should think about:doesn´t my child watch to much TV if it gets manipulated so bad by the advertising?
The only problem is that I know that there are parents that don´t mind if theire children watch TV all day and that they dont´t care or don´t know about the manipulation caused by the television advertisings.
This is sad and because of this I would like to change my opinion and say this kind of advertising shouldn`t be allowed to protect the poor children which have parents that don´t know how to protect their children by their own.
The question wether television avertising directed toward young children should not be allowed is a theme with a lot of different aspects.
First of all I think that the children are old enough to make this experience and to find out in which world we live.
The second aspect is that Children grow up in a world with a lot of social medias.
They live in a time where the internet and television is one of the most popular thing all over the world.
Secondly I think that television advertising would be a great adventure for the children and they can find out their straights.
They learn a lot of things they will need in life.
But on the other side I think that the children are too young for the television advertising.
It´s important for young children that they learn that the social media isn´t that important.
They might be play in the nature or they have to spend time with family.
So when they were confrontated in this young age with television advertising, it might be not that good for young children.
Moreover I think that the Children arn´t in the mood to say no or yes to television advertising.
So the parents usually decide wether their children have to take party in television advertising.
I come to the conclusion that the children shouldn´t be allowed to television advertising.
They are to young to make their own decisions and they have to play in nature.
They have to live their childhood.
This means to play games and not beeing a part of television advertising.
I agree to this statement, because I think that young children in this age shouldn't watch so much television, especially advertisements, anyway.
In some programs there are many advertisements, which aren't good for kids in this age e.g.
about alcohol and cigarettes.
Kids can't understand them and maybe get directed in the wrong direction, because they can't understand what is right and what is wrong in this age.
Some parents think it is good, when there childs see advertisements about toys, so they can choose what they want to have as their next present for some event or what movie to watch next.
Nevertheless I think it is better to go to a toy shop with his kid or just let the child imagine a toy, what you can maybe buy somethere.
Otherwise they get addicted to the television and may forget about their friends on the playground.
In our century almost the whole population is addicted to smartphones and television.
But we can't stop this, if we sat our young children in front of a telvision to have relax time from them annoying us.
In this way we support this huge problem.
Another problem is, that the kids fastly fall in love with all the toys and movies they might see in the advertisings, but many  parents can't afford everything or even one thing of them.
So the childs get sad very quickly.
Even worse is it, when the toy isn't so cool like it was described in the advertising, because it is often so, that things in television are described as the most perfect and best thing, that you really need and they leave out all the bad informations about it.
So to come to a conclusion I would say, that children with young age shouldn't watch television advertisings, because their dreams and thougts could get destroyed and they would get confused about all the other stuff, which is advertised between the kids stuff.
In the following, I will analyze wether Television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden or not.
In the past, this topic has often been discussed by politicans.
Firstly, it is important to ask yourself wether or not it really is a problem.
Because children in such a young age don't really question what they see.
They just want to be entertained by funny things, which is often not the case, when they see advertises for adults.
Does it really bother them, or is it just us, the older generation, that questions everything?
Do they really care?
But is this, the fact, that they don't really question what they see, not the biggest problem?
I mean, it is possible, that they, because they just accept the seen things, get influenced in a negative way.
Especially when they see idealized and very thin dolls, it may cause them to think that something may be wrong with them, because they just don't look like that.
On the other side: is there a better way to advertise toys for kids?
With that I mean, that I guess that it would just be kind of strange to look at grown people playing with plastic cars or dolls, wouldn't it?
Is it that bad, to make fitting advertises for the product that the companies want to sell?
Let's not forget about the things that children are tought by advertises.
We often see dolls in big castles, who only think about dressing up, who are maybe in a relationship with the different sex, in example Barbie and Ken.
And boys, whose interests are almost always just in cars or pirates or something, at least in the advertises.
Is this, the fact, that these things are the first things that children see when they turn on the TV, the reason why sexism is still that important, because children are thrown into groups, because they are tought to like the things that are ''normal'' for their gender?
Wouldn't it be nice to let children choose the toys that they want to play by themselves, without being influenced by the television?
In my opinion, I think that it could maybe make a big change, in a positive way, if advertising for young children would be forbidden.
But maybe that's not what we really need.
We need a change,that's for sure, to not teach children wrong ideals, but is this a reason to just forbid something?
I think that it would be better, to just think about better solutions, for example changing the advertises in such a way, that children are not badly influenced by it, as they did, for example, with 'Barbie', because they have introduced new body types.
This is why I think, that we need some kind of a revolution in the toy industries and their advertises, but I don't think, that forbidding something is the best solution for that kind of a problem.
In these days more and more young kids spend their freetime in front of a computer or television.
By doing this, they are often confronted with a lot of advertising for toys or other things for kinds in their ages.
But is in needed to broadcast ads for young children?
On one hand there is the argument that product for children should be placed in actions where kids are in, for example television.
Why shouldn't it be allowed to make ads for Kids when they are the customers?
It ist very simple: children are easy to infuence because they can not decide if they need this product or if the promises the ads do are possible ore just empty promises.
But by watching these advertisings children also learn how to deal with the given informations.
They learn not to trust everything they hear.
This is one step for growing up.
Further they learn slowly how to deal with money.
If there is a product, which they are totally in, they have to save their money for buying the product some day.
But sometimes this can go wrong.
kids who get too much money from their parents don't learn this quality.
They waste their money by buying the most (unnecessary) toys or other product just because  in the  adsvertising it seemed to be very cool.
In my opinion it is very diffficult to decide whether advertising in television for kids shouldn't be allowed or not.
On one  hand they learn in their early years how to deal with advertising promises and saving their money for things that are more needed.
On the other they are in a critical age where they easily get influenced by things in television and waste their money, because they can not handle the given information and promises.
So if I  had to decide, I wouldn't allowe ads for kids.
Advertisement - specially used in television - is sometimes really annoying.
When children are watching television and there are breaks for advertisement it could be really difficult for the parents to explain their children why they see these advertisement.
In the following essay I will name explain my opinion to the theses: Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
The first point for the theses is that children normally don't be watching any tv.
Children in the age of 2 to 5 should be playing with other children.
You can't really let these children watch something because even if you let them watch special children programm they can see things they dont are allowed to see.
And if they watch news which also can be shown on the children channel and see something about war it really can be traumatic.
The first point against the statement is the point that the children can watch to something even if they don't understand that is directed to them.
They will build up a connection to the tv and can understand the meaning of watching television.
It can really be helpful to watch to something between the original programm in what children also are connected.
To name an example: Sometimes television shows advertisement directed to children in which they show new pampers or  milk.
In this case the advertisent isn't only directed to the parents - it's also directed to the children.
The second point which is for the theses is that children don't understand what they see in television.
Television normally is directed to parents and aged people.
There are special channels for children in which advertisement is easier to understand.
But it doesn't allowed children to watch it because sometimes there are advertisement with sexual content which not is helpful for children.
An example is the German television channel super-rtl which normally shows special programms for children.
Soemtimes they also show advertisement which should not be shown to children.
To sum up all the aspects I can say that in my opinion advertisement directed to children (aged two to five) shouldn't be allowed - so I agree with the statement - because children shouldn't be watching tv in younger years.
It really can be shown something in which the content isn't that good as in other advertisement.
So let the children play and parents watch tv.
:)
Nowadays, advertisements can be hardly avoided: you see them everywhere, on the streets, in magazines, on websites and also television.
In the following text I will argue why television advertising toward young children from the age of two to five is or is not reasonable and whether it should be allowed or not.
It can't be argued that a lot of children watch TV, where they face a lot of advertisement targeted not only for, but also for them.
Children from the age of two to five have less control over themselves and aren't always reasonable, as can be seen by the many tantrums especially young children throw and the annoying shrieks they like to do when they don't get what they want.
Now imagine they see an advertisement on TV and are persuaded into thinking they desperately need that item, for example LEGO cubes.
This will result in tensions between them and their parents.
However, it should be made clear that not every child watches television - as I sincerely hope they have other and better things to do - and that I expect the parents, who have control and supervision over them, to control their television consume.
This way they can also control what series, movies, but also what advertisements they watch.
Then again the parents can't always be there for their children and watch over them 24/7, so the children are still at risk of being manipulated.
But even if they get "manipulated", these kids are not old enough to decide (yet) and don't have that much influence.
Some of them will perhaps insist on getting that Barbie doll, or whatever else they want, but the parents still have the authority and the children are obliged to listen to what they say.
I think it is still important to stress just how badly the children get influenced by all the advertisement, especially those directed at them, which makes them want bad and wrong things.
However, advertisement can also help the children to know what they really want out of the many things that are offered on the market.
Also, the same "manipulation" applies to basically every human being that has seen advertisement: the goal is always to manipulate the folks into buying stuff or otherwise spending money.
For example, teenage girls are offered "beauty tips" in expensive magazines, and "make-up" items that they really do not need.
Lastly, advertising is important as a sort of income for the people who advertise.
I conclude that advertising for young children should be allowed and is fine as it is.
Advertises.
Everyone, who watches tv sees them hundreds of times.
But should they not be allowed if they are directed toward childs at the age from 2 to 5?
I think, advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Kids at the age from 2 years to 5 years do not really have the understanding to realize, what the advertising shows.
Maybe children understand the advertising wrong or do not think about the advertised object.
For example, kids, who are watching tv without their parents see a toy, which they see completely different from it's usual meaning.
The kids fall for this and maybe this toy isn't even allwoed for kids this young.
On the other hand, children at this age are very manipulatable, so they get the advertising and fall for the advertised object.
They instantly want the object and do not even know, what it's meant for.
At this age, it's not really possible to realize, what is happening around the children.
They just see everything but don't think about the things they see.
If you show a little kid a teddybear and say, that they need this, they think that they really need this.
This is advertising in a smaller way.
The manipulation can be seen the other way too.
Kids, who are manipulated by advertises, have no own opinion anymore.
They are like zombies.
They need this toy.
Advertises in the tv are like a trap from the toy companies.
Children tumble into the trap and they are caged.
No way out until the parents buy this toy.
Mostly kids are sreaming and crying, when they arent happy.
As a dad, I couldn't stand this noise and would buy the toy.
Advertises for young childs are indirectly directed towards the parents.
No child would accept a no, if they want a toy.
They annoy their parents until they are happy.
I think there are other things in this age they are much more important for children.
In todays society there are much problems with the speaking, learning and having frinds.
I thing one reasons why in the society came up this problems is to much Television.
Children have to play with other children.
They have to play in the forrest, playground or somewhere else they find somothing to have fun.
But I think the importenest is to play with frinds and have conversations, connections and contact with other persons.
You suggest children what is important in life.
If a big part is Television they add this meaning.
But Television is something you do not need another persons.
There is no conversation, no connection or contact.
In the age of two to five it is important to learn from other, they add reactions, how to deal with others and how to live.
Television do not show the right way.
There are so much  uniteresting details.
But I thing you can not change the problems when you say Television is not allowed.
First think about an five years old children.
On his sixt birthday, what would you think  is the first thing the children want to do?
Yes, Television.
Something which is not allowed are much more interesting than others.
The following is that wanting the Television grow and grow whit every day the child are not allowed and others are allowed.
Another big problem are older sisters or brothers.
The conflicts between them will also grow up.
I think you can not say without Television there will be less problems.
You have to think about wich role television should play in your childrens life.
Parents who do not care about this would find other things wich could make problems in the life of they childrens.
It is a different question but I think it should be allowed but less than it is used now adays.
Television advertising directed towards young children could have some advantages but also disadvantages.
At the age from two to five, children have to learn new things and start being prepared for their following life, like school.
On the one hand television can help to lern new words or something about life.
On the other hand the childrem can also learn these things from the real world.
In this period of their lifes they experience a lot of things in the nature, with their partents or children who are their age.
Go to different places and see new things in the world can help to grow up in a better way.
If the weather for example isn't good and the children haven't got the chance to go outside and make experiences there, they can also do something else than watch the television.
Their parents can read out books for them, the children can play with different types of things like little cars or dolls.
To play with the parents, other family members or kids their age is important for the future.
Children will learn to interact with other people, share things with them and how good it feels to have people around you and not being alone.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward yound children should be allowed, because in general it isn't completely bad for them.
But i think parents should create better days for their children and do things like i talked about before.
If they sometimes let their children watch the television, thats totally okay, but it should not be the whole day.
Sometimes the parents have to focus on other things like clean the house or do something for work, in my opinion it's okay if the children watch tv.
Of course it's better if they will play with some real things but sometimes they don't even want than.
To conclude i would say that the Television for young children isn't the best, but it isn't the worst either.
Should childern under 5 years watch television?
For ansering this question I will name a few ponit´s for and against this these.
Everybody know that nowadays nearly ervery child belongs to whatch television.
But is it better for them to begin with exercising for learn reading?
It´s very imtortant for children to go out and play games outside, especially in summer.
It improofs the motoric of a child.
Lot´s of people say it´s not good for children in this age to watch television.
But this meaning must spilt up in two sides.
On the one hand, there are much programms on tv that children shouldn´t look, but there are also series like "Dora" and so on who improof, in this example, the english skills from a such young child by learnings things with a playing background.
But even a child under 5 years shouldn´t watch the whole day stuff like that.
It would be too much time spend on the television.
But what is the anser now to the statemant, if children at the age of 2 up to 5 years should be allowed to watch television or not ?
I not agree with this statement but neither disagree with it.
In my opinion children shouldn´t spend their whole time at the tv, but there are some series whtich are good for a child so there must be a difference between watching tv, and watching tv with a usefull background.
Watching tv could be forbidden, but watching tv with a usefull background is good for the child and should be allowed.
With the time, more and more advertising has been showed in the television.
Today, almost every family has a television at home.
More and more parents let their kids watch television up to several hours a day.
It is easy for the parents to let their kids watch television so that they have some time off.
But the kids can get addicted to it.
In this time when there is shown so much advertising, the advertisers know that there are also many kids watching television, so they try to make advertises towards them.
The kids belive what they saw in the television and they then want their parents to buy the product in the advertise.
The people who make the advertises know that the kids will show this behaviour, so they use it to make money.
The products in the advertises directed toward young children are often toys which they will like because they claim that it would do something special.
But kids in that age are not able to see a difference between things they need and things they do not need.
The parents have to decide what is good for their children but the kids will not stop asking for this toy, so when the parents are not a bit strict in that they will waist a lot of money for unuseful things.
But it is also up to the parents if they let their children watch much television or if there is a limit for them.
They could for example let their kids watch just a series and when it is finished and advertises are shown they can turn it off.
However, it is not possible that the kids will not see any advertises.
I think it should not be allowed to make television advertising directed toward young children because they belive everything they see, so the producers of the advertises just use it to make more money.
But it is also up to the parents if they let their young children see televison.
1.
Ofthen after television shows for kids there are special advertis towards young kids.
But should that be allowed?
I think it should be allowed.
There are many comapanys for products for children and they need to advertis their product so they can sell it better.
After televison shows for children, where many children are sitting in front of the television, its the best timing to do so.
So they must use their chance to earn money.
Eventhough children cant really think clearly about the advertising and you could see this as obuse, because they cant really complain.
But I think they also want to see those adervertis because it is about products they like.
So they must talk with their parents to "understand" this system.Children want their toys and you dont see many advertis for children anywhere else then in the televison after special television shows.
The advertising system is everywhere and children must be confrontet early with this system, so they could learn more about it.
If they didnt see any advertis before they become 5 they might buy just everthing they see in advertis, because they dont learn more about the system.
Parents might have problems with specific advertising, because their child wants everything they see after their favourite televison show, but they have the control over their child and they must teach him/her how to live with those advertis.
Maby you could see it as a problem, that children want to buy everthing they see and they dont really think about it, but if they werent confronted early ist will become a problem later on in their lives.
I think adverftising towards young children is exepteble, because they nned to be confronted with this system and they must understand how the world "works" and it ist teh exercise of their parents to teach them m ore about it.
The parents need to teach them how to live with zhe advertising sytem.
I agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because on the one hand the brains of young children are not as developed as the brains of teenagers or older people.
Young children are very sensible for new things and when they watch these advertisments they think they must own these things, presented in advertisments, so they want their parents to buy all that much unnesessary stuff like plastic toys.
Another reason, why television advertising shouldn't be allowed for young children is, that they are hanging arround in front of the tv the whole day.
The children could learn bad things from the advertisments instead of playing outside with their friends.
Friends are better for thier social development than the tv.
But on the other hand it is a good method for the companies, which produses the toys, to earn money, because many parents buy new things, when young children told them to buy it.
With the new money the companies could invent new toys for the children, perhaps better toys.
It is also good for the economy when companies earn more money, so they could expand and unemployed people could find work.
My opinion is, that television advertising shouldn't be allowed becouse it is not good for th
I agree with this statement because I think they shouldn't be allowed.
But I think it's difficult to built a meaning to this theme because most of the people don't have real memories to the age between two and five, and therefore one can't decide quickly and easily how the reaction of young children towards this form of television advertising is.
First of all, such young children don't really judge about what is good and useful for them, and what is bad and not useful for them.
But according to the normal television advertisings, they'll think they have to get these stuff that seems great and good to them.
But sometimes, they're wrong.
Of course, it are the parents who decide to buy or don't buy the advertisements, but the television advertisings are directed towards the children, and not the parents.
Another remark is, that these children can easily be influenced, and some of the advertisements are a way too bad for that they should influence the children.
Additionally, the children who want one item that they have seen on television, and are seeing it in reality (in the supermarket etc.)
they are influencing the parents by their target to buy stuff.
Of course, this isn't generally a bad thing, but it can be a bad thing if the item isn't as good as it seems.
And if parents do not want to buy this item, it's probable that the younger children are starting to cry.
And this would be annoying for everyone.
But there are also points that are pro-allowing these forms of advertisements.
For example, there are many children which don't often watch TV, and therefore it wouldn't have much need to change the situation and prohibit the television advertising which are directed toward young children.
But just because some don't consume television (advertisings), it doesn't mean that this me gets irrelevant, because there are many children who do this.
There is a tv in every normal family today.
Because of this, everybody knows the problem that young children want to watch something on it but their parents don't agree.
But is it right that children aren't allowed to watch something on tv?
Is it a good idea to forbid this for children in the age of two to five?
First, we have to think of the great knowledge that these young children could get from watching interesting documetarys.
Parents often think that everything what their children are watching on tv is bad.
But thats not right because there are many good series for little children which prepare them for their life.
Of course the parents must have a look for the tv when their children watching something.
It is right that there is very much bullshit too.
And it's important that little children don't watch some bad scenes because it could make them ill. An another important fact is that children shouldn't watch tv for too long time otherwise they don't want to play outside anymore or something else.
But it's okay if the ý watch daily for one lesson and than their parents have time to relax.
But today, there are too many young children in front of a tv everyday for a too long time.
This is not even healthy anymore and they loose their connection to the real life.
That's a big problem for many familys in our century because their childs life very unhealthy.
I think parents should allowe their childs to watch tv but it must be under control.
The new televisions also have a timer that parents can chose how long their children are allowed to whatch.
Children are said to be sitting more and more in front of the Television, even at very young age.
This does not have to be bad as there are channels especially for children, offering funny as well as pedagogical programmes.
However, should it be allowed to direct TV advertising toward our youngest generation?
"Of course", you may say beause they have to learn how to deal with it.
There is a huge amount of advertising in the adults' life as well.
Wherever you go, you will find some.
In addition to that, researches have shown, that children are "immune" to advertising, if they grow up with it.
They automatically seem to learn to separate the relevant information from the irrelevant.
On the other hand, there will be an impovement of advertising techniques, which then will fit perfectly to the new generation.
The children are going to grow up and lose their immunity as new trends and new technologies are going to change their behaviour and the kind of advertising they like.
To add another point, children should grow up without being terrorised by advertising, especially if it comes from the TV.
At the age of two to five, they are still learning a lot of central aspects in our society, for example what is important or not.
I do not think that advertising belongs to the important ones and therefore it should be avoided.
To sum up, I do totally agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward children aged two to five should not be allowed.
Not only it interrupts their development and confuses them but also they soon will be victims of the advertising, as well as adults are right now.
"Should´nt television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
First of all we have to clearify which children is meant in the question, children in the age from two to five, so really young children, nearly babys.
we all know what our parents said to us in the older days: "don´t watch too much Tv it´ll damage your eyes" We all know that at some point watching too much tv isn´t good for anybody, it doesn`t matter which age.
In the age of two, little kids learn so much like speaking, eating, walking and it`s an really importend phase in their lives.
Watching tv sure is good to learn some words or to be entertainend but the little kids need someone who is actually teaching them important things for their life like their mum or dad.
If their mum and dad work the whole time and just let you sit in front of the tv then you can get wrong information.
For example the teletubbies, they all had a bit of an language mistake and soon some kids would talk like that because they didn`t know how to speak right.
Also some information which are shown in the tv are wrong because the producer think it`s for little kids and they don`t really care about the content.
Also little kids can get addicted to the tv or their favorite tv show and that isn`t good it is sure better for a children to play outside with other kids their age at the playground or just at home or just even play with their siblings.
Because when a kid watches tv the whole time it isn`t outside because the tv probably is in the livingroom or some room inside the house and so they don`t really go out the whole day.
Of cours watching tv for a children at  five to eight for half an hour is absolutely fine.
It always depends how the parents act with their kids watching tv.
Some people strictly don`t allow their kids to watch tv and then others let them watch nearly the whole day but there are some parents that say only half an hour.
The problem with not allowing your kids to watch tv is, the kids will do it anyway whether it`s behind their back, at grandmas house or at a friends house.
So in my opinion it depends on the age and the time how long it`s allowed to look.
As I said, if the kid`s only two it needs his mother to be there for him and talk to him when he learns the first things or takes the first steps.
But if the kid is like 5 or something then it begins to make it`s own decision and is more independend then a kid with the age 2.
It`s also depends what the kid is watching if it watches some entertaining or learful tv show which is especially for kids and wherer they can learn someting or have to think aswell then it`s absolutely fine.
But if it watches something their parents would watch like a sitcom or a movie or a horror movie then it can get horrofied and not get the pictures out of their head.
It all depends of the way how you specify this question and for example which age the kid specifily has and which sort of tv you mean.
This is a good statement in my eyes.
On the one hand it has many parents how just put their children in front of the television because they say a television advertising and found this good.
Probably they find that at the age between two and five the children learn quick and should learn many things.
A television is good, because the children then are quiet or they haven't so much time to look every single moment to the kids so it is a good opportunity to "put" the kids away.
In the advertising sais that the children learn and they think, this is a good way.
On the other hand this is not good.
Children is this ages have to experiment on their own in the nature.
This people find that television advertising should be not allowed.
In the advertising mostly cames that this is good for the child and it looks so good.
Advertising are short and you don't see the result.
The companis, wich make advertising just make this without thinking how this children grows with this influence.
That the children doesn't can touch the things on the screen they don't realise.
In this part of the age this is one of the most importantes things ever.
I think that it can be allowed but it is not good for the children and the parents.
When you have a child in this ages it is funny to go outside and play with your children.
See how it grows and see how the real world looks like.
In this ages it is important that they experiment, make mistakes and be happy.
Tlevision advertising are allowed but not so good.
One of the main arguments that advertising should be allowed to be directed at children aged two to five is that advertising helps selling the products.
Children are easy to influence and the parents listen to their children so that they buy the product the small boy or girl wishes for.
It is very easy for a company to sell their products to children when they advertise it correctly so it is easier for them to keep the head above the water and stand out against the other companies.
Another argument for advertising is that advertising can give new birthday present ideas for children.
For example Hans is a two year old girl that doesen´t know what to wish for his birthday so he turns the TV on and boom there he has an idea and he runs to his parents but they say that this is too expensive.
Hans is sad and cries the whole day so advertising isn´t good for the children.
It isn´t good because the children can´t decide what they are influenced by so that they want something that they don´t really need to have.
For example Hans got the toy he wished for his birthday but he just played once with it because it isn´t like he wished it to be.
So the money for the toy was wasted and Hans is said again.
Poor Hans.
Another argument against advertising and the most important one is that young chldren don´t have an own oppinion so they are very easy to be influenced by the companies that want to sell their products so thery don´t respect the children and abuse them.
In the end you can say that advertising toward young children should be forbidden because the children don´t have an own oppinion and can´t decide what they want to buy they just want the newest and best toy they saw on TV and the parents need to waste their money but the children are still unhappy.
So i agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Televison advertising is a very excited theme, espacially the one directing toward to very young children, in age of two to five.
That's the reason why I want to answer if televisison advertising shouldn't be allowed for young children?
In my view advertising is a way to manipulate somebody or to informate somebody about a product.
And i think it's more a manipulation than an information.
It isn't my opinion, but advertisings really could be dangerouse for the children and although it is a manipulation of a child's thinking there are more reasons for the television advertings.
I agree if somebody said, it should stay allowed because some of the factories producing toys have to do this beacause they should survive in the buisiness.
And maybe it isn't nessasary to say it shouldn't be allowed because it isn't intresting for the children.
The adversitings are more for their parents, their are more the adresse of this kind of advertising.
Maybe the parents are going to have crying children they really wanted to have the toy, the child in the telivision have.
And if you want to answer the main question, you should have a look at the problemes of the publizity.
And i think that's not a big problem, because it's the buisiness and all toy-factories have to have the chance to make television advertising like any other buisiness.
All in all i'll say that television advertising toward young children should stay allowed because i don't see any problemes for the children although they were manipulated by the advetising factory, but the main adresse of this are the parents and they really should know what is something good or what is something bad for their children.
The statement ´Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed` is an interesting one.
I`m not realy sure if I understand it right so in the following text I writte about some other version of this statement.
You can find some arguments which agrees with statement, but also some they don´t agree with it.
Nowertimes children all ages use more televison and other electronic stuffs.
They use theire time not like the generation befor with playing outside and meet frinds or playing with their toys at home.
You can see that the modern generation and specially yound childern lose their creativ ideas.
The televison could be one factor for this losing.
Of cours the televison has some good points like showing kids new things and some thing like that.
You can see that young children are happy when they allowed to see something an televison, but this happienis can also be a kind of something you must do because this is what you learned and something you´ve done your whole life.
It´s importent for young children to learnd from the real life, because most of the time they can not decide if that what they see in televison is real or something that only exist in a fantasy world.
So I think that televioson in general should not be allowed for young children or only in some short times, because it could make stupid and gives them a wrong picture from the world.
I also think that it gives some activitis which make more fun than sitting in room and look to an elecrtonical box.
When the children are in the age like six years, they can chose by themself, what they would do and what could be good for them, so they can look something at the televison or something like that.
In my followig essay which is based on the question: "Do I agree or disagree if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed?"
I'm going to present my answer.
First of all young children in the age of two to five are living in a life time where they should play outside and get any positive influence which they're able to.
It's import to learn how to write, to speak in conversations with other people or to handle situations.
If young children are watching too much television they are going to compare the irreal and the real world.
Every story or character skill is going to be the one that the children want to have.
Growing up with too many telvision devices is not a helpful education to get in the next lifechepter ( getting into school) especially because of the fighting scences, dangerous situations and the way how the actors talk to each other in TV shows.
Most of the children aged two to five are staying in the kindergarden.
Children are trying to live just like the characters in soaps, in games or in movies.
They try to life, talk and act like them even if they jump out of a window.
The young life chapter is really important to get life skills which are based on the following chepters.
Parents and siblings should think about how their child or sibling should grow up.
At the end parents have the power to controll the childrenhood.
English essay

I think for that statement is the question: "Is it dangerous for childern to watch TV?"
very importent.
Im not quite sure about the answer, but i heard, that it was never prouved that watching TV is dangerous for anyone.
So thats an argument against the statement.
But I think for children at that age it is importent to go outside and play some games and talk to other kids.
In this age kids learn so many things form the olther people, e.g.
speaking.
So the contact to the nature and other humans is very importent and I think when children are used to watch TV the hole day, they lose that contact.
So that's an argument for the statement.
When we're talking about learn how to speak, it's also important to say that sometimes the parents can't speake the languge they speak in that country where they are living.
So the TV can be very helpful to learn things.
And sometimes the TV has like TV-showes for children to leran specific things.
So thats a good thing about watching TV in that age.
So my opinion is that it's ok to watch Television.
I Think it should'nt be not allowed, because I think each parent should can think about that "problem" on their own.
And as long as kids won't be addicted to the TV is it totaly ok to watch their shows.
in the following statement about " Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" i want to present my personal opinion about that.
If young children watch tv they were always influeced by the advertising at every channel.
Some advertising are directed for adults and some are directetd toward young children.
The ones that are just for kids can be manupulated so that the kids make a wish about the things they have seen.
Especially when its time for christmas the advertising are full of presents for children.
So when they watch this they usually want to have these things.
But they cant get everything they want.
so when they are not getting the things they want they can feel a bit uncomfortabel and be sad.
Otherwise they have to learn, that they cant get everything in life you want have and you have to work hard for things to get them.
often the advertising show things parents do not want to that their kids see this.
But when they have such a big problem with that, they have to forbit the children to watch tv because advertisning is at every channel und you have to accept this when you want to watch television.
To put it in a nutshell i would say, that its not possible to forbit advertising directed toward young children.
Advertising take a big place in our social life and we are always influenced by it.
When you want to watch tv you get advertising und you could not do anythings against that.
if you as parents do not want that your child watch advertising you have to  buy them blue-rays, because that is the only possibility to get a distance between the kids and advertising.
First of all, we live in a free country, where freedom of speech and opinion is worshipped.
If we cut back on what ads are allowed to be shown on television, we hurt that liberty.
A television channel should be entitled to show any content they want, including their breaks filled with advertisements, as long as they aren't offensive or hurtful (for example racist or sexist).
Additionally, nobody is being forced to buy the products advertised in these ads.
It's just trying to sell something to you by convincing you why this product is so awesome or why you desperately have to have it.
However it doesn't actively steal your wallet, slowly take out the cash and buys certain product.
It just tries to make you do named move through carefully formulated speeches.
Also, why should specifically little kids not be allowed to see ads?
If you don't want your toddler to participate in the real, money-ruled world, you may not let him watch television.
Kids usually do not have any money of their own to buy all the unnecessary stuff advertised on television, so how can kit really be a danger to them?
They would first have to convince their parents to buy these things for them, which requires quite some debating skills and I'm sure no two year old has.
Although it's the parents that should be in control about their child's television consumption, advertisement breaks help to limit the time spent infront of the screen, because they make up some time in which the kid can for example get ready for bed.
The parents could also use these breaks to control how long their toddler watches.
If there's a break every twenty minutes, they know when the first ad comes on that it's time for the kid to get off of media.
There's also a lot of ad breaks on news channels, and what grown up wants to see an ad for princess sugar plums pink tutu barbie doll every fifteen minutes?
If you absolutely have to fill gaps with advertises, at least make them useful for the audience.
However, these are children from two to five years of age.
They deserve to live in their fairytale world and shouldn't be spammed with our money-driven societies advertisements for more and more and even more legos, when they're just trying to enjoy harmless toddler series like Bob the Builder and Dore the Explorer.
Let them breathe, give these kids a rest.
Summing my points up, I understand why one wouldn't want their kids to see certain ads and things on TV.
Nevertheless, we should be allowed to show ads for barbie dolls and playmobils.
I mean that's how I used to get my inspiration for my chriatmas and birthda wishlist.
We also shouldn't give to many influence that the parents are supposed to have out of hand.
They take up the responsibility for their child and if they can't take them seeing those ads they should consider not letting their kid watch so much TV.
If children (aged two to five) should watch television is a question witch is hard to answer, cause every child is different.
Television could change your child, but it also can not.
Many parents say, if their sons watch to much war films ore films where aggresivite plays a big roll, there will become the same when they´ve grown up.
I think they don´t have to.
A child who´s watching aggresive movies can also be the most relaxed kid in the universe, because it lets his "dark side" in the television, so he can be fully relaxed in normal life.
On the other side, young children often can´t really make conclusion wich is reallity and which isn´t.
So theire can thing that it´s normal to shoot whitch gun´s in normal life and they can get in to criminality.
Often the parents do not have so much time for their you children so they put them in front of the television, that the television is doing the nani.
That´s a completely wrong way to solv this problem, bacause a television can´t teach a child how life is giong on, because often TV don´t show how the real life is going on.
Children who are aged two to five should discover what life can be and not how life can be manipulated.
A better way is to interact which the children, instant putting them infroint of the TV.
Television can also change their language and how they´re speaking.
Often small children watch cartoons and don´t understand if it´s real so their can thing like Teletubbis, that their got a TV in their stoomach and try to find it witch a knife.
Small Children really should not watch too often television, but if it´s only a few times a week, that´ll be ok. On this way they can learn wich is reallity and which isn´t, so they don´t think that it´s normal to use gun´s ore other aggresive thing, in real life.

I agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Young children aren't interested in advertising.
They don't care about things like that, they are happy with what they have and that they could play with it.
Advertising would only change their interests into bad and made them unhappier.
Mabey they are confused because they couldn't understand the advertise.
When the advertise makes the children confused, it isn't good for the company either.
They try to sell their products, but when children couldn't understand their advertise, they will not play with things like this.
But when the advertisment is easy to understand and the children like it, it is kind of good for the company.
Young children only see thinks and thing "I want to have this!"
Now, they try to make their parents buy this.
For some products, they may win and the company becomes more money.
But that's the only reason I see, to show young children adverstising on television.
Advertising could influence young children very easy.
That is good for the companys and the industrie, nor for the children and the parents.
And there is also the moral question, if you can use children for industrial movements.
I thing, that isn't okay.
For the children it's better to have their childtime free from television, mobile phones, social media and marketing strategies.
But in this time, it's kind of unrealistic to live without television and so one.
So it should ce clear, that the children are safe to.
I don't want my child to be influenced by things for adults, like avertising and stuff.
Early and long enough, they must life with that.
Can't they live their first years free from klischees, predjudees and stereotyes?
Can't they get older without influence by marketing strategiers?
I hope, that my child can.
Media espcesially television is a huge part in our society.
The contant and advertisement have a great impact on our daily lifes.
If young childreen toke part in the system of advertisment the economy would gain a new part on the market and grow.
Childreen are easy to maipulate in terms of consuming.
They get less in touch with self earned money and thats why they are more willing to spend.
But this inluence could confuse the childreen and could guiden them to decisions they would never made without the inention of a television advertising.
Televion advertisment is a common thing and it is needed to keep the economy in a flow.
The childreen have the opportunity to experience new things such as toys or playgrounds just by enerting the created world of fairy or a dragon.
Even if the ad is made to gain new costumers sometimes they furfill a dream or help childreen in their life.
For instance a platform for games in the internet can help the childreen to grow up with more experience and knowledge.
At the other hand the ads are a possiple danger for parents as they have to pay for the growing dreams of their cildreen.
It costs a lot of money to furfill the basic needs of a child, but a child that is desperated to own a toy or the newest clothes is not easy to handle in financial terms.
All in all the ads for young childreen can open up new opportunities but also can have a huge impact on the childhood and most of the time a maipulative and band one.
Thats why I think tlevision ads should not be allowed.
Moreover the parents should decide
The world is full of influences coming from magazines, TV or the people around you.
For many it is difficult to cope with those influences, so should young children of the ages two to five be exposed to that kind of influence through advertising on television?
This will be discussed in the following.
Some might say, every advertisement, as long as it is not offensive in any way, should be allowed to be shown on TV.
Companies which produce products made for young children should have the rights to advertise these products like any other company with any other product.
Only because it is directed toward a specific group of people, it should not result in a worse standing when it comes to selling.
Furthermore, if parents do not want their young children to watch certain advertisements, they should not let them watch TV shows with a lot of advertising or turn the TV of, in the breaks.
However children in especially that age group are starting to develop their character and their interests.
They should be able to do that without being influenced by advertisements what to like or not to like and what to do or not to do.
Because of them developing a lot in that time, they are easy to influence, as they are looking for someone to tell them what to do.
Even at that age, they want to fit in and be liked so they try to imitate people who seem to be popular and happy.
Advertisement could take them the chance of really developing who they are.
That state should not be used for advertising, selling products and ultimatly just making money.
All in all, I believe that children aged two to five are in a crucial stage of their own development which should not be sabotaged by advertisements or used to make money.
Televison advertising should not influence these children in any way and should not be allowed to higher the chances of a good upbringing and development.
Since the technology raised so fast nearly ever child is able to use an smartphone, computer or the television in 2017.
These are types of getting the children out of their rooms from playing or learning.
But children don't unterstand everytime everything in the television or the computers.
The problem with this early relation between children and technology is that they get wrong or unrealistic ways of acting.
An example for this unrealistic way of acting is a TV-show which shows kids that the acting toys or animals can talk or do stuff just like humans are doing.
These types of TV-shows make them think in a unrealistic and even stupid way.
Also these animals which can talk or living like humans live doesn't have any realiton to the reality.
But why parents still allow their kids to watch this kind of unrealistic TV-shows or catoons?
The answer is simple because it is one of the easiest ways of making a kid stop crying.
Mostly the kids in 2017 are used to the technology and are bored by playing with some toys or reading a book if possible.
Therefore let them sit in front of the television is a way of making them stop crying and also a good think for the parents because they have some time to relax.
Therefore it is an advantage for both sides.
But do the parents recognize that the technology isn't good for their children?
This way of showing them the new world of playing around or learning by the TV-shows or cvartoons led to high damage.
These kids aged between two to five years are in the era of learning so fast and getting everything with.
It is important that they are learning realisitc stuff and don't just focus on the animation in the TV which leds to a damage because they aren't used to the screens so that they hurt their eyes by watching the screen too long or getting headache because of the fast moving and colorfull images.
Not just in pyschologic way but also in physiologic way they could get a damage.In the ages from two to five they have to learn much more informative stuff as TV-shows or cartoons.
But some of the TV-shows nowadays are about to teach the kids and let them learn new things.
To sum it up children aged from two to five shouldn't waste their time in front of a big screen which isn't good for their eyes and their brain after a time but should go out and play around and learn things which are more realistic.
They should do whatever they want.
I don't care.
But I do not think that it is good to influence little children throw multimedia.Parents should look after their children and protect them.
They should not let their children watch television all the day.
Firstly, it isn't that good for children to see advertisment because if they see a toy or viedo games which doesn't belong to them they probably want this item and if the parent don't  buy it for them they might feel incomplete and got a empty space in their hearts.
In the psychologic aspect we would consider this as a negative relation between parenting character and the children because the child builds negative emotions against his parents for the reason they couldn't fullfill his wishes.
Secondly, advertising is very chatchy.
So as young children get caught really fast it is hard to get them out of the vicious circle.
I mean to say if a advertisment stands for what it stands then it has the job to cover the audience.
And for the reason above children shouldn't be part of the audience.
But on the other hand children have the option to take own dicisions- For example if there where a lot of barbie dolls the girl or, in some weird cases, the boy has to choose which she/he wants to have.
In my opinion it's a matter of parenting because some parents just want the kids to love them and they forget what is best for child and vice versa.
So I would obiviously let my child watch advertising videos because choosing between options is something important in life.
Maybe the child chooses the option to skip the add.
And it is also important which advertisment should be banned or not.
I mean advertisment to park or for some rollercoasters are completely fine but it comes to toy and things like that I might get a bit suspicious.
Today nearly every child has the opportunity to watch TV.
In this case there meight be the question, if television adversing directed toward young children should not be allowed.
In the modern world we are living in, it is really important to know how to use modern medias.
Thus parents agree with their children sitting in front of the TV the hole day.
What they don't think about is the influence, television advertising do to their little babys.
This probleme is not just about television advertising, the much bigger probleme are the modern medias themselves.
In my opinion, young children(aged two to five) should rather spend their time in the forrest instead in front of a scream.
They learn much more while spending time with their friends, than playing any stupid computer game.
Moreover I think, everybody should have the possibility to do what he or she wants to do and a television is mostly more interesting to a child than a garden.
My little sister is eight years old and she owns an IPad since she is six.
I never saw her spending time in front of our TV, because she prefers the IPad.
That's why in my opinion the question if television advising should not be allowed is today not important.
The young children of today don't use a television, so what does it matter,if there is television advertising or not?
All in all, I think it is much more important to think about the education of young children and how to improve their lives instead of talking about such unneccesary things like television advertising.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
There are many arguments that agree and disagree with  this statement.
The advantages of  that are that the Television could show wrong information sometimes.
The children maybe never wont get the right information  because no one is telling them right and the small children believe  in that.
Another point is that the children will be  sitting in the house and watch Television all day long if they are allowed to it.
Many children don´t go outside and play there if they can watch television.
They learn that it is a nice action for their freetime.
This wont be good for their future.
Many children would watching television in their future and wont go outside and do  sports.
This fact concerns that watching television all day long wouldnt be good for their healthyness.
This is a reason why some children are getting fat which is quite unhealthy.
Also the contact to other people especially children could get lost if they are watching TV and  don´t go and play outside.
These arguments are all because children wouldn´t find an end of watching TV if they are allowed to it.
On the other hand the children could learn something when they are watching television.
There are many series also for young  children where they can  learn things like colors or the alphabet.
In the modern society it is also important that the people can handle new and modern technologies.
Especially for their future it is important that can handle it because it get more and more important in many  jobs.
So it could also be a advantage if they grow up with it.
In my opinion children should beallowed to watch television but they should new their borders.
It´s important that they have the skills to handle  modern technologies but thex should go outside
In my opinion should television advertising not be allowed to young children, because kids in the age of two to five can not diside and handle stuff like that.
I could not answer more, because i do not know what television advertising is.
So Ican not agree or disagree.
Maybe childrens love it or hate it or they be to young to know what it is.
if that is the case parents should diside what is good for their kid
The question is: " Are Televersion advertising should be allowed toward young children"?
In the following I am going to explain my opinion about this topic.
Children programms are in general good and important for kids in the age of two to five years, but in my mind advertising are not a good idea.
Everybody knows that problem: You watch a movie and a part of this is very good and then a advertising cut this moment.
But Yes, advertising is in a way good and present marks of communities.
In the supermarket it can be helpful and the person knows the product that he/she buys.
The person knows the price and the function and has an exactly picture in his/her head.
Advertising is a good way to relax and to be happy about the last part of the movie.
But the movies or series of children are not very long and advertising is not a good method.
Advertising let things or food in a better light and children want to have nearly everything.
Parents should be able to make an diccision for their kids.
"Is this food/thing good or not good for my children"?
That is the important question.
In germany we say "Advertising make dump" and i have got the same opinion.
In my mind advertising is a good way to present something, but children at the age of two to five are too young.
Children programms should be good for they, the kids have to learn something and advertsing have to make a good break to the reality.
Today, we are living in a digital century.
You can find a TV in almost every house.
So, television advertising should be allowed to young children?
I say principially yes!
It is always a question of the programme in the TV.
Not every documentation is age-specified.
A good example for this are series like "The Big Bang Theory" or "How I met your Mother".
For young children, there are other series with are much more better, like the "Sandmännchen" every evening on KIKA.
When I was young, I could only watch this one TV-show every day.
But the main reason against television advertising is, that children have to keep in touch with other children.
If your child is watching TV every day, every hour...
If that happens, your child will loose his or her social contacts, the friends.
In this time of their life, children are learning very much, for example how to communicate with others.
They have their first friendships, are meeting new friends in the primary school.
Watching TV is not very helpful with that, it gives them a wrong view of life.
In the end, I would say, that television advertising should be principially allowed, but only, if the children are watching TV-programmes which are age-specified.
If this would be allowed, there would be a big missing part in this digital century.
But to let them watch TV always...
In the following essay I´m going to give you my opinion about the question if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I think it should be allowed, if an adult controls it, because there are lots of serials extra for children, where they can learn words or can train there logical thinking.
Also it makes them a lot of fun and the serials are extra created for children, so there isn´t any kind of for example sexual content.
There is this serial named "Dora", where Dora and her equipment, that can speak, help her friends.
In this serial the children learn new words and to think logical.
So it´s quiet good for the children to watch this serial.
But which children says "I don´t want to see reality tv, I want to watch Dora."?
In my opoinion the children always want what they aren´t allowed to.
So when the parents turn on the TV, or the child on his/her own, they switch the channel to a channel, where something like reality or music videos.
This kind of content isn´t good for children, because there are lots of sexual and rude things.
Also the carakters in reality TV don´t have such a good behavior and if the children watch these shows they can start to behave like that.
Well, I don´t think  that somebody wants to behave their child like that.
To pretend this the parents can control what their children watch in the television.
They can always have the thing to control the TV, so the childrens can´t turn the TV on.
When the parents allow their children tp watch the TV, the parents can turn the TV on, switch to the right channel with a serial for children and take the thing to control the TV with them.
Nevertheless the parents have to look at how long the child is watching the TV, becuase when they watch it for too long, they could get a headache.
Also it 
good for the less.
I think television advertising towards children is okay,  as long as it´s controlled by the parents, so they only watch serials which are made extra for children.
Television plays a big role in the life of many people even younger ones.
Many children around the age of two to five already watch TV.
The problem with that is the fact that TV-shows come with advertisements.
Children are often times easily convincent by others and tend to believe many things they get told.
When it comes to advertisements they could also be convinced to want certain things that are shown on TV.
This could prove a problem for the parents when their children want them to buy something new all the time that maybe isn't like the product they saw in the commercial because advertisers tend to glorify their product very much.
Many children could also dislike it when they want a certain product they saw but their parents can't buy it.
So in the end it would be a bad experience for the parents but also for the children.
Also the parents are the ones buying the product so the commerials should be directed towards them and not the children.
On the other hand you can see advertisements almost everywhere nowadays and children can also see them.
These advertisements could be posters and malls or near toy-shops.
Children get influenced by advertisements in any way, not only by TV commercials.
Also it would be good for the market and the state to have more people buying more products.
In my opinion the fact that children are influenced by many things so easy makes advertising for such a young group morally problematic because you may change their perception of the real products in a big manner.
This system could also be bad for parents, when they can't buy their children certain products over and over again because they don't have the money.
This would be bad for everyone involved in this system.
In the end the parents have to buy the products advertised for their children so it is their choice to buy it.
They don't have to buy things that they don't want their child to play with so they should be the ones that get convinced to buy the product.
The commercials should be directed towards the parents and not the children.
Today really every children has the chance to watch TV.
It's not important how old they are or some thing like this.
When there parents watch TV the children watch it too.
Now is the question, should television advertising not be allowed directed toward young children?
Young children aged two to five are in a phase of learning.
They learn new thing all the time but it's better if they learned things by a book or from their parents.
They could watch eight hours TV but i doesn't think, that the parents will watch children TV for eight hours.
So, the young children must watch the TV for older person and this isn't good for children most of the time.
In this series or movies are things, which aren't for their young age.
For childrens is it better, if they play outside or play with a friend.
It's more important for children to play with a pet, but to watch tv isn't the best thing.
In the age of them it's important to be in action and to find friendships.
they must be social and not alone.
But TV has also good things for children.
In children series like Benjamin Blümchen they could learn something over friendships, pets and other things.
It's absolutly ok, if young children watch TV, but they must have a limited time and specifical channels, which is only for young children.
also they parents must bring the children to make sports or meet with friends.
Well, newspapers brought up the question if the advertising material broadcast in television for children aged between two and five years are harmful to them.
This controversial question is such important to be discussed with regard to the mental growth of young children.
First of all, advertising wants to face all ages of society in order to sell as many products as possible.
As Adam Smith formerly said, there is an economical aspect which says that we should not disturb the market so as to provide maximal wealth for the whole world.
If there is no evident need of interacting against the market, we shoud not.
On the other hand, children are not conscious of what they remark when they watch TV.
They begin to develop a strong desire for a product shown on TV without knowing what it means exactly.
If the marketing group present a product with a lot of colour, children will be attracted automately and as a result of this, parents will be interrogated by them.
Children are very patient when it comes to be ambitious for a goal like purchasing a product.
Ultimately we can say that many children nowadays are faced with advertising for prosperitive reasons of a business, but in the end, I recommend not to create new restricting elements to prohibit this things.
For businesses it is unbearable to see that liberal ideas of marketing are being destroyed.
In my opinion we should do everything that there are nearly no restrictions for companies trying to sell their products.
Finally it is obvious that we are those who are in charge of reducted prizes if we prohibit trivial marketing tricks of big brands.
Advertising is spread everywhere.
On the street, in newspapers, on apps, billboards, mobile devices television, just everwhere you can reach the people.
It affects us, more or less.
But ever thought how it affects our children especially on TV?
Are they even undestanding it?
Children spend more and more time infront of the television.
They're not often outdoor, they're more interessted in watching TV.
And as it's easier for the parents to let them watch series or films, they spend hours infront of the screen.
Let's say an hour a day, makes up seven hours a week.
Every twenty minutes an interval of advertising leads to one hour and fourty-five minutes advertising per week.
A huge ammount of time.
However are they even affected by advertising?
One may say firstly no, cause how should be a child affected by watching coffe, shampoo or car advertising.
It neither has a relation to these topics nor has it an interest in them.
But as a matter of facts advertising is a huge market and really well done.
Of course you don't see a 'head and shoulders' promotion clip on a channel for children.
The interests of children are more in toys, adventure parks and other children places.
Everyone of us has been in the situation walking through shops with a child.
It's not that much fun as a normal shopping tour.
Every second thing has to be analyzed, every third to be touched and every fourth has to be bought.
It's easy to rise desires about new toys or clothes in a child.
Now imagine almost two hours a week advertising agencies have the possibilities to tell our children what their new desires are.
Not a nice imagination isn't it?
You don't even need fiveteen minutes to persuade an adult of a new good if it's well done, so how long does it need to persuade a child?
Do we really want to let someone else telling our children their desires?
Do we really want to have some advertising directed children?
Do we really want to allow advertising for children?
Everybody knows that television advertising is a lot about overreacting and false statements.
People in our age know what is true and what is false.
But what about the little children that get confronted with those advertisings every single day?
Does it has an influence on them or should it be banned from the television?
First of all little children at the age two to five have no idea what money is.
When they see something they want they scream and cry until they get it.
They don't care if it costs a lot money because they have no idea what is.
They are easily impressed and that's what advertising do what isn't correct and should be banned from TV.
They show little kids something that even hasn't to be true just to get the money of their parents because they know that the kids don't care if a toy costs an amount of money.
And the worst thing is that the toys aren't even that good as shown in the advertising and that leads us to problem number two.
The industry doens't care what happens with their products as long as they are bought.
They would sell a dangerous toy to a little child or something that doens't belong in the hands of a five year old just to get money.
Technologies like mobile phones, tablets or video games that are only for adults are made attractiv for children in advertising.
Those games have an influence on those children.
It shouldn't be allowed to show little children what a computer is, how cool they are and that they need one for example to have fun on a long car trip with the family.
The last point is that those advertisings make looking television for young children attractiv.
By seeing cool toys on TV they get stuck to it and keep watching and with that they start to see things that isn't meant for young eyes for example movies for adults, advertising for adults or even gaming shows.
In my opinion young children shouldn't even be in the near of a television nor of another technology.
If they see a toy in the store that they like and they want to buy it then they should have it because they want to explor it and not because some movie spots made false statements about it.
In the other hand there isn't such a thing as getting out with the little kids and have with them outside in the yard or in the forest.
No advertising ever said they should get out and have fun with other children or their family.
I don´t know if I have correctly understand the task.
But if the statement is television advertising directed toward young children at the age of two to five should not be allowed, I ask myself which children at this age are interested in television advertising?
The feelings (Wahrnehmung) of this young children isn´t good like at a erwachsenen human.
The children don´t know what they see there at the screen.
Maybe they see there a tree or an animal and they say: "Oh, there is a horse!"
They are happy to see this and because of this I don´t think that they want to know what the message of this television advertising is and which Absicht the director of this has.
So I disagree with the statement (in hope of the right understanding by myself).
I agree that young children should not be allowed to watch too much TV because of the television advertising.
The TV is probably the most common media around the world and every modern household has one or more.
It´s really fun to watch movies, shows and so on with the whole family but also alone.
It´s entertaining and a part of the todays society.
When I think about my childhood, I remember all these kids shows which I watched with my parents with all these characters and their names which I remember till today.
The TV is a popular media for every age and there should be an oppertunity for every kid to experience it.
The real problem about TV are the ads, or television advertising, which are annoying for all of us.
When we watch a movie, there are always breaks about five till ten minutes where they show us the most popular products and so on.
But it´s not only annoying, it also influences us because music, background colour and much more create a new picture of the product in our head.
We start to really want to have these products and kids shouldn´t be influenced like that at such a young age.
I guess that TV shows and movies are always connected with ads and it´s not possible to have the whole "TV experience" without the annoying ads.
I think kids still should have the chance to watch the kids shows and talk with their friends about it but only for a specific amount of time so they don´t get to influenced by the advertising.
There should be a TV channel only for kids without ads so the parents can relax and don´t have to worry.
Still the kids shouldn´t watch too much TV because sometimes it´s much more fun to play outside with their friends.
Because of these reasons I agree that yound children should not be allowed to watch too much TV because of the television advertising but they should have the oppertunity to experience this kind of media.
The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
is a sentence, i would discouss in the following.
Firstly i want to say that i think television is okay, but not to much, not the whole day.
The childrends have to play in the nature, whoever where exactly.
The forrest, the street, the garden, its not important where exactly they play but they have to play outside.
I hate it when childrend are only inside and look tv ore relax the whole day.
kids have to play outside and didnt watch tv the whole day.
When its evening and they watch the sandman then its okay but i think young childrends arent alloud to watch much tv.
Its important to find social contacts and learn things, and you could only learn this when you are with friends.
In the television you can find much stupid things and worse series.
Childrend coulndt notice if the series tells really things ore only stupid and unreall things.
its very important to protect childrend for that, if not, then they will think that the television only tells good and really things.
so i can comprimise with the statement, because i think its important to show chioldrend in this age how to play outside and have fun without television.
but I although think that childrend are allow to watch tv, but only a bit and only the series which are for kids.
Should it be allowed to make directed advertising for young children in the age of two to five?
For the first the children could get lead to watch even more Tv if they like the advertisings, because they look colorful and funny.
For example the children are looking one hour per day TV, so they're wathcing advertisings too, this could lead them to watch more TV, because it looks so funny and nice.
But advertisings can be useful too, like helping the parents to find a present for their kids if their children saw a nice toy in the advertising what they want they can wish to get this toy.
So a boy who saw a nice train with trainstation in the advertising can tell his parents that he wants them for christmas.
The parents will buy it for christmas and they dont have the struggle of thinking the whole day what they could give their child to christmas.
A big point against the advertising is, that children get influenced by advertisings and even more if they're young.
As you see, if a advertising looks funny and colorful, the children want it and try their parents to buy it for christmas or birthday.
But on the other hand, if the parents are too afraid, that their children could get influenced could easily shut down the TV or use some streaming services like "Netflix".
Maybe the children of 4 years are allowed to watch 1 hour per day TV, but the parents are afraid that their children get influenced by the advertisings, so the parents could swap to a streaming service, where their children could watch many series without any advertising.
In my own opinion, I don't think that it's nescessary to deny every advertising for children, because I think children shouldn't watch much Tv at all in the age of two to five.
And if the parents are to afraid that their children could get influenced, they just have to shut down the TV, don't have to buy the toys in the advertisings or use some streaming services without advertisings.
So today they're much options for parents to protect their children of the influence of advertisings.
I disagree with the statement for the reasons I show you below.
I want to show different aspects of the cause of advertising.
For young children it is much more difficult to unterscheiden the reality from fiction.
They are more likely to misunderstand the advertise and get a false impression of the world.
Children are influenced by everything they know espacially from what they see.
So it is easier to get them wanting a product then it is to get adults.
For a child it is not good to see those advertisings on television and they get addictect to a world of consume.
On the other side we have to look from the advertisers view.
As I said, kids are much easier to influence.
Like this advertisers get easy new customers.
The kids really want to have a cool product they saw on TV.
Also parents will buy more often things for their child then for themselfs.
Like this not only the child will become a new customer, the parents will too.
So companies can make very efficient advertising for less money.
Ads for kids are not only important to many companies, many TV stations need it too.
If there were no ads like these, stations like KIKA or other stations for kids would have to close.
Most of their advertising direct to children and without them they get no more money.
In the end you can not forbide ads directed to young children.
It would cause too much damage to the industry of television and the toys companies.
I know this advertising is not really good for a child but if parents think like this too, they can easily forbide their children to watch stupid TV-shows all day long.
Today many pople have a Ttelevision at home and watch many hours , also when there youngh children sit next to them.
Some of the advertisings are directed toward young children (aged two to five).
Should that be allowed or not?
Sometimes adervertising is drected toward children because the person behinfd it things that it could be good for promotions because they tell their parents to for example buy a candys because they looked so delicious on the TV or they want a bike because the advertising said you need a bike to be "cool".
It influences children, some people say in a good way because they learn to have an opinion on certain things or learn to tell what they want, others say it is a bad influence because the advertising tells them what to do and mabye keeps them watching TV or get an wrong opinion of what they really need in life.
Youngh children should play outside and not watch advertisings and get influenced by it, they should have they prioritys else where because it could have an effect on their character or they behavior and there its again, some say in a helping way and some in a daming way.
It could help them to see how they people behave in the advertising and they could lern new words because if it is directed to them they are intrested.
It also could damige the way the children used to think or behave because they think that in the advertising the people get a kind of an idol for them and sometimes they are just not real because they play everything.
Also the company who make those advertising would go out of work an it would cost many workers who have no work anymore an no many and thats not good for the state.
Advertising with foods could also be dangerous because mabye they say its a healty candy but everybodey knows it is not and their parents try everything to convince them but they can't because the children ar already so infuenced by the advertising.It could also help them in some way , for example a children smoothie advertising and they mabye want to live an healty lifestyle.
But mostly imported is that the most children in these age can't really think like that and they just watch it and what ever happens happens.
I think parents should decide wether they should watch it or not.
They decide wahts best for their kids, they know them and they know if it would be goog or bad, helpfull or dangerously.
It should be up to the parents , I don't think there should be a law or something.
How often have I seen a parent arguing with his or her child at the supermarket.
"No, Lily, we will not get these chocolate cereals.
Put them back, now!"
"But muuuum, pleaaase!
", ect.
I can imagine how annoying these shopping trips with kids like that have to be for parents.
And who's to blame?
The advertisings on tv.
Just recently I found myself discussing with my friends about ads in general and also ads concidering kids.
It's brainwashing, is what one of my friends said.
And I think that is, to some extend, quite true.
Children are watching tv at a very young age these days and no doubt that they find tons of ads there.
I get the feeling that it's getting crazier and crazier too!
All the toys are getting bigger, better, more exciting and also more expensive.
And when grandma ask Lily what she'd like for her birthday he will answer with something she discovered whilst watching tv.
On the other hand I think, that one could forbid all the ads if one wanted to be fair, or non at all.
Because companies just want to make profits, don't they?
They want to sell their products.
So they have their ads streamed on tv.
It's just how it works.
So in my opinion it's ok that television advertising directed to children is allowed.
In the following I give some points and will discribe if young children are allowed to use television.
You often hear that young children (aged two to five) are using so much television because the parents watch so much TV or the parents haven`t got any time for their own children.
I think that it is okay when young boys and girls are watching TV or play some games on the tablet or the laptop from their parents if the parents haven`t got much time to play with their children little games like "Memory" or "Hide and see" or go outsite in the forest and take a walk.
Also the kids learn how to act with the media and that could be very important for they future.
But if the young children are watching to much TV they want more from day to day.
The media are also bad for the eyes.
if the children make the television to their hobby it could be that they were fatter and fatter, because only watch TV is boring so they eat sweat things.
I think that it should be allowed that the children use the television if it`s not more than one hour on a day.
first of all i have to say that i am not shure about the vocabulary in the question so i am going to answer the question, if childrem from age two to five should watch as much tv as people at a higher age.
no.
i really do not think children this age but also older children should watch much tv.
they are young they are children, they should go outside play soccer, drive around with their bike or inlineskates.
the contact to other kids is much more important than to hang around on the sofa an watsch something very uninterlectual and things nobody needs.
as a child you should experience the world with friends or with your family.
you should experience it on your own an do not watch tv and see how painted figures do that.
the series for children often do not have anything to learn something from ore worse they learn something but not the good things, the bad things only.
but if they watch tv, because soetimes it is okay, they should watch a series they can learn soething good from.
parents should give strict rules for the tv and give also times when the children are allowes to watch tv and what they are allowed to watch.
it would be horrible if a child this young age turns on the tv in the evening an something thar shows war or even just blood or dead would be showen there.
they should only watch tv together with their parents so they can control what and how long they do it.
in my childhood i was only allowed to watch tv one hour a day, and only if i was nice the day before.
the older i got the more i was allowed to watch tv.
today i know what is on the tv and i am glad and thankful my parents stopped me watching tv in the late evening or in the night.
parents in genereal should not let their young children watch tv all the time ore even alone.
if a five years old child, or even younger or a bit older, sees something brutal ore sexual on tv they would not know how to deal with that.
but the parents should make them clear they just want to protect them and not want do vorbid evberything that seems to be nice.
children can not imagine what happens in the world and think everything is nice.
parents have to make them clear it is not and have to protect them.
there won´t be enough time for playing outside when they are in school so they should use the time they have at this wonderful young age and should not waste it on bullshit like tv.
Today the television is a normal part of our day.
Most people sitting in the evening in front of there TV and watching the news.
But the program changes over the last years.
First there are only some movies for adults but today half of the day´s program are for children.
Especially young children in the age of two to five can sit the whole day in front of the TV and watch any series.
But should this be allowed or not?
I think most children who watch TV the whole day do this because they can´t do anything else.
When they go to the kindergarten they hear all other children talk about a new series in TV or about the last episode or movie.
Because of that they have to watch this series or movie, too, to talk with other children about this.
This can be one reason why children wnt to watch TV.
An other reason, when the parents of a child have to go to work and the child is the afternoon completly alone, it watch TV because it´s boring without anyone, who could play with the child.
So it´s just for being entertained.
But this aren´t reasons why it should be allowed, just why children watch the whole afternoon TV.
When you have a look in this series for children then you can find some really interesting facts but the rest is nonsense.
For adults it can be possible to split of the facts and the other stuff but could do a child this splitting off?
I don´t think so.
And because of that the children gets stupid ideas and will have confusing dialogues with friends because each friend have an other stupid idea.
In my opinion the parents of a child should really try to cotrole the time their children will sit in front of a TV.
You have to allowed your children to watch TV.
Otherwise they haven´t the chance of find new social connections because they haven´t a topic to talk about.
But it will be better for a child to play with friend or there parents without any electric stuff because it´s better for education the of the child.
The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed."
can be seen from two points of view.
The first one is the one of the parents or maybe just grown-ups in general.
If their child sees something on tv an they want to own it, it's their parents fault when they won't buy them evry single thing they see.
Furthermore a child might take the advertisment the wrong way.
In many advertisments for young children there are other young children playing with the product and it seems like they're having fun so the child who's watching the adverisment thinks, it can only be happy when it'll be able to have what they have.
On the other hand those advertisments are mostly shown on channels which are also for young people and what if they would just show advertisments for grown-ups on those channels?
Would it be okay to show a five-year-old an advertisment for sex toys or something similar to that?
Because advertisments will be there to finance the channels.
Nowadays it's normal for everyone to see advertisments everywhere and whether or not they are directed at us, they often catch our attention.
So even if certain advertisments which are directed towards young children aren't allowed, they would still see advertising.
The question is, what's worse for them?
In my opinion advertisments for young children are fine.
It's not the best thing they'll get to see on tv but it's also not the worst.
Channels for children should have children friendly content and if that includes advertisments that's okay.
Therefore I don't agree with the statement "Television advertising toward young children should not be allowed."
Nowadays  everybody has a computer or a smartphone.
Young children also as adults.
People learn more  by television and lesser from books or other people.
But is this way of modern studying good for children ?
Today there were a lot of different channels on TV also channels speciel for children.
On this channels a lot of shows try to teach young children on an easy way about different science.
From physics about biologie and chemie.
Usual, all day situation, were explained by simple test, mostly on a funny way.
This shows were created very funny speciel to children so they were interest and learn more effectifly.
On the otherhand side were the most programms on TV not made for chilfren at all.
There werde sitcoms with dirty jokes or boring newsshows.
Children watch bad shows and comedies, they were very funny but are not created to teach anything to young cildren.
I think young children learn most effectifly in human contact, with their mum and dad or their friends.
In this way they get their  education in early years by own adventures, TV should also be allowed but only in regulated   times and with special shows for children with a high potencial of education.
I think this is a good idea.
Because if young children watch TV too often they will become stupid and lazy.
In this age you have as parents the task, that you could build up a relationship with your children.
Watching TV will not help you with that.
For young children it is much more important to do something.
Namely sports ore somthing in which you learn to kow other childrens.
This is the case because the modern people have to learn social interaction as early as possible.
Regarding the the TV too often takes away your sense of the reality!
If your kids do that you should do something against it, because they will never learn something about real life if thea are watching TV all the time, finding themselves in a virtual world.
TV is teaching your children bad things!
Theres not only the bad vocabulary, no its also the actions.
If the children see in the TV how they make dangerous things and it didn't harm them, then they may try to do the same things and this could be really dangerous.
But don't worry about the danger of watching TV, there is a good method to bring the children not to do that: You have to tell them, that they will become squared eyes!
They will believe that and they will not watchig TV anymore.
Till now it shoud be clear that watching TV is a bad idea for young children.
But how it is for older?
Should television advertising be allowed toward young children?
The advertising has a big influence on everybody especially the young children who have little knowlege about the world and it's dangers.
Companies could use this advertises to influence our society early on, and make a whole generation dependent on their products.
But it might not be such a big problem because the young children don't have the money to even buy these products and if the parents reject to buy them the children will fastly forget about them.
It is also questionable if the children, which are aged two to five, would even understand what this advertising is all about.
If the companies manage to get their slogan inside the mind of the children in the way that they will recognize it when they see it in a shop, they will beg their parents to buy this specific product even if the quality and the price are worse than the other ones.
In this stage I think it comes to parents wheter they give in or they take their time and explain the children why this product is worse.
This is an importent part of childhood and if this is missing it will be a problem for the child, when it has to manage his own earnings.
So I don't think that it has to be forbidden to show advertises to young children, it is about the parents to teach them enough about life so that they can deal the right way with their funds and the advertising that is nowdays found evrywhere.
The question that I'm gonna talk about is, if television advertising should be allowed, which is mostly focused towards young children in the age between two and five years.
Advertising has a big impact on how someone is thinking about certain things.
Young children are more affected by those ads than older people.
One thing that i don't like about these advertisings is, that they use lights, colours and camera movements, that give the children the toughts that they need this toy.
Not because they like it, but because they need it.
And if they ask they parents the same question over and over again, most parents give up and purchase their kid that toy.
A positive feature, that these ads give, is that children don't feel out of place, because only ads for their parents is shown.
The ads for a younger group is mostly shown on channels, that are general made for younger kids.
If ads for a new car are shown there, children can't do anything with that information they give.
With ads for their age, they interests are spoken to, not from their parents.
*

+

My opinion about these ads is, that kids shouldn't get that feeling that they need it.
But I'm not against advertisings.
Ads must be made, so a channel can pay their staff and other costs.
And companies do these ads targeted towards children, because it works.
Most parents wan't to give their child anything, so he or she is happy.
I'm not against ads targeted towards young children, if parents don't like, that their kids watch ads, they should do something with their kid between ad break.
* Another bad thing about ads targeted towards children for the children, is that they don't do something else between ad breaks and waste alot of their life time.
But not only when they are kids, later they also watch ads, because they are used to it.
This is something that companies wan't.
They obviously wan't that their ads are being watched, but this, as i already pointed out, a big time waster.
But ads need to be that way, so parents should do something against that.
+ With advertisings towards younger children, they learn how to have an opinion on something.
Or with the help of their parents, they learn how to use their money correctly or that they don't need everything they see.
This will open the gates for a healthier lifestyle, because they already know, that they don't need everything to be happy.
But this can only be achieved with help from their parents.
If the parents are strong minded, they can help their kids not to worry about everthing they see.
In the following i will write a essay about the statement:"Television advertising directed toward young children( aged two to five) should not be allowed."
It can be allowed because many advertising are good for there knowledge.
But there can be adverstising which are not good for young children.
Young children are watching Television in the morning when there are series for them.
But if they are watching in the evening thats not good because there can be advertisings for old people.
But very often the children watched television with there parents and if they are watching allone the most children passed the advertising away.
It will be good for the young children when the advertising allowed.
A lots of the advertising are funny and very interesting.
The young children are going to bed very early.
The advertising help them to learn the  language.
So advertising can help them.
Advertising can be ugly f.e.
when they show what will be hapen if you are smoke zigarettes.
They show it with some ugly pictures.
The pictures are not good for young children because it can be scary for them.
Its good for the young children when the advertising should be allowed,because some advertising are for young children , they are funny and very interesting.
The advertising are good to improve the language beacuse the children who are younger then five years they can not  speak good.
They are definitly some advertising which are not good for young people but the most of them are in the evening.
In the following text i'll point out why i agree or disagree to the statement that "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".
I think there are some problems with advertising direct toword young children.
Mainly because they are far too easy to influence.
And of course the young children won't be able to buy the products they see in the advertising anyway.
The whole point of this is to make these  young children absoulutly want the product so they will make their parents buy it for them.
So even though the advertising isn't directed toward the adults they are ones who'll have to pay in the end.
But what would be a conclusion ?
Obviously it isn't an opportunity to just forbid advertising for products which are made for young children in general.
I think the only way to solve this  problem is to make advertising toword the adults so to try to persuade the adult who is watching the advertising that his/her child needs that product.
That way you stop young children from being influenced by advertising but the companys will still be able to sell their products.
A problem with this system could be that it is hard to tell what directly "directed toward young children" means and what the companys would have to change to change to make it "directed toward adults".
In the end i definetly agree to this statement because in my opinion it is just a way to get money from adults by influencing their children which shouldn't be allowed.
In the time age we live in, homes without television or other technical advices are very rare.
From a young age you get used to those advices and especially the children in an age between two to five get very affected.
Out of this the question "Should television advertising directed toward young children not be allowed anymore?"
arises.
First of all the children are mainly too young to understand the advertisings they are seeing in the way those were supposed to.
They are just seeing many colours and some foreign people who are playing with a toy or eating some delicious food.
However this would not affect any child in a bad way.
Maybe they would stress their parents and force them to buy them this product, but that would not be a bad affection.
On the other hand the people who set those advertisings up, don not care about how smart or dumb the clips for television are, they just care about which way may bring the best possible win for their own company.
They do not want to educate the children with the advertise.
They do not care if the children who are watching the advertise take the things they are seeing for real, even if it is completely unreal and from a fantasy world.
Another problem is that parents more and more tend to use the television as an entertaining program for their kids.
Therefore those would see all those advertisings, which are partly not even true or real, and then they would want to have all those things.
The moral values get lost sooner or later and the kids just sit in front of their TV instead of going out and play games with their friends.
Furthermore they do not want to play anymore with the other kids, because they have that many toys that they are not interested in other kids anymore because the toys are more special for them.
To sum it all up I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
For me, the producer of advertisings care too less about the educational value they should have for children in the age between two to five.
This affects them extremely, because they get used to dumb things and maybe also would do dumb things in their real life or think those dumb things are not dumb but smart.
The question, whether TV-advertisments, which are directed toward children, aged between two to five, should be allowed or not, has caused a huge discussion lately.
First of all, advertisments are often designed to be really manipulating for both, adults and children.
However, children are much easier to impress, since they don't have much knowledge and are usually naive.
To take advantage of this naive mind by advertising a product, which they should buy, is certainly morally questionable.
Furthermore, the company knows exactly that children between the age two to five are not able to buy something on their own yet.
The parents have to buy the often expensive toys for their children, because the children are annoying them as long as they don't have what they wanted.
However, on the other side, it's questionable if a child between two to five even understands the advertisments and that the products in it are real things.
They could probably think it is part of a show as well and do not even know that the thing they see is available for them to purchase.
Moreover, you could say that it's the fault of the parents.
It is up to them to set rules and to make it clear to the child, that they cannot buy everything, they want.
Or they could simply set "TV-times", to make sure their child is not watching too much shows and advertisments.
Or they could watch TV together which their child and decide on their own, which toys to buy.
In the end, it is all a matter of parental education, if the child is more manipulated by advertisments than by their own parents.
In my opinion, TV-advertisments for young children should still be allowed.Besides that i don't know, whether a child even understands what they see in the TV,i think, it's up to the parents to educate their child in a way, that they know they cannot get everything.
And maybe they can even teach their child to be satisfied with what they have.
Advertising has an very important use for media and products.
It is useful to convince people to buy what you want to sell or to get exposure for your company.
There is no problem for companies to advertise their products, but can it be directed to every group of people?
There need to be ways to get people buying your products and television advertising is definately one of them.
Many people watch tv every day and that makes it one of the biggest entertainment sources ever.
It it really important to advertise but the question now is, should television advertising also be directed toward very young children?
The reasons why it should be allowed is that television advertising is for everyone.
That means it is for every group in the society and the young children are one of them.
Companies that sell products for young kids, need their advertisements to gain money and exposure.
If companies didnt do that, children would not have as much fun as they are having because they dont get the kind of toys they like.
The childhood is a very important stage of life.
It sets the first milestone in our lives and a beautiful and easy childhood will definately influence the future.
Young children are seemlingly very influential, that is a fact.
What they see and adore at the first moment they witness it, they run to their parents and tell them that they have seen something in the television and they want it for their birthday present.
The problem with television advertising is that it has a big influence on people, especially children and that could cause parents to buy stuff for their children that they should not, for example "Lego" that could be swallowed by a young children.
There, the parents have to really pay attention and have to make their own impressions on the products they but for their kids.
In my opinion, it's not okay to advertise products that are directly towards young children, because it can really produce accidents and problems which then have to be solved by the parents and take even their time away.
Advertising is just too influential for young kids.
My question is Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
You can discuss how good is advertising.
But today we only discuss is it good for kids in the age from two to five.
You can see it from two different sites on the one site are the companies on the other the parents and kids saver.
But I start with the companies.
The thing is that kids in this age think everything is true they can't deside is it true or false.
So when they say we have the best product ever and shows some sweet figures they love this product.
A big example is ferrero with the "Kinderschokolade", "Überraschungsei" or "Kinderschokobons".
They annimate the chocolate and shows the kids how good it is.
And the speaking egg says to the kids that they buy seven "eggs".
So they influence the thoughts of the kids.
And they do this to have thees custromers later.
So they make much money with the ads.
On the other hand you have the parents.
They don't want that their child are a zombie of any advertising companies.
They want that the kids knew that choclate is not good that there is many sugar in.
They want that they eat vegetables and that they do sports.
Anyway kids who can't see the ads make their own thoughts.
And kids don't watch TV the hole day.
They go out and play with their friends.
I think that you as parents must have the choice.
If you don't want that your child see ads they watch only the public channels for example KiKa, or ARD in the morning.
But when the parents say it doesn't matter if my child see ads or not then it can watch the private channels too, e.g.
SuperRTL or DiseyChannel.
Advertisement is everywhere nowadays.
It is a part of our everyday life and it is directed toward all of us, young and old.
That brings forth the question: Should we allow advertising directed toward young children?
Small children are very naive and don't know how to form their own opinion yet.
Therefore advertisement directed directly toward them will have a big influence on them.
If an advertisement tells a small child that the product is the best thing in the world a small child will not be able to see through the marketing desguise of the advertisement and will instead just believe it and demand for their parents to buy it.
Therefore advertisement directed toward young children is very dangerous as it influences their perception of reality by displaying a false image of products and it can lead to them being spoiled and having false priorities in life.
On the contrary one might also say that the parents are responsible for their children and with that it is their job to decide wether something is suited for their child or not.
Therefore banning television asvertising directed toward children is not nessesary because the parents should be the ones preventing their children from being influenced by these advertisements and with that becoming a vilctim of the marketing industry at such a young age.
Personally I think that advertising directed toward small children does not need to be banned.
In my opinion the parents are responsible for their children and with that they are also responsible for what their children see on television.
Though I do find it morally questionable to try and use a childs innocently naive perception of the world to sell your products it is still the parent's duty to teach their child what is right and important and what isn't.
In the following essay I will give reasons and examples for and against the following statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) schould not be allowed.".
Nowdays the juse of mobile technic is getting a higher position.
Some people say it is a positive change but some people say it is a really negative change.
A reason against this statement could be, that these children can leran something out of these television programs but I think then it ist important, which chanal they wacht.
If it is a grate show where you can learn something about the nature and life I think it is a good thing.
Like the show in germany "Wissen macht A" it is a show, where two people are teaching the children some spizific words they had asked for.
But in this age I think it is to early to try to teach the children some things this way because a two years old children can´t really understand what they are talking about.
So I tink it is important to show it with pichtures and picture stories.
A positive reason for this statement is that children are sitting all the day inside and are watching tv and are not going out to play foot with other children.
And they are not doing tings on  their own wrong because they learned it fom the tv.
Another reason ist, that when every children is watching tv they can not have good connections and friendships.
And this is a really bad thing!
Every child has to ceep in contact to other cildren without tv.
In all I agree with this statement, because when I was so jung I loved it to play outisde with my friends.
And I think this is so important for every child!
I think it is ok if they sometimes watch tv but the relationship to other children is more important.
They have to learn something about life outside the parentshouse, they have to do something wrong so they can learn out of it.
Television, computers, mobile phones and many other thing are used nowadays by billions of people all around the world.
Some parents allow their childen to watch television at an age of 2,3,4 or 5.
In the following I will give my opinion about the statement "Television advertising directed toward young (aged two to five) should not be allowed"

First of all in my opinion watching TV is kind of a non-sportive "hobby" which you should use not that much.
Especially for childen with low ages the parents have to decide and controll their children.
I think every mother or father have to look up for their childen to teach them what they can do and what they can not do.
The TV and the theme of the series you watch in the TV can influence the childen with low ages in the future.
I think it depends on the series you let your child watch whether it influences your child in a good or bad way.
Nethertheless I think that you should not let a 2 year old watch TV, because it just don´t make sense, because the child doesn´t understand those themes.
At a higher age I think you can confrontate your children with modern technologies, but a TV should be one of the last things.
In my opinion at some age you can´t avoid your children watching TV, because then other children are watching TV your child will come to you and will say "my friends are watching TV, I want to watch it too".
To avoid this situation you can let your child watch TV in lower ages, but it should be controlled by parents.
At the end it depends on the child and their reaction about TV and the parents who can decide on their own whether they want their childen to watch TV or whether not.
Television advertising directed toward  young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
I will try to find my opinion to this difficult and hard statement in our modern world.
When I was younger at the age two to five I watched not so much televison or just a short time.
my parents said that the telvison is bad for my brain so I paint many pictures and played the whole time with my toys.
My best friend watched the whole day televison becouse his parents had no time for him so they allowed him that.
I was always jeallous but I think I had more fun then him.
It is always so that you want something what you can`t get.
today I think it` s more difficult to don`t allowed the children that they can`t watch televison becouse our world is really modern and in every house are many electronic.
For example my family have got 4 mobile phones; 4 computer; 2 tablets and 3 tv`s.
This is a example for our modern world you can`t say to a child who grow up with so much electronic that he can`t watch television.
When I was younger and my parents went out they always took the tv stick (Fernbedienung) with them so I can`t watch tv.
And if I watched tv  my parents I always take care that I watch just the films for my age.
So my opinion is to this statement that children who are in the age of two to five can watch tv but they can just watch for a short time and the parents have to take care of them that they can`t watch any film above there age.
On the one hand children could be maipulated very fast.
If an advertisment is shown in the television which says that thy have to buy this toy they would buy it quickly without thinking about it.
Sometimes an advertiment isn't for the age of the little children (like Eis.de).
Those advertimsents should be shown in the evening when the children are sleeping and on channels for adults.
The advertisments should be made for kids in the age who are whatching the channel where the advertisment is on air.
If there is a movie on TV in the evening the channel should take care that there is an advertisment for kids.
On the other hand it should be allowed because the companies could make more money with their advertisment because some children see a toy and want to buy it.
And the channel could make more money too if they can show more advertisment.
And the children don't get what the advertiment is talking about so they don't care about it.
But if the children are whatching the channels for adults the parents have to take care that their child don't whatch the channel and only the program which is made for it.
In my opinion the advertisments should be made for the kids if they are directed toward young children and if they switch on a channel which isn't made for kids it wouldn't be the mistake of the advertisment or of the channel.
But advertisments like Eis.de should be shown after 10 p.m when the children are definitly in their bed and are sleeping.
If not their parents have to take care that they don't have a chance to see those advertisments.
In the foolowing text I will discuss the Statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Children are more likely to be influenced by advertising than adults.
And they get to see a lot advertising.
It seems like 50 percent of the time there is advertising on telvision.
Kids that grow up with so much advertising will also show the results when they are adults.
So early influenced Children will probably grow up to be very hard conumers.
Good for the economy but bad for them.
Of course I wont have to be this way, but it is an often used argument on this theme.
Also there is a difference between a kid seeing the newest game on tv to an adult seeing the newest beauty product or something.
Kids often want it imidietly.
Because it is faster, prettyer or if it only has a new featur, even thou they have something just like this at home.
I guess when parents let their children watch tv they know how much advertising their kids will get to see.
So you could say it is their decission.
But to distract your children completly from watching tv is nowerdays not that easy.
So if children would get to see less of this advertising, I hope they would not be influenced this much anymore.
I dont think advertising toward young children should be completely forbidden.
But I think there should be a mark of how much advertising is allowed on television channels directed toward children.
I am writing an essay about the question, if it is good when the television advertising directed toward young children.
You often see on televison that advertising is directed to young childten, age two or five.
The reason is, that they want that the children want to have something how they saw at the television.
They run to their partens and scream and want this wonderful teddy the saw on televison.
Is this bad for the revolution of the children?
It is right that the parents often are stresst and have no time.
Then it is good when the children have something to do.
The television is the best thing for that.
All children love to whatch something funny.
But at the advertising comes a lot of rubbish.
There are things for adults and not for children.On this point is it good that the advertisindis directed toward young children.
Because it is better when they saw something about the easther bunny then what the Kardashians are make with her money.
On the other hand there is so many rubbish to see at advertising.
It is not good for the children when they saw all these things on television.
They become to children how want everything.
The do not live in a real world.
I would be better when they whatch one film in one piece without advertisig.
After that they could go outside and play football with friend and have social contact.
In the end I would say, that it have positiv and negativ points that the television advertising directed toward young children aged two or five.
The most of them is not very bad for the children, so it is no problem.
But I think it is not good when the young children whatch to often television.
In this essay i will you say arguments for and against television advertising directed toward youg children should not be allowed.
Television advertising is today a very important themathic.
During you watch television it's imposible to didn't look a television advertising.
The importest argument for television advertising directet toward young children is that the chlidrens should learn what they should do and how to react with these television advertising.
It's a important thing to learn in the young age to not be infulenced by something.
With television advertising the children can also see what for new stuff to play are coming out and so can decide wich play they want to wish maybe for a birthday.
Children television also have to win money and thats impoossible without television advertising.
Argument against television advertising directed toward young children is that it's to dangerous.
It's possible that the children want every month new plays and just beacouse they see it on the television.
And is it really okey during a children television show to see a television advertising?
Another point is that television advertising influence children often in a negative way.
In the view of the parents it's also a point of saftey and responsbility who must to be there or even not.
For me it's to dangerous and a to big responsibility for the parents.
It's complicated when television advertising show things that children shouldn't see in this age.
I think also that it's important to grow up without to be influenced with television advertising.
It's not a good point to be influenced in the aged of two to five.
They would be enough influenced in a older age.
Nowadays we live in a society in which the most of us have a TV.
When you watch a film, TV show ect.
every single break between it you can see advertising about erverything.
On childrens programms as well.
Televisoin advertising on children programms show most of the time new play stuff like toy cars, games or Barbies.
When I was younger I always want to have new things because the companys, that sell these things show, do these advertising on purpose: They want to get higher sold rates.
With good ideas they influence the children during they watch their favorite series.
They used special effects, specific colors or characters to get more attention.
They set their products in a perfect "light".
Young children are more influenced by it than older children because older kids have the knowlegde that they can´t get everything and accept it easiler than younger ones.
They always want to have new play stuff and with advertising their consume will increase more than before.
Some people want that those advertising should not be allowed.
But then want do you want to show childrens?
TV programms earn money from companys for showing their advertising.
And you don´t want to have advertising of new soap  or not for their age (alcohol etc.).
I doesn´t agree with this statment because I think you should look for younger children when they watch TV.
The point is you have to switch the programm or talk to them during those periods when you don´t want that your child is influenced by it.
Another reason is that TV programms don´t cut advertising out that easy.
They were paid for it.
And it doesn´t disturb me at all because when I was younger I learned that I can not get everything on TV and after time I got bored of advertising until now.
I agree with the statement because nowadays there are so many hidden influences in the television like how to act in our modern century mostly of a bad point of view or in case of business when you want people to need special things to be accepted also in television directed towards young children.
Often tv-shows create a wrong view of the reality like creating a different universe or a `better` world and children at such young age do not understand which one is the real and which is just virtual world.
Also the normal comunication of children get lost because they are sitting in front of television and learning the informal language instead of being outside with others and learn to comunicate in the right way, still  in tv-shows made for kids
The health suffers too because they do not move as much as the other children who playing outside and having the good influences of nature and they get bad eyes by watching television too much.
Children at the age two to five learn mostly imporrtant things in this period like cycling, comunicating or to write their names.
The biggest part of television they can not understand because there are letters, difficult words or formal language.
After all I am still the opinion advertising television directed toward young children in television schould not be allowed.
To start the given statement wants television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
There are different arguments supporting or weaken this statement.
On the one hand young children are not able to understand all the presented information or more important not able to question them.
So they may start believing everything that they were told and could develop a wrong image of reality.Moreover they could easily be unhappy or angry when they realize that the product does not conform with their expectations, since they are not able to reflect on a explanation.
On the other hand young children has to make their own experiences to learn from them.
In their future they will have to deal with wrong promises and unfullfilled expactations anyway, so it could be better for them to start early with questioning advertisement.
Therefore television advertising could provoke such a situation and with their gained experience and the explanations of their parents they could learn and be prepared instead of being totally suprises if such an event occurs in their future.
Furthermore it is the task of the parents to inform their children about possible dangers caused by television advertising.
Hence they should watch the different adds together with their children and explain them the difference between television and reality concerning promises, expactation and given information.
This could influence the future in a positive way,as the children has to deal with the problem in a conforming way and they start learning on how to questions such adds.
Additionally especially in a young age children regard their parents as role models.
As a consequence they are willed to learn from them what would be more effective as banning every add which concerns them.
Furthermore the children watch other adds also.
Therefore even if they are not addrest they may believe the promises.
As you can see they are confronted with advertisement anyways, however not all of them could be forbidden.
As a result of this I believe that it is better to confront them with advertisement to give them the chance to learn.
Finally advertisement could be banned to protect young children, howver this is no solution since children get confonted to advertising at some point anyways.
As a consequences learning at young age with the help of their parents would be more effective concerning experience and knowledge
In todays world television and media are getting more and more important.
Advertisising in the television is mostly directed to a specific group of people such as young children are one of them.
But should this young group be advertised?
Children aged two to five are very easily influenced by everything they see and hear.
Advertisements in the television show them what they really do not need but the adverts make them want that.
Sweets are often displayed with children "actors" to gain the feeling of need in the watching child.
I do not think that children should be advertised because of their young age and as a consequence to this their easy influenceabilty.
Explained on the example of the "Kinder Überraschungsei": in this advertisement adults give the chocolat egg to children telling them not to open it until the adult gets back.
The adult leaves the room and the child stays, sitting in an empty room with nothing but the egg on a table in it.
Every child gets very temptated by the egg and finally opens it to see the surprise.
The watching young children get the feeling to need that too, to want that chocolat and the surprise too.
They want to feel the excitement of the children in the television too.
In fact I would not want my child to be that influenced by people I, as the mother, do not know and even worse whose intentions I do not know.
I would want my child only to be influenced by me and my husband and the only other people I would allow that were other tight family members.
I do not know the people that produced these advertising but I think if they would think about this more carefully, think about how their child could be influenced they would probably be more careful with what they advertise.
We all somehow now a few tricks of the marketing industry.
Whether it's special music, which aim's for avoking a certain mood while listening or a very distinc color pallet to convey a certain message.
The fact, that the marketing industry and exspecially the advertising industry is using special methods to achive their aim, is undeniable.
And we can see how tempting it is to buy a thing when we see it in a Tv advert.
So the question is, when it's already hard for grown men and woman to resist these temptations, should it be allowed that tv advertises can be shown, which are directed towards children, in the age from two to five.
I think it silly to ban these kind of advertises.
Most of the time these advertises are about toys or some special kind of food.
As we know all things have aprice and kids around that age don't have money or atleast just a small amount of it.
So the natural cause would be, that the kids won't be able to go in the mall and buy the stuff they saw on the tv.
They would need to ask their parents for money and the parents could desitnguish between blind consumption or the necessety of things.
Nevertheless it would be way harder for buisnesses and the industry to sell their products, because they can't put the on display anywhere.
In my point of view kids around these age should not watch Tv at all, well they can watch some kids tv shows, but only in a certain amount.
Products for thise age level does not need a special display in the tv because most of the time they are just toys or products the parents would buy for their kids.
Instead of allowing these adverts, directed towards kids, the toy store or drugstores should step their game.
For example they can redecorate they interior so it's more kids friendly.
I can remeber how exciting it was for me, as a kid, to go to the toy store.
Stores should focus on maintaining this special kind of feelind and anticipation, instead of focusing on tv adverts.
Nowadays many young children watch alot Tv and many advertisings are directed toward children.
In the following statement I give some explanations whether the advertisings toward children who are under the age two or five should be allowed or not.
First of all i have to say that childrens get information about new products.
So they can talk about these at school or somewhere else.
Furthermore the children are also intigrated in the economic market so the company's have a right to advertise their products, even if products are made for children.
But beside these arguments there are many other facts why the advertisings should not be allowed.
Adding to that is that many  children change their mind about money spending because they have no idea how hard it is to work for money, they just go to their parents when they are interested.
Also the kids are not educated enough to understand the rhethoric methods from the companys.
All in all advertisings to children should not be allowed and I can not agree with the statement.
When ever a form of media gets invented, people will try to use it to their advantage and try to monetise them via advertising and television is no exeption.
Television advertising used to be incredibly effective, since watching the TV was the main source of entertainmentf for the whole family.
Nowadays however, most millenials don't really watch cabled television anymore.
Instead, they use programms like Netfilx or Hulu for shows, and webistes like MSM for news.
So the TV-advertisers has to find other demographics to appeal to.
One of those groupes are small children.
From 9am to 15 pm, there is a surprisingly large amount of advertisments directet towards toddlers aged two to five.
This calls forth the question: Is this good for the child's development?
Many people say that manipulating children at such a young age is not acceptable from a moralic perspective.
Children are extreamly guilable and belives most of the things you tell them.
Not only that, children aged two to five are increadibly fast at learning new things.
If you teach them a new word, they will use it, and if you show them tons and tons of advertisements, they will learn to, nay, be forced to love those products.
Thats why advetisements directet directly at them have a much stronger effect than advertisements directet at older people.However, if you manipulate the children too much, you will erase their individuality.
Is creating a future where all people want the same things because they saw the same advertisements when they were children that attracive?
Apperantly, for the advertising companies, it is, since having most people think alike will increase their income.
Me personaly, I think that having a diverse and colourful next generation is important and nessecairy for the continuation and evolution of the human as a species, which is why I'm adamantly against Television advertising directed towards young children.
This topic is going to be about why it should not be allowed to show toward young children (aged two to five)  television advertising.
Well, nowadays every child, even the youngest are in front of the television just to occupy them and the parents get a small moment in the day the always wished silence from the day.
But people more and more are starting to question the method to allow the children watch television because there are sometimes just trash and not very children-friendly things running in the programme.
The first point is that children with this age are very sensitive and influentiable one could also say sort of bit naive, because they believe literally nearly every thing what they are told.
The advertising could make them become addicted to   to stuff what the advertising tells them.
For example when the advertising always is about sweets and how happy these things make you.
Then the youngest and most vulnerable people of our society cannot be longer without sweets because otherwise they wouldn't be happy.
On the other perspective i


 So it's connected with many dangers show television advertising directed toward young.
If advertising is good or not is a theme since years.
The statement 'Televison advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed' is officially against it.
However there are some points which are for television advertising.
Companies need to do that, they do these product placements to earn money.
Without it they would earn less so it is very important for them.
Another reason why it should not be allowed is that children want these things more and more.
In this young age they should not think about that because when they don't get it, they try to get it on another way.
These ways can be dangerous when they steal it or they steal money from the portmoinee of their parents, both illigeal.
However there are also reasons for television advertising, children can discover more, find new things and maybe new hobbies.
They can learn what goes on in the world.
They don't need to do it on the way adults would do it and the world has changed since our parents were young so we find new ways to discover the world, with technologie for example.
To sum it all up televison advertising is good, it is important for companies and stores to earn money but not when it is directed toward young children.
These things buy their parents, so there is no need to make advertising for.
I think to forbidden television advertising directed to kids is too hard, they should make a law to show customers theirs products on another way.
In the world of television is enough advertising so children don't need to have their own.
on the one ha d it's important for companies to sell their stuff to new people and also to the youngest of us but these kids mostly don't have money as I said before, their parents buy them the things they want or need.
It's good to show parents what they can buy for their kids but most of them don't get what they want just because of advertising.
In a store you get held from people who work there, in television you just see the product and don't know if it's good or not.
To show products advertising is good but it's not what the world really needs.
This statement makes it worth to think about if should happen or not.
Firstable it has some positiv and negativ effects.
I beginn with the negativ ones.
When the young children are crying you want them to stop, so you go to the  television and show them a programm or some something like that.
But when it does not has something for children to watch, you can not show them anything to them.
Also if the parents have no time for them to play, maybe they going to give their phones and than it could be addicted to it, because it spend then many hours with it in not so much time.
And now some positiv ones.
So if the children grow up without looking so much televison, they will not stay for a couple of hours before the television.
In their young age, the children will go outside if it has not something to do at home.
They wouldn't have the problem to do otherthing as just watching television.
The children will not be addicted to it like the other children.
So I agree with the statement, because it has more positiv effects on the children as negativ ones.This should be clear.
Sure it will be a bit more complicated at the beginning, but after the children grow up it will have positiv effects with it.
But I could understand if some parents hav not time to play with their children so much.
They could do a compromise, that they let their children watch the television with a timelimit, for example just one hour per day.
The question i am thinking about today is: Should advertising television directed toward young children (aged two to five) not be allowed?
It is a good question in the modern technology time.
I agree with this statement because I think, you can do a lot of better things than sitting in front of the tv to pass your childhood.
The main contra argument is, if young childrens be allowed to look television in their childhood, they can learn a lot of different new things for examples in  documentations.
This could save the parents a lot of explainig and they would be able to do more other things while their kids are watching tv.
An other argument is, that if the little children are looking tv all day long, they won`t disturb their parents.
So the parents haven`t that much stress and maybe would be a little bit calmer.
On the other hand, why should these little kids sitting on the couch watching tv the whole day?
They could do so many better things.
For example going outside and play with their siblings or neighbours, because a lot of the tv shows involve stupid or not necessairy things wich kids shouldn`t know.
An other advantage is, they learn so many different things about how beautiful life is.For this you don`t need a tv.
Without one they are at the fresh air or doing something where they are moving and don`t sitting stare at the same point for hours.
In conclusion, it would be the stupiest thing you could do as a parent, if you let your child passing his childhood in front of a tv.
At some points it would get really boring and the kids don`t learn how to interract whit other humans and maybe later if their are older they are not good with social relations.
Everyday we're overloaded by the informations subconsciously reaching our brains.
All the advertisements interrupting our favorite TV shows have become an annoying thing we have to cope with.
But what we don't realize is which impact it has on us.
More and more scientist claim that it has a negative impact on consumerism, self-image and our general self-value.
One might ask himself what does it cause in young children, who are not able to think properly for their own good then?
Considering the fact that television advertising is one of the strongest possibilities to create desires for something in the human's brain, advertisements directed towards young children should clearly be forbidden.
It's obvious that those children are not able to determine what is real or not and what will benefit and what will harm them.
So putting them in front of a TV where they are constantly provided with advertisements will have negative impacts on them.
It can even be seen as a tool for manipulation of our young generation.
If advertisement towards young children won't be banned, many companies could use it for themselves.
But even though the television programm is something which we can not really control, there are some guidelines the companies have to follow.
And since it's forbidden to show something inappropriate on screen while it's still afternoon we might say that the advertisement won't have a negative impact on the child.
All these rules are guaranteeing us that our children won't have to cope with sexuality, strong language and other for their age inappropriate behaviour.
History on the other hand has shown that such advertisements are able to cause huge hypes in young children.
While  about 60 years ago children were not exposed to such things, nowadays it's normal for them to want something they've seen on the TV.
It does not only raise the costs spent on the child but also makes them very materialistic already from the beginning of their life.
We're lacking children who are able to play outside with nothing else than branches of a tree and some dirt.
We're lacking children who are creative without any electronical devices and who enjoy the nature as we once did.
In contrary to that, there might also be advertisements who encourage children to be creative and develope their environment.
If we think about for example an advertisement on the TV showing the newest acrylic paint, maybe it might cause the desire in a children to start paiting.
And if we think even further, maybe one day he or she will be an artist.
I strongly support the view that children should be outside and be challenged to be creative.
In a reality where they are victims of the industries we can not expect them to grow to independent adults.
It's our job to create a safe space for them.
So we also have to provide them a world where they are not subconsciously manipulated.
Maybe one day we will be at a point where not everything has to be controlled by the media.
In the world we live today advertising has a great impact on us.
The industry has realized and has already taken advantage of that.
What we like, what we dislike, what we agree and what we disagree with is highly influenced by what we see daily.
It can influence our childre even easier.
Do we want to let our children grow up 

It is difficult to say if advertising towards children should be banned.
But it is true that it has a great influence on them.
Imagine a kid seeing an advertising on something offending content.
If parents do not intervene it might be likely that unconsciously the child becomes familiar with it.
But is it just to take their right of beeing free of choosing their of choosing what they like and what they dislike?
In my opinion their likes and dislikes should be influenced by something else than what they ses on TV.
Young children do not need to find the newest trends, fashions etc.
Responsible parenting forms their opinion much more than some advertising.
However it is impossible to introduce this idea of banning advertisement.
Advertising - mostly unconsceously - occurs in our daily lives.
I would like to prevent this from happening.
Nevertherless I do not think that television advertising has such an influence on children.
As a matter of fact, I do not want that my children spend their childhood on television either.
My concern is not the advertising but the TV programs thei watch.
It is commonly known that television can have a big impact in children.
Therefore we have to be patient and aware of what or chldren watch.
The question is if the television should be in position to speak and to advertise directly to our kids.
In my opinion they should be allowed.
Television should be autorized to show this content.
The other question is what they would show.
If the publicity is about toys and normal kid's stuff, then it's alright with me.
But if the program is leading to change kid's minds and tell them to do bad desicions, teach them bad manners or show them for example how to steal, then I wouldn't definetly aprove to this statement.
Parents have the responsabilty to be aware of what their child is watching.
Children's minds should be widely open and show them beautiful and great things.
I think television should be allowed to show advertising.
It gives children the possibility to see new things.
Television advertising

Television has been one of the most widespread medias for a long time.
It can target different audiences of all ages since there is a huge amount of different channels with content specified for certain targetgroups.
One of them are children, even under five years old.
While this sounds nice, there is a dangerous scheme employed on those channels: the so-called adverts.
Usually adverts serve the purpose of making money to finance the streaming of the tv-programs.
This is here no different.
But small children are easily influencable.
If they watch a commercial about a new fun game, they will often want to have it and will persuade their parents to buy said products.
And young cute children are espescially talented in doing so.
Compared to adults and teenagers, they do not understand the value of money and  have trouble to figure out whether a toy is going to be worth it or just a scam.
On the other side, prohibiting advertisements for a specified age-group seems pretty radical.
And it is not like only children below the age of five would fall into the categorie of getting effortlessly manipulated by ads.
Besides that, television is no longer the biggest, most important media: it has been overtaken by the internet.
Since even younglings nowadays get a lot of exposure to the internet because they already have smartphones, this might very well be the bigger problem.
But banning advertisements on the internet is close to impossible and would probably destroy the whole industry.
So getting completely rid of ads does not sound like a good solut

My opinion is that the parents should put more work into monitoring what their children watch.
Furthermore, they ought to explain them that buying the things promoted on television is not always a good idea.
A reason for such television adverstisings is that it may as well be funny for the children and that they could learn a lot.
If a little child for example loves television advertising it can have a lot of fun.
Another advantage is that it can give the parents more free time.
If the parents have a lot of work to do or would just like to relax and not always look after their child, the child can do something "alone" (without the parents).
It can also be very helpful for young children if they see a lot of different things which is the case with television advertisings.
A reason against those television advertisings is that young children usually do not really understand what they are doing.
This is more often the case with younger children which are for example two or three years old.
Furthermore, are many young children forced by their parents to do something they actually do not want to do.
A young child who is for example two years old can not decide what it wants to do because it is too young and the parents would not listen to it anyway.
I think that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because young children should play outside and have an adventurous but calm childhood.
If they spend most of their time with television advertising they have less free time in which they can do whatever they want.
Surely, there are some children who would love to do this but most of the litte children just want to play with for example lego or barbies.
Then the parents should not force them to do anything they do not want to.
I think that the children have enough time to do something with television advertises when they are older but when they are young they should be able to play outside with some friends and just enjoy their free time.
Televison advertising is now-a-days something which is normal.
Everyone, from young to old watches televison and with the televison the advertising.
With time, as the televison developed, the form how the televison works and what form of shows, series and advertising developed too.
In todays age everyone gets influenced by advertising and televison.
Our society does build up on that (exp: what's new?
What's cool?
etc).
I think advertising directly to the childern in these ages is dangerous.
The reason why is because in these years of childhood as a child your are developing and learining new things and you go on adventures on to find out how life works how do you as a human being and person funtion.. Advertising little children is dangerous from my point of view because your influencing the childern in a young age were thy can't build their own opinion about these things.
For me I think also parents who let their childern watch televison in such a young age is not responsible.
The childern should be playing and not sitting around and looking at little pixels, who aren't even good for their eyes.
I think what also is importend, is, what sort of advertising is it?
Are we talking about games, things you can play outside or just a teddybear they can have for sleep.
Would it be games I don't think it is go, the children are influenced then to play it and are getting even faster addicted on a young age then maybe kids do espacially these days were everthing is electronic.
If we are talking about a teddybear I think it depends on how the advertising is done.
Is it aggressiv or is calm?
If it is aggressiv like you have to buy this teddy I don't think it is a good idea as I was saying the kid can't build them self a opinion.
However, what for me is a big reason to say it should not be allowed is that the kids should not watch television becaue of their health.
It does effect the eyes and does not get better with time.
When they grow there are even more electronic things they have or want to handle for exp: IPhone, IPad etc.
What I also think is that from time to time we get even more addicted, by growing up and that should not start at such a young age.
Referring back to what I also said is the opinion they can't make themself, I don't think a two year old baby understands whats going on and what the advertising is saying or even make a opinion about that.
In the last few years television advertising has increased very fast.
The advertising is often directet toward young children.
But do the young children even understand the advertising or not?
Can it cause harm or not?
Children like to watch television.
They have their favorite channel and they watch television whenever they can.
So the diffrent brands produce advertisments.
These advertisements have a lot of colour so the children enjoy watching it.
When they see something they like they tell their mother to buy it in order to have something more to play with.
The channel makes a lot of money and the brands too.
And the children are happy with their new toy.
On the other hand, someone has to pay the toy.
And the young children have no relation to money.
In the advertisments everything is fine and looks good but in reality the things are often disappointing.
They coast a fortune but after a couple of months they break appart.
Adults can differentiate between a good advertising and an advertising that wants you to buy cheap stuff.
But the children are to young and they think everything is nice and cool and nobody wants to be a looser because he has less toys then the others.
I think that advertising should not be prohibited because even though the chldren want to buy something the parents have the last word.
In the end they have to decide whether to buy something or not.
In my opinion when adults buy everything their child wants it is their own fault.
The adults should be able to say no even thogh the children begin to cry.
If the parents are able to do that everyone will be fine.
My opinion to this statement is really clear.
I think that so young childrend doesn`t need to watch television which contained advertising.
I thing in general childrens don`t need to watch Tv.There are so many other good possibilities to show the children the live without TV.
For example: The children are watching an animal movie and in the break there is an advertisement for a hairshampoo or a special car or something else.
At the end the childrens are so fascinated from cars and all the other stuff that they`ve forgot the animals.
And why they doesn`t go with the hole family to the zoo and watch the animals in live so for the childrens there are no advertisements and they`ve been outside as well.
The parents can calm down from work and also enjoy the nature and the world of animals.
Or the families could also go swimming with their childrens because I think to be able to swim can save lifes and thats much better than television advertising where all stuff is fake and in a glamour world.
I know that the TV is financed by advertisement but I really ask me why there is advertisment on the childrens channles on Tv?
For what, they advertising on a childrens platform for a car or a shampoo?
Most of the childrens won`t be able to take these informations from the really glamour word into the real world and after that they will have big problems.
And they won`t go to the shop and buy the shampoo beacuse they`re too young.
In my opinion the television advertising shouldn`t be allowed on kids channels.
Nowbody will buy the stuff.
And for me it`s also a bit unnormal that 2 years old childs are allowed to watch Tv.
I hope that our generation doesn`t get their childrens too much into the whole thing with computers, televison and also not mobile phones.
My wish is that there is not television advertising or advertising in general which isn`t good for our childrens beacause they destroy the mind of our childrens and childrenschildren.
It has been often a topic of arguement and it shouldn´t get forgoten.
What I´m talking about is the television advertising directed toward young children.
Should it be forbidden?
Or does it be still allowedd to be shown?
Of course there are many different opinions for this topic and I´m going to present some.
In one hand you can definitely say that children of the age of two to five aren´t able to just turn of the TV when any kind of advertising is on it clearly.
Also they can not understand wheater they´re getting manipulated by getting shown some toys or any other things kids would like to have.
The aspect of the manipulation is clearly one of the strongest argument for the position against this kind of advertising because it isn´t fair to manipulate a kid as a adult person and it doesn´t fit to a morally correct behavior.
Also children get more easily influented than adults and this without even noticing it.
In the other hand you have several aspects for this kind of advertising: For example not only children watch this kind of advertising and with them the parents could get inspirated to buy their children something they really want to have concerning christmas or their birthday maybe.
Also it´s more likely that adults watch that kind of advertising because many parents don´t allow their children to watch TV for long, that often and without them being their to check what they´re watching.
To conclude it is important that some kind of advertising is shown in TV because not only adults like to get inspirated by the TV.
Also children should have the right to watch TV and get inspirated.
But at the same time it should be thought a lot about the advertising directed towards children so that they get inspirated but not manipulated, like some advertisings do manipulate.
As a child who's raised in a family with no television, I can only imagine this experience and use stories that I've heard so far.
Television advertising can surely be very interesting; that's why we watch it.
So if a child at the age from two to five watches this advertising, if daily or just from time to time, it maybe help to prosper its imagination and fascination of new things.
I'm not an expert, but if I watch an television advertising, for example for a new product, there's a chance that I'll get interested and start thinking about how it works, what I could use it for etc.
I can imagine that a similar process of thinking could start in the head of a  young child.
On the other hand, without doubt, it can be easily addicting.
The child gets used to watch something on television, and learns that you can spend time just watching television.
But to come to the specific part of the advertising, I guess there's a high chance that the child sees something in an advertising and it instantly has a longing for it.
For exaple, if a child sees a toy, which is offered as if one couldn't have fun in his childhood without this very toy, it simply wants it.
Advertising can be so manipulating, that a child doesn't realise what other toys it might already has, but just gets greedy about this new toy.
That's why in the end I think, advertising focused on children aged two to five should not be allowed.
This statement is a very controversial one.
It asks if young children (aged two to five) should get specialised television advertisement.
On one hand I don't believe there exists a lot of ads for young kids that age, at least not on a channel like Kika.
I remember that, when I watched Kika, there was absolutely no advertising at all other than for their shows during primetime or so.
Also, I don't believe that kids that age watch that much TV so that most of the ads made don't even reach them.
But I still think that small children should get to know what kind of toys, etc.
exist so that they get an idea of what they like and what they want, e.g.
for Christmas.
However, I do believe that advertising does make things look better than they actually are and the small children shouldn't need to deal with the 'real world' yet.
By saying this I mean the fact that the stuff being advertised may break easily or isn't as cool as it seemed to be whilst watching the commercial.
Also, I believe that most of the toys are overpriced.
As an example I have a little boy aged four watching his favorite TV show.
Suddenly, a commercial comes up speaking of the newest Playmobil boat that can float and be on the water, etc.
He thinks that it looks so cool in the commercial so he puts it on the wishlist for his birthday.
Then, his birthday comes up and he actually gets the ship and is excited and happy about the (very expensive!!)
present his parents made him.
He starts putting the ship toghether and then, finally, puts the boat onto water in the bathtub.
At first, the boat floats so he wants to jump in and play with it which he then does.
After 20 minutes of playing the boat starts to fill with water and gets heavier and heavier.
Then, it sinks and breaks and the boy is sad and crying.
Still, the company is happy because they have the money.
To conclude, I agree with this statement and after looking at both sides, I believe that there shouldn't be commercial for those children because usually there are overpriced products with low quality being advertised.
Also, I think that children don't necessairily need advertising to know what they want for their birthday or so.
In the following text i will discuss if television advertising directed toward young children aged two to five should be allowed.
On the one hand these advertising help parents to find new cool things for their children to play with but on the other hand the children get very influenced by the products shown on TV.
I remember when i was young i always wanted to have the thing which were shown on TV.
Otherwise there are advertisings like Durex or stuff like this which are in my opinion not good for the little ones.
Furthermore it exist ads like the McDonalds advertising which has a big influence, I have seen a movie once, it wqas about a man eating mc donalds everyday and in this movie they were asking kids if they new the hymne of the United States but they didnt know and when the man ask them so sing the song of Ronald McDonald they knew exactly how to sing it.
So in my opinion, there are different kinds od ad which can be shown to kids, because there are ads which are made for little ones and their parents like the babyborn ad but on the other side there are way too much ads which have a negative influence to kids.
Me as a child my dad only allowed me to watch KiKa because there was no advertising, only for there programm, but what he didnt know i watched super RTL secretly at my friends house.
The only way to prevent kids from bad influence is to forbid advertising on kids channels, so it should be allowed on normal channels but not on kids ones.
Everybody already watched TV.
It's normal and natural that people want to be (unterhaltend) and amused.
But children in age of 2 to 5 sometimes watch to much the TV.
But why?
Maybe the perents need some free time or have to work on something and that's why they let them watch the TV.
Children in this age can watch the TV.
It's not unhealthy or something like that but you have to regular it.
Otherwise it will be an addiction and that could be "unhealthy".
They won't make some new friends because they are just at home alone.
In this age, it's betterwhen children play in the garden with friends.
Children have a very big imagination and they will loose it with the age.
That's pretty normal but in this age where it's possible and that simple to imagine some cool games with friends they have to do it and let theire imagination free ;)

But the TV is not only bad for children.
They also can learn from the TV.
Some series are quiet intereseting and helpful.
An example is "Galileo".
My opinion is that every family has to decide for themself, but I think that it's better when the children play in the gardenwith friends or play society games.
But when they are watching once or twice a week the TV it's ok and it will not have any bad influence on the children.
Sometimes watching TV could be a (Belohnung) for the children.
Some critics believe that television advertising directed toward young children, aged two to five, should not be allowed.
Reasons for that statement could be that when younger children see the advertising and commercials on their TV immediatley want to get the item that is advertised even though they don't fully understand want that item, often a toy, even is.
The children could get unsatisfied with the toys they have at their own house, since children always want new things they can play with.
But since not all parents have the money and/or abilities to buy their child a new toy everytime they see one on TV, it could be better if the children didn't see any commercials on Televison.
But that could also be achieved in another way.
It is easy for the parents to make sure the children only watch TV channels that don't have any commercials that are directly towarded to young children.
Private channels only make money off of commercials and ads which is why there is no way around showing them.
In my opinion, it is better for a child to see commercials they can understand and get entertained by than an ad about something they don't understand or shouldn't see because it contains graphic or sexual content.
In conclusion I think it is important for the parents of a young child to know what their child is watching on TV.
It should be their decision whether or not they let their child watch TV.
If it was my child, I would make sure it is only watching channels that have child appropriate commercials and TV shows.
All in all I don't think advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
Nowadays watching television is part of the everyday life of children.
As we know not only tv - shows are part of the television programm but also the adverts in between the tv - shows.
Now I am going to discuss if these television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
On the one hand television advertising could be something useful, because that's how the children can come in contact with new products.
They learn more about the variety of products and can get interested to try new games etc.
Moreover the adverts aren't a big danger for the children because they just show new products, which means that there isn't the possibility, that they have a bad influence on the children.
On the other hand by watching televison adverts, the children get influenced on what to buy or what to like, because if they see a special product over and over in the television, they will want to buy that product one day.
Especially when the children are in such a young age they can be influenced very easily.
Besides that due to the television adverts they can't developp an own opinion of what they like or of what they don't like, because the television adverts bascially forces them to like somethig or to not like something.
In my opinion television adverts directed toward young children should not be allowed, because I think that it is really important that children especially in that young age, where they start to make an own opinion about things, should be able to decide on their own, without the influence of adverts, what they like or what they don't like.
Moreover it is more important to create an own opinion through other human beings like friends or family and not through a machine.
If you like watching Tv you may have recognized that there is a lot of advertising between your series or movies which always interrupts everything and is just annoying.
But moreover and even worse, the fact that not only adutls should be caught.
Nowadays advertising is even directed toward young children who are aged two to five.
Critics think it should be forbidden to catch the attention of these young children by showing them all the nice toys and sweets they could get for christmas or their birthday.
In  my oppinion they are absolutly right!
Having a childhood is the most important thing in life.
It helps forming your character and should not be influenced by television advertising or any shows.
If these kids always watch Tv and dont go outside to neet new people, to discouver their little world, they will never get the chance to be confident and to do things by themselves.
On the other hand the companies which produce all the toys or sweets and clothes do really profite by catching the attention of kids.
At least kids are the ones who beg for getting new toys and who are able to make their parents buy all the stuff they want just by looking cute.
So actually it wouldnt be helpful to stop the directly advertising toward young children.
Moreover by playing with their toys children can have fun and also enjoy life.
So why should we forbid this advertising?
I do exactly know why.
Children learn by touching, moving and feeling.
Not by constantly sitting in front of the Tv.
It makes them stupid watching a lot of Tv.
Besides even if they got a lot of toys to play with, we actually know they wont use all of it.
They will have their favourite one which they wont change for a long time.
Young kids should better go outside and learn something about the nature.
In conclusion the advertising directed toward young children shouldnt be allowed, it makes them even more watching Tv istead of going to explore the world 
They see all the nice stuuf and want to have it, which is not good at all.
In the following text I am going to find arguments in favor of television advertising directed toward young children and against it.
It is said that young children should not even watch TV in their young age.
They could become dumb and not educated, the should go outside or play with someone.
Nevertheless there are programms, in which you can see documentaries and earn education of them.
But even between one documentary and another one, most of the time there will be television advertising, because there has to be a way to make money for the people who are doing work for these documentaries.
On the other hand it is said that Televison manipulates people, children in the young age can be more manipulated.
Especially if this would be advertising about Toy´s or some stuff like that.
So if they watch TV and get education, that is fine, but each advertising is made to manipulate people.
When children see television advertising about toys, most of the time they want to get this toy.
The consequence is, that the kids want the toys and the parents have no other choice but to buy this toy or other stuff like that.
Toy´s are expensive and after a short time they get broken or the children are bored of these.
And further they watch TV again and want a new toy, which means the parents have to pay even more money.
If they start to watch TV in their young age, it could be fatal if they would get all the toys they want, because if they get everything they want in this young age, this will not stop if they get older than five years, it will continue and they will not learn to respect what money is, they will buy even more stuff with the money of their parents.
And if the parents do not buy the stuff their children want, The children will get angry or loud until they get it.
In the end to sum it all up it can be said, that watching TV does not have to be bad, no, it can be educating.
Only the television advertising can manipulate the children and educate them wrong.
On one hand it is right that television advertising directed towardyound young children should not be allowed.
Beacuase the influence of the television is bigger than we think.
The children do what they see on television.
They can not think what is real and what is just fantasy.
On the other hand I think it is not so bad.
Because the brain does not grow very much anymore.
So the influence of televisions can not be so bad.
At all, I would say, that every parents should be decide by his own.
Every person thinks different about television and children.
So everybody should do what they want.
But I think it is not good something to allowed.
Because it is just an little thing - there are bigger problems in our world.
I can't agree or disagree completly with the statement: "Television advertising dirceted toward young children should not be allowed".
At first why I'm in certain parts agree with the statement.
For little childrin, flashing lights and loud sound can be very disturbing, bescause their brain can't handle it at the same time.
So, it is not very healthy for them and doesn't have an learn effect either.
To make your child calm down or be distracted you shouldn't place it infront of a Tv.
You as a parent should interact with your child and teach him or her ceratin things, the television is not made for raising your child, which some parents think because there are a lot of teaching shows for different things.
It also can ahve the sideeffect that the child has to much energy left when it sat infront of a TV for quiet some time.
Well try to put a small child with to much energy to bed, you will fail constantly.
Now the points why I also disagree with this statement.
It depends on wich schow you watch with your child or if you watch the show together with your child and at which time.
When your child is very young loud shows with flashing lights should not be watched, insted look for something calm, so your child won't be hyped up again.
It is now problem to watch after your child had a long day maybe at kindergarden, if the show dosen't have certain effects, it won't bother your child too much and will even make it sleepy.
It also is no problem if you have rules for TV watching, 30 minutes a day are enough for a small child.
If you don't overdo it with the TV watching it also won't become something your child needs to calm down.
But still in both ways childrin should be outside a lot, espacially in their young age because the have energy which needs to go somewhere.
In my opinion it is okay to watch TV with your child, but only for a limit time like 30 minutes a day and than only one show, without attention keeping effects like flashing lights.
It is no problem that there are a lot of shows for young childrin only you as a parent can decide what your child well see or won't see.
So it also depends on you how much television you bring into your child's life because you and only you decide what's the best for your own child.
Still the television shouldn't replace your role as a parent to raise and teach your child.
In the following text I´ll compare the arguments which support or are against the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed".
First of all there are plenty of reasons to support the statement.
One of the most important ones is that young children who simply want to watch their favorite shows on the television have no other choice than to watch those commercials.
Little children don´t have an own opinon like we adults do yet.
So they would believe erverything the commercials tell them which can be very dangerous on the one hand or makes them loose their instincts for the reality on the other hand.
So if they see a commercial that shows somebody sky diving or bungee jumping of a high cliff they wouldn´t know that the people who are doing this are secured and safe like we do, they could try to do the same without knowing they aren´t just because it looks fun.
Moreover there are commercials like MC´Donalds that are trying to make their food look as healthy as possible on the tv.
We would know it´s fast food and to stay healthy we shouldn´t eat to much of it but a young kid without any kind of experience or an own opinion about things wouldn´t know better.
Cool advertising for Vodka or cigarettes makes them believe it´s something without any risks just because it´s on the tv and there´s some nice music in the commercial and a lot of impressive pictures.
On the other side there are special channels for kids like the disney channel which wouldn´t show the same commercials like adult channels would do which doesn´t mean there´s no advertising.
Channels like this would show a lot of commercials for toys with a lot of animation and effects so the kids ask their parents to buy them.
An argument against advertising directed toward children would be that it´s impossible to stop advertising at all because that´s what pays the salary to the people who work there and finances the channel itself.
Finally I would say that it is impossible to stop the advertising but not impossible to stop it for this age.
They need to show commercials anyway but they could direct the to older kids.
Television advertising that is directed towards young children has positive and negative consequences.
On the one hand it should be allowed for everyone to advertise any of their products, and not limit it to a specific age.
This is also difficult to manage or judge about, as it is never absolutely clear to whom the advertisement is addressed.
Assuming a decision in court would become necessary, judges must decide to which age the commercial appeals the most, which the advertising company might refuse to accept.
However, children at this kind of age (two to five years) are very easy to manipulate.
They believe nearly anything that is being told to them in the advertisements and are not able to polarize between wrong and true facts that are being presented to them in the advertisements.
Additionally, when watching TV, children are mostly alone.
Therefore, they do not have a parent that tells them what is false about that commercial.
Although here it is necessary to respect that most advertisements are not as aggressive, direct or manipulative as others.
These most definitely must be an exception.
For children at this age, an commercial is called manipulative way earlier than for adults.
When children are being manipulated on this way, it might result in a different judgement in their later life as well.
Concluding all of these arguments, I think that it is not a solution to generalize about this topic.
A relatively free economy, as we have it in Germany, needs to maintain that right and be able to advertise to everyone.
But as soon as it comes to manipulating young children, companies must be restricted in that freedom.
Overly manipulative commercials should be banned at especially this age, because it destroys the free judgement of the children watching.
Every mum knows it.
The moment when their child watches TV and suddenly screams: I want this!
or: Mum, I want this for my birthday.
But should it actually be allowed to put advertising directed to children on TV?
A big problem with children is that they want everything they see on TV.
When a new ad comes on about a new Playmobil school or Starwars game, they want to have it.
This summarizes up to big numbers of toys, which children want to have, which can be a problem for mums who don't have that much money and can't give their children the toy they want.
Other than that children see that there is so much more they could have and their old toys or for example the new book their parents got them for their last birthday is already forgotten and they want the next thing.
Wouldn't it be way better to forbid advertisement on TV for young children?
Children are influenced by media already.
Do we have to put in front of their eyes every new toy they have to have?
And is it even necessairy?
Kids should not be influenced and convinced by the media already in such a young age.
They should rather watch Teletubbies without screaming: I want this!
as soon as the ads are on.
The problem is that even if ads were forbidden, children would see these toys in a store or at their friends house anyway so theres no point in not allowing advertisement.
And what is a childhood without toys?
I am going to talk about the television advertising directed toward young children.
In the beginning I will start with the bad biological influence of the television for the child.
It can lead to cancer because of the power that can destroy the cells of our bodys.
We know about those facts so we should be more aware of it.
We should look out for our children because we are the adults we can't just let them do whatever they would like to do.
They are children so they can't think of the bad influences in the same way like we do.
But it's not even just the health fact.
It's also the age which has a big influence on this disagreement.
If you look at it psychologically, in this age of the children you have to talk to them and to be able to comunicate with them.
EVen if they can't reply you they are listening though and they are learning while you talk to tem.
Their brain starts to get more active and they can improve their thinking activities.
You have to sociate babies and children so therefore they can live a better live where they are able to communicate better with the people who are surounding them.
There was once a little girl her name was genie.
She has been beaten up everytime she started to scream or to cry so she did not say anythimg anymore.
After they had found her she was not able to talk to people even though she was in the age of 7 years.
So with that exemple you can see that the process of a good socialisation and of a good brain function it all starts very early.
It's an action and a reaction, you have to react on the baby because they see and hear more things than we could say.
We often think they are not able to realise a lot things because they are that young but that is actually not true.
You have to give a child a lot of affection and attention.
It can just learn things when you are talking and communicating with it othervise it won't be able to learn for exemple a language.
It can listen to a radio all day long it does not have a big impact on the child, it doesn't learn the language in the same way than it does it with another human being.
So to summarise it a little bit there are not just negative facts in the biological aspect there are also a lot of contras in the psychological aspect which you have to be considered of.
There are a lot better ways and alternatives how you could entertain your child.
A very good way is to start reading something for the child and start to show him/her pictures and explain them everthing you can.
Of course it takes much more time and energy than to just let it sit down in front of a television but the influences are much better for the developement.
Of course we can even see it with the geographycal perspective.
There are a lot of resourcess which could be used by far better than to be invested in all kinds of technical television.
So as a facit I think there are a lot of contras for this statement and I think we should start to think better for our children and their developement.
We can have an impact on all those things and we should start to invest more time and energy in the entertaining and learning process for the children of the next generation.
In the following essay I`m going to talk about the question if television advertising directed toward children, aged two to five should be allowed or not.
The most of us probably don`t like advertisment at all, especially when watching a good film and being interupted by an advertisement.
But we all know that in this century it is the best way for companies to do their marketing and to finally sell their products.
But do our little children really have to be confronted with advertising?Isn`t it enough if we are confronted with advertising every day?
First I think, for economical reasons it does make sense to allow television advertising direct toward young children  because they would like to have everything if they could.
It`s easy to convince them of posessing this product is nessesary.
On the other hand I think at their age they should have the right to watch television without any confusing advertisment.
Furthermore it is important not to only care about money.
And that is exactly what we do if even the youngest of our society have to watch television advertising.
In conclusion I could say that I`m absolutely against television advertising directed to young children because it isn`t good for their developpment and they should not be treated like teenagers or even like adults.
It is questionable whether advertising directed towards young children should or should not be allowed.
In my opinion it is not possible to ban this kind of advertisement, because it is up to them what kind of advertisement they make.
But it is also up to the TV program what kind of advertisement they show and when they show it, although in the end they show the ads they get paid for the most.
So it's not for the TV programs or the companies to choose but rather for the parents to choose what their children should watch and what they shouldn't.
What should be banned is false advertisement which also happens in ads for children aged two to five.
Suddenly the Barbie or the racing car is alive and able to speak and does fun things and the children in the ad are amazed and happy and the stuff seems like the most fun you could ever have, but in reality it's just a piece of plastic, and on top of that the most times overly expensive.
There should be a filter to what young children are able to watch and if it's not possible to directly ban ads from television the parents should think whether their child should watch this show or rather watch a different one where there is no advertisement.
Those ads are always for the newest toys or toys that appear in TV shows or movies so of course the children will want them but their ability of judgement has not yet developed to see that this is not about them having fun but for the companies to make money because of their lack of understanding and them getting tricked to want what is advertised.
Young children should not watch advertisement because then they grow up thinking that everything presented to them in ads is as good as it seems.
Companies should not make that much profit by taking advantage of them not knowing better.
to answer the question wether television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not, its necessary to define the question further.
Television advertising directed toward young children is talking about children aged two to five and about advertising the products made especially for them like toys.
Those products shall no more be advertised and shown in television.
The reason for this prohibition is young children being more sensitive to advertising since they can be manipulated more easily and don´t know how advertising works yet.
On the one hand you could say thats just how economy works, if your "target" is easy to persuade, you should exploit it, regardless of their age, if people working in the marketting branche  considered the customers emotions and if they really needed what they sell them, economy wouldn´t work.
Growing about, this children could also become one of those marketting managers exploiting young children, forgetting about how they were young and manipulative.
On the other hand one could argue its our duty to protect childrem and be aware of what we´re buying or selling, it´s not only about the children, everywhere everyone tries to make us buy their products, so we should at least protect the children until they understand that what is promised isn´t the truth.
In the end, it´s the parents anyway who have to pay for the toys.
I am not against the idea of forbidding television advertisement directed toward young children, I just don´t think, it´s the way how advertising should be handled.
In my opinion it would be more useful not letting the kids watch televison too often, but when they are, accompany them and talk about what they see.
In this age kids are more willing to learn and understand the world and their surroundings, so i reckon it would be best trying to explain the children how the marketting branche works, giving them the feeling of being important and grown-up.
Of course this strategy might not work for children aged two but in this case they can watch Tvchannels without advertisement and at this age they shouldn´t be allowed to watch television anyway.
At age three or four when they start talking better, it´s time to explain as much as they can understand, it´s not possible to avoid advertisement and it will never be, learning how to handle it and knowing what´s behind it is the way to go.
In the end, children should be allowed to be children, without being tried to be manipulated in the end and they should always have other options like playing outside or cuddling with th
The most negative point from advertising on series for kids is that they can show topics the children don't have  and don't want to know about.
If the advertisement is brutal for example or shows a kind of sexual situation the child may not be allowed to watch this.
It's not hard to manipulate children.
The advertisements can do that if they only shopw a short clip with a happy child with a great toy that the watcher suddently wants to have.
But that can bea positive argument to.The children can find knew stuff they want to have in advertisements.
If they need any wishes for christmas or their next birthday they can find them through advertisements.
Another argument ist that the parents if they watch television with they're children can see what their child likes as toys.
They might know that but there are always surprisings.
There is also the point that the children have to grow up.
If you seperate them from the older ones you push them into another kind of world.
Advertisements show you whats up to date in the world.
Maybe a five year old child doesn't need that but it's hard to seperate clearly what is a show for children and what is not.
And if you watch a series about a zoo or generally about pets then you have to sepperate.
Many children watch series like that so there would be no advertising but many older people watch it too so you need advertisingh to make money.
I think it's wrong to take advertising away from children because I don't think that it's good to seperate them from the outside world.
They have to grow up and you can't controll what children are watching if you aren't the parent.
I have the opinion that it's not okay to show stuff that has some brutal or other topics that are not good for children.
Maybe a solution can be that on tv channels for kids they don't show such advertisements but most of them are okay for children anyway.
I think if the parents don't want their children to watch advertisements they should watch out for them.
That is not the work of the publischer or the persons who make the tv programm.
My parents never had a problem with that and I think that is good because I don't like beeing sepperated to the older ones.
mybe a child doesn't care because he wouldn't know the another way round but I don't like the idea.
I'm not a fan of advertisements generally so I wouldn't really care if they really never show advertisements on childrens channels ever again but I don't watch them so I wouldn't have amn advantage and as a child I didn't care about advertisements.
I just don't like the thinking that we have to protect every child.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because children between two to five usually take after the exemple they see.
So as soon as they would watch TV they would quickly get attached to the item they saw.
As well it might be quite hard for parents to explain every time that it isn't possible for them to buy it at the moment even if the children saw it on TV.
It is also unfair because children like colorful things wich move or when they get older they like to play video games.
In the case of girls maybe play with dolls and advertising such things is so easy for a company.
It is quite manipulativ because children don't get that they need to resist the urge of playing with the exact same game as they saw.
For adults it is easier to know what we really need.
But even for older people advertisement still works, wich is estonishing.
So the idea of advertisement for young children is really intelligent because children won't understand that you need to spend money to buy the subject before you're even able to play with it.
For parents it is hard and exhausting to change the childrens thoughts on every advertisement they see plus they can be quite persuassive.
I think it should be prohibided because adversiment is already huge for our own generation and we react the same as small children but we are still able to control our feelings toward an item we like for children this might be much harder.
The effect advertisment has on us is with young children multiplied, I expierenced that when I was younger the same way.
If something had my favourite color I wished for it and the idea of having that item lasts mostly quite a while.
Watching television nowadays has become a common pleasure in the daily life of people at any age.
Lately, watching television got some harsh critics because of some shows, that do not have a good reputation.
But not only shows got harsh critics even advertising did.
So I will abord the statement if television advertising should be allwoed towards young children?
First of all, there is no harm if children at a young age are confronted with television advertising.
Children have friends and they get to know such things really fast.
Secondly, even without television advertising there is no prevention, that could abandon the knowledge of a child.
The child will get to know the TV sooner or later and even if it is later than sooner they need to learn to cope with it.
If the parents want to protect their child, the power is in their hands and they can not forbid companies for trying to make profit.
However, a child should play outside in its youth and not be stuck inside in front of a television.
Television advertising directed towards children is cruel and reckless.
The companies use the mind of a child because this mind has not a personal opinion and can be formed easily.
Children at a young age like whatever looks fancy, even though it may harm them.
Second point, a child can develop itself better without television advertising.
It is not influenced and can truely become the best version of themselves.
To conclude I want to point out, that it is the parents will what to do with their child and they should not try and  screw a profit for companies.
Because the parents are mainly important for the developpment of a child and not television advertising.
I would consider, that television advertising should be allowed towards young children, because I can not see any harm.
It is known, that tv advertisements often contain promises which they can`t hold or facts that aren`t true.
But unfortuanately, young children tend to belive them when theysee these advertisements on tv.
Therefore, many people think, that advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
An advantage in illegalizing these advertisements would be, that parents wouldn`t have to face the problem, that their children are crying or screaming, because they want to have something, they saw in an advertisement.
Another advantage could probably be, that there would be less advrtising on tv and so, the adults would probably profit also because of the fact that there would be less annoying advertisement breaks, when they want to watch a programm on tv.
An argument against the illegalization of these advertisements is that the children should better learn at a young age, that advertisements on tv often lie to them and that they shouldn`t belive everything they get told, especially not, if it is on tv.
Another argument si, that the toy industry would be affected negatively.
Certainly, this argument only affects a rather small specific group of people, but it would bevery bad for these people, who are working in the toy industry.
Also, the private tv channels need the money they get through these advertisements and so they would be affected negatively too.
Because of the reasons I just named, I am against the illegalization of tv advertisements directed to young children.
I agree with the statement that Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
At this age children are easy to influence.
They don´t have the ability to decide wether something is right or wrong.
By influencing the children, the parents get influenced as well, because the children talk their parents into buying things.
By directing television advertising toward young children, the kids get connected to the advertinsing and market world by this young age and are not able to develop their own mind and own opinion.
They have an opinion on whats right or wrong and what´s good to buy planted in their minds.
For economy of course it´s usefull to direct television advertisement toward young children because they win a new generation of customers.
A child will keep a brand or a product name, which it´s seen an advertisement for, stuck in it´s head for a long time and might even remember it when it´s an adult.
They are programmed to buy more things because they know from a young age, that buying things is a good things.
The system trains them from a young age that they have to buy stuff and that money is the most important value in this world.
And so, by buying stuff they just support the system and they don´t even understand why.
Nowadays, on nearly every TV programme there is advertisment and some of it is directed toward young children.
However, some think that this should not be allowed.
One reason is that young children who are only two or five years old are not able to understand everything they see on the television.
But when they see something they particualery like, they want to have it.
Even some new technology that their parents wouldn't allow them to have because they think it's unnecessary.
Furthermore, one could thinnk that these thinks are what other children of the same age have.
So, when they see it on television advertising the don't want to be outsiders.
This advertising spreads the idea that it is normal for children to have the things that are shown on television.
On the other hand, one might say that advertising doesn't hurt anyone.
What's the problem if children see television advertising?
They might want to have those things, but advertisment does not force them to buy the products they have shown.
It is a good way to show what new products there are and what there are for.
If parents don't want their children to see television advertising, they can just make sure that the children watch only programmes without any advertisment.
Personally, I don't have a problem with television advertising toward young children, but it's possible that I would see this differntly if I had young children on my own.
Right now, it has no influence on me and it's nothing I have thought about before.
I agree with the statment, that television advertising directed toward young children shounln`t be allowed.
Television advertising manipulates the thoughts of the viewers and espacially young children are easy to manipulate.
If a young child watches an advertising, that shows a spezific thing, for example a toy, it will want that toy, because it just saw how cool it is.
Young children aren`t able to think about things as older people and they belive what olders tell them.
A television andvertisement shows only the positive things and fitures about a new thing, bacause it should be presented as new and cool as possible.
Younger children don`t have the emotionaly strengh to fight against the positive image of the advertised object.
They just belive what they were told.
On the other hand are already many kinds of advertisment avalible and there are other ways to advertise an new product to younger children.
An argument for television advertising towards younger children is, that parents decide what they buy their children.
Younger childrens aren`t able to go to an store and buy the object which was advertised.
So if the childrens get manipulated by the advertising, not all of them get the product.
They must confince their parents to buy them the product or they won`t get it.
To sum up there is a problem with televison advertisemant towards younger children, because they`re to easy to manipulate.
That is good for the companys which run those advertisemants, but the children aren`t able to buy the product, they have to convince their parents.
I think television advertising towards younger children shouldn`t be allowed.
It`s unfair to promote a product to people who are not able to resiste those advertisments.
I fell it`s like television advertising towards younger children is like offering drugs to an drug addicted person.
They aren`t able to say resist, but the people who offer it might get profit.
Should it not be allowed to direct advertisement on television toward young children?
First of all the question occures, whether advertisement harms anybody.
And as long as it is not offending or anything compareable the answer to that question is no.
Because in the end, advertising is also just a way of saying what is on your mind out loud.
So if it was not allowed, that would offend our freedom of speech.
Of course it is hard for a child to see the advertisement for all the great new toys, which their parents can not afford, on television, but would it change a lot if advertisement was not there?
Because in the end the children advertise toward eachother anyway.
If for example one child has a great new toy.
which it loves, it will show it to his or her friends and they would probably want to own it too.
That is also nothing else than advertising.
But of course advertising in between children works differently that on television.
It is more innocent and if there would be less advertising those children might be able to think free with less influence on their minds.
Summing up, it might be good for children nowadays to have a less influenced mind, but to forbid advertising toward children, would take away our freedom of speech.
The question if television advertising toward young children should be allowed, gives a few positive and negative arguments.
One positive argument is that they could find new things and would try to taste them.
Like if the Kid doesn't like tomato's, but in the advertising is someone who eats one and tells that it is really delicious, so they would like to eat them and they get new experience.
A negative point is, that in the advertising could be games, which looks so good that the child wants it and crys until he gets it.
And so the parents would by it more, than if they don't watched the advertising.
So they get very influenced by the advertising.
I think that it is not so got for the children, because they could get spoiled if they become everything that they want and get influenced of the advertising of what they like and of what they don't like.
But in some case it is not so bad for the children, because they sometimes have no idea what the people in the television is talking and they don't even get whats happening
But for the Company it is good, because they can sell more.
The kids get more influenced than the parents or older kids.
I do agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
The reason why I think that it should not be allowed is that advertising in general manipulate people.
And the younger a person is, the more can it get manipulated, because the older a person is the more lifeexperians it gets.
For example: If I would told a child that 1+1=3 it would belive me, because the child was not able to collect some own experiance.
So if a child with an age from under five is whatching an advertising it will get strongly manipulated.
So if the television advertising is showing for example a toy than the child will think that it have play with that which is from there on really stressful for the parents, because they maybe think that the toy is too expensiv for them or just not good for the child, so they would not buy it.
But this means that the child will cry the whole time whitch is not great for the child and for the parents neather.
So after my oppinion it would be the best thing if such kinds of advertising would be not allowed so the parents have not to spent their money for some nonsence just because the television advertising is manipulating the children.
But I can understand why it could get difficult to ban those advertisings because where is the border from an advertising which is for children with an age of six and one with an age of five?
But all in all I am against television advertisings which are directed toward young children.
The statement that children at the age of two to five should not be allowed to watch television is not easy to answer.
There are many reasons why it should be allowed and many reasons why it should be forbidden.
Kids at the age of two to five are in a part of life in that humans learn a lot and create their own identity.
Televisionn could be a big help on the way to learn how speaking works.
Today there are many TV-shows like Dora which are helping kids to handle different situations of life.
But it is also important to learn skills like eating alone, go to toilet alone and so on.
It is way better to learn together with your parents instead of learning alone in front of the television.
Everybody knows how hard kids can be and if the parents need some freetime to calm down or something like that, the television would be a good point to give the kid something to do.
I think it would be a good compromise to allow kids watching TV but just a special type of TV-shows which are made for kids and maybe with a time limit of 1 hour per day.
I think it would be the best if the parents are finding a good balance between learning together with the kid and let the kid learn alone.
Young children believe everything they see on this big, bright screen.
People can fly, animals can speak and you can buy everything.
Television advertising makes them believe that and it has a big influence on them.
Thinking they can have whatever they want is dangerous.
Having a too high self-esteem as a child is often normal, but not always good.
Being selfish and arrogant towards other children is a consequence which makes them an outsider and sometimes bullied.
Having a high self-esteem is good, but being arrogant isn't.
But television advertising makes children see, what they want and what they wish for.
It makes them wanting to achieve their goals or maybe just write a wish list.
Crying until the parents will buy it, can't be the main problem.
The topic television for children is a difficult one.
How much are they allowed to watch and how much is too much?
Getting children involved with advertising and the whole marketing isn't always good.
They're innocent children, too young to know what's the truth and what's a lie.
The marketing business is tough.
People are doing everything to make their product seem great and perfect, even though it isn't.
Children can't see the difference.
Advertising is influencing the opinions of children, because believing what is said on television is easy.
If somebody one television says, bananas are toxic, they probably would believe it and not eat bananas anymore.
Advertises with dangerous videos, like bungee jumping or jumping off a house are influencing children.
They think it's okay to jump off a house and be fine after it, because somebody did it on tv.
The sentence "Don't try this at home."
won't help.
They won't read or overhear it and want to try it too.
Seeing so many different and exciting products makes children want everything, even though they don't even know, what they really want.
It makes them confused and believing, that they want all of it.
That's one of the influences and manipulations.
Children learn to get their own opinion.
They learn to see every aspect of something and then think about it.
But when they're so young, they can't do that, so they shouldn't be influenced like that.
I think television advertising shouldn't be directed toward young children, because they often don't know how to handle this information.
Especially advertises with dangerous content should be banned and not allowed.
Making children believe it's okay to jump off a house is dangerous and can hurt or even kill them.
It isn't fair to manipulate young people, who have almost no wisdom.
Forcing them to believe everything, isn't fair and managers or other people who produce these advertises know that.
Commercials are an important factor in our society, where you are confronted with advertising nearly everywhere.
Not only on the television, but also on the street, through shields and logos attached to a wall or on a car.
Everybody  knows this feeling: you are watching a movie at home and during the commercial you suddently become hungry.
Even if you just had dinner you have the desire to take the car and drive immediately to the next shop to buy a chocolate bar.
But as soon as the commercial ends, this overwhelming feeling disappears as fast as it appeared.
Obviously, this is an exagerated exemple, but it's pretty much the goal of the publicity industry.
They want to induce you to buy a product.
A child has to learn how to deal with the manipulation coming from the media.
If you don't get used to it as a child and learn how to control your emotions, it could be too late for you.
You'd  be constantly buying things you don't really need and be loosing money in the meantime.
You have to know yourself better than anyone else.
Especially your response to certain commercials.
There are researchers working only to find out how to stimulate certain regions of your brain and connect the product in question with pleseant feelings and memories.
So no, I'm completely against this statement.
Television advertising is always directed towards the group of people that should take use of the product.
Young children are easy victims for manipulation and especially through media like television.
So should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed or not?
Advertising in any form is very important for the economic stucture.
It helps the companies reach more customers and when it comes to children they can easily sell their product with the use of bright colors and happy faces.
On the other hand children are not well aware of what exactly is happening in front of their eyes.
A screen is often misjudged as reality and so they get diffrent ideas of what is real and what not.
When a children's toy is advertised when surrounded by creatures like faries and cute animals, it is not only the assositaion with positive fealings that is created but also a diffrent reality of a toy coming with faries and animals.
Through advertisments the child that is still in need of education by its parents is also told what it needs to be happy.
Children are more curious than anyone else and they want to know what makes the people on the screen so happy.
But this can create the thought that materialisic worth is the most important to be happy.
That might lead to jealousy between chilren and not worshipping things like friendship or nature that should be experienced and explored as a child and people at any age.
Parents should be aware of what their child is watching and wether they are being influenced too much in what they want to have or play with.
But forbidding watching advertisments or having advertised toys is not the best way.
By seeing what their friends play with what they do not have children might get frustrated and feel left out and beg their parents for that as consequence.
Companies and television programms are responsible for showing those advertisements so they are the ones who should restrict the amount of advertisements.
In my opinion advertiements for video games or useless, expensive things should not be allowed because they are not supporting the child's development or are woth their price.
In the 21st century television advertising takes a huge part in companie's marketing techniques.
Ads nowadays follow certain terms and conventions based on target audiences the specific products are meant to attract.
More and more advertising companies don't just talk to adults or adolescants anymore, they are also directly adressed to younger children around the age of two to five.
These specific kind of ad rises a lot of critical questions in today's society.
Young children are really easily affected by the things they see around them.
Wether they copy things done by people in their envirement or recreate things seen on TV or the internet.
Therefore ads directed to younger audiences are specifically meant to persuade children.
Even if the ad just introduces new toys or games, children will get attracted to it and will certainly want to buy them due to the lack of rational decision skills.
Children will then also persue to influence other family members whithout even noticing.
They might mention the item to a sibling or ask one of their parents to buy it for them.
On the other hand, ads for  this speci target audience are most often constructed in a non-offensive way and therefore don't disturb audiences watching them.
It also is a huge marketing platform for companies.
Even if the product is not entirely meant for childrens use, if the ad is designed in a child-like, humorous way it will still affect children, which as a result carry the message or the content of the ad to older audiences such as their parents or relatives.
In my opinion TV advertisement directly addressed to children is not problematic, as long as term and conventions of childrens advertisement are not obeyed.
At the end of the day a TV advertisement will not have a huge impact on children aged between two to five and will most certainly not change consumption habits of adults in their envirement.
I halfly disagree to the upper named statement because why should advertising to children should be forbidden?
Children up to five are also watching TV if the parents allow it.
If the mother or the father don't have a problem with dealing with the television advertising why should it not be allowed?
The parents should be able to know what there children are allowed to watch and what not so i don't think that it should be forbidden for all because it is not the
television that has to think about it.
Also a few spots are also interesting for those young children espacially things about animals or something that they can play with.
When i was younger my mum did allow me to watch tv and i would not say that the advertising was bad for me or my future.
Young children are often really happy when they get to see some cute animals or a barbie.
Maybe specific spots should be replaced to spots which are teaching children something about life or make the children happy.
There should not be a advertising that says that smartphones for this aged group are good or that a spot where they get to know what alcohol is.
In my oponion there should be specific times for the programm for the young aged and in the afternoon there should be the programm for the upper aged.
So that parents can easily let there children watch tv and in the afternoon when the children are sleeping the older ones get to see something they want to see.
I agree half of the upper namend statement because some advertising is bad for the children but some aren't even a little bad.
A advertising for children should have specific themes that children love like animals or spots for children based films an series.
But it would better if the advertising would be much shorter so that children get to see what they want and that the programm doesn't take too long.
At the end I summarize my point of view.
Television advertising should be allowed but not every spot should be in the programm for these young aged.
The spots should show things children love and nothing children should not see.
Also the advertising should be shorter so that the children don't have to watch a long time TV because of the long spots which are shown in the breaks of the programm they want to see.
This would also make it a lot easier for the parents to let the children watch what they want and they don't have to take care that something bad would be shown their children.
I agree that some advertisement at the television can be dangerous for young children.
Children in this age can easily be manipulated and are open for any influences.
In addition to that the children of the current generations are spending more and more time watching television, so the danger will increase in the future.
Children at this age can´t really see wether it´s a true statement in the advertisment or if it´s a lie.
Even in some advertisements where their parents would clearly understand that it´s not true.
The consequences of this bad influence could be that young children increasingly think that they need to buy things to be accepted and to be popular, pretty or even intelligent.
On the other hand the children will be sooner or later confronted by advertisements, even if they didn´t watched television advertisements when they were 3 or five.
So it would not change much to not allow it when they are so young.
Another argument against the statement is that advertisements with bad influece aren´t only at the television.
Young children can be manipulated and influenced by advertisments everywhere, wether it´s a mall or a supermarket.
So it would not help to keep the children away from the advertisements at the television.
I think only the parents should be responsible aobut their childrens well being.
They should make sure that the children know that they dont need things to be a better person and that the advertisements (not only at the telvision) aren´t always real.
If the parents are aware of the possible danger of the advertisments.
I don´t think it´s necessary to not allow television advertising directed toward young children.
Today, it is normal that televison advertises directly toward young children.
In this statement, I want to discuss the question, whether it should be allowed or not.
First, it can be useful for parents to occupy their children while they are doing other things and can't give attention to them.
The kids also find television very interesting so it is not hard to keep them watching.
However, it can't be right for parents to sit their children right in front of the televion just to occupy them.
The young children can totally be affected by it and can getting used to it.
Furthermore, it is damaging and can't be healthy for a young brain which is not completely developed.
If they are always watching TV they will be used to it and don't know anything else.
In addition to that, the children are obviously too young to understand everything which they see.
If they are getting older they finally understand most of it but the main problem is that they believe everything they see, so if there is a person in the television who comes very often, he or she could become a role model for the kids.
They will take it very personal and the advertising will stay in their mind.
They also want everything if there is anything that seems nice to play with.
To sum up, I personally think that advertising in the television toward young children should not be allowed because there are just so many arguments against it.
Finally, it is about the health of our children and we can't let it affected by the modern technology.
"Advertising" 

Times have changed in terms of raising a child.
New technology has come and nowadays can't be ignored.
Kids from young age on get used to a TV, a mobile phone and the computer.
With the use of the new technology comes advertisement.
But advertisment isn't only just bad and not good for the kids.
It gives them, for example ideas for christmas or their birthday.
It gives them something to dream of or talk about with their friends.
And this can also happen to children aged two to five.
Channels and companys need advertisement to promote of finance themselves.
There is no difference between going outside and seeing a huge board with advertisement or wathing TV and have a small spot between your show.
But there's of course not only "good" advertisement.
Many try to controll kids and promote things which are not only heavily overprized but maybe even bad for the children because it contains small things that they can swallow and in the worst case even die.
In my perspective advertisement should be sorted.
The age from two to five is one of the most important phases of a growing children and it's a learning phase in which they more or less believe everything you will say.
As a child I watched TV aswell and the ad-breaks weren't the most fun so I did something else.
This shows you that ad's have of course a impact on the minds of little kids, but they also have a own opinion and won't be controlled by the advertisment.
It's all about how and what you promote and what is allowed to promote.
That's is why I think that advertising isn't always bad, but should definitly be sorted.
Also it's pretty rough to only ban ad's for young children, because not only young children watch those channels and others who were wathing could be offended because they acutally wanted to see the ad's.
I think to say if it should be allowed or not depends on the commercial.
For example some commercialspots are really creative and should be allowed on the other hand some spots are to influencing towards the children should not.
For example if the commercial make it seem that you have to have the subjekt and can not life without it.
This is dangerous especially for young children because they believe things like that alot easyer than adults which is obvious.
But i think you can not disallow them because tv is for everyone.
To come back to my first point, pointing out the creative tv spots and with that i mean for example something usefull or real fun for the children.
I remember for example the spots for a summercap which in my oppininon is still cool.
Of course maybe they also use some unreal facts to make the camp seem cooler but that is ok in my oppininon.
Another example are the LEGO commercials because in their spots no one tells you that you need their products to have fun and they do not show anything wrong about their products to make them seem cooler.
So in my oppininon you can not really disallow television advertising for young children because it is a bussines for me the parents have to decide if their child should watch commercials and if so, they are the ones who should explain their child how advertising works.
Most children watch TV daily.
The amounts of advertising, may it be toys,clothes,food and what not, that flashes by is unbelivable.
Which leads to the question wether television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed.
The young children get introduced to greed as soon as they start watching television.
The constant flow of products that you "must buy and cannot live without" does have a serious impact on young children, they will soon start beliving that in order to be happy they need a certain new toy.
Its a phenomenon that even adults struggle with: the need to fill up certain gaps in their life with materialisitc purchases.
This is not something that should be introduced at such an early age, since it results in a certain self-destructive behaviour.
They are more likely to make bad decisions.The children are prone to spent their pocket money on these pointless purchases such as a speaking turtle.
Children would spend all their pocket money on rdiculous toys if they just see it on TV over and over again, convinced that they need it.
On the contrary though one could argue that the telvision ads may teach children how to deal with money  and teaching them the value of things.
making them realize that once 20bucks spent on a speaking turtle means that you may not be able to buy the princess necklace, or that with the same money you could have bought a bunch of candy.
teaching them the most basic understandings of economics.
Of course the ads may lead kids to wanting something, but by all means this does not mean they ll get it.
the parentsto do have a say in what their kid spend the money on.
This means that they will learn how to deal with disappointment and ho to get over it.
In my opinion the telvision advertising does neither ruin the kids, nor help them incredibly.
I dont think it has to be forbidden.
If parents want to protect their kids from the kapitalist part of our society the may just switch of the TV.
Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.
Young children are easy to manipulate, since they are not ablr to think as rational as an adult would.
On one hand it is important for making money and an effective way to sell more products.
Industries need to advertise there products to be succesfull.
Also it is in the hand of the parents whether or not they allow their children to see television advertising.
Also i think that it is better for the children to see adverstisement directed to their age than advertisement directed for adults since that could be worse for their well being.
On the other hand they might not understand that they can not have everything shown in the adverstisement and seeing a lot of great toys might make them think that what they have is not enough which leads them to be unthankfull towards their parents.
Also they are not able to think rationally about whether they really need something or not it is easy to manipulate them to thank that they need something shown in the advertisement to be as cool as the children on tv.
Which can lead to a low confidence and think that they are only worth something when they own the things shown in the adversisement.
To sum up I do not think that tv advertisement should be forbidden.
I think it is imporant for the children to learn that what is shown on tv is not the reality, they need to learn that they can not have everything and that they need to compromise.
It is impartant the the parents speak with them about television adversising to make sure that they understand everything correctly and that they do not need the best toys to be confident.
That is something that is important to learn at that age.
I think that comunication is always better than to forbid something.
Of course it is a big problem that children are very navie and believe what they see but it is important for the industries to sell their toys aswell.
Parents should deciede whether or not they allow their children to wath programms that show adversisement iand if they do deals with the consequences and explain the children the conce
It is a common picture in a normal houshold: Children watching television after school.
To most of the people it may seem harmless, but there is a danger hidden inside.
Advertising.
Many complaints about advertisments in television were recently mentioned by a sheer number of families.
Parents complained about how their children began to ask for more toys, specificly those which could be seen on television.
Moreover the wishes for candy and similar junk food increased more.
A small party consisting of concernd parents wants to disallow advertising directed towards young chilrden, but should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed or not?
First of all, it is well-known that advertisements are no good.
Studies show that customers bought a certain product 20 times more after having seen it on television.
The influence on our choices on products is very heavy.
The better an advertisment is, the longer we think about it, the more it settles in our brains.
Advertisment has a long history of sexism and racism, yet is has never been disallowed.
However, advertisments are not muteable.
They are at your bus station, in your magazine or even on your shirt.
There is no way to escape from advertising.
Although the influence of advertisments on children between the age of two to five is certainly high, the influence is going to increase even more during the age of six to ten.
So what could stop the children from being influenced and pushed into this never ending circle?
Of course the first thing to do would be to make the children stop watching television at all.
This might work out for a certain period of time but their friends might still be watching television and be informing them about the latest toy or candy.
To refer again to the question mentioned in the introduction, I think that advertising towards children aged two to five should be allowed.
There is no way that the children might be able to flee the circle most of the population on earth is stuck in
Children often don´t know what to do.
So parnets put them infront of a TV.
But is this really the right thing to do when your kid is between aged two to five?
If the parents have many things they have to do and the child is only annoying then it is a good thing to show the kid a serie.
It is not okay to think that your child is annoying but that is a different subject.
Through TV- shows kids can learn many things, e.g.
colours but also cultural normes like sharing to other peoeple or that it isn´t okay to hurt somebody.
There are also some shows where kids can learn other languages.
But on the other side scientists found out that kids could get ill from watching TV.
Young children can only see many many pictures which changes very quickly.
They couldn´t realize what happens and can´t understand what a TV is.
Also there is a lack of communication when children watch too early too much TV.
They can´t say what they feel or want because they have less words to use.
And in general it is better to care about the children.
When parents decide to have a baby then they have to spent time with her/him, even if it is a difficult situation.
Kids learn a lot when for example the parents read them something out.
They know how to listen and how to learn by heart.
I think it is okay for young children to watch TV once a week but only for half an hour and only if the kid wants it.
The shows must be checked by parents if it is a reaaly good one and don´t get the children be stupid (like the Teletabbies).
But there are many other activities to do.
The kid has to learn how to do something alone when he has nothing to do, TV aren´t allowed to be the answer.
He has to get a social life even it is a young person.
Otherwise they don´t learn how to share in real life or all those cultural normes.
So I would more agree with the statement that Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.
Nowadays children spend way too much time in front of a television instead of playing with their favourite toys and having fun with their frieds outside.When I was 2 years old or even 5 years old television wasn't an issue at all.I wasn't allowed to watch TV by myself, so I would only sometimes watch the news with my parents (if the subject wasn't too heavy for my age group).
But in the new generation of children it is very common to watch TV at a very young age.There are even are even advertisements designed to please the youngest viewers.Is that a good developement in our society or a bad one?
It's obvious that young children are easy targets to advertisements.
They see something and they want it immediately, not tomorow or next week,no, right now.
When we think of little children at a supermarket we get the picture of children comlaining, maybe even throwing themselves on the ground and crying in frustration for not getting something that they want really badly.
That kid maybe saw an advertisement for the product on TV the other day and now it aasosiates the product with the fun the children in the advertisement had with it.
You could say that children that young don't have a brain enough developed to assosiate anything.
Well, that's not true because a young childs brain works almost only by assosiatons.
They assosiate vegetables with disgust or snow with winter.
They assosiate their mothers voice to safety.It obviously only works if you repeat it to them enough.
So as there is almost as much advertisement as series and films on TV they are persuaded quite quickly.
So I don't think advertisement directed toward children that young is a good think,that it actually harms them and their relationship with buying and possessing products.I would even go as far as saying that the advertisements make them gready and harm their developement.
Many children are watching TV daily.
The time goes faster and the parents don't have to care about them.
Television has a big influence to the children.
They can be scared of a movie, impressed by a hero or even learn something about the life.
Near to all TV shows, movies and so on, are interrupted by advertising.
They can be good or bad, adventurous or stupid.
The advertises are good for the business, the children see some sweets or a doll and the want to have it.
They ask there parents to buy this stuff until they get it.
Without television advertising many factories would be closed.
The advertises are sometimes very long, so the children get bored.
They just want to watch something and all fiveteen minutes the show or the movie will be interrupted by adverising.
In this time the children switch to another channel and maybe even forget the show or movie they are actually watching.
But it gives also children who turn off the TV when the advertise start and do something better and healthier like going outside or make homework.
So many television advertises are dangerous for the children.
They see a man who can fly or somone who swims with a crocodile.
The risk is big, that the children are impressed by that and want to try it out by themselves.
That is very bad and dangerous.
I think advertising is important for the big business.
But I think also they are in the shows and movies for young children not nessecairy.
Advertises can have many influences about their life.
They are young and hava a lot to learn.
But it gives many better solutions to learn about something important about the life than TV andvertises.
I know that it's probably impossible to watch TV without advertises.
But maybe they can be at the end or at the beginning of a show or a movie, so the children would be less bored or animated to something they shouldn't do.
"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allwowed".
Can you follow this statement ?
In the following text this will be explaned.
The good things of television is that it could transfare things to children for example they better lern how to speak or learnig motorical things.
Also they are seeing new things and lern out of them.
They lern how to get along with people or lern to see things in an other way they have sawn them.
The parents are happy to have more time to do things without a kid.
But television don't have only good things.
Maybe the two to five aged children are sitting to near to the sreen and get problems witch their eyes later on.
Children can't know that they have to sit far away and a TV is magic for children so they are going to near.
When children have a own tv in theit room and know already how to use it they may get not enough sleep because the screen let the brain thinking that it is day time and they have to stay up and not to go to sleep.
After that the kids hadn't enough sleep and can't concentrate.
The biggest negative point is, that the children getting influensed from the televiosion and lern things wrong and everyone know things that you have learned wrong are very difficult to lern right afterwards.
The children couldn't understand erverthing and interpretate things wrong because they are made for older people and lern wong out of it.
In the end I would say that children should be allowed to watch television but only one hour a day and at a normal day time.
This time is a "golden hour" for parents where they can relax or do something without their kid.
Also they shouldn't watch erverythink because of brutal things and things that they are understanding wrong.
If I should answer the statement with yes or no I would say yes.
I agree with the statement above because of many reasons.
You can influence young kids easily because in this age you are very naive.
Now if kids see advertisments on television about toys and how cool they are they want to have this toy too.
They will ask their parents and annoy them untill they buy this toy.
You can say almost anything on telivision and small kids will believe it.
But if you don't allow ads on television you also shouldn't allow ads on posters or in magazines because they have the same effect on kids.
Big companies shouldn't advertise their newest product to influence children.
Parents should think alone about what they can buy for their kids but the kids will see new ads for toys very often and want their parents to buy it.
On the other hand parents could just be strict and not allow their kids to watch that much TV or just don't buy every toy a kid wants.
Almost everybody has a television at home.
When you ask somebody about his childhood many people remember the series, they watched.
But is childhood really only about watching TV?
At the age of two to five children are supposed to learn a lot for exemple how to walk or to speak properly.
Is it really good if they are watching TV at this time?
The learning process is important and TV hasn't any influence to the this.
They are only sitting there alone.
Bettter would it be if they are socialising with their parents: They would learn new vocaburlary and more.
Or playing at the playground with some friends.
Little children enjoy of course the fantastic unreal word, full of adventures, but it's difficult for them to see a difference between real and unreal.
If they watched TV with this young age, they would probably become kind of hooked on TV series when they are grown up.
When I was a child, I wasn't allowed to wath television.
And I was fine with that.Because then the childrern are forced to use their own imagination to have.
Or do some kind of "logical plays".
This are only a few reasons why television advertising toward young children should not be allowed.
It's the best time to learn about essential skills and better were not to miss this important steps in life.
Going out there, exploring the nature and being fascinated by the possibility of climbing trees is the only thing a child should care about.Having fun with your parents is so easy when you're little and this time should be used.
For young children it is important that they play outside with other children because the have to make experience and to learn things like riding a bike or playing foorball because that are things which connect the children to the world outside their home.
An other important thing for them is the sunshine which they body need for vitamine C.

Lot´s of parent´s have not so much time for their children, when they came at home after work they are often out of power and want´s to sleep, so it is easier to sit them in front of the TV.
Or when the weather is very bad they can´t go outside to play with their friends, so it´s sometimes better to watch with the family a movie when their are at home, that has the effect that the children are not bored and it strenght the relationship of the family.
Especially young children very like watching TV because there are lots of things they cant´s see in reality and it is very amusing for them to watch show´s like the Tele tubbies, but children can get easy addicted to things because the are young and didn´t really know what is important in live, they are more interested in having fun instead of learning because they often think it is boring especially when they compare learning with things like watching TV.
Watching TV can have good effects on them too, a lot of movies for children have more content than being amusing, they have influence to them, a good movie which is for example about friendship can show children that it is important to be nice and helpfull, they learn to be social and not egoistic.
On the other side there are sometimes movies like from the
It is not god for these children to watch television for a long time because there brains cold not process the informaion from the eyes as fast older people.
It is not good too because the children maybe copy the behavior of the characters from the the movies or films, but it can improve the speech from these children because they can listen hour for hour to people but they can't see the face from the person who is speaking because the sound is not the origional.
This is not good for the speech of the children because they lern things by seeing for example walking but if they see a character jumping from a wall they could try it because the saw it.
Advertising in this way is good for companies because these children want to get toys and if the see these they are very sure that they want this special thing but it is very bad for parrents because they have to buy this things else the children maybe cry.
The children get a influence by there environment more than older people because they learn to understand how there environment works and what the have to do and what they should not do for exmple walk lonely outside.
I thing it is not good to make advertising only for these yooung children because the language is realy bad and the maybe want to get these toys, that they saw.
Because of this reasons I think it should be not allowed for children to watch a long time a day television because it is not good for there brain but I think  a short time maybe half a hour a day is ok for them because they have to use these screen there hole life.
So I agree to the statement because of the reasons above.
First of all, an advertisement  influences their perception because they learn how things are and people act and personally, I wouldn't let my young kid watch advertisements where they promise very unreal things like
Furthermore, the brain is still in its developing stage in that age so the brain could get manipulated by surrealist advertisements.
Advantages are acted and mostly synchronized afterwards.
As a result, the voices are sometimes a few mili-seconds too late what adults wouldn't even notice.
However, the brains of young kids do and as i recently read it's proofed that a brain that often watches television can be seriously damaged.
Another point is that the television channel sometimes shows advertisements of movies they are going to show the following day, And even in the afternoon they sometimes show the preview of some crucial films, my little brother, for example, who is already eleven years old still gets horrific dreams because of such film excerpts which are shown during the mid-time break of a football match.
The only advantage of an advertisement is that they are mostly funny and they entertain that even little children laugh.
As parents, it's clear that you also want your free time in which you don't have to take care of your son or daughter and if you choose the right channel there won't be too many interceptions with advertisements.
Personally, I think television advertising directed  toward young children
Essay; Television

The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be not allowed."
will in the following essay be analyzed and end up with the opinion of my own.
At first there should be given positive and negative aspects of the topic.
To let children watching TV could be positive for the parents because they also have to cool down.
If they have a children which cries everytime for example but in front of the television it is excited of all those colours and doesn't cry, it is good.
so why the children shouldn't watching TV?.
Another aspect is that the children could get a more better use of words or learn new words.
In Germany there are many TV shows to learn english for children, it is easy because they explain every word for three or more times and repeat it.
At the age of two to five the children should be allowed to watching TV because of an hour could not be this bad for them.
Maybe when they are in the kindergarden it could be worse because some of the other children watches television at home and they talk about some series but the children who doesn't watch TV because of the parents of him doesn't allowed it, it can't integrate him- or herself to them for the reason, that at the society of today are electronic things, social media, the internet and also the TV is really important.
Another reasons is, that if parents don't want their children to be watching mad series the children could watch news and know in a young age many about what is up in the world.
A reason against that children watching TV in the young ages is, that they maybe get mad and starts crying, screaming and be really aggressive and angry.
Often the children can't get along with those many colours and the moving at the TV, it makes them mad in their brain and they could get crazy about it.
another reason is, if they are often in front of the TV they want it every time, like a man who take drugs, it is something that they think to need after some times.
So they always asks their parents to let him or her watching TV and asks them all time long, to the point where the parents say yes.
another reason is, that the children don't want to play with friends, they just want to watches TV, parents who doesn't look time for time what their children is watching are bad, because it could watches series or a film which isn't for his age and the children could get paranoia or something else, but it could be mentally destroyed.
In my opinion children should watch TV because the daily society it is normal to have a smartphones, or watching TV even at a young age.
But parents have to see sometimes what the children is watching so they can't watch series or films which are for older children or not good for their mind because they could be mentally disabled.
I see no reason, to not allow advertisments in the childrens program.
The company that sends the program out in Television neeeds to send advertisments too, because they need to earn money.
If they wouldn't earn enough money they  would stop their program.
Children can be infuenced easy, but they still have parents, that decide what they buy for their children and what not.
So I think it's right that advertisments are allowed.
When discussing about whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not you can choose between two different points of view.
There are several arguments that speak for and against it.
Nowadays, young children are already watching television.
Their parents prefer to let them be entertained in front of the television instead of raising them up properly.
Obviously, the children are confronted with lots of information but because of them being so young it often doesn't matter what they are watching.
They can't distinguish nor memorise the information they receive from the television.
On the other hand, allowing children to watch television advertisiments may lead to damage in the long-term as they start requesting the advertised products.
In addition to this, a young child may not even be capable of thinking on its own yet.
It may not link the idea of seeing a product on an advertisement and the idea of going to the store to buy it.
Also, children aren't even capable of going to the store on their own, so advertising for young children on television may really just be a waste of money.
In comparison, one could also say that in the long-term young children may really feel the urge of buying advertised products as they were introduced to advertising very early in their life.
In conclusion, I want to mention that, in my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be prohibited because it probably doesn't affect the children in the long-term.
I would even go so far as calling it a waste of money because it won't be the children who buy the products but their parents.
I think television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed.
In the following text I listet a few arguments that came to my mind while thinking about this issue.
Children of the ages two to five are way more influenced by prebuilt opinions than adults because most grown-ups can question different opinions and think about those critically, while children as young as the mentioned age are more likely to not be able to do that.
Therefore advertisements have a huge influence on kids and can make it harder for the child to learn to reflect their surroundings if they develop the habit of adapting other's opinions.
Although getting premade opinions on such things as toys and food could help children to learn reflection from a very early age which may give them a more mature view on things in their youth so they are familiar with critical strategies if it gets to a more important decision than what to eat for dinner.
Also parents can use advertisements to teach their children the concept of money and different values such as the right amount of consume but it depends on the parents if they want to educate their child on their own or rely on the scholar system.
On the other hand children this young probably don't want to learn about the values of a decent human life on this planet.
They only want to play with the toys from the ads.
To conclude I don't think ads aimed at children this young should be a thing because they are more influenced by the prebuilt opinions than adults and they would be more likely to adapt opinions even in their adult life if they aren't teached properly.
Altough advertisements could be used by the parents to teach children proper values and concepts but let's be honest: ain't nobody got time for that.
Jung children and television 

Every Person now, that children love television.
They look with realy big eyes, if you say they are alowed to look.
but a lot of doc`s andacademics are agenst television.
they have good reasons for this.
children under three see the pictures, are faszinated but they don´t know what happend.
they can not realise and don´t understand.
Young children learn "to be social" and a lot of ouser things with komunication.
they need a reflektion from the person they are komunicaed with.
kommunication ist not only the lenguage.
it is althou a smil or the bissy mude of her mother.
If children don´t get reflexion, they have a lot of dificites what studies have provet.
children have in teenager age problems with socialcontacts, math, sports, her weigth and alot of outher things.
So shoot television forbitten vor young kids?
it is a big question and a lot of academics impriesiatesd it.
But why is it than so diversed topic.
Because parents like the Television too and it is a nice thing, that they have a half our time to do ouserThings, when the child is sitting in front of the tv.
And at which age do you whant to take the cut if a child can/ cut watch television?
its are a lot of questions and a littel bitt of prograstination that is gulty for this situation.
but we have not to forgett,that the controvers in oure televison programm is alreddy a high discussion in oure society.
in this lands it are the kidsactors, in this country it are the brutal action szenes...

We cut do what we want.

When childrens not be allowed to watch television, thy can play and have a very nice childhood, so we many people in the past.
They dont musst watch television to have fun or a perfect live.
The Children can play withe thy parent or friends or they can go out whith al aged og five together with his or her parents.
Also it ist better when they parents read  a book for his child.
The don´t have contact with televisions and other electric things in this age.
The don´t need in this young age contact with the media of the world.
It is not importen to do taht in thei age Thy wont to have a nice childhood with much time outside and not in the livingroom.
Also the children dont understand what is wright or wrong what the people do in the televison and they do the wrong thinks, because the learn it from a show charakter.
But ther are many television shows for young children, who thy can learn, things for the kindergarden or the school, also the parent musen´t sitt the whole time be the child.
The child look on the television and make nothing els.
But the child can learn also in the kindergarden or with pictur books and not with the television.
I found children dont need a television in this age, because thy don´t understand this all and play whith friends or whith his or her perents is better than look the whole time for the television.
In my childhood i don´t watch much Television, because i play often with my sister and my parent.
When my parent had any time my grandparents came and we make much thinks with them, so we had not so much time to watch televisions.
But somteims we watch learnig shows, but than for on hour and that not very often.
Televison advertising towards young children?
First of all, do young children understand what the media says?
Because they don't really have a good memory so they won't remember a certain advertisemend when they are at the toystore to buy a new toy.
If they see the advertisemend they would properly tell their parents so they remember they'd like that toy.
So later on they maybe get it that's how the world works you ask your parents if you can have something and then you get it.
That's how the world works, isn't it?
No that's not how the world works.
Then he would never learn how to save money from a certain income to get something he worked for.
Some would say it is a bit early a the age of 2 or 3 but i think it can't be early enough to learn how the world works.
But on the other hand I loved my childhood it was such an easy time you could eat, sleep, play with friend and do what you want, so that's what childhood is all about.
The advertisemends only showed me at home what I could be looking for at the toystore.
So even today I don't really see any problem because if you want something, as a kid, you ask your parents so they have to dicide whether you get it or not so it is a question of education not a question of advertising.
Blaming the adventisemends would be too easy.
Thats's why I over all think the television advertisng directed to young children isn't a problem and blaming it for the huge amount of toys someone has is just way to easy.
It is a matter of education!
It might seem, that advertisements for children might prove usefull, as children can choose for themselves, what interests them, when they are offered not only their parents point of view.
However, there are many contradicting arguments.
For starters, a child is too young to deprict what's good for itself, and therefore cannot judge the value of a product, especially as advertisements are never neutral.
In addition, children are easy to be influenced by the television, and should be educated by their parents.
Also, children of that age are not yet capable of handling money, and most probably are dependant on their parents nevertheless.
Of course, children can always tell their parents what they want, but its still up to them what they actually buy.
Most importantly, children watching television are missing elemental time else spent with framily and friends, which normally provides much of future knowledge, such as the known words and moral values, social capacities and other skills.
But advertisements often use wrong grammar in the use of puns, taking not only time for the child to learn, but teach them wrong instead.
I therefore think advertisements are not to be allowed for children at such a young age.
In the following part I want to write an Essay belongs the toppic "Television advertising directed toward young children should allowed or not be allowed".
In my oppinion this topic is a very difficult topic, because some children in this age can handel this elctric influence but many of them in the same age can´t do  that.
In that way i think that television toward young children should be not allowed, because the kids can´t choose between fals and right TV topics.
They believe in that what they see in the Television.
But if parents are next to the kids and they choose the serie or the catoon or what they watch together they can reflect if the show what is in the TV is good for the kids or not.
When the kids watch allone some parts in the TV, I think that isn´t good for them to be influenced from many different and coulorfull advertising breaks.
All in all I agree with the Statement, because young children from two to five shouldn´t be as much as older persons be confrontated with big names of products and with their firm strategie to sell more products and to make more money with the small kids and their wishes.
I hope that these answer is to some parts correct, because I dont really understand the topic of this task.
The topic if there should be television advertising directed toward young children, aged two to five, is stated differently.
The advertisement could be a good thing for children that age, because these products that are being advertised are specific for young children in that age so they can't get the idee of having to want a plastic gun or other things that aren't ment for them.
Also through these shown products children could develope a hobby by finding a toy, that excites them.
And it shows them a range of what is possible today.
On then other hand side these advertisements aren't alwas good either, they could show sweets and unhealthy stuff that could effect the children in their life.
Then some parents don't take their responsibilty towards their children very serious and they buy them those things.
Also these children are very naiv this could have effections on their expectations of presents from their parents and relatives.
Another argument is that in those advertisments the price isn't mentioned which is why children just want that toy but their parents can't afford it, which could dissapoint the children.
All in all I think talking about this toping is a good thing and that parents should talk with their children about this, because every child reacts differently on advertisements and every child is effected differently by advertisements.
Also some can afford those things that are being advertised and some don't.
I think this makes a huge difference on how the children should take the advertisements serious or not.
Television advertising directed toward young children of course is a good way to advertise because young children can be manipulated easily with good ads but on the other hand is abusing this weakness to make a good amount of money due to the parents buying their children those advertised items because they love them.
Basicly those advertisments abuse the children and their parents because the children are made to want the advertised stuff and the parents buy it for them.
On the other hand these advertisments of couse help the companies behind the ads because they will make very much money out of it.
Parents should also try to teach their children that they can't get anything they see on the television just because it is advertised.
I personally would disagree with the statement that advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed if it is appropiate advertisment.
If the children are not forced by the ads to buy the advertised item I would totally accept that these ads would be shown in television.
On the other hand if the ads would force the children to buy those items because they are presented as an item that the children must have when they actually don't really need it, I would agree with the given statement because the advertisment is just abusing the weakness of easily being manipulated that children have.
If I had to decide if I agree or disagree with the statement in general I would definitly agree with the statement since even though there might be appropiate advertisment there is still more bad advertisment that forces children to buy the advertised item.
Of course ads should be make the viewer want the item that is being advertised but if the viewer is too young to decide what he really wants to buy they shouldn't be manipulated by these ads.
In the age of two to five years  they can't decide what they want to buy on their own and so there shouldn't be ads directed to them.
Today you can find in every house a tv and the most people can't imagine to have no one.
The most childrens starts to watch tv very early and when their parents or grandparents told them about their first tv they often start to laugh.
The first tv was in the middle of the 20th century on the market.
The movies were black and white and have a button for switching the channels.
In this time the most people can't buy one because the tv too expensive.
But when a family owned a tv was watching tv the "highlight" of the evening.
After the quick text I would like to talk about the positive and negative aspects of watching tv in the young age of two to fve.
I start with the positive site.
One argument is that the childrens could learn something.
In the channel for childrens are series where they could learn something new for example about animals, the nature or the world.
Also the series like the "Sandmann" in Germany is a adorable serie to watch, but also the news that are produced extra for childrens are a good posibility for them, because the people who worked there, explained everthing easy so everybody could understand it.
The first negative aspect is that the childrens often don't want to go outside because they realy start to like watching tv, sometimes because of that, they lose friends and in this age is to have a friend very important.
The most series for childrens are often in the early morning in the tv is another negative point because it's bad to watch tv at 7am.
The last argument is that some childrens are learning some bad things from the serie or wehen they switch the channel.
I think it's okaywhen a children watch sometimes a movie or a serie at tv but only togehter with their parents so the parents knows which film the childrens watch.
But in totally I agree the statement.
In our globalized and modern world media is getting more and more important.
Nearly everybody is always online so a question must be asked: If our society is based on media and of cause also on television why shouldn't we confrontate our children with television advertising to show them a part of our world and their future?
It is a fact that media is one of the most popular things we spend our time with and don't you think that children should learn about their artificial environment very eary to be able to stand their lifes in a future of media?
Of cause, it is important to show children their environment, direct them into a content future, but does media really lead to a happy childhood that is always a basic for a content future?
Media rather destroys childhood, captures young people, so that they are not able to think theirselves anymore.
It is a big problem inowadays that children are that early manipulated in a direction that supports the destruction of our environment, so nature, as well as advertising that promotes and forms a whole character of a society, a time.
Children suffer from high expectations of their family and friends, build up walls and hide themselves behind them.
Chatting via a computer is easier than verbal conversations but that does not form strong characters who are able to express opinions because there is no chance to form an opinion.
Advertising  leads to manipulation and people who can be manipulated are wanted in a society that aims for simularities.
Selfreflection does not happen anymore and don't you think that this danger of young people who may change the society by new ways of thinking isn't wanted?
Advertising a shampoo may not sound dangerous but it advertisement expresses a whole character of time and for me personally this character of time must be changed.
I want to offer  my children a childhood that forms freedom in their minds and no pictures of shampoo, dolls and cornflakes in their heads because the age of childhood even if it is not experienced in full consciousness forms a whole character and therefore the future society.
More and more children watch television all day.
That is why the question, whether television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed, have to be discussed.
First of all young children watch TV to have fun and to entertain themselves instead of playing with others.
But adults do it the same way, they want to watch their favourite series without seeng annoying advertising either.
So why should children have rights to watch TV without advertising while their parents do not?
The answer should be: It would be pretty unfair.
Children aged two to five can not really judge about questions advertising asks.
They cannot say, I do not need the things the people show to me.
It is easier to manipulate a younger child than an adult who can judge better and that is why it shold not be allowed.
On the other hand advertising cannot reach children.
They are not the group of people the advertising wants to react, because they are not real consumers.
The advertising has a direct goal: people who buy unnessesary things.
It would not be effective to place advertising in children's TV but in that point of view there is not an argument to forbit it either.
Although advertising does not really reach them, it is a question of morality.
People who cannot already judge about things, should not be influenced by television.
It would be better if they
Every company tries to get their product to the group of people who could be interested the most in buying these things.
So with any advertisements, does not matter if it is a television advertisement, an ad on the radio or adverstisements in form of print media, the seller of the product tries to hit a specific group in the society.
So some ads direct toward young people and some try to convince old people to buy products of the company.
The statement critisises television advertisings heading toward the youngest of generations aged betweed two and five years.
It says that adverstisements like these should not be allowed to be sent out by any television channel.
The very young kids are not able see through the advertising.
They just see the video in their TV devices and think that this product must be amazing.
They cannot build an own opinion on the product that got presented to them because their brain is still in such a young state so it is not possible for them to have some controversial thoughts on the clip they just have seen.
On the other side the kids somehow have to learn how to look at things critically and not just believe the first thing they see or the first sentence they read.
They will get confronted with this topic at any time in their life.
So why should we hide adverstisements heading towards this part of society when they get to them in a certain point of life anyway?
In my opinion banning television advertisings that are specificly going to young children is just something to hide the reality from them.
But it would definetly help if parents try to tell the kids what the advertising is trying to do and how it tries to manipulate them.
So the kids have a basic knowledge on how adverstisements are made and how they work so they do not just believe everything they see in their television device.
Television advertising directed toward young children - should that be allowed?
First of all there should be a way young children get to know about some specific toys or something to develop own decisions of what they like or do not like.
This will be important for their later life.
But the media today influence children a way too much.
Children always want to have the new cool things they saw in the TV because for them everything seems like a must-have.
The producers of the advertising uses colorful and loud gadgets in their videos to support this thought of the children.
So they make their profit based on the aspect that children can be influenced easily.
On the one side it is just a product like a toy for example, and why should the producers of it should not be allowed to make advertising for their product?
Of course they want to earn some money as well and they do not lie to the kids or promise them something absolut wrong, mostly they make children happy with their product but to reach this they need to make some advertising for their tool.
On the other hand a tool can make a child sad as easy as happy.
When a child sees a tool and wants to have it so badly and even all his/her friends have this tool but the parents are just not able to buy it, the child will be very sad and might not feel integrated to his group of age anymore.
Summarized, I think televison advertising for young children is acceptable in a certain way.
It should not be too much and should not be based on influence the children to buy it, just a simply introduction of a product.
In my opinion they are in a age they can start to develop a feeling for decisions in a slowly way, but in the todays media  exists to much supply for them, so that they are not able to have a wise decision.
Many children nowadays are placed in front of a TV and are left there all day long.
The problem with this is that they don't only see TV programms that they should not, they also see adverts that are directed towards them, The question now is if these adverts should be forbidden.
First of all it is a problem that little children watch so much TV in general.
There are a lot of things that chlidren that age should not be seeing but they do.
For example there are a lot of TV programms that treat the subject of monsters and other scary things that could traumatize them for their wole life although they are probably not even meant to do that.
There are also TV programms that are just meant for adults like horror movies.
If a child watches these kind of filmes it will defintels be traumatized because they don't understand that the things thar are shown in these movies are not even real.
They believe what they see in the TV.
And this also leads to the main problem with these adverts.
Children believe these adverts.
While adults know that most of the things that are said in commercials are exeggerated, children do not know yet.
If a character from their favorite TV programm says that these cookies that are formed like them are the best cookies in the entire world the children that sit in front of the TV believe this and go to their parents and want them to buy these cookies and the next time they go grocery-shopping with their parents they will be screaming and will not stop until their mother promises them to buy these cookies.
Advertising isn't a bad thing but when it is directed to children it is very manipulative and shows them things that are very unnecessary but they want them anyway so they go to their parents and ask for these things.
Often they don't even know why they want these things they just want them.
The problem eith this is that they are invented to this world of consum at a very young age so they grow up with this exeggerated consum if their parents do not do something against this.
The commercials bring wrong values to them.
The adverstising kind of raises the children towards a direction that is useful for them- also many years later.
For example: McDonalds.
Their adverts are very good and successful because they are directed towards children and tell them that McDonalds is very healthy and everyone is rella happy and if you go there you will be happy too.
Of course, when the children that saw this advert become older they will not believe this but on the inside there is something that still tells them about these values and connects them with the brand.
I don't think that advertising directed towards children should be forbidden but I think that the laws that reat this subject should be a lot harder so that this manipulatve advertising is not aloud any longer because that is the thing that we should worry about.
In the following text I will give arguments to the quote in the task and give my opinion as a conclusion.
As a first point there is to say, that children in this age are mostly not able to think about the products, that are shown in the text.
So the advertising can influence the children that much, that they want these product so much, that they ask their parents whether they can get it.
If the parents don't buy it then, the children can be so angry, that they have a big argue with their parents.
So in a worst case scenario, it can have negative influences on the relationship between the parents and the children in the future, if this happens very often.
Another reason for forbidding the advertisements is, that children can't even buy the products theirselves and so the advertisements doesn't have any impact on the children.
They aren't interested in advertisements and just want to watch television.
So the only effect of advertising is, that the children are bored of watching television because they can't watch their favourite TV show without having some interruptions by advertisements.
A reason against the quote is, that the children get a first knowledge about some products, that are shown in the advertisements.
In some cases it can effect that the children get a better education or that they have a better knowledge.
Another reason is, that the children can't buy the products theirselves.
So the products, shown in the advertisements have to be bought by the parents, which can decide, whether they want to buy it or not.
In my opinion, advertisements should be forbidden, because it is boring for children and can bring problems to the parents.
Too many televesion advertising and too many influences.
But is that right that that the children (aged two to five) should not be allowed to watch these advertisings?
Of course there are pleinty reasons against the television advertinsing.
One might be that the young children become influenced and directed by the advertisings.
If they watch them too often they might not decide anymore between lies and the reality in these speaches.
often, the producers of the advertising of toys lie to put their product in a better view.
the children see the toys and want to have them, but is that as good as everybody thought?
they have trust in a product which might be bad produced and in the end they will be sad if the toy does not work as they thought and how it was shown in the television advertinsing.
an other reason to "hide" the advertising toward young children might be that often the advertisings do not show subjects for two to five years old children!
Usually they mention subjects for older people or videogames for adults.
what do the children would learn if they see brutal videogames like the famouse game "GTA"?
yes, they would think that the people how are destroying cars and killing other people is "normal".
Young children learn from seeing and doing it.
It would be a bit extrem to say that they would do the same like the people in the video game or other advertising but in this case they will learn that to hurt other people with play guns or, as I allready mentioned in video games, is funny!
they connect the brutal toys and plays with fun.
Learning by doing.
however, television advertising is not bad all the time through.
More often, the producers of advertising are showing organisations for helping other children or to supply them.
the children can see these horrible pictures and often they want to help them because they can see their "same-aged-friend" in bad living conditions.
to conclude: of course the children can be bad influenced by advertising and be joked be toysprudcts but often they can learn from advertising which announces for help or non-smoking!
Also, the parent can controll when and which ad
In a time, when every free space, every gap between streets and houses are full of advertisement, webadresses and qr-codes, we are told to scan to see the latest trends, we have to learn how to "defend" ourselves against the masses of ads: Internet, TV, analogue or digital.
PopUp, Cookie, sheet of paper.
Those classical TV spots seem so innocent and informing, just like a learning program to get ready for the rest of the ad-world.
So should we present television advertising towards our young children or should it be prohibited?
Assuming, that watching tv-ads makes our children learn how to treat the aggresive product recommention, we have to accept that they evidently will be raised in such a capitalistical environment although they should actually focus on developing their own identity and learn how to socialize.
Aren't we consumption-focused enough?
Of course not according to the industries.
Sure, we could say that so young children will never remember the adverts they saw when they were at the age of 3 or 4, but anyway, they are humans, who have already developed a consciousness of what happens around them which determines their way of thinking, independent from their memory.
Additionally, that typical "ad-language" with its unnatural and super expressive sound can be understood by the grown up.
Children in that case still seek for conversation to develop their language.
Although the consciousness of reality and virtuality mixes in the head of children when they are confronted with animations on digital devices, a law to prevent the children from being raised by the consumption industries is unnecessairy.
In my opinion, TV-adverts can limit and determine the development potential of our children but the impact is not that heavy that parents should not be able to decide on their own on the raising and their childrens' future.
It would rather be better to trust in prevention and telling parents about the risks and the consequences.
The following text will handle the topic whether advertisment directed to children aged between two to five years should be forbidden.
There are pro and contra arguments which will be laid out.
On the one hand the idea seems a bit unnecessary and like a typical burocratic decision.
People might think that the advertisors should be free to make advertisments directed to everyone but there are more pro agruments, which support the stat
First, children are easy to influence.
In consequence, they can be manipulated by advertisments, also in a bad way,  because they do not understand the strategy of advertisments to make people buy the goods.
So they are not in the position to judge about the advertisment because they do not have the ability to decide what is good for them.
This could be bad for the children to be influenced in that way because they first need to learn how to handle advertisments and the advertisments should not be directed to them.
In addition the children are not the ones who would buy the goods, which are presented in the advertisments.
Instead they need to convince their parents and this could cause problems in the family because children can be very stubborn if they want something.
For the parents it might be hard to explain that the goods, which are normally  presented in the advertisments in nice ways to make the people buy it, can also be bad for the children.
In consequence the role of the parents is more hard nowadays if the children are influenced in many ways and do not trust the judgment of their parents anymore.
This should not be supported so it is not good to direct the advertisment to young children.
Instead it could be directed to the parents, who are more able to handle the strategies of advertisors and who are also the ones to decide whether to buy it or not.
Television advertising has become very popular in our community.
Old peolple watch their news on the television, the middle-aged enjoy watching movies while young people are wathing their favorite series day by day.
Children got entertained by the children programme on the Disney channels.
But there is also a younger group who enjoys watching television: the babies, the young children between two and five.
Should the television advertising be allowed toward this young group?
Is this group too young for watching televison?
The television advertising can be a good entertainment for the little.
If  the parents are occupied with their house work,the television can be an easy solution to make the children sitting calmly in their chair and not distracting the work of the parents
The little children have also a possibility to learn something from the television.
There are a lot of children programmes which have the aim to teach the children.
But there are also risks which one should not exclude.
The programmes on the children channels are not always that informative and helpful.
There are a lot of entertainment which does not make any sense.
$
The television can have a bad impact on the health of the children, their eye-sight can get worse by watching a lot of television.
In my opinion the children group aged two to five should not be allowed to watch television daily.
The television advertising is not necessairy for such a young group.
The children should rather be playing with their cars or barbies than watching television programmes.
There are better solutions to entertain the young children.
In this Essay the positive and neative agruments on the question if television should be advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed are going to be presented.
The first argument that agrees with the statement is that chidren should learn from their parents and not from the television, because the stories that are told could be disturbing or teach bad habits to the children.
Secondly the children should not be depandent of televion in such an young age, because sooner or later it will happen anyway!
And the third argument  is that children will want to see more and more from his/her superhero and will want to wach television all  day long, wich will have consequences on their health, because they do not go outside enough.
Now the arguments against the statement will be listed.
The first argument, why children should have their television shows and so on, is that they can have something they are passionated about.
But of course they can have other things they like.
Secondly they slowly get used to modern technology and are not overwelmed by it later on.
And thirdly, they have other influences than their parents, books or kindergarden.
All in all I think that chidren should be able to watch television even in a young age.
But in the end the parents can decide what they watch and if they even are alowed to watch.
That way the possibility is there.
Advertisement is all around us and we are exposed to it from a very young age.
Most tv channels depend on adverts which are addressing different groups of costumers.
One of these groups are infants as young as two to five years old.
This is a controverial subject.
First of all, young children are easily influenced.
They may not question the benfit of a product if someone else is evidentely happy with it.
They learn through copying others and thus are drawn to want the same toy as the fellow child in the advert.
Children of this age who are exposed to commercials and are often unable to choose whether they want to watch the adverts or not.
As an adult one is more aware of adverts and can ignore or skipt them, whereas children who watch tv usually do not differ between programmes or adverts.
This again makes them more vulnerable.
Nowadays though tv consumption is decreasing due to the availability of programmes on the internet.
The internet often containes more adverts which may not always be appropriate for children, therefore tv adverts are a better option.
Furthermore, infants are usually cared for by their parents who will buy them what they think is best for them.
It would be logical to aim adverts towards parents and not the children themselves, since the parents will be the ones who might eventually buy the product.
However, children should have a certain influence to what their guardians buy for them.
Adverts may help them to recognise the diversity of products.
In my opinion adverts aimed towards young childern ought to be appropriate and ther should only be a limited amount.
I think it often depends in the product that is advertied and above all how it is presented.
Children may be made aware of the existance of the product but should not feel compulsed to own it.
At first it is to say, that young children are in the phase to copy all things other people do.
So if a person do anything for example ironic, the child will do that too.
It is not good because they are learning bad behaviours in  front of other people without knowing what they did wrong.
If a joung child is watching TV in the night, there is mostly advertising with pornographic content wich is not good for children because they can get scared for long time.
At the other hand children ignore the advertising in the TV because they only want to see the series or movies.
When there is advertising, they change the channel to another series or movie.
When they have to see advertising they wuld getting bored and they do another activity while the TV is running.
In my opinion it is okay that young children are watching advertisement in the television because they mostly do not even know what is going on and only want to skip the advertisement, so they do not even see advertisement.
They do not watching TV in the night because they are sleeping and hopefully the parents are protecting them to watch TV at night.
And the things they are learning from advertisements is mostly goodlanguage what can be no formal language but they learn the all day-language of all people wich is not wrong to learn.
The series, the children watch in TV should not be allowed because they are getting more stupid per every year.
In the following essay i shall examine argument for and against the motion "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed".
The first argument that agrees with the statement is this advertising should not be allowed because it does support the high amount of watching TV which can have health impacts on the development of the children.
If there is for example a special ad of a toy which a kid loves it wants to see this ad and wants to watch Tv more often.
Another pro argument is that the manupulation of the consumer with advertising gets support because the industry does start to influence the children from a low age to for example ask their parents to buy a certain toy.
An argument against the statement is that a ban of the Television advertising would not solve the main problem: Children would still watch too much TV instead of playing in the nature or with toys; even the eyes or the brain could have health impacts because the motions and colours on the TV could be too much for these young children.
Another argument against the stament is that only the advertising has not a bad impact on the children because it is only seconds long and also has not any unfitting content like for example violence.
The last argument againt the stamenet is that if these advertising can not exist anymore the economy and companies could get problems.
Probably less people would buy their products because they do not know them or are not convinced of them.
In my opinion, the advertising should not be allowed anymore.
First, this advertising supports watching often TV at a young age which in my opinion is not good.
The consumer should also decide and have his own opinion to products and not get influenced companies and their advertising especially not at a yong age.
Many young children now a days watch a lot of televison.
And also there are a lot of advertisnets towardas young children.
Even some children from the age of two to five sometimes are watching televison about three to five hours per day.
But are these advertisments good or bad for the child and should the be allowed or forbidden?
There are many advetisements which are directed to very young childrens.
That is good, because when a mother dosen't has enough time for her child, then she can just put her child in front of the televison and the child and watch some movies which are made for his age and for which the child isn't too young.
And every mother knows that a child includes much time and sometimes they need time to relax and maybe for some women it's not easy to find a place where they can give their child during the day so they can relax.
On the other side, the grandmother could watch after the child because she would be happy and she has enough time to play with the child.
And only watching television isn't good for the child because in this period of his life it's necessary that the child can crab and touch things and only looking at different things on a televison is not enough for the healthy growth of the child and in a extrem case they can even get addicted to it.
I think advetisments towards young children should be forbidden because it only leads to problems.
The temptation for the mother is too big to just put the child in front of the television.
And this is leading to, that every child watches television the whole day and don't play with real toy.
And maybe later they get addicted to watching television and then they have some problems in their later life.
In the modern era of technology a massive influence is lead towards children, starting from a young age.
Through television, mobile phones and social media a new way of entertainig is presented.
Should advertisement directly chosen for children of young age (two to five) be allowed?
In the following essay I will present the arguments pro and contra the statement and lastly coome to a personal opinion.
First of the television is a great way of advertisement and information.
When children get personal advertisements they know exactly which toys they want to buy as an example.
The children can see the toys or other stuff.
It is a better way than magazines because you have more than just one picture.
There is also a contra side to that theme.
Children get easily influenced by certain things like advertiment.
The product is maybe shown in a really good way, but when that product is bought it is not that fun to play with or only the positive things of the product are presented.
A children of that age could be to naive to consider that, because it has not enough life experience.
On top of that children should not start to watch television at that age.
Children at that age just started to live and when they are getting there own advertisements they clearly watch to much television.
As already said earlier because they are so young firstly they need to gather experience in life and learn certain things.
Maybe they even get addicted to television and can do nothing else than watching tv when they are older.
After thinking about both sides I come to the conclusion that children should not watch television at that age because the arguments against it had more impact on my opinion.
Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
To start with an important point, why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed is,
that alot of young children can learn by watching TV, sure they have to watch a programm which is good for their age.
If they watch programms in diffrent languages they can learn some words and important sentences.
An other case is, that their parents have more time for themselfes so they are less stressed and they have not to pay money for an expensive babysitter.
It is also important to confront childrens early with electronic devises, like the TV, because actually you should have the know-how for these things, how they work, how to find the right programm, how to change language and so on.
If every child is allowed to watch TV, just partly of the day, maeby an hour or an half, the children could have more the same chances later at kindergarden and at school.
But there are also some things which are contra watching TV in these ages.
A child which is just two to five years old should also play with other childrens outside.
When children pass a lot of time by watching TV they have no time to play outside.
An other bad case is that there is a lot of unimportant, bad things in TV and children could be anxious after watching TV.
The parents also should not forget to do something with their child because it is important for a child.
In my opinion Televison advertising directed toward young children should be allowed but just partly.
Today, everyone is used to television advertises but nobody really likes it.
But for the businesses they are absolutely important.
But should it be allowed to direct them toward young children?
Young children are easy to manipulate.
When they see something on TV they want to have it because it is often shown way different than it is in real life.
The people behind television advertises know and learn what children want to see, so they create something that is stunning and cool for them.
For sure they also know that the children are the only ones who can change the adults opinions, so they buy the stuff for their kids.
On the other hand, it is good because as I said, the young children sometimes are the only ones who are able to get the parents to buy things.
When the consumers invest money on a product the workers form the shops, the producers and all the other people who have something to do with the production, do not loose their jobs.
Advertise could possibly also help the children to imagine how they could use some toys and other stuff, so it is usefull for their fantasy.
I have to say I do not like adversise in general but as a child I sometimes liked it because I saw toys there I did not know they exist but I really liked to have.
All in one, I do not think advertising is that bad and it is necessary in our generation.
In the following text I will discuss whether television advertising towards young children should be allowed or not.
The first point which supports the statement is that children have to learn to deal with wrong information which means they have to learn not to believe everything the see (for example in television).
Children in the age of 4 to 5 are already able to talk and to participate in conversations so some of them (depends on how fast they develop) are already able to decide between truth and lie.
In this case advertising is a good challenge not to believe everything you see.
Of course they need support by their parents who tell their children about the lies that may appear in advertising so it is important that the parents participate at watching television at least sometimes.
On the other hand you have to say that even if some children in this age are able to decide between truth or lies many of them are not.
If the parents do not take enough care of their children or just do not have the time the little people are put in front of the television so they are concentrated on something which is not boring.
This situation is pretty dangerous because in the case of less time the parents are not able to controll what their children watch or with what kind of advertising they are confronted.
Regarding this point you can say that children in this age are easy to influence by advertising lokking interesting.
If there is for example a new Barbie which is presented as pretty, mostly pink and maybe also has glitter in her hair, many girl can not resist and want their parents to buy it.
It is a pity that many parents are not able to prevent their children from lies or wrong statements.
Many children are very naive and stubborn so in many cases they believe  everything they see.
But due to this point it is unclear whether this really is a danger because 4-5 years old children are not able to go to the store and buy stuff they saw in television advertising because in most of the cases the children do not decide where they spend their money on but the parents do.
To sum it all up I can say that i agree partly with the statement.
Television advertising may not help the young people to learn not to believe everything but it also does not make anything worse.
Maybe it supports their naive way of thinking in a way but that is a consequence that should actually disappear when the children develop and get older.
Personally, I would rather read a book to the children than letting them watch television but sometimes time just does not make it possible.
This is why I think television advertising (if it is not too often) is not the best thing children deal with but the consequences (buying the product on their own) would not appear in the most cases.
I would say that letting children watch television advertising is not negative but more unnecessary because they can not buy
Today, watching television became for many young children a part of their daily routine.
The hours in spent in front of the screen increase as the quality of images gets better and the variability of different programms bigger.
Therefore, many enterprises saw their change in advertising on TV channels to increase their profit.
In this way, also young children get in contact with this kind of publicity.
But should it really be prohibitted or is a reduction also enough?
It is known sine long, that young children can easily be influenced by their environment, of which television also became a part.
By watching television, young children get in contact with adverts which were produced for teenagers or adults.
The content and type of this sort of publicity maybe isn't appropriate for their situatioun or age and can have an influence on their behaviour.
Children can also feel wrong cravings like faim or the wish to posses the same clothes as the people shown in the advert.
This is mainly because children identifiy themselves with the people or animals in a adverts, whose product they liked.
On the other hand, publicity on television can't be forbidden.
Many businesses couldn't sell their products anymore and only a few television channels could survive, because they dependent on the money they earn by showing adverts of businesses' products between their products.
If we want to save children from so called "dangerous" advertising, it would also have to be necessary to remove all adverts on panels and big screens in public, like those posters on public transport stations or in cities.
New laws concerining advertising would have been made which would lead for sure to many unsatiesfied businessmen and women who saw their freedom of market endangered.
I think, that advertising directed towar yound children should not be abolished because mostly because of the severe influence it would have on industry.
It would also mean an incredible amount of work creating new laws and even removing panels and posters on public places.
This would definitely lead to many unsatisfied citizens and a lot of unnecessary upheaval.
In my opinion, children would be better protected from unapropriate content by creating new places for family activites.
In this essaay the follwoing statmement should be discussed wether its accurate or mostly inaccurate.
The statement I am going to talk about is 'Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.'.
First of all we need to understand why televison advertising toward children coul be a problem in present-day society.
In my opinion parents who allow their children wathing TV a lot during the day, take a big risk about them concerning the own opinion of their children.
They may get influenced really fast and even stop thinking on their own if they realised that they may get everything they want to know in a simple TV-show.
This is really dangerous because they probably do not even realise that they are influenced and they may thing that everything they see in a TV-show is totally true.
This could be a problem for parents if the children get influenced really bad and than want to have everything they see in television advertising or even thing that it is totally necerssary to have like this special toy they showed while the televison advertising in a TV-show.
At the other hand it is necesarry to say that there are many TV-shows that are mostly adapted for children to learn about simple things concerning their age or they already learned about in kindergarten.
If a child is watching TV once in a while it might not be that dangerous to also show some advertising for children because if the TV-show itself is adapted for children this age, the advertising also should be.
The problem just does not disappear with TV-shows adapted for little children.
Firstly, its possible that children may see thing in TV while the parents are not watching and secondly children are also pretty likely to get obsessed with several TV-shows or thing shown in telvesision advertising even if it is adapted for them or even more because of that.
So to end this essay about the statement above there is a last, pretty strong argument agains TV advertising toward young children in my opinion.
Many parents struggle with the amount of money they have to pay for raising their child.
Good example for this may be single-parent moms that have to pay everything alone, raise their child alone and still also have to go working to gain money.
These parents hardly can afford money to buy expensive toys the child sees in TV advertising.
But if the parents can not afford this money the children may compare theirselfs to others and become pretty unhappy.
So, in my opinion TV adverising for children is not a good ideá because it does not only affect the life od
It is a difficult question whether television advertising directed towards young children affects them in a positive way or not.
On one hand it is very profitable for big brands to direct it towards them as children are easily affected by bright colours and more likely to believe what they are shown.
Many children probably learn about most of the offered products simply by watching television.
Quite often, though, through those advertisements children learn completely wrong stereotypes, for example for their gender or their age group, their body images or materialism.
Images transported through televisions like exaggerated nudity, sexuality in a wrong way and today´s beauty standards already affect them in bad ways that result in eating and personality disorders.
We all remember the times we were allowed to watch televison as a child.
All those funny and interesting shows and the advertisements in between were an easy distraction after school.
Often we would run to our parents afterwards and tell them of the new toy we saw that we want to play with immediately.
But is it right to show advertisements to young children, as they are extremely easily influenced?
Children aged two to five are still learning a lot about the world surrounding them.
They often don't have their own opinion yet.
That's why they are a lot more influenced by advertisements.
They want to own everything they see on television as they believe everything that is said there.
But they are also learning.
And if they are never confronted with advertisements they wont learn to resist them.
In this age they can't just go and buy everything they want, which means that the parents can still control them and teach them that advertisements only tell the benefits of a product.
If a child learns that and is able to do its research before buying everything that sounds interesting, it has learned a mutual lesson.
Of course it can also make children unhappy if they always want something they can't have and if they are never just happy with what they already own.
But the chanals for children also have to get money from somewhere.
If they have enough income, they can fund better shows that are better produced.
In the end I think that advertisements aren't extremely good for children, but they also don't hurt them.
Which is why I don't understand why they should be forbidden.
And if parents don't like their children to be confronted with televison advertising, they can just limit their childrens access to the television.
There should be enough other things that children can do that are more creative anyways.
Television advertisment is more focused on small children aged two to five.
Some people discuss about how good this could be for our children.
People always complained about how brutal television gets.
But advertisment should be attractive for the children this age.
So the advertisment is clearly structured to be harmless, they are rather cute.
For example McDonalds advertise with a funny clown, a lot of other happy children and small toys in their Happy Meal, that is a special thing just for children.
Their goal is achieved when the children gets attractiv to McDonalds, they want to go there.
The next step is that they run to their parents and ask them to go there.
Some parents say "yes" in two seconds, other do not think that McDonalds is that attractive.
But they take their children there in the moment they begin to force and annoy them because they want a Happy Meal and a meeting with the clown.
This is of course good for McDonalds and also good for the parents because they do not have to spend time in the kitchen to cook a meal that the child probably does not like.
So they go to McDonalds.
But here wait more negativ facts that positive: 
You have to pay money for a small meal and after two hours, the child is hungry again because the meal got more calories and chemicals than a healthy meal that stops the feeling of being hungry for more than 4 hours.
Parents should care more about their children and they should raise them right.
When childern know they can easily force their parents to take them to a place that is not good for them, the parents did not do their job to raise the children well.
Actually it is not fair to focuse advertisment on children aged two to five.
They are like just new born babys, they do not know anything about the world and its dark secrets.
They just can not handle the situation the advertisment gave them.
All in one children also should pay more attention on playing outside or with toys in their room with playmates or also their parents.
It is a bad sign when parrents leave their babys alone in front of the TV.
They also need to pay more attention on the surrounding of its child.
I agree with the statement that advertisment that is directed toward young children should not be allowed  because children can not handle the situation and parents just leave them alone.
If you want to have children you should spend time to  show them the world on your own.
You do not need advertisment to show them that McDonalds has got a clown.
When you take your child outside for a walk, it gets fresh air, it moves and it also can see that there is a clown in froint of this restaurant.
But then they do not connect it with having a meal in there.
In some ways the advertiser just want to get through the children to their parents, because they are the only one who got the money and who is able to take the children to its place.
Children are just a bridge to the other side, to the side of the parents.
The following task is to state whether I agree or disagree on the quote "Television adv ertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
First of all, it is important to know which gengre of all the things shown on the tv are shown to the kids watching tv.
In some reason it is important to contrast also young people with television and its dangers.
They have to get the chance to grow up with all possibilities of getting a bigger knowledge than others once.
But you also have to state the fact, that children with the age of 5 or even younger cannot desicide what is good and bad or even desicide anything.
So parents have to take care of them and only those can descide what their children are allowed to watch on TV or not allowed.
They already got the knowledge of advantadges and dangers in contrast to their kids.
They have to handle the problem if their kids watch some really awkward stuff on TV and cannot sleep at night or kids who are influenced by TV in another way.
But they can also desicide what the kids are allowed to watch and it could be very helpfull for some of the kids if they learn something new, helpfull and also informative on TV to get a great knowledge.
So all in all, you can say that there are lots of dangers in case of watching TV like dangers are our all problem in the whole world, but nevertheless parents have to take care of their children until they are 18 years old and live their own life.
So parents should also handle the kids consumption of watching television.
Maybe parents should get some help by specific people who know more about the consumption, dangers and its reasons.
To sum it up and state my own opinion, I totally agree with the given quote on the top which says that Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Television advertising is a very strong form of advertisement.
The main problem with advertisments directed to children is, that it makes them want what is shown in the TV.
Small children are very influencable so if they see a lot of TV advertisements made for children, they will annoy their parents by telling them: "I want this!
","I want that!"
They will become children who want to have everthing.
When they are children, that aspect of personality isn't a big problem because their parents are setting borders for them.
But the children won't stay children forever.
They will get adults and have an own apartment.
Thats when the TV advertisements really become a problem.
That aspect of pereonality that has grown through watching TV will get the overhand and they are going to buy a lot of stuff they don't really need.
That will cause them to live in poverty later in their life.
Another bad aspect of television advertisements directed to children is, that there are not only children who watch TV.
Other people will be annoyed by adverstisments for "stupid child stuff" and they are going to switch to another channel.
So advertisments for children are not only bad for the children but also for the channel that sends those advertisements.
The third an last bad aspect is, that it makes decisions even harder for children when they are young.
If their parents tell them, they can spend a certain amount of money and the children want everything, they won't be able to make a decision in short time.
The only good thing with advertisments for children is, that it shows them possibilities and sometimes, it makes them discover something they wouldn't know about if they didn't see the advertisement.
My opinion is, that television advertisments for children should be forbidden, because it could have bad consequences for their lifes.
Do we really want to destroy people's lifes just for a little bit of profit?
It makes no sense.
Everyone is telling we should protect children from war regions.
Everyone is crying, we should save the nature but how can we do this if we can't even protect our own children?
Television advertising toward young children is a complicated subject and brings up different arguments.
To begin, young children are easy to influence and are going to believe the publicity.
If a special product, developed for kids and good for their growth ( for example special items to play with) is shown on television, they will see it and want to have it.
But there are many unnecessarily things on television advertising too!
Children are not old enough to select good from bad decisions, especially when the television advertising are e.g.
funny-looking.
They want to have things which are actually bad for them or they are going to believe they necessarily need itmes presented by the advertising.
However, forbitting television advertising is not the best solution to this problem.
The best way to solve this and give security to young children, is to reduce the time they watch TV or parents who look after their kids.
Parents can decide which things their kids need and explain to them why buying something is not necessairy or some things not good for them.
Too much advertising is confusing children, they have to quit watching TV sometimes to discover new things in their lives, without general, good and bad, influence from television advertising.
In the 21st century technics and television are the most important things in life of the humaity  in the modern world.
Everything has to be on the highest standards.
Consuming is, in my opinion, a big problem in the society.
They lost the viewpoint on important things in life.
Another problem is manipulation and influence in television.
To produce series for every kind of age, they use advertising.
But how do I think about it?
Agree or disagree I?
Of cause, there are many tipes of how this advertisement is put into the television-sopes.
For example an english-talking girl in a fictional environment.
A sporty young man battles against the antagonist; always funny an far away from zhe reality.
Tele-Tabbies or other "freaks" dominate the every-day-life in the TV.
But is this the right way to confrontate the children with?
I think no.
I disagree with the idea of trelevision advertising direct toward young children.
Why should they?
Make the TV the children more intellegend?
No.
Do they learn something from these soaps?
No.
Another disadvantage is, that the children could be influenced (geprägt werden) in the wrong way.
Furthermore, the tension could be too complicated to understand; the producers have just the view of an adult and can not pu t themselves in a young boy or girl.
Because of this, they "überspitzen" the soaps.
And they produce soaps exactly for the two genders: a pink world with fairies and a glamorous kingdom for the girls and a blue world with dragons and superheroes for the boys.
Do we live in the 50's?
Do we have only male and female and every gender has a special position in life.
But were're a world with gender diversity.
Young children could be confused when they grow older and they explore that they're homosexual; but the television telled them: "There's only man and woman and nothing else.
Sorry, but this is defenetly thw wrong way to bring up the reality to the children-stop!
These series haven't got the exercise to teach the children what they expect in reality when they grow older.
A good example is "logo" from the ZDF: they create a way to tell the young children (5) the news and political structures in the world.
Less is more and the closer it is to the reality the better.
I disagree with the way of otday.
the can change sonething in m
Many people have different oppinions on whether television advertising directed toward young children who are aged two to five should or should not be allowed.
Nowadays there are many children who watch television even the really young one's who aren't even old enough to understand everything that is happening.
That is why they probably don't really understand the television advertising which is why it isn't dangerous when it's directed toward them.
The young children can only understand everything through their vision.
When parents see the advertising which often is about some kind of toy that every children wants to have they could take that as an idea for a birthday present or something like that which would be an advantage of the advertising.
But there are often children who act in this kind of advertising who are just as young as the children that are watching these advertisings which is a thing that in my oppinion should be talked about as well.
Children who aren't old enough to decide whether they want to act or not could be used by their parents for money which would be considered as child work.
The problem is that if this had to be forbidden it should be forbidden for every kind of television which means that they also could'nt act in movies or television shows and then again the movies would become rather boring.
All in all there is no reason for me why television advertising should not be allowed apart from the fact that the children who act in the advertisings are too young to make that decision themselve because often enough the young children don't even understand what is happening in there.
In this essay I will write my opinion to the statement.
I think it is a very important topic for the parents of the children because when the children watch tv the advertising it is a part which they watch everytime.
I think it is good for young children (aged two to five) because if they watch something they had never seen before what they like they want to have it.
But the parents must take care of their own childs because sometimes in the advertising are topics or products that the young children will not understand.
And sometimes when it is an advertising about for example electric products like a cell phone or something else the children want it too.
But in my opinion the children from the age two to five are too young for a cell phone because they do not understand how much money it costs and the can not use it like adults or older people.
The advertising must be for the children so that they understand the idea behind it.
And I think when children watch the advertising in the tv they want to have all of these things and that can be a reason for a big discuss with the parents.
But sometimes it is something what the children can talk with their friends about.
An other negativ point is when they watch the advertisings they are in another world it is not even real but the believe that all what the people in the tv say about the products is right.
And in this time when the children watch the advertising on the tv they can probably go outside with their friends to play for example soccer or something else what make fun.
I can say that the statement is totally right because there are many point which are against the television advertising.
The advertising take fluence to the whole life because the children watch it everyday and everytime.
So the advertising must be not allowed for young children.
No doubt about it, advertising plays a major role in our modern way of life.
As we are confronted by advertisement every day it determinates our daily routine and consumption behaviour.
Nevertheless, is television advertising good to be seen by young children?
Or should television advertising directed toward young children aged two to five be forbidden?
The following arguments and counterarguments are about to answer this question!
The first reason for forbidding television spots directed to youn children is the danger of their consequences: Young children are not able to realize the differences between reality and advertisement and believe in everything that is said in those televison spots.
However, advertisement is often exegerrated.
Thats the reason why advertising is too effectible for children at these ages.
Compared to advertisement of McDonald´s which is directed to children in a very special way it results in a lot of money for the companies and a lot problems for the health of the children.
On the other hand advertising directed to young children offers some opportunities:

It allows children to react and to cope with advertisement at a young age which makes them to confident consumers.
In summing up it can be said that there are some opportunities and problems due to advertisements directed to young children.
After weighing the pros and cons it is more important to me to cover young children from advertisements!
Television advertising is a controversial topic, especially if it is targeting young children.
As usual,there is not only one right opinion.
Parents must be aware of the "risks" if they let their children watch television.
They should be aware of the consequences of this useful "game" if they just want to get their children doing something.
Advertising targeting young children might have some positiv aspects.
Since young children are very susceptable for new information (including advertising), the believe everything said in an advertisement.
If we take a milk promotion as an example(considering milk is healthy): The advertisement is telling that every child needs milk in order to grow up and become strong.
Probably, most of the children disliking milk before the ad, will start to drink milk, since they believe they need it.
On the other hand,advertisement on television specified for young children is very dangerous.
Children are probably the most likely to get manipulated since they have not learned yet how to evaluate information they receive.
So if there is an ad for a chocolate bar saying that it is very tasty,good for children and even can replace a whole meal, young children are likely to believe in this.
Furthermore, advertising directed toward young children teachs them materialistic values already in their young age.
In conclusion, the negative aspects overweigh the positive ones.
Even though parents have a certain responsibility for their children, it is unreasonable to place specific advertising for children of that young age.
It is not necessary to make our children already "adicted" when they are 4 or 5, not to television and not to other promoted goods including lots of sugar etc.
Therefore, we need to be careful what we promot.
Tody the most of the parents of young children have not much time for their small children.
So they turn on the TV and sit the child before it.
So if they watch TV there are some advertisments directed toward young children (aged two to five).
Schould these advertisement are not be allowed?
On the one hand are young children easy to covince.
They dont ask if something is good or bad for them, they just belive it if a anime figure said that.
So the TV advertisement could achife that the children are not able to build an own opinion if they belive everything in young years.
On the other hand parentes they do not want their cildren watching TV could give them to a day mother ore to the kindergarden.
Generally parentes who let their cildren watcing TV in such young years should not have children becase either they worke so much that they havent time for a kid or the dont want to have time with a kid.
Secondly is there no right witch could forbide TV advertisment just for children in yound years.
All in all I think that TV advertrisment for two to five years old children should be allowed because if the kid watch in these young years TV the parentes do not do a good job.
It is up to them.
There are different types of television advertisements, that we are day by day confronted with.
Some of them contain a drink (for example Fanta), some of them contain toys(for example Lego).
Some people think that this could have a bad influence to young children between two and five years old.
But is this true?
Should television advertising directed to children not be allowed?
Most of the television advertisements are completely harmless for children in that age.
(drinks, toys, holydays...).
I personally watched a lot of TV when I was about five and I saw those kinds of advertising too, but it didn't take any impact on me.
I thought nothing about it.
For me, those kind of advertising aren't dangerous for children.
Besindes that, children often watch TV shows that are specially made for children in that age (for example TOGGO or KIKA).
If there is some kind of advertising, the producers are told to make it some kind of harmless for them.
In my case, I seldom watched TV with my parents of my older brother.
If I did, my mother had always an eye on me, what I was about to see.
But that didn't involve any advertising.
We never thought about it in a dangerous way.
If an advertisement should animat a child to buy something, it has to ask their parents first.
So they have the last word about it.
It doesn't pose any risk if a five year old wants a playmobile-house, but the father says "no".
Parents must be a able to deny something to their children, so this can't be an argument to forbid television advertising to children.
So in my opinion it doesn't make any difference if a five year old child sees television advertising or not.
It mostly depends on the parents how they teach their children to deal with this kind of things.
If their doing well, no five year old boy or girl can be harmed by a simple advertisement.
We all know the doll, racer or horse advertisements on television.
Now exactly these adverts to young children are controversely discussed in society.
One uncritisised fact is that parents get problems on their weekly shopping tours after their child has seen the new pink Barbie doll on television.
What follows is crying in the supermarket... the conclusion: sad children and angry and helpless parents or a happy child and poorer and frustrated parents.
A child of this age can not think about its wishes and their pros and cons.
They want it all and they want it now - no matter what it costs.
And this is the aim of it, isn´t it?
Those firms could address the childrens parents instead, persuade them to buy these toys for their children.
But they don´t.
That would mean less profit in most cases.
But isn´t it the parents` own fault?
If they did not let their children watch TV, these kids would not see any advertisement that raises their wishes of new toys and games.
But let us be realistic; it is not possible to keep your children isolated from all TV influences until they go to school.
It is not in their parents control what they do when they are with friends or in the kindergarden.
So to draw a conclusion I can say that the aim of TV advertisements directed toward young children is to make more profit by raising the childrens wishes and force their parents to buy the advertised toy or game.
This is why I think that it should be forbidden.
It is unfair trying to raise one´s profit by using the relationship between parent and child than just try to convince the parents with the product itself.
Advertisement is all around us.
We see it on TV, in the newspapers and around us in the city.
Especially younger children fall for these advertisements easily.
So should advertising for young children be allowed ?
Firstly, especially young children are easily manipulated which is greatly taken advantage of by the industry.
Children rarely think about something they see in an advertisement on TV and just see the new toy they must have.
This problem, on the other hand, would appear at an older age if advertisemnt were banned since children are not used to them and would just fall for the advertisemt then which would just delay the problem and not solve it.
Secondly, there is advertisement for goods that are not supposed to be seen by childreen but you can still find them on TV  which is not intended but it is hard to controll so a ban would help.
Advertisements are for all people and so they should be allowed.
It is very hard to advertise in public if this is not allowed for children which would cost a lot of money.
There are products for children that are useful and banning advertisements for them would just be unfair since the ban to totally fail doing what it is supposed ti do.
There are some products that are not useful and should be banned but this should not be done with a general ban.
To conclude, there are advertisements that should be banned but firstly it is very hardly achievable if at all and
In this century television becomes more and more important esspecialy for the younger generations.
Now I am going to comment on the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
An argument for this statement is that children in this age can be influenced very easiely by what they see or hear.
That means if these children watch television and see specific advertising for a new product they will be very interested in it.
On this way the television can have a big influence on the children.
But it is also important to say that this influence can be very positive.
For example if there is an advertising for things you use outside like an bike or something like this.
This child wants to play outside where it could meet other children in its age and make some new friends.
This is a very positive influence on the social life.
An other argument against it is that children in this age are to young and have not enought experiences in their lifes to know what is good for them and whats not.
That means that the child does not know if it is positive for him or not.
To draw a conclusion I can say that the influence of televison advetising is very big on children.
So it is very important that the parents, but also the television, have a closer look on what the children see there and if it is good for them or not.
It is not possible to take away every influences from
It has always been a controversial topic if advertisements in e.g.
television should be directed at young children in the age of up to five years.
Or if it even has to be forbidden.
Up until today, toy companies have the upper hand and every child can see their ads in the break of the favourite cartoon.
The problem most people have with adivertisements for the younger children ist that they are very easy to influence.
The ad can tell them anything an they will believe it.
They don't have the experiene a grown up person has.
Also the parents can control what their child is watching in TV but hardly what they see during the advertising break.
On the other hand advertisements always have that very aspect that everyone can discover new products that fit in their life, even the smaller folks.
Secondly every company has the right to advertise their products to a certain level.
Apart from probably being against the law, it would heavily damage many toy companies.
Another problem is where you draw the line.
Every company could just claim that their advertisement only interests children above the age of five.
So if it would be possible to just not allow some companies to advertise their products, why should we make a difference in ads that are directed toward elderly people or how can anyone guarantee that a law state like that doesn't get missused by corrupt poeple.
All in all a law like that would maybe make sense on first sight but in reality is just not going to be possible.
And even if it were there, companies would always find a way to go around it.
In the following text I analyse the state arguments for and against the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" and after that my own opinion.
Many people are convinced, that advertising might have a negative influence towards children.
If it refers to children's advertising, the only harm which will follow, is that the parents might get annoyed by their children's wishes to get new things to play with.
Moreover, earlier or later children are confronted with the consume of advertising in our society.
Its necessary to remember: Children's advertising only shows some playthings, and that, very short.
Maybe children are influnced to want to have what is shown in TV.
But especially at this age they should learn that they could not get everything they want.
If the parents want to prevent the contact between children and advertising, children cannot even leave the house, because we are surrounded by it.
In general I think advertising for cildren is not very harmful.
Firstly, its their parents challange to prepare them for becoming an adult.
And as long as advertising is a part of our daily life, childrens should be teached to get along with it.
In spite of preventing the contact between them and the advertising, I think it is better to teach them why it is shown in TV and that they cannot get everything they want.
So I do not agree with the statement.
The world with all it's developement sometimes shows cruel faces.
Manipulating human beings in order to make them buy things they don't need and make them want things they didn't think of before, is a widley accepted way of advertisement.
Shops have their ways of manipulating people, and so do the companies.
But a big impact for sure has found television.
We now have to ask ourselfs how far we want it to go.
This is what leads us to the question if television advertising directed towards children aged two to five should be allowed or not.
First of all, we have to define what that actually means.
In my understandig, this are advertisements in the TV that are made in a way, that small children understand what it is about.
They should probably lead a child to wanting something, and making his parents buy it.
Should this form of advertisement be accapted or not?
Obviously children that age are affected a lot by the surrounding.
But TV advertisements nowadays are not all made for children.
There are a lot of half naked women and men, trying to make you belive you get a sixpack by buying a parfume.
We have to ask ourselfs if an advertisment directed towards children, and therefore made for children, really is that bad.
Manipulating children is obviously sounding really harsh and like something we wouldn't want.
But how far would our children be affacted by it anyways?
A kid aged two to five should not be watching TV for too long, but rather play or be outside.
An advert it sees in the evening for a short timeperiod should therefore not really have an impact on its life.
I do belive that there are already a lot of adverts directed towards children in TV, and in my opinion,that is okey.
I would rather have my child watch an adverd directed towards him and made for kids eyes, than an advert made for adults.
The problem of advertising for me is a lot more than only manipulating, but it is a way of showing wrong ideals to people and children.
So I belive that any advertisement can have a bad impact on a child, and that one directed towards it is not even making a big change, as long as it is not showing wrong ideas of humans and their behaviour.
I think, the statement, that television advertising directetd toward children in the age two to five should not be allowed, has a good point and is true but can`t be used for all cases, where young children see advertisment on the television.
There are two different kinds of advertisment on television, you could possibly direct towards young children.
The first kind is the advertisment for products as toys, candys etc., which are designed and produced for children.
In my opinion, these are the advertisments, which shouldn`t be allowed to show or produce to or for children in the age from two to five.
Like advertisments for adult people this TV-spots have the purpose of selling as much products as possible.
But unlike an adult person a young child can`t judge the product advertised.
It can`t calculate the true value and quality of the product, how much it costs and the fairness of the price.
Young children are easier to influence than adults, therefore they want the product, for example a toy, that was advertised and don`t uderstand why their parents would possibly don`t buy it.
This kind of advertisment just  leads to arguments and unhealthy consume habits, therefore I think it should be banned from the television.
The second kind of advertisment are spots or trailers for new TV-shows or movies coming to the cinema.
This kind of advertisment is, in my opinion, not as bad as the advertisement for toys and simular products.
It can be easily tested if a TV-show or a trailer is fitting for the age of the children watching the programm and it hasn`t the purpose to sell a product.
Children can ask their parents if they`re allowed to watch the show or the movie and a solution is easier found.
Sometimes advertisment like this is necessary for the channel, to draw attention to new shows or movies in it`s programm.
My conclusion is, that advertisment, trying to sell products should be banned for young children but short, informative spots about the channel``s programm or age-fitting movie trailers should be allowed to show.
Young children could be more confused with advertising and any other things e.g.
supermarkets with many sweets or shops for plays etc..
The whole world and the modern lifestyle in cities could be too much for young children.
I think if we dicuss only about television advertising it is not enough.
Telvision in general with advertising or not might be too much for the little brains of such young children.
And there are some channels in Germany without advertising, but what is with the following situation.
Imagine a child of three years watch e.g.
mikey mouse, a few days later the mother goes shopping with the child, the child see a shirt or sweets or anything else with mickey mouse and it wants to have it.
But in the shop isn't only mickey mouse there aresuch more superheros, that might be interesting for children.
Isn't that the same, as advertising at television?
Advertising is a difficult topic, but I think it is more than television advertising, I think it should be the responsible of the parents that their own children haven't too much influences form the television in general and the whole world and lifestyle.
In this essay I am going to discuss, whether television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed or not.
I would always say, it depends on the advertisements.
Normally, they direct advertisements about toys and food towards young kids, because they see it and most of the times they go to their parents and ask them to buy it.
Kids with the age of two to five, still play a lot with toys and other stuff.
On the one side, it can be really annoying for the parents when their kids see many of advertisements about toys and always want to have stuff.
The kids do not forget about things like that, that easily so they keep on asking their parents for it until they get it.
On the other side, it is an advantage for the producers of the products to direct advertisements towards young kids, because it is so easy to get their attention and to change their minds about buying something.
If they are advertising for toys, they choose bright colors, short and melodical slogans and kids who play with the toys to get their interest.
Kids do not forget and do not give up that easily.
Well, if the advertisements are about fast food, for example McDonalds they offer meals escpecially for the kids.
The Happy Meal includes a toy the most of the time wakes the kids interest.
They see the toy and then the kids want to go to McDonalds to get that toy.
Also, kids reallys love small portions like a small can of milk or some slices of apples and so they offer those for the kids.
They advertise with slides at McDonalds, with the clown and balloons.
They make it look like so much fun to go and eat at a fast food restaurant.
They try to tell you that it is not unhealthy at all to go and eat there.
It may helps them a lot to tell kids of such a young age that fast food is not bad for you and that they keep on going to that restaurant for a long time.
I think, it would be okay to show some advertisements about toys and food so they still make profit, but not all the time.
If you watch channels on TV for kids, they only show advertisements about toys and food and I just think that is way to much for the kids.
If they start bying things at this young age how is it going to be when they are at an older age?
They are probably not going to be able to behave themselves about saving their money and not to spend it.
The statement about the television advertising directed toward young chlidren is a very interesting and also often discussed subject.
Some people say it's great because their children know that the television is also interested in young humans.
Children, who produce much noise are often very silent whilst watching television, therefore it could be perfect for parents, when the kids are busy they can work at home.
But the advertising can make the kids addicted to watch television and finally their only theme they are talking about is something they saw in television.
Does it really matter, if advertising is directed toward an adult or a child?
Yes of course because children can't understand that the companies, who produce the advertising is only interesting in their profit.
Let's look at an example which shows the nagative side of advertising directed to young aged people.
A poor family with two children sits in front of the TV, that shows advertising for kids, afterwards both kids want the teddybear the've seen in the TV.
Now the parents have to explain to them, that they will not get such a teddybear and the kids are very sad and disturb the inventar of the appartment.
The parents have to repair all destroyed things and have no money left for their hobbies.
In the end every person can decide if the advertising shall be allowed or not, I think young aged humans should go outside and not watching television all the time.
I would forbit my children to watch TV, and it doesn't matter if advertising is for them or for adult people.
In the nature they lern many more things than at home in front of the TV.
Finally I agree with the statement becuase the parents are maybe forced to buy the children things they have seen in television although they have not enough money for it.
Well I think first of all, children that are younger than five years old should not be watching TV at all, because for several reasons it's not good for their personal development.
But back to the point, I think it definitely shouldn't be allowed, since it's really annoying for parents if their children are wanting to get something in the supermarket really badly, they know out of a TV ad and was directed to them.
These kinds of advertisements make little childeren already wanting everything they see in the television, which is already bad enough with children at age ten.
But I also tend more to make this a parent's responsibility, that they should not allow their young children to watch TV at this age.
And it's their fault if the child won't develop as much creativity and imagination or the ability to have fun playing outside.
I don't really get why businesses would spend money on TV advertisements pointed towards young children.
I mean I get it for children at the age of ten, because it's always an emotional decision at this time and every child wants to buy what's advertised in the TV and looks cool to them.
Regarding the arguments, I'm not totally against the advertising directed toward young children, because when they become older they will remember certain advertisements and there is a chance they will buy some products which is a huge market for businesses.
But I'm definitely not supporting advertisements directed toward young children, since it is affecting their childhood in a negative way and it also has negative impacts on their personal development.
I agree that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Today every child spent a lot of time in front of the television watching TV.
Advertisments for small children came in the early morning.
The most children watch TV in the moring, so they see a lot of advertisments.
If a child see such an advertisment in the TV , it will have this product.
The advertisment showes to the child, that it should have this product immediately and the parents will buy it because they will have a happy child.
This is not good for children, because the will have more and more products and they learn that they get the product if they wanted it.
Today small children do not know how to play with natural objects in the forest or how to play games outside because they have everyting.
Furthermore they spent too many time in front of the TV watching these advertisments.
If children have everything, they do not learn how to share things with others or how to spend time without this products.
This is negative for their future.
Their life become more and more tecnical and they forget how beautiful the nature is.
For example they do nor know from where the milk is.
They think, the milk comes from the Migros and not from the cow.
Managers earn a lot of money with those advertisments for young children.
This is not fair beacause parents could not forbid watching TV.
My conclusion is, that small children become stupid if they watch such advertisments.
They could not make important experiences, like playing in the forest or outside.
They learn that they should have this product otherweise they will get sad.
It is important, that advertisments are not allowed for young children.
In the following essay I want to point out my opinion towards television advertising addressed to young children.
Almost every household has an televison in the 21st century.
Advertising is getting more popular because it is an easy way to influence the society.
The impact of advertising is a controversial topic in our community.
Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed because children are not able to understand the impact of most of the products.
Some of them could be harmful and children would get addicted to things which are not good for their development.
On the other side even young children have the same rights than parents.
They are all potential buyers in the future and ,well, watching advertisment doesnt imply buying this product.
Maybe this specific advertisment helps young children to find out what they are going to wish for their birthday.
First of all I have a general question.
Are young children aged between 2 and 4 interested in watching television?
I don´t think so.
On the other hand it is proofed that advertisement influences a buyer´s decision.
At an age of 3 children should not be confronted with advertisment because they should better go out and play with their freinds.
It is also morally questionable when companies try to benefit from children.
If advertisement directed towards young children would be allowed young parents who alredy got a low budget had to explain their children that they are not able to buy this product.
This disappointment is not good for a young character.
If this kind of advertisemnt should be allowed we would definately need a law and an nutral institution that controlls this law.
How sould it be possible for this institution to decide wheater this product is directed towards children at an age of 5?
It is just logical that companies would say that their product is made for people at an age of 6 but it can also be used by younger children.
Overall I thing that television advertisement directed towards young chiildren shouldn´t be allowed becuase of the mentioned facts.
In the following essay I will point out why I think that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
Of course I understand parents who say that this advertising just makes children want more things to play, the newest things, the most popular things, the most expensive things.
And that is true, kids can be convinced more easily than adults to buy something or to let it be bought by their parents.
But on the other hand how many companies do we have that are specified on the production and selling of toys.
Advertising is a huge part of their marketing and without this they would not be able to present and sell so many new toys.
Companies like ToysRUs would lose very much of their profit over the years.
That would be bad for the economy because when less toys are sold less toys will be produced and less toys will be exported.
There are advertisements for everything that is just part of how our society works.
If it is on television or in a newspaper or even on a bench in the park, advertisements are everywhere.
In the end it is the choice of the parents wheather they buy their kids these toys or not.
It is their decision if they want to teach their kids wheather they can not have everything they want or not.
If think television advertising should be allowed even toward young children and if parents have a problem with that they should not let their kids watch that much television.
Children will always want the newest and funniest toys because they hear about them from other kids or see it on other kids.
They are young and do not understand that everything costs money and that money has to be earned.
Never then less parents should teach their children that they can not get everything they want, because in life it is not that way either.
Little Max.
Three years old.
Hanging around the television all the time.
He is really into it.
His mum is a really busy woman.
Her time for little Max is limited.
So when she has to do important things for work, she turns on the television for little Max.
Max's favourites are the teletubbies.
He can't get enough of this colourful dudes, who are hanging around in a surrealistic house.
He just loves them.
Teletubbies is a nice programme for young children like Max.
However during breaks in the programme, there is made lots of propaganda of diverse things.
Young children are really into playing with things.
They like for example lego or playmobils.
Imagine when they see the newest playmobil in TV.
After seeing that propaganda, they just want that awesome playmobil!
As a result they go to their parents and ask them to buy it.
And not just one time.
The young smart lovely children ask them until the parents say yes.
And then the issue is by the parents.
It is a quesion of: Raise the money or a continued asking and nerving period of the children.
It is up to the parents.
Although I think television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
Children are hungry to learn, try and descover new things.
The world should be open to them.
No excuses.
Children have to learn.
And the only way they are able to learn is when they make mistakes.
And such mistakes can be made by watching television.
To conclude it is a question of how parents react to television advertising.
Because parents decide for the children.
Television advertising is nothing bad.
It could help the children to learn.
So little Max is allowed to still watch his Teletubbies.
Advertisements are becoming more and more present in our daily lifes.
In many parts of life we are confronted with adverts.
Very often there is a particular
group to which the advert is directed to especially on the television.
In our times there are even adverts on the TV for the youngest members of our society.
There has already been quite a lot of discussion as to wheater this should be allowed or wheater it is ethically not supportable.
In the following essays I'm going to discuss the pros and cons of this.
The companies directing advertisement would argue that it isn't so much worse to know what kind of games there are from television than from the old fashioned catalogues.
It might even be bettter to let children see what there is on the television because there are less products at once in television adverts.
Additionally some might argue that that young children don't even really notice the adverts or maybe can't tell children adverts apart from adverts for adults.
They might not even be able to realise that there's difference between adverts and normal TV shows.
Finally it is also the task of the parents to monitor what their children are allowed to watch and what they aren't allowed to.
If they know about some chanals which have for their taste too many adverts directed to kids, they can just not allow their children to watch those chanals.
However, even it children might not always even identify and advert as such, children are very infulencable.
If they see lots of colours and some fun looking products which maybe other children play with, they immediately want to play with those things as well.
They start to continuously beg their parents to buy it for them and this can cause a lot of problems.
Furthermore it is morally not quite supportable to direct adverts towards the most infulencable members of our society.
The members that aren't yet able to distinguish good and sensible products from other ones that are made big on adverts.
The publishing companies disabuse the infulencabilty of the children for their own purposes.
Weighing out the pros and cons, I find that even if it is completely possible as parents to stop your children from seeing those adverts or only seeing some on selected channels, the ethical catastrophe of this situation overweighs all of the other arguments.
Companies shouldn't profit from the influenceability of the youngest members of our society.
Nowdays everyone knows what a television is and a majority of the european population possesses one.
Imagine you have kids and you would like to take a break out them.
But they want absoluty to play and be entertained.
A few families would turn on the television so the childrens could watch a serie.
As the serie ends or have a break, television advertising will appear.
Should children be directed to those advertising?
Should it not be allowed?
You can never know, what kind of advertising will appear.
So it is very possible that the content might not accord to their age.
It influe themselve and their parents.
For example if they see a toy on screen, they will 

Kids are surrouded by medias.
So elevision cannot be avoided 

If television advertising should not be allowed, than we should not allow adds on other medias eigther.

This text is about the arguments if television advertising directed young children aged between two and five should be not allowed.
Children aged beetween two to five cannot distinguise between important things.
So the advertisment shwo a lot of things and the children have the feeling they have to need that.
This could affect, how they buy things in the future because they couldn't learn which products are important because when they go to a supermaket with her mother she tells the child waht's important and what not ond the child lerans how to consume normally.
Children want everything and with thouse advertisment they see a lot of things the could have.
It's like you go into a supermaket and they ask her mother many times if she could buy theme things.
Companys have to seel their gods and when thier specialsied to produce things for children they have to use television advertising so that they can sell their things.
Without that the company would not have enough money to pay the worker and many people would lsoe their job.
For children it makes fun to watch these advertisments because they are on the same level of understanding and it activate their fantasie.
In my opinion it should be abolished because children were manipulated so that companys can make some profit.
They cannot distingusie between those things which are important and thosue wich aren't.
Nowadays, people question, if television advertising, which are directed toward children in the age of two to five, should not be allowed.
Some people state that those adverts have bad consequences for children.
But is it really as bad as some adults think?
First of all you have to admit that young children do not think as much as adults about any consequences.
They have to try, what is best for them and do not have enough experiences yet.
Thus, you can they that those adverts also have a good influnce because children have to learn for the future and build their own mind.
They can learn to ignore and seperate what is good and what is bad for them.
On the other side there are also many bad consequences.
You have to say that children are easier to influece than older people.
Until then, they cannot seperate between good and bad influence.
On top of that they do not reconize when they are influenced.
Therefore they can get addicted to television and materilistic things.
Moreover they try to influence their parents to buy the product in the advert and parents cannot buy everything and also should not do because a lot of products are also bad for these young children.
For example they could swallow things wich are too tiny or cannot handle the product to use it corecctly.
Moreover they can hu

To put everything into a nutshell, I can they that there are in my opinion more bad consequences than good ones when regarding the effect televison advertising has on young children.
That is the reason, why I state that there are too much of those adverts and children are influenced when they are too young for it and cannot deal with the consequences.
Nowadays, advertisment is everywhere.
There is advertisment for every age, from babies to old people.
It is hotly discussed, wether advertisment directed toward young children should be banned from television.
First of all, we have to recognize the legal status.
In Germany everybody is allowed to say what he wants as long as it does not break other laws.
Making a new law that bans a part of television advertisment would not
Secondly, trading with goods for children is a big part of the economy.
If there was no advertiment on television, the amount of toys etc.
would probably decrease.
As a consequence, governmental income would also decrease because taxes etc.
would not be paid.
Thirdly, everybody should be able to build up an own opinion.
It is the right of children to watch advertisment on television and then decide about advantages and disadvantages and as a conclusion having an own, independent opinion.
There are also arguments in favour of banning advertisment for children from television.
It is true that everybody should have the chance to build their own opinion but children are naiv and have no experience whatsoever.
Because of this they cannot decide for their own good.
Moreover, with advertisment children are led to be future customers.
Advertisment leads them through their lives.
As a conclusion, I do not agree with banning television advertisment for children.

Advertisements are found found everywhere in our daily life.
In the trains on the streets and even on television.
On television, there is by far the most advertising.
This is disturbing, as there are really long television breaks for advertisements only.
The problem with advertisements on TV is that it isn't possible to ignore them.
The question is: should such advertisement of television which directs toward young children be allowed?
To start off it is safe to say that it is difficult for kids to find out about new things.
Television advertising is only a way of showing kids possibilities which they wouldn't have known of without television.
Advertising is all about expanding the kids horizon.
Moreover, kids are being entertained by advertisements.
They see cool things in the television that they want, but they probably won't ever have them.
This makes the kids dream about what they could have and entertains them.
It is important that kids never stop dreaming, and that kids are entertained enough.
On the other hand, kids usually want the cool stuff they've seen in the TV.
The problem is that kids havent got any money.
First thing they do is they run to their parents and ask them to buy the toy, or whatever the advertisement was for.
This isn't the best for the kids education.
Kids should learn how to deal with money and how to decide whether they really need something or not.
Furthermore, kids will find everything cool.
They can't judge if it is something cool and something usable or just something that has to be sold.
Most of the things that are advertised on the TV are unnecessary things which are really bad quality and not usable.
It is clear that television advertising for children is something that causes rather problems that educating the kids.
Kids should be able to watch television without being disturbed by advertisements which are turning them crazy.
Today i would like to discuss the statement which says, that television advertising directed toward young children, who are aged two to five, should not be allowed.
Firstly the children could be manipulated easily.
Children like this age don't have any life experiences so they don't know if they need theses thing or not.
Also they don't have any idea about money.
They don't earn any money so they have to borrow it from their parents.
If the parents don't want to buy the products which are supported in the advertisement, children could cry or damage something at home which cause familiary problems.
My first point for allowing advertisment toward young children is that it doesn't matter if they watch it.
The parents still have something like the last word.
Children need to ask their parents to buy the products for them so the advertisment towards them is close to useless, because the parents will think about that.
Secondly they often don't understand the advertisement.
If there is a advertisement about something like a little bear, children of age two wouldn't understand any word.
In the end i would say that it doesn't matter if young children advertisement is allowed or not, because in age like two they won't understand them and in age five they need to ask their parents.
If i need to be for one side i would support the statement that it shouldn't be allowed, because children in age five could cause some problems when they start to cry, when the parents says no.
Television advertising dircted toward young children should not be allowed.
I really agree with this statement and I will show you the reasons in the following text.
A boy watch television and after every thirty minutes there comes different advertising for ten minutes.
The young boy ,who is just two to five years old see the advertising and that ist not very good.
At first he will be influenced with five years or lower.
That could be very bad for his following future.
For example: He watchs very often TV and because of that he realize all the new products, which he always want to buy.
The advertising for young children is very attractive for them, because there they show the young children new "Barbies" or anything else.
The hypothalamus, the most important thing of the head, of the children is not completly produced.
So they can not devide between the advertising that is good for them and the advertising that should manipulate them.
Arguments against the advertising toward children are in the following text.
A young child, aged two to five, should not watch television.
And if they don't watch television they won't be influenced.
So in my opinion the parents should have a look on their children and control they media life of their child.
The reason of advertising is that it should make the people buy these things in the supermarket for much money.
All in all I would say that the advertising directed toward young children, isn't very good for the future of the children.
And I hope that the whole world could see that the future of our children is the most important exercise in our world and I really hope that we stopp manipulate ourselves and our future with advertising.
The children are our future so don't destroy these good base
In the following I am going to dicuss if customer directed advertising should be allowed for children aged between two and five.
Almost everybody knows nowadays how advertising works and how the companies are tryieng to sell there products.
They try to influence the customers by using smells or by eye pleasing pictures.
So the companies decidet to show there advertisements and commercials to people who are not understanding what they are looking at or who don´t know how the machinery of capitalism works.
Children.
Children who love to watch there favourite tv show should get interrupted by advertisements which are are directed towards them.
The companies would for example use there favourite charakters that would try to sell a special toy to a child.
There are some different things that could happen if the child would watch that commercial.
Firstly, the child would hate the characters now because they are advertising stuff which the child does not want or it would get scared by the advertisement.
Secondly, the companies would achieve what they want and the parents of the child would buy this toy.
And finally, the child would want the toy but the parents could not afford it so child would get sad.
It does not need to be only a bad thing.
The commercials could also show how important it is to learn, to obey your parents by advertising pre school and kindergarten books.
And thats it.
In my opinion such advertisement would be bad for the psychological health of a child.
It could diturb the child or bring hate into a family.
Your children are watching their favourite TV-series and always in the middle of the Folge are at least eight minutes of adverising.
Annoying but an efficient strategy of the concernes.
We can't forbid them to direct advertisements to children, can we?
Maybe the ones with questionable content, things they should not been ... with.
It is clear that there shouldn't be advertising for smoking or alcohol in a children-channel.
But what about bikes or the newest doll or a little boat?
They will ask their parents if they could please get this or that because they have seen it in the TV and it is so cool.
Pretty intelligent strategy.
But is it allowed to influence young children?
or why not?
The impact on the evaluation of the children is quite high.
But advertisements don't have to be something bad or annoying, sometimes they show some funny things or they show you a picture of society that is "good".
...
I think that it would be good to at least reduce the quantity and to forbid the questionable content to be shown to children under five years.
You couldn't never be sure if there is a child watching the advertising.
And there would be a financial problem to solve.
Television advertising has positiv and negative points.
Many young children watched televiosin often and it is good to watch it, because they can learn something from it.
But between the movies there are television advertising.
On the one hand it is good when the children watch this advertising eary, so they could learn what this advertising stands for and why the advertising is in the televion.
The young children know in the futur, when they see an advertising, that they do not need all these toys.
A next point is that the children see what play is new and what is new from for examlpe barbie or lego.
If they see more different toys, they could choose better wha they want to have and what they donot like.
But on the other hand advertising is not nessacary for two years old children.
They do not need expencive toys or the new ones.
If they see all the toys, plays and dolls, they will want all these things.
In television advertising all products are good, helpful, tasty or nessecary.
So the young children could not know, If they need the things or not.
Also they do not want to play with their things, because they see the new ones.
In my opinion the advertising is not helpful and nessecary for the children.
They do not need the best toys or the expencive teddies.
They only need a nice doll and someone who plays together with the child.
Nowadays it's normal to have a TV, but should young children be allowed to watch TV?
Firstly, when the young children watch too much TV, they don't have time for other things like playing/going out and moving, learing how to speak for example or just reading a easy book.
In the other hand, if they still have enough time to learn etc.
then it won't cost too much time.
AFter that, they can also learn while watching TV for example, learn to speak or just learn things for the future life, like something in the history, although they're very young.
In the other case, they can imitate the things they watched, for example a fight or something like that.
Then it is quiet possible, that the children get addicted by the TV.
So if they are addicted, they can be agressiv, if someone doesn't let him/her watch the TV.
Finally, The TV is also not good for the eyes.
If they watch too much TV, it is possible that the child gets glasses, and this can have a result for the whole future life.
My opinion is that children should be allowed to watch TV, but just in a right measure.
If they watch too much, it should not be allowed.
So if they watch sometimes, they can learn something, but if they watch too much they don't have time to do something diffrent, like moving around or learning.
And they shouldn't imitate bad things, so the parents should tell them what is good and what is bad.
Today everybody has got a television at home and watch a lot of time TV.
Sometimes alone, sometimes with the family.
I think everyone is tired of the long television advertisings between a fantastic film.
So children see a film and than the advertising starts and shows them the new toys, which will coming soon.
Now the question is: Should television advertising, which is directed toward young children (aged two to five), be allowed?
On the one hand the advertising, which is directed toward children, isn't worse for them, because the main thing that is showed, are new toys or activities for young children.
So these adverdisings are not brutal or something else.
One the other hand the economy use the childrens for selling their products, because then a young children see for example a new toy, he ore she wants this and then he or she goes to his parents to ask them, if they buy her or him these new toy.
Another point is that thes young children are wanting every time the best and the newest toy, when they see the advertising.
This is exactly the thing taht the economic want; to sell their products and earn profit with them.
In my opinion the advertising toward young children from the age two to five should not be allowed.
The children in this age dont understand any of this commercials  and are not able to examine them in a proper way.
If the advertising is about a game or something to play with, the kids will only want this things and will maybe start to cry (age two) because they dont know how to tell their parents what they want.
For children in the age of five it is not that difficult, they already can explain their thoughts to their parents and can tell them that they want to have a new toy.
Another reason is that children in the age of two are not able to analyse visual things because they are not smart enough.
Because I dont see any positive points of advertising toward young children anymore I am going to list some more negative points.
Children will start to compare with their friends what they have and what they dont have, so a competition between the children starts and they are going to start to stress their parents till they get what they want.
Another point is that children dont know whent it is enough so they will want more and more toys because the commercial is build up like that so the parents buy more and more to satisfy theri children
In the end I am still following the statement.
I hope you understand my point of view.

In the following essay I will point out my opinion about television advertising directed toward young children by listing the arguments and showing my opinion in the end.
On the one hand children could learn on the Television.
There are some shows especially for children to learn about the nature, animals and the humans' body.
If they watch these shows, they could learn something that could help them in school maybe.
But on the other hand the children could get dependent  on watching television.
in the small age of  two to five it would be horrorbly to be dependent to watch TV every time.
They wouldnt go out, play in the nature and meet friends on the streets.
For myself it was the best childhood to play in the garden, in the sand or on the street with some friends out of my village.
i cant imagine to sit on the tv everytime.
on other point is,that the picture that are shown on the tv are too fast for the eyes of the young children.
the brain cant work with the information it gets from all the pictures.
it could be the reason for many health problems in the older age.
the parents that let their children watch tv every day, every time will probably see it in the grades of the children when they are students.
They wont be as concentrated as other students and wont be as focused.
and they wont be as creative as the other students, that told their friends stories about their dreams.
So finally in my opinion the children should have a childhood in the nature with their friends and not in the living room in front of the TV because it is important for the future.
if they only watch TV they could miss some lessons for life that make them "normal" human.
Now it´s my task, to write an essay about the topic "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".
In my opinion it is good idea that television for children from two to five shouldn´t be allowed, because so the most parents are going to do more outside activities with their kids, which would cause an better relationship to the people outside.
The kids could learn more about the inviroment or get new friends.
in the real life the kids will learn how to react in different situations, which they maybe can´t handle with when they are just watching it on television.
Most of the TV series now a days are not ideal for litte children from the age from two to five, because they can just see an situation but can´t experience it in tzhe real life for theirselves.
Maybe it is possible to find an compromise between watching TV in this age and getting advertised by the real life with real feelings and real situation where thy can learn from others how to react right.
So all in all I would say that is an good idea to forbit TV for little children, but not for all the time.
Maybe it is possible to have some time at the day where they can watch TV an some other time where they have to do something else, like playing outside.
Nowadays our TV is plenty of advertising and not only to adults or teenager also to little childrens in the age of two to five.
In the following essay I want to raise the question if TV advertising dirceted toward young children should be allowed.
First of all, children did not understand or remember what they are waching.
Because their brain is not that structured.
I mean we do not remember us on a happening when we were two years.
The things are not safed by the brain.
Although you can not remember the brain safes it.
But a little child do not understand that somethings are manipulation and not true.
For exemple, if something was said by their mother they will not tell them that is false.
It is our new society, we have to accept that and it is better when you get use to it in a young age.
It is simmilar to money if you guard your child from all the money they can not handle it when they are adult but when you give them pocket money and learn them how to handle it they will get use to it.
But you do not learn them how to handle with money in the age of two years.
It is differently to early.
Adversiting or general wachting TV is good for the structure of the brain.
It is an enritchment because they get an inspiring for ideas.
Well maybe this is true but if you let them play by theirselfes it would be a lot better for their brain.
To summarize, childrens can not participate if it is true or not.
It is not a good idea to interduce the handle but it is silly in the age of two year
Should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) not be allowed?
No, in my opininion every type of advertising should be allowed because for example germany is a free country and you can do what you want.
Everything said to this topic!
In the following it is my task to write an essay about directed televison advertising for children.
In my opinion it is not a problem to create advertising like this because there is also advertising for adults and young adults.
But it hink it is important what the advertising is about and
Television advertising directed toward young children (aaged two to five) should nor be allowed
Agree or disagree?
In the following text, i will name arguments for and aganist this theme and will discuss and coclude, which site of view i agree with.
Negative arguments for advertising televison to very young children is, that this early contact with technology and media is good to handle these things in future.
Young children will knew how to use them.
They can entertain themself by watching soaps, tv shows or films.
It is very possible, that they learn something learnful from the televison.
By watching documentations and the daily news they are informed about the problems and situations at the world, sice a age where they learn how to speak correctly.
Through advertising these kids to televison, they can maybe learn a better language and social life than kids without watching tv at a age of two years.
Arguments for this theme: Yes, it should be not allowed.
When young children, at a age of two to five, are advertised to televison, it is very bad for the proceeding of growth.
They had a less social life and also the language, they learn from the tv is too bad for a sucessful kid in future.
The eyes also can hurt by this.They get a poot eyesight and maybe also a poor hearness(hörverstehen).
A kid, who is advertised to tv, have no real and natural cildhood.
There are media in the Tv the young kid isn`t understanding.
They get a bad and wrong education by wrong news and documentaions, which are therefore, to inform people false.
It is too possible, that they get physically hurt by advertising to tv at this age.
My opinion is, that it should be not allowed.
I agree defintely whith this statement and think, it is nor okay to educate a child like this.
At a age of two to five it is not necessary, that a kid is watching soaps or something like this.
At this age, they lear how to get friend or learn the language.
It shoul not ne
Either side has a variety of arguments, some better, some worse, in this case.
The people in favor of a ban of advertisement targeted towards younger children will claim that this is manipulation much like all advertisment, but targeted towards a group that is more vulnerable.
This comes from the fact that these children will usually not have made many experiences with advertisement in general and see anything targeted towards them as something they want to own.
With how children of this age act, this can be somehwat of a problem for parents as alternatives beyond saying yes or no will often not be available, and telling a small child it can not have something it wants will often lead to issues.
One could also claim that targeted advertisment as a whole is something that is questionable at best, as it essentially abuses people's general interests in order to manipulate them into buying something.
While this is difficult to pursue further, targeted advertisement can quite often lead to problematic situations.
At the same time supporters of these ads will claim that it is merely companies doing business, doing their marketing.
A company that creates exclusively children's products might rely on advertisements like these and the children in turn insisting on then owning the product mentioned.
A ban would mean that either the company would have to quickly find another way to do their marketing or suffer a significant loss in profits.
Meanwhile, others will claim that if parents do not want their children to see these advertisements, they simply should not let their children watch live TV and instead rely on recordings or no TV at all.
For parents that  care what their children see this is a good option to begin with.
A lack of advertising also leads to a more enjoyable experience for children, most of whom are very impatient, which is something the companies creating the ads will abuse aswell.
Personally I do not care much about this subject, as I neither watch any TV nor plan to have children any time soon if at all.
However, I am generally not in favour of banning things for minor reasons, as, in this case, there are enough ways for parents to work around advertising on TV.
Just banning it would hardly do any good and at the same time send a message I disagree with, as a few outraged people should not have the power to dictate what an entire nation can and cannot do.
So, while my both my reasons and my resolve on this matter are rather weak, I do not support an action like this.
Televsion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed

Nowadays televison advertising gets more and more in our daily life and it makes a great majorty of the hole advertising.
But scientists are unsure about these sorts of advertising because it is communally knwon that childern can be easely affected and our daily childs watch more televsion then ever.
So there is the question if telvesion advertising should be allowed.
In my essay I will discuss exactly this statement.
For beginnig I think it is important to remark that childern will be our future, so we should protect them as far as we can.
We should not only guard them when they are crossing a street, we should also try to protect them in the virtual world.
And this world will become more important in future then it is even now.
Bad influences to our childern like inmoraly advertising could have bad affectsto their character and so to their and our future too.
In my opinion the advertising branche should be concentrated on the adultes because when an adult gets influcend be advertsising, which is actually the case, then a child who belives mostly everthing which is told to him, has no chance of an childhood anymore.
To conculse I think it is important to remark onemore that our childern are our future and so we should protect them .
It depends what the advertising is about.
Advertising which are about games and stuff children like is often not good for the children and for their parents because they make the children wish these things and sometimes is this hard for the parents if they don't have the money to buy them these "unnecessary" things.
Children are easy to manipulate.
I think that's the reason why the toy industries make a big profit because of their advertisings.
Sometimes advertisings toward children are good if they entertain the children and not only "force" them to buy their product.
These kind of manipulative advertisings aren't good because they can be the reason why children argue with their parents or that they cry a lot because they won't have the product.
The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
is a bit too extreme written or thought because why should television advertisings which are made for children be forbidden for them?
It's better when they watch these sort of advertising instead an advertising which is about "toys" for adults.
It think television advertisings toward children are O.K.
if they are not that manipulative that the children are forced to buy the product and have to argue with their parents about it.
When a child sees an advertising on TV he should think: "Oh what a funny and entertaining advertising."
instead of:  "OMG!
I need to bring my parents to buy me this toy."
I think it should be allowed, that children aged two to five watch advertising in TV.
But there are reasons for both sides of this statement.
First it should be clear, that these children watch series for children.
So the advertising in these programs is for children too.
Someone would say, if children watch advertising (for children) they get "stupid", because there are some methodes of them who are making advertising, which are not good for children.
They only think about the best way for selling there products and sometimes it isn`t good for the children who want to watch their series only.
But on the other sides, what makes them "stupid" like many people say?
I don`t see any reason for this.
I said, that children only want to watch their series.
If they watch "Spongebob" e.g.
and then there is for three or four minutes a break, they play with other things, because mostly they aren`t interested in advertising.
And if there watch advertising, what happens for them?
Maybe they want some of these products, which are shown to them.
All in all there are some reasons for both sides, but if some parents are against advertising in TV channels for children, they doesn`t have to let watch their kids watching TV und buy DVD`s for example.
In today's essay we talk about the question, whether television advertising should be allowed to be directed towards young children or not.
To start off this discussion I wanted to talk about the possible times, where children could be in this situation.
They often watch television when their parents are somewhere around the house, so it should actually be in the responsibilty of the parents to look after their kids and to controll what they are watching on TV.
But on the other hand, there is so much advertising in the television programms nowadays, so that the parents are overwhelmed and can't really controll it themselves.
The amout of information we still know from our life in the age of two to five years old is really small.
It is normal that we forget most of the things which have happend in this time of our lives.
If it actually is like that, it does not depend whether the advertising is directed towards the children or not, because they forget about it in the next few days.
Studies have show that there are events from your childhood, which still have an impact on your life.
These studies show that parents should truely think about the things they show their children, because it could have an impact on their adult life.
Last but not least children have to learn how to handle this overwhelming lifesytle, where the individual is litteraly floated with information and advertisments.
They are born in a world where this is quite normal, so they have to learn it early enough.
On the other hand, children are still very sensitive and vulnerable and because of that they cam be affected by it very easy.
In conclusion I would totally agree whit the statement written above, because children are still really tiny human beings are therefore are still vulnerbale and can be harmed very easy.
In my opinion there should not be any advertisements dirceted toward young children, because parents can't completely controll it.
My opinion for advertising directed to young people has two different sides .
On the one hand advertising is important to sell products to the people.
They have to know what kind of new products e.g.
food is on the market .
For young people it is often funny and interesting to see advertisement cause of jokes or different pictures .
Often there is kind of a slang or song while the advertisement and so they can remember on.
They can say it to the parents and they know what the child want to have or is interested in.
These are the positive aspects for television advertising directed toward young people.
In conclusion to this is also the vability while watching TV.
They get used of different words and so it can be a practise for learning their language a little bit better.
On the other hand the advertisement in TV is  often too difficult for young people to understand .
For example how the product is used for or how expensive it may be .
This is a reason for why the children often get nervous when their film ends or there is a break.
For parents it is difficult or not possible always to explain the child the advertising.
All in all it is not the best way when children are watching TV in their freetime every time.
They have to learn and do things with other people and have to do other ways of laerning their language better .
The best way is to play with friends outside in the garden and to built something  or to play with a ball or something like that , being outside and have fresh air is very important for young children`s health.
It is not very bad when the child want to whatch TV for one hour in the evening or maybe in the afternoon,but then it is important that
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I think that it gives two sides for this statement.
One for pro and one for contra.
One negative point is that the young children don´t know what advertising is and the kids don´t know the background of advertising,so it is unpossible to show advertising in kids tv.
The advertising in the tv want,that you see an product and that you would buy it,because the products were presented nicer,as they really are.
Then we come to the next negative point by television advertising toward young children.
The young kids want all that they see and all thats look cool and nice,they are so easy to influence.The children see an product in television and they would have it.
The kids don´t know about television advertising and don´t know who the products really are.
I think that the young children don´t know what good or bad is.
One positiv point of television advertising directed toward young children is, that the product,what is presenting in the tv, can be more buy.
Because more people watch the advertising.
In the end i would say,that television advertising should´nt directed toward young children.
The kids are too young to know,if the advertising is good or bad.
Young children are easier to influence,and to influence to by an product.
The advertising can be allowed when the kids are older and know abou this.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed;because it is to early for these young kids to watch television.
In age two to five the children cannot react on this television advertising and dont know about the story of this movies.
in this age they should need they time in other way, for example play with friends or take time with the family.
in age of two years you are to young to watch TV.
When you are older you should need the television for the news or other things, but not young children.Young children want to see comedy movies an not interesting serie;which you inform about the most important topics in the world.
Comedy Movies or zeichentrick series exsist, because of the entertaining.
Those young children should not have enternaining in this way, they should read a book,which help the kids learning to read or preparing the kids in age of 5 for the school stuff.
When  the young children start watching TV, they cant stop and want to see more and more, They are in other word addicted to the Television.
In my view it is to early for this kids, to be addicted of something.
In this time of life the kids dont understand the critics of televgision, so the partents of them should be very strict in topic Tv.
Also it gives other ways to be entertaint, for example play not technological games or listen some CDs.
In this way the eyes of the young children wont be bad.
Some parents have not enough time for them children and put them in front of TVs  .When they sit in front of televisions, the parents shouldnt care about them.
But I think in ages of two years the childrens need die Nähe of the parents.
They need alot of care and Zuneigung.
Early watching of Tvs lead the children in the future also
For me is the statement : "Television advertising directed towrad young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed", a very important theme.
I think that children between the ages two to five should go outside and learn something about whats going on arround them, and not sitting infront of the television  and wachting something very stupid.
For an important reason is aswell that the children could get more stupid if they just sit infront of the television, like my parents often say, they couldn´t learn something from it, that makes me very sad .
An other very important, maybe an old school fact, is that our parents or even our grandparents are growing up without watching television every day.
For me there is no need that small chilrden have to watch television, why cant they play with theyr parents or even witch theyr older/younger siblings, they definitly got better influence on them than some characters in a tv-show.
All this should be more fun for them, then sitting infront of the television.
Often i ask myself why could parents put their little child infront of the television,why dont the play and enjoy the time with them, the time is running so fast and they would see it much later when the time is over.
But in the other hand the parents could let their children wacht tv sometimes, not too often, when they don´t really have time for them, for example during cooking or something like that.
So like you could see I could found definitly more espects to agree with the statement.
so for me the statement tells the truth, evenif some people wouldn´t see it.
For me it makes more sence that little childrens are playing out seid or with their toys, but not with those electronical toys which be could have.
I agree with the statement " Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowe.
", because in my opinion young children shall go outside and shouldn't be attracted by television.
Many people would say that young children could learn from different television shows, but I think that the children aren't old enough to understand everything.
For example the TV show "Dory".
This show should help young children to learn English in a very young ages but most of the children won't understand this and just watch little graphic humans doing crazy things.
I also think that it is not good for the eyes when young children watch too much television, because they look at an very big screen the whole time and the animation istn't good for their eyes.
Also young children don't understand that their is a difference between them and the animated humans.
Children think that they are like them.
An example is the show " Die Teletubbies".
The Teletubbies had TV's in their belly and young children watching this show thought that they also have TV's in their belly and cut into their belly looking for a TV and died.
I think television advertising toward young children isn't a good thing, because the children aren't old enough to understand the things in the TV, they just watch it.
And instead of this they should go outside and play with other children, that is much better for them and for their health.
We live in a digital age.
Advertisement is done mostly over electronics.
So it is not surprising that most comercials aren't directed to all people but on a group.
But is really every group equally sensible for comercial or shouldn't advertisements be directed towards young children?
Infants are easyly influencend by their environnement.
They repeat everything they heard, they act like their partent and their speach resembles the one that television characters use.
But this is, most of the time, a  good influence which makes the children learn new words.
As comercials also follow certain rules which involve the avoiding of profanity those product promotions might be perfect for young children to get to know more words and evolve their grammatical skills.
On the other hand this might lead to an increase of television usage of the younger generation, which is a bit counterproductive, as the children wont go out and learn something about the environement.
What's more is that this may be the perfect way of communication between parents and their children.
Often enough infants don't know how to express themselfes if they are in need of something.
But with the comercials the could just reuse the phrases they heard there and the parents automatically would know what they want.
But with comercials only for them so early in their lifes this might lead to an decreas in the quality of later generations, as they might believe everything they see in advertisements.
Comercials will alway be directed at certain groups and the younger generation is born into an age where everything is digital and communication happens mostly over the internet.
Sooner or later they get influenced by comercials but on the internet there is, most of the time, no one which controlls if the rules aren't broken, so television might be the perfect method to influence young children in a good way.
The following text is about, that television advertising should not be allowed to young children between age two to five.
But is it importent?
It should be allowed, because of this, the parents are not so much stessed out.
Their children are all the time in front of the television, so must not play with the children some games or do activities.
Also the parents could do more work and are able to do more money.
It should be also allowed, because there are a lot of informational television shows, that could help the child by learning new things, for example the alphabeth or the one and one, in point of that, school would be much easier.
Nevertheless there are some bad points for the children in the television.
One reason for this is, that the kids are more indoor and not in the nature.
They could getting fat and a couchpotato, because they aren't play any games outside, like hide and seek or running.
Also the children woundn't get so much social expiriance with other children, which is very helpful for the future, because this time is the first point of life, where should make friends.
I gives you impressions, how you should react to other people and how you shouldn't, this is very importent for every future, of every person, because you need it in work and to create a family.
Yes, I agree with the question ,,Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five ) should not be allowed'', because like in the next its an very importent time of life for the children, they should go outside, make some friend and should have fun together, because in their future they aren't able to this anymore.
They just have not enouth time.
The statement Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed is in my oppinion very controversial.
In the following essay I will discuss the topic and its controversy.
People of all ages are influenced by advertising every single day in out lifes.
And its not just television in witch we are contacted with advertisement.
It has become a part of our lifes, if we want it or not we just simply cannot escape its influece.
Therefore I believe it is unnecessary or even impossible to protect our children anf younger people in generell from advertising and its effect on the individual.
I believe it is in the hand of the parents to reduce the advertisings influence on the young generations by not allowing them to watch certain types of channels or going on specific websites that promote advertising directed towards children.
In our socirty it is in my oppinion not possible to compete with the advertising industry.
But of course we are capable to protect our children from advertisement in our private lifes.
As a conclusion I would say that it is necessary to raise awareness to the negative effects of advertisement, especially to young paople but I do not think it is possible to stop advertisement directed to children in generell.
A controversal topic nowadays is television advertising.
Some people think, that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed.
In the following I will comment on that topic.
Firstly you can say, that these advertisments, towards young chilren, offer the producer a bigger frame of costumers.
Often advertisments are directed towards adults or teens, so that they buy certain products, but also if an advertisment does not catch an adults or teens attention, a young child can influence their parents to be interested in that special product, so that they look at it again.
Furthermore especially young children are easy to influence and so they believe everything said in the advertisment.
They do not have as many life experience as their older siblings or parents and so they believe especially people, who seem trustful, alot and when it is a good advertisment they can get influenced by it very much.
Young children at the age from two to five should not be allowed to watch television or television advertesments.
In the age of two to five they should play outside with friends.
They should not sit inside and watch television alot, perhaps in the evenings, the children program, but there are no advertisments in these special shows for young children.Television advertisement can influence their personalities in wanting everything.
Young children, who watch much television or television advertisments can get badly influenced by these, because they often tell you, that you should definitly buy the product and so their character can get influenced in wanting everything.
To sum it all up, I would say, that these television advertisments towards young children should not be allowed, in the reason, that it could influience their life in a bad way, and noone wants that for their child.
Who does not know it ?
Little brother,sistor or even cousin is sitting in front of the TV and watches the advertisement between his two favorite series.
The eyes getting bigger and bigger with every toy they see.
Discussions with mom and dad about buying them this and this seems everyday business.
But is it okay to direct advertisemnt to these young kids?
In the following i will give a statement to this topic:

First of all you can say that children aged between two and fived do not have that complex progress of will like we do as adults or young adults.
They see the advertisement, like the toys that are pictured and with the next episode of Spongebob it is no longer interesting for them.
Additional to that the children are not the ones who can buy these products in the normal stores because in the most cases they will only go shopping with their parents.
But actually advertisment that is driectly directed to the children can somehow influence them in their future consumer behaviour.
The advertisemnt and the way the parents treat their childrens wishes could optimise or make their former consumer behaviour even worse.
If a kid gets everything it wants, it will possibly buy everything it wants as an adult too and gets selfish.
Additional to that there is some kind of social pressure.
The parents of the children, who are directly confronted with the wishes of their children, probably can not afford the toys.
The comparism kids do about toys puts a thirtend social pressure on the parents and could also be an indicator of wealth in society.
The advertisement made for children is also kind of dangerous because children can be teached wrong moral rules or they can not estimate the symbolism or clishees the advertisement often uses.
So all in one I would say there should be an optimzed advertisement for children or the quote of advertisement for children should be controlled by the government so that there is no more sociual pressure and no room for wrong interpretations.
Everyone knows Comericals, and in the Television are Comercials for ever age group.
But the question I want to disscuss today is if Comercial pointed excactly for young Children (age 2-5) should be allowed or not.
The first impression I have when I hear something like this topic is, why should this force any kind of problem, it´s only commercial.
But if you start think a little more intense, you rekognice some aspects witch tell you to not do this.
But first of all I want to start out white the positive aspects At first I would say there is the point of the lokal market.
Children have Parents who pay for them if the Childens want to have someting they have seen in the Comercisl they want to buy this this is good for the Market.
I also think it would be not that much of a Problem because I think the most Children do not totaly listen to Comercial but to this what their Friens have bought.
But on the other hand there´s some facts which indead lead to an other oppinion.
Children are manipulativ, which means if you produce a very good Commercial every Kid would like to have this because the have not a own oppinion they just learning what others tell´em and when the commercial tells´em to buy this beautifull product they want to have this without thinking about it.
Also you could force big economic crisis trough this.
A Government like the USA could export for example plastic Figures, using TTIP, witch the kids threw an ey on because of the commercial to europe and the kids need to have this.
Than they buy it and get ill trough the bad plastic of the USA.
If the chew on the Plastic they could maybe even die and all this because the Commercials directly towards young aged children.
If there where no Commercial only a few to non children woh would have seen this in the lokal Store would have bought this and got ill. Than the government would stop the import and lots of less deaths would have been caused by this plastic figures from the USA so you can see I personally would forbit Commercial directly toward smal thildren because they are to simple to catch with a good commercial.
The topic of television advertising toward young children is a much discussed topic.
In the following I will discuss this statement.
To begin with, TV advertisement should likely be allowed but also be supervisioned by the parents.
If parents allow their little kids to watch TV, they can also watch the commercials.
Nevertheless, parents should always control the amount of time their kids spend watching TV and set rules with them.
Advertising toward children should not be forbidden but it is in the parents´hands to keep and eye on their kids.
Furthermore, allowing television advertising for little kids will lead to them growing up with a lot of media use.
It is a lot more improtant though that they grow up with friends and play games and not only sit on the couch all day.
Kids should rather participate in activities such as sports or clubs or even play with others.
On the one hand, if television advertisement is allowed, children will probably not only sit in front of the TV a lot but will also get in touch with other media soon.
This may help them to learn how to use those with early age.
Since the use of media has taken a lot of influence on our society, this might help them a little to understand the function of it.
On the other hand, it is way too early to start watching TV and the TV advertisement already at the age of two.
Such little childern should first start to speak and even start writing before watching TV and use other media.
It will not be helpful for their developement and will probably lead them to become addicted from TV very early in life and this should be prevented by not allowing television advertising.
In conclusion, I am of the opinion that television advertising should not be allowed toward young children aged two to five because it has negative influence on their developement and it is much more important for them to learn speaking, writing and even reading skills before watching TV advertisements.
The debate of advertising directed toward young children is a debate, which people talk about now and which is important for the future and the new generation.
Making adverts for young children can be seen as a smart idea because in this young ages, the children always try to convince their parents to buy them the things they see, for example in supermarkets.
If they see a toy in the advert and then in the supermarket, they will ask their parents so that they buy it for them.
My second point is that adverts might stay in the children's mind and when they grow up and see products from the same name they might think of the past and connect the product with good emotions.
This is securing the future group for buying their products.
But at the other hand, young children don't understand complicated advert, they only see the product and when they don't understand the product right, they might use it wrong and not what the people, who made it, want it to be used.
Another point is that young children don't buy themselves products and if the parents don't buy it for them, the advert will only be in television and not sold good in the markets.
To connect to my argument before, i close this argumentation with my last point.
For many parents it is usual to let their children watch television, but they are parents who question this adverts and products, they might manipulate the children to make them to buy other products from them in the future.It is an education question to forbid televison for young children because only the parents decide what their children do in this age.
The question of advertising directed to young children is another but is indicated in the education.
Personally, i agree with the statement because i think of bad manipulation when i think of adverts, internet and other things.
People shouldn't focus on advertising their products good to children, instead they should think of educate young generations right to manage a friendly world again.
No I don't agree with the statement.
I mean it's not the job of the enterprises not to try to reach kids, it's the job of the parents to say "No honey, not today."
It's normal, that there are television advertising for condoms or sex toys and nobody asks "Is it okay to make television advertising just for adults?
", when there's a tv-spot about Spitex, nobody asks if it's okay just to make television advertising just for elders - what I want to say is, that kids are just another customer group and shouldn't be questioned.
Well, I understand that some people say it's not okay, that you try to reach customer groups who don't even earn money.
But to be honest that's just business, like a lot of other stuff - I mean the UBS hangs up some posters with the writing on it that children should come and bring their "Sparbatze" to the UBS and they'd become a toy - I think this isn't okay, to let kids bring you their money just so you (the bank) can invest it and hope it works out.
So from my side, I wouldn't ban television advertising for kids from the tv, I mean in the end, if this concerns sells more stuff, they pay more taxes and Switzerland gets money, if Switzerland gets money, we can keep this county clean, pretty, just like we know Switzerland - isn't that worth these maybe 15 seconds of television advertising for playmobil?
Television advertising directed toward kids is nothing else than just usual television advertising and I think it's definitely okay.
Television advertising is shown on every canal at every time on TV.
There are different advertisings, some are more specific to adults, others to kids.
But most of the canals do not seperate their ads and so also young children sometimes could watch ads that are not made for their age group.
But advertising also can be inspirering or useful.
In the following I will discuss the pros and cons of advertising and if it should not be allowed to show advertising directed toward young children.
On the one handside, advertising which is directed especially toward kids in the age between two and five years could inspire.
If for example kids are shown who are playing instruments, doing sports or help inside the house the kids who are watching these scenes might thing that this is really cool because these kids are on TV and what happens on TV often seems great to young children.
So they might decide to do things like these too.
Another point is that there are also ads that are teaching things.
Especially on American TV there are often programs for children which are showing how to build certain things.
If these programs are shown in television advertising kids get informed about it and are going to watch them and learn something.
But even if there are some things that seem good about television advertising directed toward young children, there is also a negativ side.
At first, ads often show new toys and want the kids to buy them.
So the children go to their parents and tell them about the things.
But if the parents do not buy the stuff the children can get very angry an ennoying.
If these things would not be shown on TV, kids would not know about them and would not want to buy them.
In addition, advertisings are mostly very unrealistic and show things very differently and better than they are.
So kids get a wrong image of maybe even important things.
And if their parents do not care about what the children are watching or do not teach them how things really are, these children might get problems in their future.
In my opinion it can be very useful not to allowed television advertising to young children.
It can protect the kids to belive the "lies" that are telling on TV and to be content witch the things they have without always want to buy new toys.
Advertising to children up to five years is a quite questionnable method.
If a producer launches a new toy for small children it wouldn't be intelligent to advertise to adults since they aren't potential customers.
The advertisement has to be directed to the target persons and those are of course small children.
The question that we have to ask is now: Is it correct to use the children's inability to think by themselves what is necessary to have and what isn't?
The problem is that their age is to young to estimate if the quality of a toy is comparable according to the price?
Children want to have everything that looks new and interesting and the toy producer knows that he can make profit due to the fact that small children are easy to influence by a television advertising.
But this thought-provoking method isn't just a bad way to gain more profit.
We shouln't forget that children by themselves can't do a lot.
Their parents have decide what is good and what is not necessary for their child.
Advertising to children is in this view not worse than normal advertisement.
Sure, adults are less easy to influence but on the other is the children advertising not profitable if the parents don't buy the product.
The rate that an adult will buy a product for themselves is probably higher than that would buy a toy for their unconscious child.
It is the time of media of all sorts and forms.
Young children grow up with it and are influenced by it every day.
There is specific advertising for products that is made for young children.
A question is, if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
The first argument against this is, that is good for the companies selling these products.
They have young people who grow up with this advertising for these producs and who really want to have it and play with it.
When they grow up with it and make many memories with these toys they may buy it for their own children, when the are grown-ups.
Another argument is that many parents cannot say no to their off-spring and often buy everything they want to have.
A further plus for the companies.
Young children are influenced nearly everywhere they go.
Many toddlers do own smartphones or tablets and are confronted with advertising.
So why should it be forbidden on television?
A third argument is that it is part of our society and capitalism to earn as much money as possible so it is ok to use everybody.
The first argument for this statement, that young children in the ages from two to five years should not be influenced already, is that tehy do not understand completely what they see and what they should do with this information.
It is too much for their young brains.
A seciond argument is that companies are using these children and their parents to make more money.
Of course people are always used when it comes to advertising but this should not be done to young children because they do not have their own money and do not know how to use it in the few cases they alreay have money.
In this society it is important that you have money, because only then you have power so people start using the most naive and innocent part of the community and this is not ok.

To conclude, it should not be allowed to direct advertising toward young children.
Nowadays there are many people buying products they have seen in TV before.
This may show how the advertising influences the consumer.
Everytime we watch television there are advertisements between films.
They show new and revolutionary products everybody should buy to make one´s life better.
But they are often from brands that are very expensive so the people who see the new things on television screen think that the product is new and different but there is not always a difference to the products they developed before.
It is also difficult for brands to get the consumer´s interest without advertising because the people who go to a shopping center are often stressed or they only buy the products they had on their list.
But when they see new products in the advertisements, they are interested and they want to experience the feeling of having this new product.
This leads to higher numbers of selling so the firms do spend much money on their advertising but they get more people´s interest.
In addition, it is much easier for parents to buy presents for Christmas or the child´s birthday if the children have said before what they wish for.
The parents, who do often have much work to do, do not want to spend that much time in looking for presents to make their children happy, so they are happy about the exact wishes.
On the opposite, there are many children watching television who do also get to know the new articles.
The products are often specialised for channels which are for children because they like everything that is colourful or that seems interesting.
Children and also parents want their children to have the newest toys so that they may invite their friends to show them off.
When the parents go shopping together with their children, the parents become stressed because their children want to have for example the new speaking doll or the moving horse their playmates have got or they have seen on TV.
When the children ask their parents for these things they often buy these things because they want their child to become silent or they only want to be good parents.
These shopping problems can not be solved by stopping firms making advertisements on television because products can also be published on the internet that is nowadays much used by many children.
In my opinion, the parents have to decide what is good for their children.
The firms should be allowed to publish their products in television to get a high selling number.
The parents should be able to make their children clear what is good for them and what is not.
Today, mostly all famalies have a TV at their home.
some of the young parents grew up with a TV theirselves so it is normal for them.
So many children start watching TV in a young age.
I also did so.
In this case some people think if it could be bad for the kids to see all the advertises shown in TV.
Normally advertises are no bad things.
Cars, clothes, websites or everything else is shown there.
But that could be the problem with it.
"Everything".
Sometimes there are advertises for movies, maybe a horrro movie.
Things children could be scared of.
Maybe they can not sleep at the nights.
We all know how easy it is to trick a child.
They believe mostly everything.
The same with the advertises they see.
So it is easy to tell them wrong things.
The things are shown there better than they really are.
So the kids want to have everything they see there.
It is so amazing for them cause they believe it.
But right this point is also a reason to let them watch it, from the view of the econemie.
The toy industrie lives from advretises.
The children see it in TV and want to have it.
So in the end I would say there are some advertises that are not good for the chilldren, but if they just watch the channels made for kids it is okay.
I do not think that these channels show advertises for dating websites or horror movies, are they?
And I watched TV too when I was young and I did not fail my life, I hope.
In the following text I will give a statement to the debatte about telivision advertising for children, but first let us watch at the positive and negative aspects about this theme.
At first you can say that everybody needs to have the same rights.
So why not for children?
When there is advertisement in the television just for adults, many children will lose their connection to toys.
Grown up they will not have any memories about toys or things they can connect with their childhood.
Childrens have also a right to be informed about the outcoming of a new product.
Many childrens love a speficial firm, which products a rare type of toy and there is no way for childrens to actualise their mindset.
On the other hand childrens can be easier influenced and manipulated.
Many firms build on the simple-stricted mind of children.
They used to put only the good facts about the products and hide the negative that for example that many worker in China have to work for this product for low money.
And why should they not?
Everybody puts his positive qualifications in the front and his negative in the background.
This is a normal human behavior, but the differance is that childrens are not able to notice these things and adutls are.
The adults are also a very important factor of firms in television advertising.
Adults will be forced to buy toys, they actually do not want to buy, but do it anyway just to make the child happy.
In the end you can say that television advertising should be allowed.
All rights for everybody and if the parents have the feeling their childrens get manipulated by this advertisement, they should inform their childrens about that.
Many children often look television in young age in their freetime just for fun.
In the following I want to discuss wether this is good or not in this young age.
First I want to say that it doesn't make sense when you just let your child sit on the sofa and watch televison while their mother clean the house for example.
Television isn't good for the education and the most kids, who watch often television in their freetime, aren't so educated.
On the one hand it's really bad for the education and then later the school life, but on the other hand I understand that watching television is better for children instead of reading a book.
Children often are boring in their freetime and mostly they are too lazy to read a book, that's why they just sit themself on the sofa and watch television, because it's so much easier.
Furthermore television doesn't help in school, because the most children series doesn't make sense and they are just there, so that the children aren't boring and they have funny things to look in the television.
If the children would read a book or making something productive, they prepare for school and already know how to write a good text in german lessons for example.
Moreover they know more words and how to combine them in their texts, so that the text get a good structure and is good to read for the teacher.
I come to the end that it isn't good for children in young age to watch television.
My own opinion is the same as the conclusion.
Children should better reead a book or if they are too young, their parents should read out a book for them instead of watching television.
Furthermore the connection between parents and their child also get better if they do something together like reading a book.
In addition their child is also more educated when they're reading a book.
First of all it´s important to place one thing on the top: advertising changes us all daily and it has such a big influence on our behaviour.
It became so usual for us that we can´t imagine living without, because we don´t realize the gravity, like blind children who believe in everything.
But now we have to ask the question: can we live a life beside all those advertisings and medias?
Should we especially protect children from this influence?
On the one hand we have to realize how much responsibility we have for the children of today, because they are the strong ones of tomorrow.
Adverts influence their point of view more than the point of view of adults, because their knowledge about deciding between good and bad is much smaller.
Children believe nearly everything they hear or see and that is the dangerous point.
Another problem is that we never know what the advert a 4-year old child sees makes to him and how it changes his future.
Maybe in one hundred years the people behave like roboters, because the future generation is on that "consume trip" since childhood.
On the other hand we have to live in reality and we have to see how far technologies developed in the last years and how our society changes with them day by day.
We can´t take our children to a different universe and we can´t make them close their eyes.
Sooner or later they have to live with advertising in media and they have to learn how to handle them.
At all I have to say that I can understand the statement and I see the affect behind it, but I don´t think that it´s possible to create such a law.
Not today, not in this world.
Coming back to the question above;we can´t protect our children, because we all bahave like children in this society.
No, I don't agree with the statement.
One of the reasons why I don't agree with it is that the television advertising could help the parents to find gift ideas.
Otherwise, they would still buy old things and would be aware of new games for example.
I don't see any point why it should't be allowed to advertise directly toward little kids, because they won't just go and buy the advertised product.
They would still have to ask their parents.
It is much better to advertise directly toward them than advertise for products they won't buy in the next ten years.
Another thing is that the parents know that the kids would see just things for their age, if the don't change the channel.
I also see a positive point for the companies, because the will advertise and about 85% of the viewers would be a potential buyer.
So a win-win situation in my opinion.
But the comanies should stay fair and should't ``brainwash`` the kids.
Otherwise it woulb be very hard for the parents because the children would want to buy one thing after another.
They shouldn't just think about how to make the most sales and lie the whole time.
The kids would be sad and that should not be the case.
To sum up, I don't see a problem with companies that advertise directly toward small children, as long as they stay fair and don't try to sell them as much as possible.
In times like these it is normal for us to watch tv and the advertisement which comes with it.
For most of the people the advertisement is not great but fine.
For young children it is another story.
Today I am going to argue if the television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or should not be allowed.
On the one hand television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
The children are influences by a lot of things around them already.
They don't need another source which tells them what to do or what to buy.
Humans always compare each other.
It begins in the kindergarden.
Kids compare each other, who has the newest toy?
Who brought the better food?
Then after kindergarden school begins and again Who has the best grades?
Who is the prettiest?
Than after school real life begins and most of the people have to work and start a family and it is obvious that everyone is comparing again When do my friends have their first child?
What amount of money does my brother get?
And on and on.
So I don't think that you should influence children, which are not even in kindergarden to compare themselfes with their friends.
On the other hand television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, because the businesses which want to sell their stuff are better on if they have young watchers.
The time where you're influenced the most in your life is the age before and the age during school.
So if the business is able to catch you one time they are probably going to have a futurecustomer.
Another obvious thing is that kids like to buy new toys.
If they are allowed to watch television they are always up to date.
In the end I think young children should be allowed to watch television advertising but only if it is the right amount.
Most of the television advertisements are very long and they don't really hold a lot of useful information.
Maybe the advertisement people could put some short  knowledge shows in the time of advertisemnt
Nowadays pretty much everyone owns a television.
This also includes hoseholds with children of course.
But is it a good idea to allow little children around the age of two to five free access to the television?
Little infants are way more naive than teenagers or adults and also easier to manipulate.
So everything presented on television could influence them hence they have not learned yet not to believe in everything that is told on TV.
Especially advertisement directed toward youg children has a big influence on them and leave them wanting uneccessairy products, mostly toys, which are not a good quality and probably over prized.
Eventhough the advertisment is not affecting the children mentally, it could stress out the parents, who are experiencing a midlife crisis anyways.
So it is understandable out of their perspective why those adds should get banned on TV.
However, I do not see a good reason why it should not be allowed since it does not badly affect anyone.
Whereas, it would not be really beneficial for those companies which are responisble for these adds for children.
The product would be less popular and less people would consider buying it.
In conclusion, to answer the question, no I do not agree that television advertising directed toward children should get banned.
However what should get banned are silly shows like Teletubbys or Spongebob which are making our children go braindead.
Many young children watch a lot of Television.
Because of that they also watch and hear a lot of advertisements for toys, food and other stuff children would want to have.
This topic is discussed controversially and in the following I will explain what I think about forbidding television advertising directed to young children.
The advertisements effect and manipulate children a lot: They see a new toy in the advertisements, presented as colourful and really nice.
They immediately want to have it and want their parents to buy it for them.
So they do not really think about it and just want to have the toy because they have seen it on TV, often they actually do not really use it when they have it beacause it is not as nice as it has seemed.
Forbidding these advertisements would stop this manipulation and make the children think about what they want a little longer.
But is that really true?
Would they think about it longer?
Isn´t it normal that children in the age of two to five years make fast decisions and want to have a lot of toys etc.?
And would forbidding television advertisements directed to children of that age group really stop the manipulation?
There are many other ways to make children want something, for example in movies.
If the people in the movie all have a certain type of toy, the children could also want to have it.
In that case it is just as much manipulation as in an advertisement.
Another fact against forbidding these advertisements is that later, when these children are older, they are manipulated in many ways, also by advertisments.
Shouldn´t they learn early how to deal with these manipulations and how to resist them?
All in all I think that these advertisments should still be allowed and that parents should decide themselves if they want their children to watch television and the advertisements.
Whenever you want to watch a movie in TV, you will be unterrupted by advertisement.
If you really pay attention to those ads or if you use the break differently, is up to you.
However, if you have kids, you will probably have your child coming at least once to you saying that it wants something it has seen in TV.
But is that OK?
Should television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) not be allowed?
To begin with, nearly every big company uses advertising in television as a good marketing option.
People are used to be interrupted during a movie or a TV series.
These ads show what is new on the market and a good one makes the viewer wanting this new product.
Advertisement can appeal to out senses, to our emotion or to our humour.
It kind of influences us.
Kids are not able to see the difference between reality and fiction.
That is why children fear monsters under their bed they have seen in their dreams or in movies before.
As an adult we know what we need and what we do not need.
We are sensible.
We are more annoyed by television advertising than our kids.
Children have no idea about what they really need.
Furthermore, they are highly manipulative.
They may think that they really need a certain product maybe because other friends have got it as well.
On the one hand, you can say that they have parents who are reliable for them that they tell their kids that materialism is not the most important thing in life.
On the other hand, some parents do not care or are no ideal for them.
The products which are often advertised are not really useful and kids cannot relate.
They have not got the experience of an adult to make sure they really know what the people in the ads are talking about.
In my personal opinion, I think that TV ads are annoying in general and especially for kids.
The content of their advertisement is often not even useful because they are about toys or sweets which
Television advertisments bring in lots of money for their producers but also for the TV Programm that cuts them in.
But are they good for our society, do we like them or are they just annoying.
Do they actually cause us to buy a certain product or use public institutions?
In between all the arguments about this topic there is one specific quetion I want to talk about now and that is, whether TV advertisments, that are clearly directed to very young children, should bee allowed.
At first sight there is no actually big harm towards the kids directly if they watch TV advertisments.
Many children might not even be interested.
There is no harm to them to spend all their money on a product,just because they didn't think about it first.
The parets pay and they make the decisions so where is the problem.
There are many problems about TV advertisments that are directed to little children.
Many mothers let their kids watch TV for daily periods so that they can chill out for a while.
None of them thinks about the advertisments in between the TV shows that their kis might watch as well.
When a TV commercial appears for example about Kinder Chocolate that might not have any effect on the children?
Yes it does have an effect.
As soon as the children have seen the advertisment, maybe even without actually realising it they ask their mother for chocolate.
So that advertisment had a direct influence on the children.
That kind of influence isn't good for young children.
They don't realise that the advertisment was the reason why they wanted to have chocolate.
Young children can be influenced very easily.
They see something in for example a toy and they want to have it immediately, no matter whether it is healthy or smart to buy that product in that moment.
This can be a huge problem for mothers.
They already need to convince their children day for day that they do not need for a toy or sugar cand for example.
This  kind of influnece is not good for  the growth of their character and it might cause a wrong image of the world.
Furthermore in advertisments only ideal kids play, there are no ugly or fat ones.
This gives the children a very wrong image of the world and might cause depression or other disabilities.
The only way out of  this disaster is to eighter forbid your children to watch TV or to forbid TV advertisments towards children.
Television adverts for the youngest generation

A four year old boy is watching TV in the afternoon.
This days, the new set from Lego Kingdom will be released and the TV speaker announces the new Castle with 15 knights, 4 horses, a wizard and a dragon.
The boy is amazed and he wants this set for every price.
Is it legit, the Lego Company shows adverts in TV, or isn't it just horror for the poor parents with kids who want the newest toys.
Despite lots of poor parents, it will be difficult to get a law which forbids those adverts.
Most of the discussed spots will be about toys.
A toy is not dangerous, it doesn't lead to being fat, it is important for kids to play with etc.
All those arguments speak against the headline.
And isn't it better to show toys on TV than letting the children watch people smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol on TV.
Before interrupting toy adverts, they would better forbid the alcohol and tabac adverts.
An other aspect is, that the children aged two to five maybe won't understand what they hear and see.
In this case, it isn't as important to stop showing toys on TV.
On the other hand it is not easy for the parents, to bring the children doing something else than watching TV and press buttons on their phones.
No toys on TV might help them a bit.
Additionaly the kids wouldn't insist on having this and those toys from the spot last night anymore.
In the end, it is important the parents educate their kids well, so they will face less problems with their children dreaming on the newest Lego Castle.
First, it is more important to forbid dangerous adverts for things like alcohol and tabac.
In my opinion there should not be Television advertisments for young children, because the parents have to deal with all the stress to find these things ot they will have to tell theire children why they will not buy these things.On the other hand  if these things are good for the childs evolution, like learning how to talk or how to write or read it would be a great idea.
But often these advertisments show onlky things you do not really need,like a talking puppet or something like this.
Another argugemnt against is that many people does not like these advertisments because they have to wait untill they can watch theire movie or theire series.
Also many people does not even watch these advertisment and they will zap to another channel.
An argument for it is that it is easier to find things that youre child likes.So you know what you could by for his/her birthday.
If you loook at it in the point of the guy who buys the time to show his advertisment you can see that he has to make these advertisments so the world knows that he is here and that he has some "really cool things" like fast cars or an airplane for example,because he would not get as much costumers as if he would have his advertisments and commercials only in magazines or in the radio for example.
My last argument agains advertisments in television is ,that there will not be so much people who comes to his shop just because he has some advertisments in television.
He has to have a nice shop, good prices and maybe a page on the internet.
so as I told you earlier I am straight against television advertisment.
The brain of a young child aged two to five doesn't work like the brain of a adolescent or an adult.
A young child sees the world in a different way compared to an adult.
A child won't buy a product by it's own.
The parents decide wether to buy something for his child or not.
So I don't think that it is useful for a company to make television advertising toward young children.
On the other side nothing will happen if a child watches a television advertising.
It won't affect the child in a bad way because a company won't do an advertise that young children don't like.
So in the small clip there would be toys or other things a young child wants to have.
The memory of a child is different too.
The brain of an adult can recognise things he saw somewhere, like on television.
I don't think a child wants to buy something only because he or she saw a television advertising.
These were only a few of the arguments for this topic.
In my opinion it should be allowed.
If a company wants to risk doing an television advertising directed toward young children then they should do it.
I'm not sure wether there is a point for doing that or not because of the reason I've written about in the upper half of the essay.
If I were in the promotion departement of a company I wouldn't do a television advertising for young children.
But I don't see a reason why it shouldn't be allowed.
It doesn't affect the child in a bad way so there is no reason to not allow it.
In the time of today, television plays a big role in the daily life of most of the people around the world.
Also chrildren often watch TV, some even every day.
They are confronted with much advertising, for example for toys or mostly unhealthy things to eat.
But is that really okay to show advertising directed towards young children in TV?
At first it has to be said, that small children are more likely to believe what is said in television and the advertisements oftes abuse this to make them want to buy their products.
Often they use characters from TV-shows or films for children, with whom the kids are familiar.
Even though the small children need healthy and good food, the advertisements are mostly for unhelthy candy or snacks with too much sugar in it and so its not made for children.
Today there are much more jung humans with an BMI (Body-Mass-Index) which is defenetly to high and they are more likely to get illnisses like Adipositas.
One reason for this is the unhealthy livingstandard with the unhealthy food, which selling raises because of the advertising.
In my opinion the advertising toward young children should not be forbidden at all, but it should be important that the product is healthy udn good for the children and also adults when there is an advertisement for the product shown in TV.
There should be less advertising for candy or softdrinks, but more advertising for fruits and vegetables made for children, so they rather want to eat the sweet looking strawberries from TV, than the unhelthy yoghurts with way to much sugar in it.
A lot of children are watching TV daily.
This has something to do with the programms and everything children are advertised in the TV.
If the children are watching TV so often they will get bad eyes and even they will not go outside.
This is really bad for the health of the children.
But if you can put the children in front of the TV at times you need to do something like preparing meals or journeys it is nice that children stay in front of the TV.
Watching TV so often is still bad so young children need to do something else.
If the children is shown something on TV they often want to get it so parents are nerved by children who just want to get the toyce or whatever.
By advertising the children the TV producents just need to work with nice colours, pirates or unicorns and then they catch the children.
There are as well parents who are not that rich that they can buy everything the children want to have.
But on the otherhand the children are shown thinks which they maybe want to get for birthday or christmas.
If they have no idea what they want to get they get inspiried so they can make wishes out of it.
Finally you can  say advertising toward children is not good because they just want to get exactly those things and the parents are under pressure when they sometimes or often can not buy the child what he or she likes to have.
It is horrible if building groups starts in the age of two.
In the kindergarden they can start building groups of cool and borring people easier.
Just because it is easy to impress little children you should not do this everywhere and non stop.
Advertising should be stop by the TV industry or it should be forbidden by the TV channels so they do not show the advertisising.
In the last years, the television has become an ubiquitous part of our home.
After a challenging day of work, you like to go home, sit on the couch and watch some TV.
Some people prefer watching sitcoms or series and other people are more into blockbuster or action movies.
What nearly every TV programm has in common is that there are those annoying and long advertisements during a pause or between a change of the programm.
There are all kind of advertisements on TV nowadays from which companies benefit.
But what about advertising directed toward young children?
Should they be allowed or not?
On one hand, the advertising is important for many entreprises who make their money from young children products.
Nestle, one of the biggest grocery producer in the world, produces all sorts of groceries for young children.
On the other hand, there are more ways of advertising successfully.
One can advertise in news papers, screens in public and so on.
Secondly


So I think it should be allowed because there is no need to be against a television advertising directed toward young children.
The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two or five) should not be allowed" says that television are directing advertisement towards children, what in my opinion is not okay.
When a child who watches TV always sees those advertisements where children their age are playing with for example dolls and that child whose watching this ad sees these smiling and happy children, they naturally become jealous.
If this child is living in a household that has not enough money to buy expensive toys, it might feels like as if it is not as cool as the other children who seems so lucky to have those toys.
In return the family feels sorry because they just can not afford certain things and this leads to difficulties within the family.
Children also see the world with other eyes and they get influenced really quick.
So if the advertisements are always presenting the newest and coolest toys they are not able to catogerise and analyse these ads the way we would.
I also think that little children should not be confronted by advertisements because there are too many information, too many impressions to handle.
Furthermore some children might get the impression that evrything they ever see in the TV is perfect, symbolises the perfect life and they live under the pressure to live the life that gives the impression to be perfect.
And what happens when we live under a pressure with so high standards that we have the feeling to have to achieve?
We fall into depression, we get the feeling that we are not able to handle ourselfs anymore and we will never learn how it is to love ourselfs the way we are.
Sure, it might is leading to more profit for the firms but only because of the families who are able to afford all these expensive things for there children.
What is happening to the ones who are not capable of affording these things?
When they are older, they are getting bullied because of that.
Children are stupid sometimes.
It is already enough if one child does not wear expensive clothes and they are getting picked up on it.
I say no to advertisements directed towards young children.
And even us teenagers.
Because those impressions we are getting through the ads are leading to jealousy and pressure to be like the ones in the ads.
To live a life that does not excist.
Or at least not for everybody.
On the one hand, most of the children aren`t used to give statements about specific things, they can`t understand how advertising works.
They don`t know that advertising tries to catch the attention of the audience, and they will think that everything the advertising says have to be true.
They won`t speculate about the truth of the advertising, they`ll just try to persuade their parents to buy the things the advertising presents.
These are arguments which support the opinion that television advertising for young children should be forbidden.
But on the other hand, I think that also children should watch advertising, because that`s the best way to teach them that not everything television says is true.
If the parents explain that they won`t buy a product from television advertising and why they won`t buy it, children will be able to understand that they can`t own everything.
Furthermore, they have to make their own experiences about whether a product from advertising is as good as the advertising claims or not to learn about the methods of advertising, in case their parents buy it.
That`s why I am of the opinion that also children should be allowed to watch television advertising, as long as there are only products for children the content of the advertising.
Of course, the advertising should only show toys or film trailer, for example, things the children know and want to play with, because other advertising elements aren`t on the children`s mind.
And there shouldn`t be advertising about political aspects as an example, things children won`t be able to understand and criticise.
Furthermore, the advertising musn`t show trailers of films children can`t deal with, like thriller, because many children would get nightmares because of those.
The advertising for children should be ruled.
In this following essay I am going to discuss the advatages and disadvantages of television advertising that is directed toward young children.
Firstly, television advertising is quiet okay because nowadays we live in a world full of advertising.
So why should young children not be able to expire television advertising toward them.
We do not live in the 19th century no more.
The young children have to build their own future and it would be helpfull if they get to know our world in their young ages.
On the other hand, television advertising toward young children is very bad for the thoughts of children.
Through the television advertising de children do not think by themselves.
They believe everything what tehy hear or see and with advertising they will not lern how they should have their own oppinion because they never had to think before.
In my eyes I would defenetely not allow television advertising toward young children.
They should lear how to think by themselves and get their own ideas.
I think advertising toward them is the worst thing we could allow if we want them to be creative and successfull in life.
In the following text I will refer to the given statement that television advertisings that are directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I totally agree with this statement because at first children who are that young are not old enough to understand the sense of an advertisement.
In my eyes young children should also not watch much television and then it is important that there is not much advertising during the specific shows or series.
These advertising would influence them too much because they are too young to understand what an advertisement is for and how it is not always realistic.
Especially all the advertisements for toys should be forbidden because a child will never be happy with its toys when there is always something more actual or better on the TV.
So the advertising also influences the children's behaviour what should be avoided because these young persons should be allowed to grow up without the sounds and jingles of advertisings.
But there is also another important argument: If children watch TV and there is an advertising with a for example flying boy they could try to imitate his behaviour but they are too young to dicover the danger of jumping like a superhero from something high to prove that they can fly higher than the young boy in the advertising.
But  I admit that  something like this (a dangerous situation) can happen because of a normal television show (instead of an advertising), too, although most of the TV  shows today are controlled by organisations like FSK that declare for what age this film is suitable for.
As a conclusion I can say that especially the young kids need to be protected (if they already watch televison).
One opportunity to save the youngest is already installed in the most of the new televisions.
In Germany it is called "Kindersicherung" and it doesn't open specific channels without a code so that the children cant't watch these shows or series.
The parent can choose which channels they include into the "Kindersicherung" and they can change their list of forbidden channels at any time when their children are getting older.
(old enough for some of the channels and their program) But I still think that young children shouldn't watch that much television even if there weren't any advertisements in it.
Television advertising has much to offer for many different generations.
But there are cases that are dangerous to direct adverstismnent to young children aged two to five.
But what is so dangerous and what are the consequences when televison shows advertisment to young children?
At first young children don't understand everything they see in television.
When they watch for example an advertisment for dolls that can say what ever you want, they believe it and want to get one.At this age children are still really naive.
But there are often lies in all these advertisments and young children get easily effected by all these things that aren't true and are shown in television.
Also it's hard for parents to say to their own children that they can't have somehing.Children always cry and are really sad about it.
Things that are shown in advertisments are often really expensive and for parents who are for example poor it's hard to stay strong when children want something and get really angry.
They can't convince their children easily with arguments and expect their children to understand their money problems.
They always want things they can't have without knowing the problems behind it.
Young children also don't watch televison very often at that age.
They should play with other kids and start to grow with learning by doing.
When they watch TV at this age they maybe get used to it and always watch television.This has a big effect on their future, because it's not healthy to not move or do other stuff for example homework and just watch television.
That means that it's often not allowed to watch television, because their parents don't want their child to watch it.
So there's no chance that the adverstisment is popular to kids.
It's a waste of money for all the advertisment companies.
As a conclusion it's not good to show avertisment at televsion toward young children, because it's for both sides a waste of money.
Children are too young at that age to watch televsion or especially to understand every word right.
There are often discussions about the topic television and young children, if they should watch television or not.
I think that it depends on a few things.
When you let a two years old child watch TV the whole day, it isn´t good for his or her development, because the child is just inside and it doesn´t meet any other childs.
Then the child just learns from the TV series, but not from social contacts.
In my opinion as a parent you should set clear rules, when, how long and what your child is allowed to watch TV.
Because if not, the child maybe watches some TV shows that aren´t good for his or her age.
Also it is important to control a bit how long it watches TV and that it sometimes goes outside to learn also things from the nature and the people around the child.
On the other hand it isn´t good to control your child or doesn´t let it watch Tv at all, because then it just learns from the family or friends, which isn´t bad but it should also learn things from television.
Essaying I would say that you should let them watch TV but with some rules.
Most of the time television channels have to decide which kind of products they would like to advertise.
Certain factors are looked upon to choose which advertisement fits best to the content of the channel.
Problems seem to occure though, because people are not sure wether television advertisement for children should be allowed or not.
Obviously children should not have access to advertisement for cigarettes, alcohol or any other kind of drug which could potentially be damaging.
But if a child is able to watch channels that present such products, it probably shouldn't be allowed to watch those channels either.
Depending on the age group television channels show advertisement that fits best and also advertisement where the companies can be sure that the viewers will buy their products.
So when a child watches a channel meant for kids it will probably see advertisement for dolls or cars or other new games that are available on the market, which isn't a problem at all.
On the other hand though some people think it even is controversial that young children have the chance to watch tv.
Out of fear, parents don't allow their child to watch tv, thinking that their child could easily switch the channel and see something they aren't meant to see for exemple advertisement for the latest horror movie.
In conclusion advertisement can be damaging for a child, but with the newest security systems on tv it should be possible to let a child enjoy children's channels and seeing avertisement that is directed towards their eyes.
In this essay, I will state my opinion on the question wheter or not television advertising toward young children should be allowed.
Of course, it's fun for small children to watch their favorite shows on TV.
But on this way, they also get in touch with digital advertising very easily.
While on special channels for children, it's most likely some kind of fun games, on channels for older people almost everything could be advertised.
In general, advertising is quite manipulative, making the people want to buy the stuff they try to sell - and small children can be manipulated very easily.
When children see a new game, they probably beg their parents to buy it for them because they are obviously way too young to purchase something on their own.
Then it's the parents' choice wheter or not their child is allowed to get a new thing to play with.
Also, when children never get to see advertising, it's way harder for them to deal with it later in life.
But advertising may also trick the children into thinking everything they see on TV is real.
Especially for very young people, it's hard to make a difference between reality and a fictional world.
In general, I don't see something wrong with television advertising for young children.
It's interesting to see the new games they may probably get for next Christmas and most of the time, they enjoy seeing advertising that is directed to them.
Of course the children shouldn't spend too much time in front of a TV, but that's the thing parents should be keeping an eye on normally.
Also, they should be aware of the fact that they need to show children how to deal with digital advertising the correct and best way instead of just forbid them to watch TV for all their childhood because this (as long as it's on a healthy dose) may even help them to understand life and growing up in the world they're living in since advertising is an important part of today's society.
Advertising is a very contradictory subject and there exist many diffrent opinions about it.
Should television advertising directed towards young children be allowed or not?
The factories, who sell the goods, which are in an advertising, make a lot of money with it, because children want to have the things, which they see in adverts and often they evan manage to persuade their parents to buy them.
It brings though much profit to the factories.
Secondly, the state would influence the privat live of people, which would contradict the freedom of everyone to do, what they want.
On the other hand, children are very manipulative and advertisments, which they watch, have a big influence on them.
They do not realize, that advertising often doesn not show the reality, but a better picture of a product.
Childern believe everything, what they hear and they are not able to distinguish between reality and lies.
If they see for example an advertising, which they like, they want to have the product without thinking of its downsides.
The whole lot of advertisments for children makes it very difficult for their parents too, because their children always want to have the products, which they see in the advertising.The parents then always have to expain them, why they do not buy them these things.
Another reason not to allow advertisments for children,is, that this confronts them very early with materialism.
We live in a very material society nowadays, but the children should not learn this materialist attitude too early.
Despite the fact that advertisments are good for the economy and a prohibition of advertising would contradict the freedom of everyone to do, what they want, it would be much better for the children not to be confronted with advertising, because it has a bad influence on them.
A normal saturday evening.
A family is watching a film on TV.
The film is often interrupted by advertising.
There is advertising for almost all you can buy.
The children are interested in short advertising films about toys.
They would love to get the pink barbie or the toy cars to christmas.
Should television advertising directed toward young children be forbidden?
First of all, young children are influenced by advertising more than older ones.
They can not realize that the promises made in TV does not become true.
So if the barbies speak or the cars drive of her own.
Maybe there are disappointed in the presents they wanted to get but now they are boring.
I guess there is no advertising directed to children that influences their live in an bad way.
So why should it be forbidden?
I think young children watche TV chanels like KiKa and I did not remember they show advertising.
Of course parents have to control what their children are watching.
But I think the advertising that is directed toward young children is not a risk for them.
Telivision advertising is an very important topic in our every day lifes.
Nearly everybody who watches something in the television knows about all the advertisings.
Today I will give you my opinion to the television advertising directed to young children.
An argument for advertising in the young age is, that the children get prepared for their lifes in an highger age.
When they grow up with the advertising, their parents will propably explain to them how they have to work with it and they should not let influence theirselves from the advertising.
But on the other side, children can learn also in an higher age how they can devoid the influence of the advertisings from the television.
They will propably not change anything on their attitude to watch television and to watch advertisings.
Another point is, that children in this young age can not understand the advertising completely and they want to have all of it, if their parents would allow this.
Here is an example: "If there is a toy, for example a dog, in an advertising and a little girl, 4 years old, is watching it in the television, then she would ask her parents directly if they can buy them for her.
Her parents would propably say no and the little girl would be very sad."
This example should show, that the children let influence theirselves too much from the advertisings, because they do not understand what the producers want to reach and their parents can not devoid this.
As you propably can see in my arguments, I totally agree with the statement, because I think that children in this young age should not be confrontated with this advertisings.
Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed or not?
First of all, I think that it is important to mention that the children are very young and could get influenced by the television advertising.
For example when they see a commercial of barbies, they want a barbie or want to look like it.
Moreover they get to know a very wrong role of a woman like looking good and being thin, cook all day long and think thats all they can do.
On the other side not many young children in age 2 to 5 watch TV regulary so it minimizes the chance to get influences by wrong roles.
Many parents just want their children to read and hear music and not watch the TV.
So they don't get influenced.
In addition the young children do not think so much about the things in the advertsing so they do not know whats behind it and just want one thing.
It is more dangerous later, when they are teenager and think about the roles and being thin.
I think that the parents should not allow their children to watch the TV so early and when they are so young.
My opinion is that the advertising is then no problem.
Later it is a problem in puberty when the children think about it, but it can also start very early.
It is a very controversial theme, but it is the best solution to not allow the children to watch the TV so they do not get in touch with advertising.
Everyone knows and see it, the happy world of products and advertising in Television.
Most of us aren't really interested in watching it, but if something is very colourful and loud,the most childeren want to see it.
So there offers the question if these kind of advertising, which is directed toward childeren, shouldn't be allowed?
The most interesting advertisings for childeren in age of two to five are toys, musik or nearly everything thats loud.Now imagine parents with their child are going through the supermarket and there is the new super cool waterpistole.
Of cause the child want the toy, but the parents say no.
The young child starts to scream, cry and rolling over the ground.
These situation is anoying and embarissing, not only for the parents also for every other person around.
The positive sites are only seen by the company of the product.
Many parents want to stop the terror of their childeren and just buy what they want,and the company sees much money.
I think it is not possible to stop the adverrtising directed to childeren in age of two to five, because it's a big deal for the companies and they wont stop it.
But I would agree, that it should not be allowed to make these kind of advertising.
                    Advertising

There are many reasons for why television ads specifically targeted to young children should not be allowed, but in my oppinion one of the strongest is that children aged two to five often can't differentiate between a good tip from their friends or peers - maybe for a toy - or just plain advertisements.
That means that those kids would often bug their parents about a special toy, just because they saw it on TV once.
Their brains are simply not able to evaluate what they see as much as that of an adult can.
But on the other hand, most TV channels do need those advertisements, in order to cover the costs of producing and sending the children-friendly content that they're offering, and to keep it all running.
If their would be no ads, the channel would need a different way to make profit, which in most of the cases results in premium-channels.
So the big question - that you have to decide for yourself - basically is, whether you want to be able to recieve and watch TV for free, or you want your children to grow up to children-friendly content with no ads, which means you have to pay a premium.
In my oppinion there is no perfect solution to that problem, especially because some familys don't have the leftover money needed to subscribe to a premium-channel.
And as long as that is the case, TV ads targeted to children have to be allowed, or the children of those familys won't be able to enjoy content made for their age at all.
(*The problem is not that I don't have the vocabulary or grammar necessary in order to write more, but simply that I hate essays..)
Advertising toward young children?
I would agree the following statement, that television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed, because a child at this age can be easy manipulated, by the advertising.
The manipulation of our society is a big problem and shouldn´t be supported by anyone.
Also children decide about their own life, without beeing influenced by any organisation or an advertising in the television.
The only positive point for this statement is, that the company, who does make the advertising towards the children can easily win new people, which will buy their products.
So the company is the only one, who has a use for this advertising toward young children.
Young children are not in the position to buy products of a company, so they have to annoy their parents till they buy the products.
The parents are the one which will try to make the manipulation undone, but it will end mostly like the parents will buy the product for the child , so it is quiet.
It´s really unfair for the parents and they only prevent their children from the manipulation if they wouldn´t allow their children to watch television or the advertising towards young children shouldn´t be allowed.
So there are only positive aspects for the company about the advertising towards young children and only negative for all the other people, which means that this kind of advertising shouldn´t be allowed in my opinion.
In the following Essay I will take position about the statement: ''Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.''
In our world, we live today, is advertising a thing of our all day life.
We find Ad's not just in the TV, there are many other ways, for example ad walls.
You could now say: why should the advertisment not reach everybody, children included.
Well, there might be some points that could support this statement.
One might be the growing rivaliation between companys and labels.
They obviously have to communicate with the customer to ''stay alive''.
But on the other hand, there are children aged at two to five, which should play outside and gather life-expierence.
Children, that are sitting all day long in front of their televisions, are often having social problems in their further life.
Ad's for those support the Tv consume, especially because children are way more open for those ad's.
You could now argue, well there are parents.
They have to controll the consume.
Yes, that is true.
But there are familys with problems, where the parents dont have enough time.
Especially for them, should'nt kids get that effected.
The labels have still the oppurtunity, to create ad's for the parents.
That would let the children uneffected and they could have a lovely time as a child.
My opinion is obvious, dont create ad's for children in that young age.
Try to focus on adverstisments for groups, that are able to handle the influence.
In the following text I will argue on the thesis that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Advertisements are basically everywhere to be seen in our daily life.
Since younger people also use mobile devices or use the internet to watch for instance Youtube, where ads are played,too, I would in addition television advertising say that online adnvertising shouldn't be allowed, too.
Advertising in general is used to manipulate and influence the thoughts of the audience and bend it to the company's will.
And when watching the add over and over again the effects on the audience are unforeseenable.
But after all, adults are already able to defend themselfs against strong advertisements, most grown-ups know what they need can properly decide what is good or bad for them.
But we are talking about young children from the age 2 to 5.
Their brains are not as developed as the brains of adults.
During the age of 2 to 5 the human being is still learning everything he aquires through his senses.
They are most of the time leaded by emotional and not rational thinking.
Advertisement is easily accepted by the young children, they would be overwhelmed by the manipulative pictures and slogans.
An example: On the "Disney Channel" is the ad of a "Lego" game shown.
The young children see these colorful images and are easily convinced that they want to this game.
The parents relentlessly give them what they want and "Lego" profits from the advertisement instantly.
Children at that age cannot decide what they want or don't want.
In conclusion I can certainly say that television and internet advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Advertisements are invented to get more and more people to buy a specific product.
Young children, especially aged from two to five are very easy to convince to buy something and mostly the parents also buy it for them, but should it really be banned?
A lot of people think that the advertisements wich are made just for kids are mostly the ones for toys, but that is wrong.
Often they tease stuff like sweets just for kids, and if they see them in the supermarket, they must have it and the parents often allow it, because otherwise the kids would scream through the whole supermarket.
In my opinion, the bigger problem is not the advertising, it is the parents!
Because the parents should theach the kids from when they are young that they can not have everything they want.
And often the products from the advertisements are not as good as they are told to be, tha is something the parents should teach the kids too.
You could protect the kids with not allowing advertisements directed towards young children, but in the end, they need to learn it when they are older.
And once you have learned it correctly, you know it for sure.
In my opinion the statement "Television advertising directed toward young child (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
isn't nessescary.
I think it depends on the parents of the young children, because if their are parents who think it's okay if their children watch television who cares.
It is their child and I think the parents know what is the best for their child.
So on the one hand, I think there are a lot of parents who can say what is the best for their children and if their could watch television but on the other hand there a so many parents which can not do this job and there maybe decided that there children could watch a film or a serie on television and then it is too bad for them and there couldn't handel it.
I think you can see the "Television-No" for young children aged from two to five in the first way or in the second way.
And it also depends on the question "what?
", because if the young children watch a film about animals or a film like "Frozen", I didn't see any bad points on it, but if the children watch a horrorfilm or something like that, it isn't good.
There is just one other point we must checked if the statement should worked and that is who checked this.
I mean when there is a statement like that who says that the parents do that and their children are not allowed to watch television or something like that.
I think nobody.
So all in all I would say it is very difficult to handel a statement like that and it is
I agree with the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed".
Clearly you can say that their is no big difference between children seeing the new toys on the television or getting to know about it by their friends in the kindergarden, but in my opinion the television with its television star has a much bigger effect on the children than their playmates.
Another argument for advertising directed toward young children is that it is easier for the parents to find good and fitting presents for their child, because automatically gets a lot wishes through the advertising.
But this could also lead to a problem.
If the child has for example ten wishes and the parents buy only three presents the cild maybe gets unhappy and can`t even be happy about those.
In my opinion it is wrong to show young children aged two to five advertising because they are not able to understand the meaning of the products.
This leads to the situation that they can`t decide which product is really important for their life and which stuff the truly need.
In addition most of them don`t have own money which means that they are not able to deal with it and to have a feeling for the worth of the product.
Furthermore I think children have a pretty big phantasy so it is possible to imagine things adults couldn`t even think about.
Concluding they are able to use for example old toys or stuff from nature for their playing and it is not neccessary for them to have the newest and best toys ever and ever again.
This is often good for the character of the child because it becomes more creative after a while, which is a good base for the school but although for the job life.
All in all I would say that advertising directed toward young children is a good invention for the concerns but not for the moneybag of the parents and the eduacation of the children.
I think it would be a good solution to make a television channel where the parents are able to decide if they want to turn the advertising on or off.
This means that is in their on hands if their children can watch advertising or not and how often and for what time space they can watch it.
But in the end it always the decision of the parents if the children are allowed too watch advertising or not.
If the children are able to see the advertising while the parents are watchging television it is not that effective if it is forbidden for them.
On the one hand I would say its not so good that parrents allow their children to look tv in this age.
The reason for that is that its very easy for children to switch between the programs and so they are able to look films like James Bond or something like that.
So the children are able to see maybe death people or people which kill other people.
This is very fatal and very easy for the children.
On the other hand I would say its a good thing to allow children in an age between two to five because today you can see many programs which are only inventioned for little children.
This programs can help your children to learn math, english or german.
But this effects are combined with fun, so your children want to look tv and have fun and the parrents are also happy because they know that their children learn something.
Another point is that there are many systems for the parents to safe their children.
One example is a system that block all oher tv programs, so the children are unable to look films like James Bond, or a system that conrol how much time the children spend looking tv and if they look to many tv the system turn off the tv.
Honestly i would say parrents can allow their children to look tv because their so many systems to safe the children and the effect that the children can learn something by watching tv is also good.
Due to this the children have much fun and this is  very important.
I am of the opinion that such advertising should not be allowed:

Firstly, it targets young humans who are not able to critically engage the content of the advert.
In addition to that, an adult may be able to tell whether or not he or she is manipulated as adults are capable of self-reflection, while such abilities are absent in young children.
While some may argue that children would not be easily manipulated as they can tell fantasy and reality apart, this argument neglects the hyperrealistic nature of many adverts today, making it hard for the child to tell apart advert and reality.
This could lead to developmental impairment as the development of critical thinking may be slowed down by such a delusion.
Another argument that could be brought forth is that such a prohibition would harm the market by shutting off a portion of the customer base.
This argument, however, fails to mention the negligible purchasing power of young children.
Instead of targeting the children to get them to nag on their parents, the adverts should be targeted towards parents.
These parents are the ones buying the advertised good either way, which would probably not lead to a noticable decrease in the sales of the products.
This could even lead to more sales, as parents could be directly advertised to, convincing them directly of the advantages of the product.
Such a ban could also harbor benefit for the children: A large number of young children are obese, probably tied to fast-food adverts targeted towards them.
A ban on these could significantly improve the health of children.
In conclusion, I agree with the statement because of the potential harmful effects of such adverts on both childrens bodies and minds.
The amount of televison kids watch these days, since the Tv was created is higher then before.
Kids spent their whole time in front of the TV or other specific high-tech systems.
Kids, especially young ones can be distracted by the advertisments and can believe everything said in a 3 minute Tv spot.
For example the Advertisments where unrealistic content is shown, like things that are on paper or package start living and flying around, or animals like unicorns get real and run through the living room.
Another point of view is that the kids spent too much time in front of the Tv in general.
They stop spending time with friends or just watch spongebob with them.
There are also special Ads which kids will always keep in their mind.
The ones with violent content, half-naked women or a lot of action stay in their minds and afterwards in school, they tell friend about it of course.
But ads are not always bad and inappropriate.
Sometimes they just want to make us realize how good we have it to have a home food and just a family.
This concept goes for example with the "unicef" Advertisments.
Those show often poor kids without food and family.
If little kids get such a message is questinable though.
Another pro aspect for ads is that are able to learn something new any may they can understand just a little how the "big world" works.
Different pictures make different and impressions and different impressions make a more interesting place to live on.
One way or another the influence of television and Advertisments is bigger then we think.
But as long as our kids use some of their short time between Shows  and Cartoons to go out to remember what the real world looks like, things still didn´t hit the bottom
The given statement proposes that television advertising that is directed towards young children should not be allowed.
Personally, I agree with this, seeing that especially young children around the proposed ages between two and five years are easily manipulated.
Adults and teenagers are heavily influenced by commercials as well, although they, contrary to small children, know about deceits such as false advertisement and what it is in fact intended to achieve - to lure potential buyers for certain products.
It doesn't necessarily show the truth.
So if an adult for example watches a commercial targeted towards their age group, they may weigh the pros and cons of the product, be it consciously or not, despite only the great aspects of the respective product being shown and emphasized.
Children don't automatically do that.
They would of course see the pros of what they're seeing, but they don't ask for the negative aspects that come along with it.
Thus, they can be easily tricked into fully believing commercials, convince their parents to buy said product and then come to be disappointed or simply desire more.
Furthermore, it could potentially convey false messages or imply things to manipulate the child's mind.
As already mentioned above, children are very easily influenced.
The goal of advertisement is ultimately influencing the potential customer before the television.
Specific mindsets towards certain topics can be planted into the little ones head before they even know much about it, which on a long run may turn out harmful to them or others.
If, as a very extreme example, faschist propaganda were somehow hidden in commercials targeted towards children, that would not only have severe consequences for the child, but their environment and the people around them as well.
In general, the chance of any of it being intended propaganda is relatively small, but, whether intended or not, it does take part in the child's life, especially now that television is playing a large role in the lives of many kids.
However, it is the firm's responsibility to sell their products, and directing their advertising to this age group may secure them a much larger number of customers, since every parent wants to satisfy their child and make them happy.
But therer are other ways for firms to secure this part of the market, without having to drag in small children who don't know much about advertising and are thus prone to its effects.
They don't have the responsibilty do deal with this
In the following text we discus the topic: "Televison advertising directed toward young children between two and five years should not be allowed".
The first point against this statement is that young children can learn a lot if they watch a something about the world or about the nature but the problem here is that most of the children watch things which aren´t good for them.
Another point against this statement is that don´t have any idea what they can do because  the perents of them don´t buy things with them they can play.
Against this you can say that also can go out and with four or five years you have friends and you can do better things then watching TV.
For example you can paly football or play catching other children.
The first point which agree with this statement is that it is not good for there young eyes to watch TV because maybe it can destroy there eyes and it is very bad if you need with young years glasses.
Another point is that it is very important to have social contacts to other people maybe they can help you with a few things.
For example they can help you to speak or to went.
In adittion you have to make your own experience and you can´t make your own experience if you sit on the coutch and whatch TV.
Experience are very important for the future of young people and without them you have a harder live then others.
At last you can say that it isn`t good for young children to watch lots of TV but i don´t think that the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" is a good statement.
Today nearly nobody can spend without watching television.
Sadly, parents sit their young children in front a TV, that they can do other things and must not care for their children.
But is this the wright way to deal with the short freetime, you have, if you are parents?
On the one hand it maybe solve the problem for the parents, that their children is not silent or is getting on their nervs, while they have to do the household or work.
But on the other hand it is not okay, to sit a young child in front of a televison channel for adults, this can build a trauma in the mind of the child.Some parents do not care about what is on the televion, tehy only want silence for a time.
Eventhough parents show their children channels for kids, it should be a solution for more than an hour.
Although some series try to teach the children speaking, but you can not compare it with the social contact to the parents,other family members,...
In the future these children lose the ability to deal with social conflicts and all in all to know new people, they are not so educated and have it harder to get a good education, because they had no good skills, you need for it.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because the rate for risk and danger is much higher than for the positive aspects.
And I think, the government should make a law, which forbid it.
These children will be the future for humanity and the whole planet.
In today's day and age it is impossible to not come across an advertisement every once in a while.
Wether it's written on bilboards or seen on TV, a persons day always includes some company's attempt at luring them into buy their product.
So why should children be excluded from such an apparently mundane day to day occurance, the answer is that simple, they shouldn't.
Just as with a lot of things in life, if you want something, there is some kind of tradeoff, so if you as a parent want to be able to enjoy a brief moment of silence and let your child be educated by the television you also have to live with the fact that companies will want to enthice your child by showing it new toys etc.
so first off, if you don't want these ads to have an effect on your children, don't let them watch TV.
Second off, why shouldn't they be allowed, just so that you as a parent can have a good night's sleep without beeing tortured into buying that new toy car for your son who has no other cares in the world?
No, is the answer.
Either you as a parent are rightous enough to stand up to your child and say no, or you give in and enjoy those 5 minutes of silence in which your child isn't bored already with its new toy.
Prohibiting companies to make advertisements directed to young children would also impeed the business succes of companies which have that target group, meaning that if everyone can make ads for their respective target group (e.g.
makeup for women, viagra for old men) but they can't then that wouldn't be a fair market for products that aren't harmful.
Finally those ads aren't out to harm your children, but to give them an incentive to buy a companys products, in other words exactly what all the other ads do to you.
So if you really don't want to have your child want what other children already have at its age, then don't let her watch TV and close its eyes when you go out in public, or start to do some actual parenting in stead of limiting toy selling companies from blossom and crippling the market.
So do yourself a favor and let the children be children and let the companies do marketing.
In some talkshows they worked with the question whether <<television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed>>.
So the question is still very interesting for many parents who have growing childrens.
At first it is a kind of freedom to make advertisings for products in the style that every customer think about it.
There weren´t a rule for a long time period against it and it damaged nobody so why should it be changed now?
Young childs also wants to be informed when there are new toys on the market.
Further on the parents pay attention on their childrens in these ages and they do not have their own money to waste it for well done advertisings.
But on the other hand the young childs are getting influenced by the advertisings and because the childrens are only interested in toys and sweets.
So they propably spend their small count of money to buy some cheap but useless toys.
As a result to stop the growing influence on childrens by advertisings in a digital world it might be useful to not allow these kinds of advertisings.
I personally think, that advertising directed toward young children should still be allowed because it is a kind of force to disallow these advertisings.
Further on I don´t know childrens who are seriously influenced by these advertisings and who were damaged by them.
We often see or hear about children who watch a lot of television.
They regulary watch television for some hours a day.
Of course it is normal to watch TV but not always four hours a day.
Children dont have to spent too much time on television.
They should go out with their friends, play football or do something other outside.
It isn't good for their eyes to watch television for a long time.
The advertising between the series are very bad for the children.
Sometimes it's special what the matter of the advertise is.
When the children often watch television and see a lot of the advertise they want all of the beautiful toys.
They only speak about this cool car which they want or the new barbie or whatever.
After a while their parents buy them this things.
The children get it and play one or two times with the car and then it isn't interesting anymore.
Some kids take their toys to school and show it their friends.
So it begins a quarrel about the best toy and perhaps one of the friends destroys it.
It is nice when the children change their toys so everyone can play with an other toy and be happy, but the television advertising can't help to be happy.
When I was four years old, we played with the toys from our older sister and we were happy.
I know that every factory will sell their toys but I think it isn't good when you always see the new things which are better than yours.
You can't enjoy your life if you always have to be better than the others.
I have often played with plants or stones.
You can make a nice house of stone and the plants are the people who live there.
I think with all these television advertising we stole the fantasy of our children.
Everybody knows those annoying commercials that interrupt a good movie.
Many companies are trying to win the people for their product and they mostly succeed because otherwise they'd quit because it's not worth it and they couldn't afford it anymore.
Often their aiming at young people in order to generate new loyal customers because once they like your product there's a high possibility that they'll always buy it.
I want to answer the question whether this kind of commercial should be allowed or prohibited.
Commercials are often responsible for addiction in any way.
If you eat at Mac Donalds for instance you'll get to see a lot of young people (like from two to five years old) and when you see them eating those "Happy Meals" you can conclude that they were inspired by these remarkable advertisements from the TV spots.
But from now on they'll always eat at Mac Donalds and over the years they'll most likely gain weight what damages their image and perhaps they be bullied one day.
But when you think about I bet you'll come up with some good arguments that emphasize the importance of those advertisement.
I mean think about our economy: It need's to work like this.
Companies are supposed to grew and enlarge all the time and they generate new employers what reduces the number of unemployed workers.
Imagine the government would forbid commercials for those people; Companies would get stuck and wouls have effects for other companies like for example the companies who deliver products and so on.
So imagine commercials for young people were forbidden companies would have a big lack in perhaps twenty years.
What would for example companies like "Lego" do if they didn't have any customers anymore.
In my opinion it would be ridiculous if the government didn't allow commercials directed to young people anymore.
They would restrict their own economy system and made a huge mistake they cannot be frogiven for.

Since many years there are advertisings in the program of kids television show.
Exspecially american television systems use them by hard.
In the following agrees and disagrees of this topic will be showed.
One the one hand, advertisings have to be in the program, because the company of television were financed by them.
So they are the reason, that many programs are cheap or for free.
On the other hand, this advertisings make kids lose their time, which could be used to play outside or make other funny things.
Furthermore, the children believe this advertisings and get lost to them.
The kids see these products and they really want to get them.
So the parents would have many problems, if they maybe have not enough money.
Maybe they are feeling than as bad parents or between the adult and the child will be more trouble and much more stress.
I agree with the statement.
In my opinion television advertising direct toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
I think its better when companys use secondary programs for Kids like ZDF and KiKa.
So they get more money from ZDF and not so much from KiKa.
Relations like this could be used as an idol for other television companys.


In a society where nearly everybody can take part of media advertising ,concerning young children, is an issue.
So it should be considered if it should be forbidden to advertise directly to young children.
On the one hand it is very easy to influence children in that age.
They have no experience in life and are not steady in their mind.
So if they are manipulated in young age it can have big influence on their later life and on their behavior of buying.Later in their life it could influence the way how the children as grown up spend their money,which is of course the background why big companies advertise.
They could get in financial problems.
On the other children in that age have no oppurtunity to buy things.
So if they want something they have to ask their parents and in that case it would not matter if the kids are manipulated or not.
You could also consider that companies have to advertise in television and also directly to children.
And adult would never buy an toy because he wants it.
He does that because the children want to have a specific thing.
So if a company wants to sell something they have to make the children see it.
Since most children watch television it is the only oppurtunity.
Furthermore children in that age should not watch so much television at all.
It is already an issue that big c0mpanies have a reason to make such advertising.
All in all i think it should be allowed to direct advertisements toward children.
I think in few cases it can influence the behavior of children when they grow up.
But since children can not buy something by themselves in that age it is not that big of a problem.
And what is really striking is that companies have to sell their goods so advertisement also have to be made.
Since technical things developed much faster, children start to grow up with more technical things like smartphones, televisions, computers and so on, than in the past.
At least every child grows up with a television and thats why there could be the question, if it should not be allowed to show television advertisings directed toward young children.
It is obvious that children especially in this age during two to five are easy to influence.
So whenever they see something they want or someone tells them to buy something cause they really need it, they change their mind so then they really want it.
Then they always get on their parents nerves and were sad when the parents do not allow buying these things.
Also they learn from television advertisings.
If the guy or kid in the advertisement is doing something which looks like fun or something like that, the children watching this want to try it out, too.
Even if it is dangerous.
Also in these newer times the advertisings are often about ne apps and so on which pushes the children more and more to the technical side, so they stop playing outside or something.
They trust in things, the television is showing them, so they even expect the things which are showed them in the advertisings even if it is physically not possible or something else.
On the other hand the people, making games and so on have to show it in a way to children and so on.
Otherwise they would not earn enough money to go on in their production.
Also the television programms have to earn enough money to pay their costs.
That is just possible with advertisings and so on.
So many jobs depent on this.
All in one I think jobs are most important so this side wins for me.
Nowadays many children, especially young children aged two to five watch television because of parents who have no time or are just not amused to play with their children.
The children watch everything in television for example telivision advertising.
In the following essay I will discuss whether television advertising directed young children should be allowed.
Firstly I would like to mention that there are a lot of channels for children.
They are especially made for them to sleep well or just to laugh a little bit and get some kind of distraction.
They are made to give the parents time to calm down or to do other things like the dishes.
This sort of channels have no bad influence on a little child.
Furthermore children do not watch television that much because they go to the kindergarden and spend time with their parents.
Another argument I would like to add is that every adult has do decide on their own whether it is okay for a child to watch television or not.
There could be some parents who want their children to watch television advertising.
Parents have to make decisions on their own beacsue this is their 'job'.
They get a child to take care for it this leads to own decisions and an own opinion how to raise a child.
The last argument I would like to mention is that children aged between two and five are not that interested in television.
They like to play outside or to meet their friends.
Usually they play with dolls or with other toys to have fun.
Sometimes they have to spend the whole day in the kindergarden where they play with their friends every single second and where they do not have the possibility to watch television.
To sum it up I think that it should be allowed for lables or brands to have the possibility to make television advertising even if children will watch it.
There are different channels and some especially for children that is why it should be a task for parents to raise a child in the right way and tell him/her which things are allowed and which are not.
We are living in a world where technology is a very important thing and many people can't live without.
Either the smartphone or tablets are in our hands.
But often we like to lay on the couch an watch television, but should television directed toward young children be allowed?
This statement is a controversial theme.
The children are even more younger when there starting to watch television and some parents don't care because the children are busy and couldn't go on there nerves.
On the other side it isn't good for them because they can become bad eyes or don't go outside anymore.
The young children will be learn the wrong things and if they are looking to much television they can be stressed and want to look even more TV.
In our society it isn't possible to say that the young children shouldn't watch Tv because it's a very big problem when everyone is watching it the whole time and they musn't.
In comparison to that point it's so important for there rising to have freetime and play outside with friends.
If they are watchuing television the whole time they are sitting in a room without freshly air and forget the time.
Most of the time the parents don't think about this problem because of our technologe societiy.
Finally it's important for children to go outside and communicate.
Television can make them nervous and often they watch the wrong things so they learn bad vocabulary for the future and mostly haven't the same experiences as others.
In my oppinion it should be allowed for children to watch TV but not that often so they have enough time for using there freetime to gain experiences.
Television adevertising directed toward young children should be allowed but parents should pay more attention on it.
And I think not every child is watching TV that often so there are only a few with problems.
There are advertisements in the television, that are directed to children between 2 and 5.
Now i want to show some arguments for and against this and in the end summarize my opinion.
The first positive thing, that comes in my mind is, that these advertisements are for the childrens age and not for example some advertisements for adults.
This can also be good for showing the children new things and maybe, if there is an advertisement for a toy for example, they want to have it and they can then play with it.
Also there can be interesting advertisements for children so they get interest in new things which are shown in the television or something like that.
But there are also negative points in these advertisements.
One thing is, that the children maybe don't even understand one thing which is said.
Also it could be a problem, that they get addicted to watching television if there is an advertisement they really like and which they want to see all the time.
Also there can be advertisements, which aren't liked from every child.
And that is not good if they start to cry from some advertisements or if they have bad dreams about something which was shown on the television.
The question is now, if television advertisements, directed to children between 2 and 5 should be forbidden or stay allowed.
In my opinion, they shouldn't be forbidden because it can be interesting or it can show things which are nice and which the children also like.
There are also some negative things, but for the most things it could help that the parents overwatch their children, while they watch television.
So if this is the case there should almost be no problem with these advertisementes and i think it is okay to allow them, because there aren't so good reasons against it.
Nowerdays often the question if young people should watch TV comes up to our minds.Today many young children watch TV because their parents have no time to play with their children.
In my opinion it is not good for so young people to watch TV the hole day.
Children in this age should play outside with other children in their ages.
It is important for them to have social contact to know how to act infront other people.
Young children learn the most with other peolpe in the same age.
When they watch TV it is also possible to learn new things, so you have to know the difference between some channels.
Some channels are very helpful to learn the language or the numbers but other channels do not have a learneffect.
They are only there for entertainement what is not the best for little children.
Young children should play with friends in the same age or with there parents and other familymembers.
At a special age it is okay to watch TV but not the hole day.
I think a two years old child do not have to watch TV to be entertaint it should play to have fun.
I think with five years it were okay when the child watch half an hour the day TV.
So in my opinion you have to know the differnence between the age of a child and the TV channel it is also important to look at the time, how long a child watch TV.
So in the end every parent have a other opinion to this theme and have to know it for himself.
"It sais that televison adversising direct toword young children".
To begin television has a big place in our society.
Nearly everyone is wathing TV nowedays because of the big number of TV-shows.
Beside the TV-shows witch are just for fun or to relaxe at the end of the day ther are also TV-shows were you can lern new things.
But should it be allowed for young children to watch it.
On the one hand as its been said television hasn't only TV-shows witch arent needed in life witch are just for fun so we have to split the wort television in two parts.
If children learning something with the televison, for example there is a TV-show were a child can learn how to speek better or maybe how to draw it could be good for the kid because he or she is not wasting his or her time.
Because in the young age children don't forget what they hear or see everything stays in their mind.
But on the other hand this kind of experience can the child also have in public, for example by talking with its family.
He or she has there also the oppertunity to learn with other children by playing.
The child gets so a better social life and learns that its not only him/her.
The second part opf television are the TV-shows were you dont learn something you are just watching something happen.
ther the children also get influenced.
I agree with the statement because in this age it is verry imortant to lern by doing and this in socitety.
The Children aged two to five dont know really much because they have to learn everything new.
Its importand to show them only good things and something good to lern because it will stany for the rest of his/her life.
More and more houses in our countries get a television at home.
Today it is standard to have minimum one television at home.
Now we have like three generations on our planets.
The oldest one who havent any technical stuff in there childhood and learn about the new technical things since they are very old.
For those people are the new technical stuff new.
Television is something that they are know the most.
The second generations are the one who lived with the change to the new technic.
For those it is already standard with the modern technic.
And the latest generation are the one, who do not know something else.
Since they are on the planet they are surrounded by the newest technical thing.
One of this technical thing is logically the television.
From this new technic it is even an older one.
But some people have the opinion that in very young age you should not have to be allowed to have already contact to this new modern technic like television
Firstly That is because they think with this change of childhood they are loosing old good values.
If childrens were introduced in the life just with the new technical things they really dont know something else.
So they are loosing the contact to important values.
Things like this can leads into a big social trouble with other humans.
Generally humanity is getting loose.
We have to take care on this values.
The new technic can easily destroy old important values.
If the children are watching televison it seems everything to look perfect.
But thats not our reality.
I know that reality isnt perfect in the oposite of the technic world, but the reality is what counts.
But secondly i guess it doesnt need rules which are saying that childrens arent allowed to watch TV.
It is the job of the parents to look for the children.
They need a good relation between the reality and the virtuality.
So they can do easy the different between this two worlds.
Additionaly they have to know that the world that counts is the reality.
Overall i guess it is too hard to say it needs rules to forbidden Television for children.
That are values which should be given from parents.
If parents think they dont have to watch TV they can decide that.
But the point is that television isnt hard enough for children that they are completly lost.
I agree with the statement: Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I think at the age of two to five no child has to watch any television.
At this time there are so many other things to do.
For example playing outside with friends or have walks with family in the woods.
Learn something about nature and animals in real life is really worthful.
Some people have the opinion the children could learn things about life while watching television.
Sure there are some informativ documentaries but what kind of child wants to watch this boring stuff?
Another argument against using a television at this age is the children who sit infront of computers or ipads or smartphones or televisions all day or can we say atleast too often get fat.
They not get enough fresh air and they do not move.
So they eat and lay in bed and thats really bad for their health.
The parents have to be very careful because there are so many possibilities to get in contact with some kind of media in times like today.
I think parents have to protect their children

For parents it might be easier sometimes to "take" their children and set them in front of a television.
They do not have to pay attention to them any longer.
They do not have to prepare exiting trips or something.
But it is so important to play with your children and to give them love and time.
Dear parents, please spent some time with your young "pieces of gold" as long as you are able to do and as long as they are not too old to want to play with you.
As children have very visual-based beahviour, young children often feel the need to get something as soon as they see it somewhere frequently.
Therefore television advertising is probably a very good strategy for the companies to make those children want their product.
However it is questionable if children aged two to five should even already be confronted with advertising.
They are still in the stage of getting to know their environment and getting to know their families.
During this stage advertising can slower their progress as they get confused between the virtual and the real world.
Do you think the ads should be directed towards these young caracters?
Should they even be watching television often enough to get affected by those ads?
The most amazing childhood is the one, about which you can tell stories to your own children later.
Do you really want your child to tell stories about the television series to your grandchildren?
I do not think there should be television ads directed towards two to five year olds.
They are in the middle of finding out who they are and who they want to be.
I do not think they should be influenced by anything else but their families, their friends or their teachers.
Other than this I think they should not be sitting in front of the television often enough to get affected by ads.
A child only really wants something if it has to look at it over and over again.
They do not admire something after they saw it once.
They forget about it rapidly if they are not confronted with it another time.
So I think the more appropriate statement would be; Young children should live their childhood, rather than watching television often enough to be influenced by advertising.
Personally I agree with this statement, because a lot of young children use a huge amount of electronical devices in young age.
So they are not as communicative as the ones who grew up without any television or with not a huge usage of television.
Furthermore it is not helpful for the young generation, because they only get a knowlegde about the digital world and not about the "real" world.
So this could be a problem.
In addition to that a lot of families use these electronical devices, because they want a break from their children and so this could be a useful gadget, but i doesn't become to habit.
Otherwise if you travel in another country and spend their your vacation  and you use the restaurants in the hotel, there you can see a lot of families with young children who sit infront of a television.
In this case it is not a common TV, but through the digital century, you can use other electronical devices like mobile phones, tablets or comnputer.
These devices allow you to stream films or series, so these devices are the modern TV's.
You easy can take them with you.
Another aspect is that you also can watch films and series in the common Tv channel, but more and more people use stream websites like amazon prime, netflix, maxdome, sky on demand to watch their favourit films and series.
Through this kind of development, which we can/ have during the last years, we have to do something against this trend.
The children need a "real" childhood which is not based on electronical devices, they need a childhood which is based on "normal" things like meeting friends or to spend the whole day outside.
We have to find a conclusion in this case, because I think the TV have a huge influence on the young children.
Otherwise they are not able to seperat these things and what they see in the TV or what kind of things they see, are real.
Essay

Children are sweet and everybody likes children.
They just give us a great feeling.
This is a fact why many people use little children for their advertising.
But is this good for the children?
When the children are little they believe everything what adults are saying.
They have no own opinion and can not talk for themselve.
They do not choose for themselve.
Others are choosing for them.
So they can not say if they want to make advertising or not.
Many parent with sweet babies just try to get their little children on TV.
It is a simple work and they get paid for this.
Even when the children do not like the work, some parents just force them to do it.
But with 5 year you should be in de position to say what you like to do and what not.
When you force the little children to do stuff like this, than they can not reaise up like they want.
It can be irritating for them when they are growing up with doing advertising and suddenly they have to go to school and have a normal way of life.
It could bring many problems for the children.
It also can be that they do not like it that they were in a advertising and when they are older they are ashamed about this.
In the most advertising where chidren are in, there are just there for thir cuteness.
So we are using the cuteness from children to make advertising that other people buy stuff.
But is it really so bad, when chidlren are in advertising?
I do not believe that.
Sure it is not good when others are forcing them to do this.
But when they are sometimes in a advertising and when the parents are looking that their baby would not be ashamed about that, when it is older.
But the children also need to know that making advertising is not normal.
They have to know the real way of life and to live that.
Children nowadays become more and more used to media.
Not only the internet but also television influence 
the everydaylife of children, many even become addicted to it.
There are critists who think that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I agree to this statement, which I will now explain.
Many children in their early age choose somebody or something to  look up to, to gain motivation or to become 
inspired.
Of course, there is nothing wrong about it, but in some cases it can be very dangerous for their
further development.
Children become easily manipulated and if they watch the 'wrong things', it can have
a negative impact on their life.
Especially advertising is something of which young children are easily passioned about.
They see things
they may not have and become fascinated.
They start to think about what they have justb watched or listened to 
and it starts to influence their mind.
An example for a problematic situation which probably became worse because of advertising, is obesity.
Advertising of food has a massive impact on people's diet because it makes them want the things they have
just seen at the advertisement.
This is the same with young children.
If they watch television advertising directed 
to them, they  may form theirselves a wrong opinion abo
In the last years electronical devices, like television, are getting used more often.
Also small children often watches many hours television per week.
Where they come in contact with television advertising.
But it is well known that small children are very influencable by television advertising.
As quotet above small children are very easy to influence, especially by well made television advertises.
Because they are young and aren`t able to make their own thoughts about  aproduct due to their lack of experience.
For example I have seen this when my brother was younger and we went to the cinema.
At the beginning and during the brake there were many advertises, like movie trailers and food advertises.
While I wasn`t interested in it, my brother wanted to go eating there.
On the other hand it is very difficult to achieve the goal to get no television advertises to small children aged two to five.
Because you can`t ban channels fron every channel which a small kid is watching.
Because on every major channel their is a small kids watching so they have to ban advertises from every channel.
Also advertises is the main money income of the most television channels.
And without this income it would be impossible to provide free television channels.
Although small children are very easy influenced by television advertises it is very difficult to achieve the goal not to get any advertises to small children.
On plus television advertises are the main income of most television channels without them most channels would go bankrupt.
As a solution it is possible to do payable televisio channels on which isn`t any advertises.
This channels will earn their money by monthly paid prices from the consumer.
It is widely discussed whether young children (aged two to five) should be confronted with television advertisement.
A reason why many people are against it is that children are often more easily influenced by their surroundings than children of an older age, teenager or adults as they are still at a strong developping stage.
As advertisment is often used to manipulate people into wanting certain products or buying them,there is indeed a difference in trying to manipulate adults that know the sake of advertisment and are able to reflect about the things they are facing rather than children that take most things in without questioning them.
Yet, there are people older than the age of five years old that are still as easy to manipulate.
Eventhough you are not as strongly developping at the ages of 6 and everything above compared to a toddler, you are still developping.
But shall it therfor be forbidden directing advertisment towards young children?
As we are living at the age of social media nowadays.
Children are often introduced to the 'world of social media' at an early stage.
So it is not possible for them to not be confronted with adverstisment at all, whether it is directed towards them or not.
What toddlers see is what they most likely want to have.
Whether it is the phone their mother is holding in her hand or whatever they see on television.
Also earlier or later they will be the ones who the advertisment is directed at, at some point (as they will reach they will eventually reach the ages of 6 and older )
Whenever that may be they should be prepared and used to the advertisment.
When advertisment is part of your daily life, you start to not listen to it that exactly anymore.
It becomes something like a backgound noise rather than something that takes up all of your attention, as it is new to you, made extra interesting just to influence you.
That is why I am for advertisment dirceted toward young children.
Telivision advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because they are to young to be victims of the industrie and their aims.
For the industrie it would be great to give the children pictures of things they would like to have and suggest them wishes because the children will tell these wishes their parents and forced them to buy the wished produkt.That means industrielle profit.
But the parents are the ones, who have to buy unnecesary and expensive things to make their children happy.
They have to spent more and more money to fullfill their children´ wishes.
And not every family has enough money to mess with these capitalism standarts.
In my opinion children should not be manipulated and influenced like this.
They are just watching television and have never heard before from these produkts, however now they want to have them.
The children are not as lucky as they were before they started watching television.
Now they are unconfortable because of the influence by the wish after this sertain produkt and are not able to play and live as freely as before they knew about this product.
In addition the children start to compare each other and want to have the same things the others have.
This leads to social unequality and conflicts between the children and their parents, because they do not buy the things for the children whish they want to have and also to conflikts between the childen because they are jealus of o
There have ever been a big discussion about television advertising.
What should be allowed, what shouldn't?
Especially advertising directed toward children is a big topic, because there are many proponents, but at least as many opponents.
In the following points I will name and compare some of their points.
First of all, we all know how children are easy to influence.
So a great point for the advertising is, that it is really effective, and if a five year old boy sees a toy he likes, he will try to convince his mother to buy it until she does.
But anyway, it is really manipulative to just show the children this things and make them to want the toys, and the advertising tries to own the mind of the child, to meka it think of the new toy or whatever the whole time, so it is morally pretty incorrect to show this advertisement to children, because they are not as used to advertising and to think not only of the things mentioned in the advertisement, but also of the things behind it.
An other point, which goes in the same direction, is, that children are more guided by incentives than adults are, so if they always see the advertisement of one particular thing, they will decide in the store automatically for this thing, or ask their parents to buy this thing, because the only thing they know is, that they have already seen this somewhere so it is probably a good one.
This is a strong point, but opponents say, that tese two to five year old children don't even understand and get what the advertisement is about, so it is kind of useless to make advertisement especially for this children.
Additionally, it is, in the sight of many people, unnecessary and unuseful to make advertisement for children, because in the end the parent have to buy the things.
So it would be much better to make advertisement which is directed toward the parents, explaining them how the children are able to profit of these things, and if they are able to cpvince the parents, they will buy it and the company makes much more money than if they convinced the children, because yes, maybe they want the things afterwards, but this doesnot serve anybody because they can not get it and the company can make no profit, and if they direct it directly to the children, maybe the parents are even more shocked that they do something like this and they are not going to buy it out of this reason.
On the other hand, it doesn't hurt somebody if they make advertisement for the young children, and the idea of companies is maybe, to try it once and to watch if it helps to optimize their profit, and if not they can make a different next advertising line, and if it works they can go on like this, so it can be seen as an experiment.
All in all, there are many pros and contras, but in my opinion the contras are much better points, because the manipulating of young children is a dangerous topic, and even if it does not hurt anyone, it should not get more and more and at a point in the future our children are just brain-washed babies which follow all the advertisements, and I guess it is even more profitable to direct it to the parents, because the big influence they have on the children is not useful if it is not the same influece on the parents, because children alone provide no profit.
Young children can be manipulated quite easy.
They still have to learn very much of their environment and mostly the take older people as their (Vorbild).
If they grow up with a television and it's advertisements the toddlers either whatch it with full attention or they aren't really interested and don't take it too serious.
But if they love what they see, television advertising can make them to want the shown product or to be like the children/persons who show up in the ads.
First, I am sure very few people like television advertising because it divides the mostly valuable, real TV content.
On the other side, advertising is essential for many companies to earn money and even to survive, tough a large part of their revenues is advertising.
So how to decide whether to decide an advert is directed toward young children or toward their parents or even other people?
I think this would be extremely difficult, and if such a law exists, there may even appear some court cases where parents do not agree with former decicions.
On the other side, TV adverts are quite manipulative, expacially if directed toward young children: Such advertisers want children to annoy their parents until they finally buy the advertiser's product.
Additionally, adverts shown to young children will burn into their memories, I think.
In other words, these children will be secretly, unknownly influenced and manipulated during their whole life.
But to really prove these statements, it is necessary to look up some studies already existing in this area.
So how about other advertising young children are inevitably seing whenever they watch television?
In fact, children will also be influenced by these.
This thesis leads toward denying every single advert which is economically simply unpossible.
To sum up, there are definitely real problems, but its a very difficult and dangerous question where to draw the line.
I agree with this statement.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because of the danger such advertisment can do in relation to a young childrens` brain.
When children watch television in a young age it will kill more brain cells than in an older age.
Also the children want to watch more television.
They are getting confronted with advertisments for kids, so they want to have them.
Very annoying for parents when the child asks the whole time if he can have that toy maybe.
So the parents buy the toy for the kid.
Only to stop this annoying questioning.
This is buisness.
The firms are playinmg against the will of the people and because of that they are making more money.
They are not interested in the health or the wishes of the people who can decide.
Children can not decide.
They see something they want to have and can not decide if it is good for them or not.
The television is something everyone got today.
It was getting important during the last years.
Because of that, many firms are doing advertisments in the Telivision.Many children are watching Tv nowadays and so they exploit it.
Only to make profit.
Advertisements in television or in the internet are oftener directed toward young children today.
The question is, should those advertisements be allowed or not and that is the topic i am going to discuss in this essay.
Well, one argument for this kind of advertising is, that people at every age are advertised so why not the younger ones either.
Youths are advertised just as elders, so what is the problem with advertisement for even younger ones?
In the age from two to five you are very predictable and easy to influence with certain tricks and the advertising in television uses those tricks to kind of controll the young people who are watching it.
When a child sees an advertisment like this, the desire of getting the product is imense, for example for a toy.
When kids in this age want something like this it can get very complicated because it is easy to disappoint them.
So my personal opinion on this controversial topic is that those kind of advertisements should be more or less forbidden.
The most simple reason for this is that children in this age are so easy to influence and this can cause serious problems.
A lot of parents all over the world are worried about the influences with which their children are confronted in advertising on television and the radio.
Every where you go, you will be faced with advertising and so you cannot make it unseen for you children.
Futhermore it is important that the children learn to handel with advertising and maybe they get some information through it like the advertising for a history book or the next history film in cinema.
In addition to that children have also to learn, that they cannot get everthing what they have seen on television and for example in the supermarket.
How often a child runs to his mom and show here a chocolate or chips and ssy to here, that it has seen it on the advertising and it should smell so good and it want to try it.
In addition to that a lot of parents by these things for theire children and that is the problem.
with this bourggt they help the firms which make these advertising for their products to do more.
On the other side you can understand the parents when they say advertising which is not directed towards children of the age from two to five years is not good or unbelievable, but the advertising which is for these young people should be okay, because we are everywhere confronted with advertising our whole life long.
AQdvertising which is not directed to this young people is not okay, while they should become a bad influence or do bad things, but it must be not 
so in all ways of advertising.
A bad advertising could also show a childre, that it will not do it anytime because it is so bad or has got such worse consequences for the person who do it or for all the other people which were involved.
In fact I do not agree with the fear of the parents because I think it is more a help for the children, when they are confronted with the good and bad sights of advertising in young age.No one could help them later to decide if they need this or have to seen this (film) or not, if they do not learn it from youth on.
First of all, I aree with the statement.
There are multiple reasons for that and few against it.
The main issue is, that children in the age of two to five have a different mind set up and not all behave the same way.
This leads to different perspectives which leads to more factors that have to be included.
But if we ignore that and just focus on one certain type of child, the most common one, which is naive and inexperienced, we come to the conclusion that they are easily manipulated which follows by a child begging his parents to buy the advertised object.
One the one hand, if the parents say no which is more likely than just saying yes the child is perhaps going to cry and stress them.
On the other hand if they agree and buy the advertised object, let's say a toy, the child will be satisfied but for an unknown amount of time.
Children tend to have interests in many things and change often their focus on new things.
All in all, the child will be satisfied for a short time until it sees a new advertising which repeats the whole process over to an endless circle of unpleasure for the parents.

Which person hadn't seen ever television?
Television is a part of our daily life, we watch it to relax, for entertaining reasons, to informate us, what happen around the globe.
Most of the humans can't imagine a life wihtout a television.
But what is about the younger part in our socierty?
Should they watch advertising television shows?
Is it good, that there exist shows for such young childrens, or is it a danger for themselves?
It is proved, that television isn't good for the childrens' intelligence.
If they are watching television to often, they are getting dumber.
The best example for this statement are the Teletubbies.
A lot of professors and psychoanalytics worked a long time, to bring out a programme, which would help the children to learn.
There have been some parents, who believed in this programme and let their children watch it.
Some children, who watched it too often have now big speech problems, because they don't use the normal language in the Teletubbie-show.
On the other hand yound children need always something new and interesting.
At television exist a large amount of shows, which are the best entertainer.
Young children love watching television, so why won't we let them?
There are series, like Bee Maya, Peterson and Findus or Wickie.
To look at this series is like to read a little story, so if the children like to hear a good and entertaining story, they just can turn the television on.
Nevertheless, television contains the danger of getting addicted to it.
If we take a look at our society, we can clearly see, that there are some people, which can't live wihtout a television or a mobile phone.
Young childrens are getting used to television, they stop playing with Lego and they stop going out.
It is also possible that they are getting angry, if they can't watch television anymore.
It is the obligation of their parents, that they take care of their children and play with them.
If a child has a choice between playing football with it's dad or watching television, it would always choose playing football.
So it lays in the parents' hands, that their children don't watch to often television and get addicted to it.
Television shows are the best programme, that a poor family could have.
If the parents are woking all day long, and they can't buy their children some toys, the children can watch television to entertain themselves.
If the parents are at home they an watSo there is a possibility to pass by time as a family, with watching television, the family would be happy.
In my personal opinion, I think that televison is a bad thing for young children.
If I was around this age, I always went out to play, make sports, if i stayed in the house i played with my Legos.
The children which don't do such things in their childhood, don't know how to have a conversation and they loose the connection to reality.
It is truly sad, that people at my age keep staring at their phones, instead of speaking with each other or having a good time.
Everything must be photographed, everything must be posted, it is a tragedy.
You are may questioning yourself, why I am talking about phones.
Television an phones are somehow the same, both of them are entertaining humans, and you can have an addiction to both of them.
So the dangers of television are the  same, as the dangers of the mobile phones.
So it is nessesery, that espacially young children don't watch television to often.
Televisions are an amazing thing for young children.
They entertain them with colourful, creative pictures and adventurous stories, no matter when, no matter how.
A child could spend all day long in front of the TV, staring on the screen.
Even when a advertising break interrupts the serie or the movie the children won't take their eyes away from this big black box.
So, is television advertising just a genius idea from the capitalistic industries and can it hardly influence the children's grow up?
Should advertising not be allowed on the kid's channels?
In my opinion advertising shouldn't be hidden for young children's eyes - it should be forbidden in general.
Advertising is like creating illusions of things you have to have for beeing succesfull or cool or whatever.
And it works.
Especially with young children.
They see something fabulous on TV and the months after they won't stop stressing their parents until they get it.
And they will get it.
If you are a father or a mother and you're against TV advertising directed toward young children you just shouldn't allow them to look TV.
Seriously, is it better for your kid to stare hours and hours on the screen watching stupid series than watching advertising spots?
Make them go outside, discover the world and feel free.
Children don't realy need TV's, neither they need advertising.
If you get them anything they need - and I speak of love, freedom and peace - they will never be catched of this illusions created by capitalism.
There's just one way to fight advertising directed toward young children: fight capitalism.
I often encounter advertisements for children while watching television at home.
Boring, short scenes which often are simple and rather stupid, to be honest.
Just yesterday I saw one during the break, while watching a football game.
The advertisement was for some ego-shooter and it didn't seem appealing whatsoever.
And so I started questioning advertisements made for young viewers; does it really make sense to show them?
For one, the ussage of digital devices is getting more and more frequent and the age of their users is dropping drastically.
My neighbours son has his own i-Pad eventhough he's only fourteen years old.
He doesn't use it to learn or to do research, he rather goes online and surfs the web, watches all sorts of videos, plays games.
And every now and then a short video pops up, advertising, what often seem to be war games.
Now the fact that those videos appear, is something I can deal with.
I mean advertisements are all over the place, we see them when we go shopping, while watching the news, even in papers you find them on each page.
But presenting children with a subject of violence, a major cause of the worlds disasters, namely war, that's simply wrong.
If people want to launch ads for healthy food or for doing sports, with the aim of fetching children from their screen and outside to play, I'd totally support that.
But if you try to sell some product linked to violence to children so young, they don't even understand what's at stake, you should seriously question what you're doing.
And as I've said before, children don't have the rational thinking of grown-ups yet.
They don't always think of all of the consequences there are, wich is perfectly fine!
But you shouldn't attempt getting them to do something they don't know the risks of.
If you make a child download  a game, fine.
If it, by playing it, learns something, perfect.
But if the child then suddendly clicks on a button within the game and pays real money, the parents money, without really realizing it, I don't think that's the right way of doing it.
So in the end I think advertisements meant for children are prefectly fine, as long as their content and the product they're trying to give to those children is sensible and children-friendly.
Television advertising should not be directed to young children(age2-5).
Their brain is not able to comprehend what kind of information they are given.
They have not learned how to make reasonable decisions yet or tell the difference of necessary and not necessary.
A child see's the world in a complete different way than an adult.
Not only do they not realise that what they are watching is meant specifically to make them want it, but also do they not realise how much the wished for object would cost.
This brings me to another crucial point.
Children at that age do not have their own income.
By gods sake, they probably do not even quite understand the value of a money.
Give a kid a hundred bucks and the worst case scenario would be him or she ripping it apart.
They should stop using diapers before being abused by adults advertising stuff, wanting nothing less, but the kids parents to buy the mercendise.
Advertising toward people of such a young age can cause them to have future problems with investing their (not endless source of) money, due to the parents not paying for it anymore.
They are practically forced to take place in the industry and its demand of consuming.
Television has really invadad our society.
In americn homes for example people wake up while, eat or go to bed while watching tv.The tv is always on.
Not only it is"manipulating" us, the society with all their food commercials and every little thing that is out there but they lso don't give us a choice not to have to live with it.
It's every parents own responsibility what they let their kids watch and do when they are home and still minor.
They can watch their movies, their tv shows and listen to the music channels  they want to.
But all these things have one thing in common.
The kids decided they wanted to watch the movies, shows or music channels.But the commercials aren't the kids choice anymore.they are being put there directly so the kid gets attacked directly and is pretty much forced to watch them if it intents to finish whatever he is watching at the moment. 
. 
Manufactrues use the break time between movies, shows and talkshows to advertise their products.
Adults, for example, they might like on thing in the beginning but then think about it more carefully and waht the consequenses might be.
But kids they, if they see a thing they like they want it.
Some kids are easier than others and might get distracted by other things in a blink of a second.
But others might have attention issues or other problems and get obsessed with that one thing they see.
Their minds can't get off that thought that they want to have this toy for example.
In the end it all depends on the parents, but oftentimes if the kid gets really annoying with that one thing he wants they give it to him so he stops complaining and whining.
This leads to a circle.
The kids figure out a way of getting what they want, and the parents just keep going with it, because these days everyone has got less time and wants to have a good time without being annoyed.
So in the end if a kid always screams around and annoys them, they sure want to make it stop.
It's also a good way for the company to make a huge amount of money.
They only have to put a big effort into their advertising section but otherise they don't have to do anything anymore.
The tv does everything for them.
All they get out of it is kids wanting to have their things and parents wanting to buy these products to satisfy their screaming and unhappy children.
That's the new way of getting costumors.
I don't think it is a good thing to do.
Because now in our society everything runs through television and advertising.
That's all we do.
obsess about something and buy it.
we've got to be an isolated population.
and for that i think it's unfair to not only fasten up this whole unnatural prpcess but also to drag the unknowing kids into it.
first of all i think they have better things to do then wath tv all day and get spoiled but also they are so innocent that everyone is just profiting from them.
An argument for this subject is that kids who have two to five years don't know what is useful or good for them, because many games are just useless and don't bring much joy as ist is shown in the television.
An other argument against the advertisment for little children is that they influence them too strong, for an exemple a poor family with a little kid who is watching tv sees an advertising about a toy for children.
The child starts asking his parents if they could get them the toy, but it's too expensive so the parents have to say no.
The child notice that it will never get this toy.
What I want to say is that because of the advertisement poor people can feel sometimes bad because they havn't enough money to make their childs dream come true.
The cons are that the producers of children games should have the right to advertise their products in the television.
The don't create a harmful advertisement for children, they jus try to sell their products.
An other argument for the advertisment for children aged two to five years is that for example me when I was a little child I liked to see advertisements for children games, because I wanted to be informed what was new on the market or  what I could wish for christmas.
An other argument for this topic is that the advertisment of children games make the parents life easier, because the child know what it wants when they go to a shopping center.
Without the advertisment children would cry in the super market, because they couldn't decide which game their parents should buy and that would end in a discussion.
In my opinion children aged two to five are too young to know what's good or usefull for them and because of the advertising in the television they are wrong influenced.
The adverisement lie often, so it's better that you go with your children to the supermarket and look by your own what could make them laugh or what isn't harmful.
Because of this I think that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Nowadays a lot of children in our society grow up with electronic.
Especially young Children aged two to five, which haven't yet been at school spend a lot of time watching TV.
But can we agree with this phenomen?
Today there are a lot of televison shows in which children can learn for example how to act in our society.
Their are some shows in other languages, in those the children can learn how to count, to spell or to write.
Also for parents it is sometimes really practical, when the parents are busy the kids chan watch TV.
The children grew up with the new technicals and electroncis in our world.
When the parents don't have a lot of time, little children are sometimes watching to much TV.
They spent the whole day inside and can't play outside with other children in the same age.
This influences their social compartment and has an impact on their behaviour.
Sometimes I see little children in the bus witch are watching televison during the whole busdrive and they don't even recognize their enviroment.
In my opinion Televison has positive and negative influences on young children.
I think it is really effective to learn for example languages.
But if they are only sitting in front of the TV and don't play outside or with other children their are negative impacts.
It is common knowledge that Televion advertising or adverts in general do have an influence on our subconcious for we then tend to make different desicions without us actively noticing.
So should this be not allowed for children aged two to five?
Given the fact of what I've mentioned on top I think people who aren't concious about that fact shouldn't watch to much advertisement, therefore most of the children but I think you should raise the "restriction age" at least up to eight or ten for children below the age of five hardly watch any TV with adverts (if the parents are responsible).
Another point is that "adverts influenced children" (if that's the case) almost never make any desicion on their own, I mean a 5 year old won't go to the supermarket to buy that cool toy he saw on tv, wich is something that the parents should prevent in my opinion.
I could imagine the opposite to be the case more often.
People who really could do such things (with more serious stuff like expensive shit or their food) should be warned.
So I'd rather suppose you prevent such people from being subconciously influenced, by maybe having a warning sign show up whenever adverts are shown that says somthing like: "Warning adverts can subconciously influence your later desicions" or something like that.
I'd find that more helpful, than banning "children stuff" adverts.
Today many companies advertise their products not only on the streets but also on television.
This is a good idea because the companies can reach a great amount of audience with this method but should these advertisements be allowed for young children of the age of two to five?
On one hand the children are to young to understand that they can not have everything that is displayed on advertisements on tv.
If they see toy in an advertisement, they automaticaly want to have it.
This puts great pressure on their parents because they do not want to dissappoint their children.
In conclusion the young audience is used as a huge marketing strategy.
The companies put their advertisements for child toys only on the tv channels that are watched by children and not on the channels watched by the parents, even though they are the one who have to buy the toys.
The companies aim on purpose for the innocence and naivity of the children.
On the other hand there are alot children who do not put their parents under pressure and gentely ask them wether they can have the toy in the advertisement or not.
The major part of the childrens behaviour depends on parenting and on the caracter of  the child.
It is the bad parenting for he kids that shoult be blamed and not the advertisements on tv.
In addition, many children do not even watch the advertisement because they are annoyed by them.
The advertisement interrupt their favourite series and are considered annoying and unuseful by the children.
In my opinion the advertisement should not be banned but somehow reduced.
Also the parenting should be adapted to the digital generations.
This means that the parents should be able to say no whe a child asks them the hole time about new and expensive toys and should not spoil their children.
This way the children will get less effected by the advertisements and the parents do not spend to much money.
Chewinggums, sweets, toys and many more products that trigger young childrens wishes are broadcasted everyday on hundreds of different TV-chanels.
But is it moraly correct to try influencing these young children at that age already?
Young children receive information different and their conciousness is not yet so far developed to resist sublimental influences.
They start to think they need these good instead of just wanting them.
Many adults even are easily influenced and manipulated by media and the effect on children is significantly bigger.
This influence leads to a diminishing of choices the child can do on its own since the preset ideas are already made up by television and can only be changed hardly.
Another important point are the parents of a certain spout.
As the influence becomes bigger over time of consumation of these media, parents should actively control the amount of time children are allowed to spend with television and media.
If this generally were the case, as it clearly isn't in many of todays households, advertising would have a smaller impact on these children and thus could be tolerated more.
As a conclusion I'd say it is not toleratable to direct adversiting toward young children and should either be prohibited by law or be reduced by the companies broadcasting them.
Media can be usefull in some cases like news and documentals, but in this case it just isn't changing anything for the good, as they teach the children to obtain a materialist mindset which is already too widespread in todays society.
The question here is should it be allowed that televison advertising be directed toward to young children aged two to five.
It is something that concern a lot of people almost parents who are interested how they children should get adults.
The first advantage is when de advertisement would be allowed to young children that mostly the shops or the people behind the advertisement who are trying to sell something could better do this than.
Young children are simple to manipulate because if they see something in the televison the want to have it.
So the parents have to buy it because they want to see their children happy.
The second advantage could be if young children can choose if they want to watch an advertisement or not they could influence that.
On the other hand this idea have also his disadvantages.
For example children aged two to five are kids and they do not really think about what they do or watch on the television.
They just want to play and have fun and do not think that they become manipulated of any advertisement.
An other disadvantage is when young children watch to much television they can end up being alone all the time and do not have any friends or other hobbies.
They forget that it exist an other world outside and they might become unreliable at school.
But who say that children aged two to five even should watch televison and then advertising directed toward them?
I think young children should live their life as a child and play a lot with their friends, being outside.
If they want to rest for a time alone they could read a book or something like that but they should not spend too much time watching televison and get manipulated of different advertisement.
For conclusing I would say that children aged two to five are too young for television or for example using to often applications on the smartphone.
They should not be confrontated as young kids because they do not know always what they really want or need and what they just want to have.
In this text im going to write about a difficult topic named "Advertising", it includes the discussion, whether direct advertising should be allowed for children (aged to to five) or not.
In my opinion it should be allowed, because the advertising wont harm the children.
But in a fact the children could use that time more effectively to learn or play with other childs to make experiences.
In another point it should't be allowed, because the advertisment will make the children addicted to it.
The time, in which they have to deal with that advertisments, is not that long, if the parents are controlling their children.
In another point it is a very good method for firms to earn money, because the children will make the parents buy stuff.
In my opinion the parents have to watch at their children, to keep them safe for too much advertisments.
In a fact the places, where advertisments are going to be shown have to be seperated.
It would be too much for very young children to only see advertisments all the time.
There should only be places like on Tv or on screens in the city.
Otherwise the children are going to be addicted to advertisments and the stuff, which is advertised in the spots.
In my opinion advertisments at children (aged two to five) should be allowed, but it should be seperated and limited.
Also the firms have to check, what they're going to advertise in their spots.
And in my opinion the parents have to watch their children more carefully and protect them.
Television advertising is a topic whitch became very important for today.
Often the advertises are shown between movies on all channels.
That also includes the television channels for children.
But is that ok?
Should the children aged two to five see advertising, for example for expensive toys?
One important argument for advertising directed toward young children is that the advertises would be "fitted" for the children.
That means that advertise which are shown on tv channels for adults wouldn't be shown on the kids channels.
So the children would only see things that are interesting for them.
That could be advertises for other TV-shows or interesting and new toys.
An argument against these topic is that advertises for example for toys, these toys are always shown better than they really are.
Children up to five are not "smart" enough to get these advertising tricks.
They always belive what they see or hear.
With this intention, the advertising companys use the kids to sell their the product they advertise for.
In my opinion Television advertising should be forbidden on TV-channels made for children up to seven or eight years.
After this age most of the children are intelligent enough to get the clue behind the advertise: the companys want to sell their products and often show them perfect so that every child should have on of these.
So I agree with the topic that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Essay
 
The topic of this essay will be Should children from the age of two to five have direct contact to the television?
to advertise childs with television or should that be forbidden?
The television is some you find in every house, every appartment or even in a camping trailer.
Noone want to miss something exciting happen in another part of the world.
But televion is not only for informing everybody about the newest topics.
It also should entertain and teach you in several things.
But they aren´t only adults watching the TV(television) there are also childs  wathing even the ones who are two years old.
And many critice want to change that they think that the children will get silly when they are whatching TV at that young age and that they should play in the garden to grow up like they did.
But do really get more silly when you are wthing TV?
no because their is no proof for such an Argument and so the argument of the critics have no right to claim this argument.
Even more some of the child TV-shows try to bring the kids some Knowledge and they aren´t just entertaint they learn something.
But they are still arguing that they aren´t playing in the garden any longerand that parents don´t do their job proberly and that they don´t want any hard problems during raising up the childs.
so they just let them sit in frotn of the TV and do theire job with homeoffice.
That is not ok Children like wahtching the TV and this is okay.
But the parents need to showup some borders and let their kids know that their is time for TV and time for somthing else like sport or reading a book.
These two things are also important for kids and their need to be a mixture between all things a child need to grow up.
Just like it ever has been the only thing that changed is that with the TV there is a new option to get childs something to know.
But it shouldn´t be over used because that could leed to adiction and children can not use their time for sport or somthing like that.
All in all you can say TV as a tool for Children to learn someting and for their advertaisement is okay except it is not over used.
And so it should not be forbidden.
Should television not be allowed toward young children at the age from two to five?
There are a lot series for young girls and boys at the television.
There are different kinds of television shows for childrens in this age.
So that there are shows, that amuse the boys and girls and then there are shows that teach them something like the show "Dori" on Nickelodion.
At the one hand the television is good to amuse the children and the television keep them a while still and silence.
Its a good way to keep them silence if the parents of them haven't got time for a while or if they have to do something, that the Children are not interest in.
The shows, that teach the children are funny too, so that the girls and boys like to watch them.
This kind of show is good for the kids to teach them some points before thre school starts.
The television might be something like a ritual in the lifetime of a children, a lot of children in Germany watch "Sandmännchen" and then go to sleep.
Often the whole familie watch this kind of series so that the children have a good time with his or her familie.
This shows and series are forever in the heads of the children and may they will watch it with teir children and so on.
The TV is a important thing for them.
At the other hand there are a lot series that are just for fun and the children just watch them, because they have nothing else to do.
The children just watch this series and don't go outside.
This is not good, young children need a lot of sport, to grow up good and healthy.
Another point is that the language in series for children ist often grammatically not right, so that the young girls and boys learn it wrong, a good example for this is the serie "Teletappi".
So all in all Television in the young age isn't that bad, the parents of the children just have to look, that the kids don other things, like meeting friends and play outside.
It is also good to look what kind of shows the children watch and that the kids not got addictet to them.
If the television is used just at some times and not the whole day it is a good thing.
In my opinion some of the series for young children should be forbitten, because they are a kind of weird and not helpfull for the growing up from young children.
But the television should not completly be forbitten for them.
Today the television advertising is directed to all people, no matter how old they are.
Those advertisings have a big influence on what we buy or what we wish to have.
I remember as I was a child I used love the things which were presented in the television because they seemed extremely magical.
But when you finally got them, they're less special.
One downside of television avertising toward joung children is that, as soon as they see all those cool toys, they start to want more and more, which their parents maybe can't afford and nor the children neither the adults are happy with heir situation.
Another contra is that the toys always look more special in the television advertising than they are in real.
I remember to be very sad when I realised that it's not the same as it is in the television.
For example as I wished for a farm from playmobile, the animals weren't that realistic as they were in the advertising and when you're a child you expect exactly the same because you don't have this knowledge which is essential.
A big disatvantage is that there are also advertisings for weapons which are called NERF and even though it's only a toy it can cause harm.
For sure there are also some advantages like the promotion of the firms.
Their products are better sold and their income is highly raised.
Anyway the whole awareness to the firms which present their things in the television is raised.
The second positive point about television advertising directed toward young children is that they know better what to wish for and it's easier for their family to find a good present for their birthday or for christmas.
To come to a conclusion, I think that television advertising shouldn't be prohibited because the fims have to promote their products to make money but it should be presented more realistic.
The major issue that this type of advertising comes up with does mostly relie on the parents and not directly on the children.
Sure the children watch these ad´s but the parents still buy the products.
The adults should be aware of what their kids actually need.
The parents may have some problems with their child if it really wants this product, toy or whatever.
But the parents are the ones with the power of the decision they make.
A positiv fact that might appear through the advertising on television could be that the adults get information about new products for their children which could actually support or help them.
They might get to know about aout the reason because of which their baby is crying.
There once was an commercial which dealed with a special kind of illnes about which most people don't know about.
Another point which should be mentioned referring to this statement is the fact that many children with this age don't even watch TV.
These advertisement can not actially reach that many viewers.
And if it should be the case that kids watch these commercials they propably won't be able to understand the content.
They can't hanlde these information.
In conclusion I don't think that this type of co0mmercials should not be allowed due to the fact that they won't have a major impact and if there should appear some problems referring to whishes the kids have, their parents should hanlde these little "problems".
In addition to that I personally think I'm not able to argue and judge about that statement  because I'm not really influencend and I don't watch TV that often.
Many parents who are out of their nervs or are just busy let their young children sitting in front of the television.
They are watching series for children and they can learn from the characters which are shown there.
With series for kids they can early learn how to count numbers or they learn to write a word.
But out of this is television really good for them?
Maybe they find out how to change the programm and then they are watching a movie or a serie which are not allowed for their age.
Also they can be influence by different spots on the television.
Maybe there is a spot for a new candy or something like that so the children want to have it.
They want the candy so much that they are get on the nervs of their parents.
They buy them the candy because they does not hear that anymore and the child is happy.
But then when the child watch another spot maybe for a teddy bear the want to have the bear.
Maybe the parents are buying the bear too but in time they are realize that the child wants more and more.
Not every  child is like in the example but it can happen.
Finally I think that children from the age two to five should not be allowed to watch television.
At this age it is easy to influence their mind because they believe what is saying in the television.
On the other hand I think that when the parents have a reason to let their kids watching television and they are watching over their children so they can not change the program or something like that it is their own decision to let their children watching child series on the television.
Young children are very easy to manipulate, which many advertisers take advantage of.
Colourful commercials with loud music and fun settings are everything you need to get an infant's attention.
But is it fair to take advantage of a small child's impressionable minds?
Nowadays many parents will sit their children in front of a tv in order to get a break.
The young ones sit quietly, easily entertained, while seconds ago they were having a temper tantrum.
It is an easy solution that doesn't require much effort.
Many times as a child I remember wanting the useless toy advertised on tv.
My father would always reply to my wishes with scorn, well knowing that I would lose interest quickly.
Today I know that he was probably right.
Advertising is unacceptable in many cases, for children as well as adults.
Grown ups are just as easily manipulated as children, but we just do not notice, since it is done in a more sublte manner.
I mostly agree with the statement, that television advertisement made for two- to five-year olds should be forbidden, because it is bad for the children.
In the time of digital media, television became a big part of our lives.
Parents quickly get annoyed by their children and let them watch TV for hours.
Companies use this to make advertisements directed to little kids.
In this young age, it is hard for them to spererate between want they need and really want or want someone told them they need.
They can´t make decisions by their own and directed television advertisement use it to sell stuff, for example toys, that the kids will play with once and never again.
They see funny advertisements with other happy kids and screams for their mummy to buy them the same toy.
Most parents also get annoyed by this, so they will buy the advertised product to make their child happy and quiet.
After some time the house gets stuffed full of toys that nobody plays with, because it is not as nice as it seemed to be and the kids didn´t really wanted it.
It is just something that somebody from the commercial told them to buy.
After all, those advertisemets should not be allowed, because it is not okay to use the childish mind of a five-year old to make profit.
This is not humane.
The following essay refers to the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.".
TV advertisement directed to young children is a very controversial topic.
I agree to the statement because exspecially young children are easy to impress.
For example an andvertisement for a new toy could have a very big impact on the kids.
It could be possible that they really want to have the toy advertised in the TV, because it impressed them and if they don´t get it they are very sad.
Also it is possible that the cildren are going to be even more addicted to the TV because they like to see all the new things they could own.
The third argument against TV advertising directed to young children would be the pressure for the parents.
It means that the children are going to ask their parents to buy the things they saw in the advertisement.
Now the parents are under a lot of pressure because they have to decide if they are going to buy the stuff of the advertisement or if they aren´t going to buy it.
Summarizing I can say that TV advertising directed toward young children is a very controversial topic and it´s not easy to decide to allow or to not allow.
But I definitely thing it would be better for young children and also for their parents if it would be forbidden.
Many young children are watching TV every day.
Now some critics have raised that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
An argument for television advertising directed toward young children is that it is not different from an advertisement in a magazine or on a paper.
Children get informed about new things which they can play with and with the advertisement they get an idea of what wishes they have for their birthday or for Christmas.
An argument against television advertising for young children is that the concerns use their fantasy and the influence they have on their parents to sell their toys.
It is much easier to make a child want to buy something than to influence an adult and the concerns know this, too.
Another argument against is that the concerns use unrealistic figures for their advertising their toys, for example dragons or unicorns.
Young children can not know that these figures do not exist because thy are just too young and do not have any life experience.
The television advertising could give them a wrong knowledge about the world because they start to believe in dragons, unicorns, witches and many unrealistic figures more.
All in all you can say that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it influences them too much and makes them believe in things that do not exist.
Young children get fascinated way faster than older people do.
Often they see things they like and than they want them immediately.
They do not consider if they really need something or if they just want to have them because it looked cool in the television.
So if they see an advertising they like they go to their parents to ask if they could go and by it.
As many parents can not restist to fullfill their children's wishes, they have to go and buy the stuff.
Sometimes the children literally have to beg their parents to buy it, even though it is really unnecessary or they do not even need it.
In my opinion you can not say that it should not be allowed because than the parents would have to forbid their children to watch television and we all know that this is never going to happen.
But in fact many companies nowadays try to promote their new products by showing them in the television.
It is a very good thought of them because everybody who owns a television is able to see those advertisings .
And who gets easier fascinated than young children?
Of course there will always be people who say that it should not be allowed because it is not fair for the parents to disappoint their children if they will not buy the things shown in the television.
I do can understand those people but I think you just have to let your children watch television and we have to consider that there are also channels especially for children with way less avertising than on normal channels.
Television advertising directed toward children is a widely discussed theme.
In Germany Telivision advertising is forbidden on the childrens Tv channel.
I would agree to the given statement because it is not good to influence children at the Television, because they can not decide wether they need what they see or just want to have it because the advertisment is colurful and says they should buy it.
In other countries like the US the children are the main customers for big companies an they make many advertisments just for them.
The children are not able to buy the things but there parents can buy it for them espacialy if the child really wants something.
Also it could bring Parents to the desicion that children in young age also need poketmoney.
So if young children get money and spend it on things they don't need, they can not learn how to deal with money and they can not learnd what it mean to earn money, because they would just get it from there parents since they are young.
The only people for whom it would be a good thing are companies because they can earn a lot of money and that could also be good for the enviroment of the countrie.
I can not imagen of any other good reasons for Telivision advertising directed toward children, that is why I would totaly agree to the given statement and I would want other countries to do it like Germany and also make a law what says that telivision advertising directed toward young children is not allowed.
Should television advertisement be allowed towards young children?
Children of our generation are more and more confronted with digital media.
The internet grows more and more, social networks like facebook and instagram are used all around the world and the age of children that get theire first phone or tablet is almost at 10 years old.
But television was always popular.
Parents think it can also help to improve the knowledge of theire kids.
The TV-Programm for kids is not comparable with television for older people, but the risks come from advertisement.
Advertises in todays tv-programm is a normal routine.
Often the advertises make 30% of a film.
We are easy to influence.Strategies that make us buy stuff we see in the TV, are getting better and better.
Internet shopping, the next vacation or a new car?
All things that look so perfect on the screen.
Just to make our live more exciting.
To get out of the daily routine.
To get attention.
But what if it is not us, who are influenced.
What if little children with the age of 2 to 5 watch television and see these big bright adverts of cool stuff.
Maybe toys or super fun land.
The goal is the same, but how good can a 4 years old boy be influenced.
It is much easier.
For example: A 5 year old girl is shopping with her mother at the supermarket.
Those corridors that are full of bright colours get the girls attention.
A new pink barbie for her collection would be nice wouldnt it?
After 5 minutes her mother pulls out the 10 dollars for the cashier.
The little girl is happy and her eyes are shining.
Good for her mother.
But this happens almost every month.
A kid should have a good childhood and needs to grow up in good circumstances.
But those are not given if the television would also influence the little girl.
With TV-Advertising she would not onnly be influenced in the local supermarket.
Allday and everyday.
Kids watch much tv and see theire dreams on the screen.
My opinion is tv advertising for kids should not be allowed.
The kids are at the beginning of theire live.
Companys should not go for little children to make theire income bigger.
It is not acceptable.
Also the situation we have today with all the social networks.
You can barely find 7 years old kids on instagram.
Often theire are presented by theire mothers to make them popular.
So lets get this straight and start with good parenting first.
In the following essay I will discuss the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed".
For that I will give advantages and disadvantages of television advertising directed toward children.
One Advantage of television advertising directed toward children is this: If the children watch something especially prepared for them, they naturally want to have that.
So it leaves to the consequence that the children convince their parents to buy them what they have watched, which is good for the creators.
Another advantage is that the children are getting inspired because of many different television advertising.
Therefore there are also disadvantages of television advertising directed toward children.
They are being manipulated by the ones who prepare that especially for them because of the ilusion they create.
The television advertising let the children think that the things that are shown are great and real because they are so young the cannot seperate that from reality.
So they want to have them and convince their parents, which is good for the ones making the television advertising but not for the children because of the manipulation.
So in conclusion, I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
They are two young to see the difference between television and reality and its easy to manipulate them to get money.
Apart from the point that too much television is not good for children, in my opinion the advertising only includes advantages for the ones making it.
I disagree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children (age 2-5) should not be allowed.
In the followed essay I support my answer with some arguments and specific reasons.
My first argument is that the age of a human do not matter in this case because in every age you were influenced by new technologies and media especially advertisements in the internet.
Every group of age watch TV inclusive the advertisement between two shows.
And is there really a difference?
It's not the case that children in this young age watch more TV than their parents so they did not get a higher influence.
My second argument is that it is not only negative that the kids see advertisements.
They can for example decide what they wanted for their third birthday and so it is in a way much easier for the parents to get presents if the kid has an idea what he wants to get and which things he could like.
In the other case, the parents did not know what the kid would make feel happier.
My third argument is that the young children could want things which are showed in the television advertisements but they can not buy them.
The decision take the parents and if they did not like her child to get the new bobby car they did not get it simply.
In general, the childrens want the newest things which are cool and if all the other kids in the kindergarten have it, automatically they want it too.
It's not an influence by the advertisement in general, it depends on what the kids are interested in and that they do not want to be an outsider or something like that.
My fourth argument is that the kids learn that they can not get everything they want.
If the parents decide not to get her kid the newest sneaker it learns that it can not get everything and it could be helpful for their life.
If they would always get what they want they would maybe become a snob and maybe a little bit to self-confident.
It would not be good for their personality.
Summarized, I would say it's not good to say that the advertisement should not be allowed for only children aged two to five.
In some cases, the advertisements even help the children and if it should be forbidden so it should be for every group of age.
The following essay is about the question, if the television should or shouldn't advertise stuff directed to children between the age two and five.
My opinion is that the statement shouldn't be allowed.
The biggest problem with young children is that they completely miss their childhood while watching TV all day.
With the power of the advertise they want to have whatever they see on the screen.
Young children can't understand the neccessary and the needs of the (for example) games or toys.
They won't stop wanting stuff they don't need, just because they see an advertise about other kids who love to play with the stuff.
Children in this age can get really annoying and most of them won't stop crying until the get what they want.
That leads us to another problem.
With the advertising, focused on young children, they'll stop apprecciate the presents and toys they already have or get.
They'll start wanting more and more and this will damage their character and the raising.
Another reason against television advertising towards young children is watching TV at all.
In the century of the technology most people or children are watching TV, playing computer games or chatting online the whole day.
Especially the younger generations have problems with the consum and year by year more people join the hype.
The damage for younger people is higher and stronger than for older people, that is another problem.
They start to live in their own digital world and stop playing with friends outside, that'll damage their social life and their character.
All in all, television is bad for everyone but younger people are more affected by the risks.
So I think that it shouldn't be allowed to advertise directly towards young children and maybe it's for the best that they shouldn't watch TV at all.
This'll raise their social life and improve the relationship between parents and children.
And, of course, they'll raise up with an healthy handeling for the technology.
Television advertising directed towards young children should be banned

In the the year 2016 television has become a normal thing in most housholds.
The quality and variaty of programms are better than ever, so it is no surprise that many people from all ages spend much time in front of the TV.
It all starts at a very young age.
What do you do if your child doesn't stop weeping?
The corresponding answer of the 21st century: you put it in front of TV.
But this might harm the child in ways the parents might not even be aware of.
The things the child sees on TV might be explicit or the advertising might harm them.
The brain of such young children is not developped yet, so it is especially important that they get good imputs from their surrounding in order to develop.
If the child now comes in contact with an advertising, that might block the learning process of more important things for the child.
Then the question arises: "Why should there be ads dirceted to such young children at all?"
At this age children can hardly make something out of the things they hear on TV, and even if they can, do you really want, that the first word your children says is: "Playmobil"?
This age group makes up only a split of the people who watch TV, adults are rarely interested in the same things as childs from two to five, so if they really want to advertise it there surely are better methods.
On the other hand there surely are worse things which can be advertised on TV and some children might even learn some words or anything from the advertisement, because if those ads are directed directly at them they might pay more attention, while they may not pay any attention at all at alternative imput sources like books.
I personally agree with the statement, because I think that for the most children those advertisings are harmful and I personally hate to watch those ads, because if you aren't it that specifc age group, it is really hard to find those ads interesting at all.
In this essay I will discuss the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed".
Often the television advertising for children are for toys or games.
In my opinion the statement is right because young children especially children between two and five years are too young to understand what the television advertising would like to say.
Also young children can not differ between right or wrong.
An other argument for the statement is that kids are very easy to influence they get easier excited for example for toys than adults and because of this point it is not okay that television advertising for children is alowed because the children exploited from the big concerns.
But there are not also arguments for the statement.
An argument against is that children could learn what they like.
Also advertising for kids are very important for the economy because kids are easier to influence and because of this point parents often buy the toys wich are shown in the television advertising and the concerns earn much money because of the advertising.
You can see the last argument has arguments for and against the statement it is just a question from which side (childrens side or economys side) you look.
But all in all you can say that the statement is right.
An other point is that I think that children between two and five should not look television because they are too young for that and also too young for television advertising.
The television programm is full of advertisements.
Espacally the programms for children.
Now, short time before christmas, there are many new toys, for which, there is much of advertisements.
Becaus of this, there is the big question: Is it good that the advertisement towards young children is allowed, or should it be forbidden?
The point, that the advertisements should be forbidden, is, that many children could think the things they see in the advertisement  are real.
For example, a costume of superman.
The children could think, they can fly with it, like in the advertisement.
Because of this it could happen bad things.
Against this, there is the point, that the parents of the child could manage the advertisements.
They could change the programm, when there are advertisements, or make a deal, that the child is only allowed to watch one episode and must than turn the tv of.
The next point is, that children from two to five are too young to watch much tv.
If the parents allow them to watch many hours a day, it must be clear, that there might be advertising breaks.
Also if there are no advertisements towards so young children, they get confrated with it when they get older.
Because they don´t know that there are many fakes in the advertisements they could think it is real.
so the problem isn´t solved, it´s only later.
In my opinion the statement is complitly wrong.
I think the parents must manage it and explain their children, that the advertisements are not always complitly right.
If there is now advertisement towards this age, the confrontation is later, but not less extreme.
so in fact it isn´t important, when they start to advertise.
In my opinion televesion advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
Because I think it´s the job of the parents to decide how much television advertising is good for their children.
So in my opinion it could be allowed for young children if they don´t look that much at the teleevision and  if they look films or other tv-shows which are acceptable for their age and not with violence or other things which aren´t good for children at this age.But if the parents don´t do that so that their children look a couple of hours at the televsion, then it should not be allowed for them to look that much.
I think it´s difficult to say whether it should be allowed or not.
I think the important thing is that it isn´t too much, but if the children look one or two times in the week at the television from two to five).
So it isn´t possible to say it for all children.The most important fact is that the parents are so responsable that they can decide how much television is good for their children.
The following essay I will discuss the pro and cons about  the statement, if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, in the age of two to five.
Young children in the age of tow to five should not be allowed to advertising directed toward, because the are to young to chosse the right things for theire age.
But on the on the hand the can learn  to handle the technik, witch is very  important in our digital age.
Because most of the things in our world works with technik and because of this you must work  more or less in all  jobs with it,  for example computers.
But when they choose their television programms allone they can make theire own choises, because of this they can learn to do things allown and will not be shy.
The also learn that some choises have bad and other good consequences and how they must deal with bad ones.
An argument against it could be, that the kids  are to young to deal with the bad consequences.
Another argument for it could be
Should televison advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?
This is a question, which is asked for a cupple of years.
Now i will give a few arguments for and against televison advertising.
Every advertising can change our life.
If they say that beef is bad you can agree and you will try to stop eating beef.
In a young age we are really easy to be influenced by advertising or somthing like that.
Especially in toy advertising in tv many childreen will say that they want this toy, because the kids, which are playing with this toy, looks very happy and looks that they have a lot of fun.
This is an strategy of the big toyfirms.
It´s really good for the firms, because they get profit of the young kids, who wants this toy.
On the ofter hand it´s relly bad for the parents, because young childreen allways want everything and if the advertising looks really good with a lot of colours, happy kids and maybe toys which are living in the advertising want that.
This costs a lot of money for the parents and if the parents say: " No, you won´t get this toy. "
the childreen will be very sad.
The advertising have to influence the people, who watch it, so for young people it´s extra coloured in pink, green, red... so the firms will get the attention of the young kids.
But if the advertising is forbidden the firms have to close and stop producing their products.
The most of the firms in the world life from their advertising.
Without this advertising, a lot of people won´t know that maybe Hot´Wheels exists.
I think that the advertising shouldn´t be forbidden, because the most firms lives from the advertising and only with an advertising the firm will get the attention of the kids.
So why should it be not allowed ?
There is no illegal strategy,
"Buy it - you´ll be happy" or "you absolutly need it to survive" are well known slogans which you can hear everyday while watching TV.
Most of us think, that they are resistant to those slogans which wannt to make you think, that you absolutely need this or that new proeudkt, but what about little children?
It is so eays to influence a child from, let´s say two to five years old.
Shoud Television advertising directed toward young people not be allowed anymore?
I think it´s very important to show your child, that it doesnt need too much to survive or better to be lucky.
Its important to explain and show them, that it doesnt always need the latest things from TV.
If you did a good job, and explained this to your, I think the risk to be influenced by this is not that much anymore.
But never the less, is it okay to show advertising, which is directed toward young kids?
I think it shoud be illegal.
At first because little kids can´t buy thereselfs somethink like a 16 years old could.
So if a kid wants this one puppy, the adults have to buy and pay it.
I think it´s not okay to use the wishes of children made by advertising to earn money becuase it is way to easy to convince a child, that it wants this or that.
If you show an advertising to a child in which you use sentences like "it makes you happy" or "you´ve always wanted" or some videos of lucky kids, it influnces the kids and make them to want something.
If you show advertising like this maybe for a smartphone to young man from 20 30 I think less than the half want that.
I explained what to criticice at televidopn directed to young children, but there are also a few good points.
At first the company earns a lot, but this isn´t fine for us.
Well we also always know the latest fashion trend and also the latest thinks to have to be lucky as a child.
But do we need this?
I think at the one hand it´s not usesfull to knwo this, but at the other hand it might be interesting to see, what is new and what my child wanna have, for example for christmas.
At least I think theres a nother question, every family shoud ask: how much television is okay or too much?
I woun´d forbit or allow advertising directed to kids.
I´d go a third way, making a compromise.
In my opinion it should be allowed to show maximal 5 minutes advertising during a programm made for kids.
It shoud be a change of serie and advertising, like half an hour tv and then 5 minutes advertising.
I´d say it should also be forbidden to say certain sentences like "you barely want this".
These are tricks, which a little kid can´t understant, so it want´s this.
But never the less, such a reform will never be allowed by the man who run TV.
The question wether television advertising directed to the group of two to five year old children should be allowed or should be denied splits the opinions of parents and socialogy professors.
An argument against this kind of advertising is the fact that children get influenced by these pictures and start to annoy their parents and to show of their superiority over other children by comparing their toys and games.
With such a young age you aren´t able to reflect wether the toy is good or bad because bright colours and funny music influence your brain to tell your parents to buy that specific toy.
Even if actually playing with the toy isn´t funny at all or might be boring the good advertising shows of the perfect toy that you need to have.
On the other hand you should ask the question why children at the age of two or even five years are watching advertising on television.
Parents should care about their childrens behaviours and should be able to stop them from doing things they don´t want them to do.
If you don´t allow advertising for this group of children you are actually censoring the television by denying concerns to show of their products which is against the freedom of speech.
You also influence the market and are responsible for huge drops of the soled numbers of toys.
In my opinion the state should not influence the market and should allow the television advertising.
As a coparision you would have to ban all movies, shows and advertising from television, that could influence children in a bad way.
Watching advertising for toys is in my opinion a lot better than watching parents to have an argument.
So last but not least the parents should be responsible for everything they don´t want their kids to see.
They should decide if their four year old boy should watch television instead of playing with his friends -and if he watches television- which channels he is watching.
If advertising should be allowed in all kind of TV channels, is a question people keep discussing about.
Some say it does affect our choices, influences us in our thinking and has a negative impact on the watchers.
The influence they get through watching TV on a regular basis is unmanagable, experts think.
On the other side, watchers don`t see the aspects they get influenced by in a negative way.
The "fun" side is bigger for them.
However, a topic which is even more discussed is if it should be allowed to direct television advertising towards young children in the age of two to five.
As always, the opinions are splitted.
In the following, the given topic will be discussed and analyzed.
For many parents, TV is a helpful thing.
Their kids sit in front of it being amused and enjoying themselves while the parents have time for other activities.
In a household with a working mum, for example, this could be really destressing.
Coming from work, still having laundry to do, television is something that holds a helpful side- activity for their kids.
The children themselves mostly enjoy watching TV, relaying to their heroes or simply experiencing other values.
Even advertisements are topics or almost shows, kids like to see.
If it`s the new Barbie, an other toy or a chocolate- cookie; TV holds a variety of things children love.
Or would love to purchase.
that seems like something really positive.
They get to experience a lot of different themes and topics so that they kind of get an idea of life outside their homes.
Even if that just might include life in kindergarden or their friend`s house.
Also the parents profite from their children seeing a lot of "cool things" on TV- getting them birthday presents, for example, is a lot easier.
But not only the fact, kids in the age of two to five are willing to believe everything the spectre of advertising has to offer, also, that they are in a phase where they are easy to influence, is the chance which a lot of companies take.
The youngest are the best clients.
Indirectly, of course.
Parents who already figured that advertising in general does not influence their children in a positive way, try to hold them away from it.
Trying to relay to certain images on TV is nothing that is supporting the development of young kids.
During the time from the age of two to five, they are the easiest to manupulate.
Not having ideas, being uncreative and more agressive are just some of the negative aspects that might occur out of the watching of TV advertisements.
In my opinion, it should be forbidden to influence children by the help of advertising in form of television clips.
It is not supporting or helpful at all, at least not for the development o the children.
Companies do get a lot of profit, but that is not the aspect society should focus on.
Raising kids is an important part of society aswell.
Children are the future of society, so it should be our wish to raise them the best possible.
Relaying to others is not a big part of it.
Nowadays children are used to electronic items like computers, televisions etc.
In this essay I will examine the question if advertisement directed toward young children should be forbitten or not.
So I will give some pro and contra arguments.
In television there are a lot of different channels made for children.
As in every channel there is a lot of advertising, children also get in contact with advertisement.
They usually watch advertisements about toys or computer games and more.
One advantage is that they are able to look what new toys exist and so they know what toys they would maybe like to have.
Furthermore, they learn how tu use the new toy they bought.
Because in adverts they often show how other children play with these objects.
Thirdly, children get new ideas by watching advertisments.
They become more creative because they learn what sort of things they can use to play and so they are able to invent something new in the way they use their toys.
On the other hand, the first thing I would like to mention is that children at this early age (two to five) should not watch TV at all.
Adverts are showed in TV to make people buy the factory's products.
So when children watch that, they already believe the things the adverts are saying.
Moreover, it could also be disturbing for the parents of the children.
The children always ask their parents to buy the new item, which can be exhausting for them because it is also a question of the money the family earns in the salary.
Lastly, the adverts have a big influence on the children.
Because if the children won't get the toy, they may behave badly.
In my opinion we should not let children watch much TV, especially not adverts.
I imagine, it must be horrible for the mother that her child keeps asking for a new toy, which may is too expensive for them.
Television advertising - some enjoy the vivid and sometimes funny breaks during a movie or TV show, some hate it from the bottom of their hearts.
As there are also many children who already are allowed to watch specific series and cartoons, the advertising which is directed toward those children is booming, which also has a big influence on the children.
Is it a good idea to already try to buy little children?
Is it even necessary to get them used to the world full of advertising and desires?
Or should this kind of advertising even be forbidden?
Well, of course it's true that young children are the ones who learn the most in their daily life.
They make experiences and learn, they get to know many new things and learn -  and they get used to our society and learn how to act and react, how to behave, how to deal with certain situations.
Therefore, it's absolutely necessary that they already know how society works and a big part of modern society is economy, more specific: shopping and selling.
Regarding this fact, it's only normal that even very young children already are confronted to advertising and its effects; it's undoubtedly part of our daily lifes.
Moreover, young children can quickly be the outsider when they don't know the latest toy and "trend" regarding dolls or Lego.
This makes clear that advertising can also be helpful to integrate children and let them be part of their own world.
On the other hand, it must definitely be mentioned that advertising can be irritating for children.
Especially little children are usually not used to the colourful advertising with speakers who are too loud and too quick and toys which get bigger and more spectacular every time you watch TV.
Advertising can simply be too much for them and disturb their carefree time watching cartoons etc.
Furthermore, it's also sure that advertising makes children want to have more and more toys because they think they need it to compete with other children.
I know myself that I often wanted to have many things I saw on TV only because they looked sweet or funny, even though I normally didn't play with such things.
Regarding this fact, you can say that advertising makes it normal for children to "want-to-have", which is a developement that causes worries when we think of all the children who haven't even enough food to survive: It makes children lose their connection to reality.
All in all I can say that I know that advertising for children belongs to our society but nevertheless, in my opinion it causes the wrong developement and image of our world which can irritate little children too much, which is why I think that it generally shouldn't be allowed.
Surround ourself we have so many advertising.
In our daily life we are confronted with advertising nearly every single minute.
In the bus in the morning, in the internet during work or even during the break time when we watch a football game on television with our close friends or family.
But is the advertising also positive for the evolution from the little children (aged two to five).
In this short essay I want to give advantages and disadvantages for this topic.
An advantage for the television advertising directed toward childern is, when their is a advertising with toys or attraction (e.g.
funparks).
When there are politic propaganda in child television then it is a problem, because children can not difference the good  from the bad things so they are not able to make their own opinion.
A disadvantage is it when their is non children advertising in a child television programm.
The reason for this point is more in an economic way.
You should not be allowed to make money because of the little children.
They still live in their own world and we should not disturb them their.
Finally I would say it is better that it should not be allowed to show advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five).
It is not fair to give them no choose because they are still to young and maybe to stupid to see the advantages and disadvantages of one advertising.
There are a lot of children in television advertisings although they can't really decide it for themselves.
Their parents are responsible for them and probably also decide if they do it or not.
Of course they probably ask the children but is a child able to make such a decision?
I think everybody knows some decisions of their own childhood they would make differently nowadays.
So maybe some people would even regret it later that they've done such an advertising in childhood.
Most of the children also don't know or are not yet able to understand what it means to be shown in television.
So of course there's the possibility that the parents decide right fo their child and also give them the money they get for the advertising but i think it shouldn't be allowed.
Those young children can't already decide for themselves but television advertising isn't a thing parents can decide for them.
Children of an age of two can't even speak so it's not their own will to make television advertising.
And also children older than two probably just do it because their parents want it.
I think those young children are just not able to make such a decision they even may regret later in their life because they aren't able to understand the meaning of being in the television.
For me these are the main facts for my answer and i agree with the statement.
I could understand if there were parents who'd need the money but even then it would be the child's decision it can't make because it's too young for it.
There are often parents who decide for their children, want them to do things or want them to become famous and i am totally against it.
Today a lot of people watch a lot of television.
Most of them watch series regularely.
And everybody of us knows that feel when somebody is pointing with a gun on somebody else, the intensity increases and then, suddenly an advertising break comes.
Those advertisments are even most of the time absolutely boring and either face 50 year old people or children.
This leads us to the following question: Should television advertising directed to children be allowed or not?
There should be a free market which allows everybody advertising their group of aim with their news about their products.
It would not be fair if you can't advertise directed to young children because the companys who produce things for young children would have an enourmous drawback to other companys who can advertise freely.
There would also be the question where the borderline is and what advertising is directed toward young children or not.
On the other side you can say that children can't think all that rationally as grown-ups can do.
Little children often don't know what they really need and what isn't necessary.
They see a product once in an advertisement and then they really want it if it is fairly affordable.
Kids then often also don't use the things they bought or they only use them for a very short period what makes it sort of a waste of money.
You may now think this wouldn't be all that tragic because children have parents that pay attention that they wot't buy all that much thing they don't need but in fact often kids can controll their parents pretty well and by threaten them yby doing certain things they often get what they want.
Parents often can't say "No" because it's the child, they wan't to make happy and the one they love.
Generally it wouldn't be fair concerning the free market and such a changes impact on it.
But morally one has to say that it's also not all that fair to influence their customers, the parents, trough their children.
Television advertising is important to get your products on the market.
It's the same procedure for everyone, children aged tow to five years included.
But should it be allowed to advertise products for young children on television?
Young people can't understand that advertises aren't real or show things which are not as right as they see it.
A child can't protect itself from television advertising.
It will be influenced by the things said and doesn't understand that it doesn't need the things etc.
Also, a child that age is normally accomanpied by its parents.
But parents aren't able to watch every show with their child or to basically be there every minute.
It is possible that the child will be afraid after what it has seen during the advertises.
Other emotions are possible too, how should the parents know it comes from the advertisements on TV?
Another problem is the inability of a child to draw a line between realitys and fiction.
The advertisements may confuse it some more or promises things which can't be fulfilled for the child.
So in the end, the child may be unhappy or sad because its parents can't fulfill its dreams or aren't able to buy the things.
The main aim of products is the happiness of their buyers.
On the other hand, the market for products for children is really big.
Enterprises have to have the right to promote their products or they will not have the chance to grow.
Enterprises are as important as children for our future and they cannot survive if they aren't able to sell their products beacause of missing advertising.
There is no other possibilty than to do television advertisements because you can be sure that people, especially children will watch it.
Moreover, when it is forbidden to do advertisements on TV for children aged 2 to 5, where should you draw the line?
Not all people can understand the meaning of advertisements and react to it like child.
When you start to not allow advertisements for children, you will end up with forbibben advertisments for adults.
As I already said, companies need to promote their products and that is not possible without TV advertising.
Also, it isn't the companies obligation to protect the children from the bad thing in the world.
It is the exercise for their parents and if they allow their children to watch TV, they know there will be adverts.
Enterprise shouldn't be punished for "missing" parents.
To conclude, it isn't easy to say if television advertisingfor young children should or shouldn't be allowed.
I think, companys need the right to advertise their products to everyone, even children.
They will soon learn that televison is not the reality and that they can't get everything they want.
In the following text I will discuss whether television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should be allowed or not.
Advertising surely influences the person watching it by telling how great the product is and how useful it would be for them.
Often there are wrong information or the advertisement exaggerates.
Especially for children this could be kind of dangerous because they are easier to influence and  believe in things faster than adults.
Children don't think about the pro and contra aspects of a product, they just see it and see how nice it is and then they want to have it.
Mostly it seems to be fun but when they finally have it, it's not half as good as it was shown in the TV.
That is the main negative aspect.
Children are disappointed quickly and because advertising often doesn't tell the truth it's most likely to disappoint children.
That also causes that the kids want to have the next thing because it might be better than the first one.
They have no doubts that the second product could be as bad as the first one and that's what the companies use.
It's highly questionable how enterprises use the behaviour and the development of children.
They know that the children want to have all these things and they know that the advertising wouldn't show the truth.
They act calculating on children who just don't know better.
But you also can say that the parents don't have to buy the things the child sees and due to that there is a little protection for them.
According to the exaggeration and wrong information it is important for children making their own experiences.
They should see for theirselves that the TV does not always tell the truth and that they are not always protected by mom and dad who watch over them and tell them what is good and what isn't.
But at last it is way too early making these experience aged two to five.
However the children should also have the freedom to experiment a little and to test how cool the products really are.
For conclusion I'd say that advertising directed towards young children is okay.
It should be more precise and it should be proved that the information given in the TV are true but all in all it's an experience for the children and they should have the space to test some things they see in the TV.
Advertisment here, advertisment there.
In the television, on the radio or on the street, I think we all know it.
We have to ask us: Is it good or helpful for us or do they just want our money?
We are so influenced by advertisnig, we do not really recognize it.
In the following part I discuss the question whether television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
We all know young children are so fascinated of television, phones and this kind of stuff.
When they are confronted by televison advertising is the danger, that if they watch for example an advertisment for some kind of toys, that the children want that toy and more and more.
And of course the parents can not say "yes" to everything, so they dont understand with their young age why these children in the televison are allowed to have this toy and not they.
Furthermore another argument against television advertisng should be allowed for young children is, that you often see things which is not for the eyes of children with two to five years, for example advertisment for ciggarets, condoms, alcohol or whatever.
They are too young for this stuff and would not understand the world anymore, because this all is new for them.
But in my opinion advertisment is not just bad and that is it.
The things what I have written in the first part can happen, but I think there are so many children which can not taken the content of advertising in their mind, they dont realize what they are watching.
These young kids are just fascinated of the colours which are changing all the time on the monitor.
I would say it depends on the child
Nowadays the world is full of modern techniques, smartphones or computers which make everything easier the people think.
So it´s nothing special when you see a small boy playing on his smartphone the whole day anyway he´s not even in high school.
I don´t think that this is something normal because it´s much to early for using smartphones in such a young age.
So in my opinion Televison advertising directed toward young children shold not be allowed.
Of course the young kids grow up with this modern communication, smartphones and televison like the generation before grew up with something else which was typical in their time.
Another poinjt is that they will get used of all these computers and smartphones anyway only a few years later.
Despite I think that the age of two to five is much too early to watch TV.
It´s really bad for their concentration.
This is something adult people realize twhen they use their smartphone for example.
The time runs and you don´t really realize that while chatting or srcolling through facebook.
The concentration suffers a lot with all the social media.
Especially young children are still developing also in their head and watching several TV series with funny characters isnt´t really helpful in this time.
Of course some stuff in TV they can learn something from won´t be that bad and maybe they understand it a little bit better because of pictures, noises or special characters.
The problem is that children from two to five aren´t even able to read in this age so they start watching TV before they are able to read a book.
I think that children should be able to read before they start watching TV so that the television doesn´t even need to produce a programm for young children from two to five.
There are multiple reasons why television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not.
Some might say it should not be allowed because children are much easier to manipulate than adults and therefore an easier target when it comes to advertising for a product.
A different opinion could be that certain products, that are made for young children, need to be advertised directly towards them, so that they know that it exists in the first place and have a chance to form their own opinions and decide whether they want it or not.
If for example Christmas is coming up and the parents ask their children what they wish for and they do not even know what their options are, it could be hard for them to decide what to wish for.
On the other hand children from age two to five are very young and most of the time they either already know what to wish for, bacause maybe one of their friends owns a toy they like or maybe they saw something in a store.
So most of the time it seems like they do not need advertisment on television to find out about certain things, because there are a lot of other ways to do so.
Another arguement against advertisment for children on television could be, that children of that age should not be watching television very much to begin with, but instead they should be playing outside or with friends.
This would also mean that when there are not a lot of children watching television all the time, the point of advertising on that particular platform would become obsolete.
Most of the time kids will not pay attention when the commercial breaks come on, because they are only waiting for their show to start again.
For those reasons the advertisments on television might not be profitable for the companies making them.
Also, it is not right to start manipulate a kids mind in that way at this very young age.
It is bad enough that adults are manipulated with advertising on television or anywhere else, but the big difference is, that most of the time they can choose or differ from when they are manipulated and when they are not.
Children are not able to see the difference yet and are therefore easier to trick into thinking they need a particular toy for example.
The children then think they really need something, when in reality they do not.
In conclusion I would say that advertising directed towards young children does more harm then it does good and therefore should not be allowed.
The reasons against it overweigh the fact that young children need to be informed about products, because there are other ways to do that, other than commercials.
And most of the time the parents are the ones who really know what is best for their child, not a commercial on television.
Should television advertising directed toward yound children not be allowed?
Many people argue about this question ,if young children should be directed by television advertising,and this is a very important theme ,because children in the age from two to five years are in the state where they get to learn and start getting used to a specifichome.
In my opinion televison advertising diricted toward yound children should not be allowed because in general children in this age should not spend that much time in front of the television.
First , the advertising which probably will be about toys and games which are avaible in toystores , and this could be an effect why children begin to crave on having these things and wanting all the toys.
Also I think that these television advertising which is directed toward the kids has the effect that children start liking to watch more the television because there are things shown in which they are interestred and in my point of view kids should not watch a lot oft time / often TV in this age.
In the other point of view I think that the television advertising is somehting very important for the companies to win costumers and the attention of the people.
If the television advertising is direceted to childrens in the age of two to five , the companies will get exactly the result which is that the kids see the products  they are probably interested in and want to get and buy them.
But in my opinion children in this ages should not be influensed by the companies and the television advertising.
The main reason for  me why this the advertising should  not be direceted toward children is , that children in this ages should not get to many ideas of something to buy and something to get , even if this is the goal of every companie but this does not have a positive effect on the childrens behaviour and also not on their interests because normally children should not me watching TV the whole day , instead of this they should be playing outside.
Espacially in this ages children get really really quickly influensed by something and they are in the part where they start to lern.
To sum this up , television advertising directed toward children should not be allowed.
We see advertisements no matter where we go, only by switiching on the television or walking through the city we are influenced by any kind of advertisements.
Our children are also affected by this and they are also influenced by advertisments, but this is nothing to be afraid of.
Nowadays it is a common thing to let your child watch television or to let it use an iPad even though there are a lot of advertisements in the background.
It is true that children have fun while watching advertisements which are directed to people their age because they usually contain things that makes children want that specific product.
Mostly those products are connected to unhealthy food so on the on hand side it can be dangerous if young children start eating too many unhealthy meals just because they are influenced by advertisements.
On the other hand side parents still have the control over what their children eat and they can easily control this.
Furthermore you can mostly see some speaking animals experiencing adventures while using that special product that should attract a child so it harldy happens that television advertising for children contains violence.
Even though they get influenced by young age and they might force their parents to only buy a specific kind of product because they prefer it after having seen the advertisement many times, the main power still remains with the parents.
In my opinion television advertisting for young children is not something to be afraid of because as long as parents control what children buy and what they eat there is no danger.
For me it is evident that anything can be dangerous to children but that is also the reason why they have parents to look after them and to make sure that they do not spend too many hours a day in front of a television and therefore being influenced by advertisements.
Since we use Television, any things have changed.
People spend a lot of time watching TV instead of doing other activities.
But not only older people spend time watching TV.
Some parents let their children watch TV no matter how old they are, how long they watch it or what they watch.
But is it really a good idea to let children of the age of two years watch horror movies?
The age between two and five years is the age in which children learn a lot of things.
It is important to show them the life in different kind of ways, how they could learn to communicate or to talk or how to behave while being with other people.
It is important to let them ask all the questions they have, to be curious and to make experiences.
On the one hand it can be good for them to watch TV, because they could learn something from the movies, but on the other hand most of the movies don't show the reality, so it is possible that the children learn things which are exactly the opposite than in reality, so they can make great mistakes.
But on TV there are documentaries or news which show the real things that have happened.
For the children it can be interesting to see what happens in the "world outside", so they can be interested in things which they haven't never without the TV.
But there aren't so many films for the youngest watchers.
Many movies are horror movies of which the children can be scared of or maybe get some fears or phobias.
Other movies are too complicated for the young children to understand so that it doesn't make any sense to let them watch them.
While watching TV the kids don't move very much, they are just sitting around.
But it is important especially for young children to make physical experiences, to get to know their own body, to make friends and to use their time.
Spending time just watching TV includes nothing of it so it may have negative aspects for the children.
In my opinion it is important that the children go outside.
Watching TV for kids between two and five years should absolutely not be allowed.
Often parents let their children watch television without observation.
Thus these young kids are on their own and can do whatever they want.
In fact many times they are even too young to decide what to watch or to do.
So they get automatically influid by everything they see, as well the advertising.
I have often seen short clips about 'Kinder Schokolade' or about Apps, which are directed toward young children.
This could result a wish of them toward their parents.
Maybe now this kids always ask about choclate and annoy their parents.
The same situation might happen with a new App, which was presented in an advertising.
Although the parents have not given any electronic advice to their children.
They get to know tablets, cell phones and could become a victim of the media society.
An other reason why it should be forbidden could be the health of the children.
Often their brain can not handle all the pictures, which are shown in television advertising.
In worst case their eyes could be harmed.
Maybe they even get a wrong imagination of the world.
At the age of two to five years they are not able to differate between what is good for them and what is not.
So everything seem exciting and intersting to them.
This is not any good influence.
They are overwhelmed from impressions and irritated.
At many times young children do not get the message of the adveritsing, so it is not usefull.
I totally agree, that it should not be allowed.
Before I take position in this particular case I want to emphasize my liberalism that is based to a certain degree on the theory of freem from John Stuart Mill who said that the only reason that one man or mankind is allowed to intervention in one man's or a group's doing is to protect itself.
Either side whether you agree or disagree do make very good points.
By producing commercial for young children they get used to our theories of economy especially capitalism because children are the consumers of tomorrow, they learn that there are maybe some things they want to have but therefore the have to learn how to deal with labor and with money (those lessons are most times learned during their teenage phases).
But many people will disagree and say that we should not show our children these highly accepted (role) models of our society, espicially leftist will hardly oppose of calling young children consumers (of tomorrow) because the leftifts might think children were naive.
Those people do not want their children to see this role model for society because it is not quiet reality but when you think of the stories the generations before had been listening every eveing in the bed, those stories have not been quiet "realistic" and it might be good this way to give your children the immage of a better world a better future than we live in today and that is why those movies and TV shows for kids show us a different world that wants to encourage children to use their creativity and immagination but these movies have to be worth their production costs so that they have to show commercial.
By forbidding commercial that directs toward young children you enable these young human beings to develop their own position towards the advertised products and you enable these young human beings to speak for themselves.
I personaly think many people are not aware of how reflected and strong these young human beings are.
In this text I am going to give my opinion about the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (agend two to five)  should not be allowed.".
First off we need to clear, that children in the age of 2-5 do not or are not allowed to watch television in many homes.
In the most families the parent allow them to watch channels that do not advertise and that are specially made for children.
That means the switch from one cartoon to another is without advertisments.
The second thing is, that children are not able to be manipulated from advertisment.
If they want toys, they say it not matter where.
In the store or if they watch.
television.
It is usally for children that if the see something they want in the television, they forget it as soon as the advertisement is over.
So parents do not have to fear that they will not stop wanting that.
The third thing is that children in the age of two do not understand the adverts.
Adverts that are synchronised are to difficult for children.
Thats why I think that there is no need to stop advertising for children because first, most of the children do not even see the adverts and second, they do not get effected by them.
In many families young children in the age of two to five are watching TV.
The majority of them are watching advertisment during the movie break.
But are advertisments a quite good influence of these young children?
First of all lot´s of people support the idea that children have to have as much influences as possible.
So children learn  much things and can decide very early about many questions because of their knowledge.
In this case parents have to explain the general using of advertisement to their kids.
But it´s quite clear that children in the age of two to five can´t understand the using of advertisement.
Furthermore young children connect the presented dream world in the advertising with their real life.
On the one hand they aren´t confronted with the really hard real world and so they have the opportunity to live and think about the new created dream world.
On the other hand children can´t decide between the dream and the real world and sometimes their life is damaged.
Thge last point I´d like to mention is that young children wants to have all presented products in the advertisment.
The famalies are confronted with a crying child who really wants to these products.
Companies can easily influence children in this age because of their small knowledge.
In this case companies sell more and more products.
I think it should not be banned from the television.
It should be more controlled not banned.
For example they could make a maximum of minutes advertisements for children can be showen on a channel per day.
Or you could set a time when it can be showen.
A channel manager can that think if it is really worth it.
It is right that this is manipulation and that this kind of adversisements are not good and really unmoral.
A child could fall easier for an adversisement than an adult but it is the wrong way to ban it.
It would destroy a hole work sequment and many ppl would lose their jobs.
It is also the mission of the parents to prove what her child is watching on the television.
If they do not want her child to watch this they could turn off the TV and do another things with the child.
Or they could teach the child how to avoid getting caught by this type of manipulation.
Advertisements for children are also anywhere else.
Banning just from TV would be really inefficiente.
U also have to ban it from every other medium that includes such advertisements like the adbanner on roads.
For example McDonalds advertisements are placed a few meters in each direktion before and after a restaurante from McDonalds to make the children interested and give them enought time to say it to their parentes.
That is in my opinion a harder and more unmoral kind of maipulation because that can´t just be turned off.
In the following text I will discuss the topic whether telivision advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
For it speaks that many children want to have everything they watch in the television advertising and many parents cannot afford every wish they have because for example they do not have enough money to buy the toys.
Furthermore children in this age (two to five) learn at lot just from looking.
They see how their parents behave to different situations and imitating them because they think it is right.
In additon it is the same thing when they are watching television advertisements.
They see the happy family with a beautiful woman as the mother a succesfull man as father and most of the time a boy and a girl.
They think it always have to be like this and wondering why it is not like this in their life.
Now the reasons why this should be allowed.
If I think about this topic, I recognized that there is already television advertising directed towards young children and till now evrey child watched this advertisements and what happend?
The parents have to say more often no to their children like my parents did.
Furthermore we have to think about the companies.
They have to sell their toys etc.
and how it could be better for them when they direct their television advertisements toward young children who wants that toys what they sell.
I think that not allowing the television advertising only helps parents to save money but it does not change the behavour of the children
Television advertising is since its beginning a much discussed theme.
Who does not know those ads where they promise you the world or even more?
Or the new trend, getting younger insteead of older seems to be the most important thing for so many people, especially for those who reach the thirties.
So what my question would be is, should television advertising be allowed in common?
But thats none of my buisness.
The television buisness is not dumb.
They are aware of their strengths.
They know that they are able to give a reason to buy something which is in its whole unuseful.
Especially the aged two to five have no idea about the tricks an advert has in its backpack.
They will just see the good-looking new toy in the Television and the next thing they will do is to annoy its parents.
"You have to buy me this, please Mum and Dad, please."
But what if the adverts get used in a proper way?
In a way that children would learn something?
For example it would be nice if the adverts could visualise some serious themes as criminality.
Children at this age take much more infos out the pictures than by hearing.
Another point I do not understand in the statement is the fact that it only should be disallowed if it is directed toward young children.
I think every kind of advert, which has no pedalogical effect for the children, should be disallowed.
So all in all, all adverts.
We all know that this never will happen.
So instead the parents have to overtake this part.
In my eyes they should not let their children watch television adverts and if they watch those adverts, they should explain them that this is not the reality.
Furthermore the best thing they could is to prevent the children.
Before they start watching TV, the parents should search for a discussion with the children.
The pedalogical effect would be much more than when the parents would explain them afterwards.
In the following essay I am going to answer the question if television advertising directed toward young children shoudn't be allowed.
I only agree with this statement in some aspects.
I dont think that children in the age of two to 3 should watch any TV at all.
In that age they rather play outside or with normal toys.
but on the other hand they would not have known about these toys without the adverts they see in TV everyday.
The main problem is what and how much the ads are advertising.
Often there are ads for girls that show babydolls that the little girls can take care about.
This can be good and bad.
For example it is very positive that the child is able to learn the first things a bout taking care of something or someone, so this would strengthen their feeling for responsibility.
On the other hand could ads like this push these girls in the gender roll of the ''stay at home housewife''.
The same goes for boys.
Another positive point is that many of the toys really support the process of learning basic stuff like numbers, colours or even some letters.
A problem I want to criticize is that there are not only ads for childs on the childchannels in TV, and in these ads they could see content that is not good for them.
I think that adverts for children are not generally bad.
I think the children can learn a lot of things with the toys they see in the ads.
PS.
: This topic sucks!
!
I agree with this statement
I think there are lots of ads in the TV, who direct to young children.
If the children look TV, they get attracted by this advertisement.
Then they would really like to have this product (mostly toys).
The children are easy to convince.
If they see a toy and they think it's cool they want to have it.
When I was a child I used to watch TV sometimes.
I know how that feels, when you see a toy in an advertisement and you really want to get this toy.
Thats just manipulative, kids are easy to manipulate.
I think youny children in this age shouldn't be watching TV to often anyways.
The should rather go outsiede and play with other children, run around and have fun.
Maybe in these years the children don't even recognize, what's going on in the ads.
Perhaps they don't even know what's going on when they watch a film.
I guess the advertisements direct to older children.
As a child you just think: "This toy is awesome, I wan't it".
You don't mind if you have a hundret of toys.Every child would say it's a paradies to own so many toys.
So in fact it's just all about the money.
The ads direct to such young people, that the company who builds the toys earns lots of money.
In the following text I will bring arguments for and against television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five years).
At the end i will say my own opinion on this theme.
The first thing I can say is, that it's important to know what advertisments are meant.
Some ads for cereals or ads for toys (as example).
If its the right ad, maybe the kid will have more fun because it didnt even know that something like that existed and than the parents can buy it and get the child a better life.
The Problem here is that,  when the child see something that it want and theen thee parents dont buy it, it will be unhappy, also if friends have the thing fromt the ad but the parents are not rich enough to buy it and they kid cant have it.
Another points against ads for young children is, that they cant see whats realistic and good and whats bad.
Its very easyto cahnge the opinion or the view of a kid that is so young and companys or partys could use this to change the view of the kid in there use.
A goood point for the ads is that childrencan learn that u cant trust everything you see and need to be critical.
Parents could  teach the kids that not every ad say the truth.
With ads for young children children could be maipulated very easy and thats not good in my opinion.
But thats not a question of allowed or not allowed, the companys wanna make profit and thats not there fault.
THe capitalisim force them to try to make profit.
In my opinion its the foul of the parents to let there childen watch tv.
Without it would be no problem or question of allowed opr not allowed, because the children wouldnt even watch them.
But many parents didnt know what to do with there children and just let them watch tv and get dumb because its easier for them letting the children watch tv instead of doing something together with the children.
In the following text I´ll collect some reasons against the statement, that Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I think that Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because it´s the role of the parents to say what their children should watch and what they shouldn´t watch.
If they don´t want their children to watch advertising in Television they have to safed their children against the advert.
This is not a problem of a brand or the Television programm.
The brands only want to sold out their products and for example advertising in Televison is a very good strategy of marketing to support their products and in this part of time it is a very normal thing.
Also the children could be in contact with advertising in other parts of their life for example in a magazine or at a poster in a city when the brands want to show the toys that the children could get at christmas.
There nobody can say that it isn´t allowed because the most of the brands does it.
So my opinion is that I disagree with the statement that Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
When I was younger for example at the age of two or three I were not allowed to watch any Television and when I was four I were only allowed to watch a programm that didn´t show advertising (KiKa).
All in all everybody has to say for their own if it is okay to show young children adverts in Television or not.
If they didn´t want that then there children don´t has to watch advert in Television.

Insane Advertising or normal funny ads?
It's totally normal today to have several commercial breaks between your sitcoms or the movies you would like to watch.
We have adapted to this over the time but it's still annoying for lots of people, but have you ever wondered about the impact all this ads have on a litte five years old child?
It's totally clear that the channels couldn't survive in their branche without the advertising companies which are spamming with all sorts of ads.
The prices for these short and sometimes shitty ads are insane high but they have to work out for the company otherwise they wouldn't do it.
But most of the advertising companies have no ethic code and would sell everything to the viewers if they could make money out of it.
But an ad doesn't have the same effect on a litte child like it has the effect on an adult.
Litte children are very sensitive about other opinions.
So ads full with liars could misslead these young humans on the wrong track and could mess up their real life.
We can see the reflection of this on the generation which is about ten years old today.
Mostly all of them have a smartphone today and even better most of them are informed about the latest trends and want to have these new trending toys too.
And what does a litte child without enough money or even without the permisson to buy it do?
It runs to its mommy and is begging to get this new toy.
Most of the parents get soft when their litte child is crying and so they buy it.
But it could also go the other way, the child could go after, a refuse of its parent, to a stranger and ask him to buy it or even steal it by it self and all this trouble just because of the groupe pressure to have this toy.
It may sound like a exaggeration but we can't underestimate the power of groupe pressure on little children.
On the other side you can argument with the fact that the responsibility is with the parents of the children they have to explain their children that it don't need this toy or whatever the advertising companies are trying to sell at the moment.
So if the parents are doing a good job by protecting their child from stupid ideas and decisions because of all the ads the litte booger will be allright.
But there is also an other problem which comes with the ads for adult people.
We're talking here about sexual advertising and dating websites which are getting more and more popular.
These ads aren't meant for children but it often happens that a child sees them, and some illusions of the shiny friendly world are going to disappear.
It's a big problem when parents are watching a film with their child which starts at let's say eight o'clock and in the later commercial breaks the child is going to see some soft porn.
There is a very heated debate going on about this issue and there are also existing some laws which won't allow the channels to promote this ads before a certain time but is this enough?
For me personally i have to say that when I was young, that these sort of problem weren't really existing, so I can't speak about my personal experience.
But  for me is clear that we have to improve the security of our children by invent new laws to shrink the influence of the adver
Today I am gonna write about my opinion on if television advertising toward young children in the age of two to five should be allowed or not.
On the one hand side it is obvious that children can get influenced easier than a normal adult person.
For example when a children sees some sweets it might just wants his parents to buy him them and if not it would may begin to cry because of that.
Another problem could be that there are some advertisements that are not even made for childrens attention and could influence them in a bad way.
On the other side there is to mention that you can not disallow an advertisement for just one explicic target group.
In my opinion advertising has to be allowed to be seen by everybody and it should rather not exists advertisements that interfluence the behaviour of children and all other target groups in a bad way than that advertisining should not be allowed toward a special target group.
I also saw a lot of advertisements in my childhood, but it had not got such a big influence on me, so I think it is not that tragic as many people think.
Everyday people have contact with television advertising and many people say it should not be allowed to direct this advertising towards children under the age of five years.
When Children at this very sensitive age see an interesting advertisement they are very interested in it and want to have the product.
For the companys it´s easy to win the children as their consumers.
They make an advertising for television channels especially toward children for example for a "Barbie".
The children think they need this toy and ask their parents to buy it.
Of course it´s a big advantage for the company because they know that young children are important main consumers but now it´s the question if directed advertising toward children should be allowed.
A reason why it should be allowed is that the companys don´t  the children to buy the product of the advertisement and the parents could say "no".
Also the company has to sale their products and when they produce children toys it´s okay to promote it.
But on the other side children at the age of two to five are very sensitive and when they see an colorful and interesting advertisement they are leaded to buy this product.
I think it should not be allowed to make an television advertising directed toward young children because they are very sensitive and naiv at this age and when they see an advertising with the goal to impress them and lead them to buy the product it´s not okay.
They plant this thought of the new and cool product in their heads and controll them and this should not be allowed.
In this essay I am writing about the statemant "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) shoud not be allowed."
I am giving some arguments for and againt this statement in the following essay.
First come some arguments for the statement.
The first one is, if very young children sit every day infron of a TV, they don't make sport.
They don't run outside and look what you can see in the nature and thats bad for the health.
For example a child who is 10 hours a day in the natur an makes sport have a better body becouse he is not so fet and you have fun to run outside.
An other argument is, that his body don't say to so much things in the natur "oh it's against me" and not so many childs with a life like this have for example astma.
The tierd argument for the statemant is, that the children have to lern in young years "you can have fun without TV" becouse If a child don't play often outside in young years they never play outside if they are big children.
The last argument for the statement is, that it is better for the child if real persons do something with them and not a TV.
Now I am speaking about some arguments against the statement.
The first one is, that it is easier for the parents to let se childs infornt of a TV as to play with them outside.
The parents can do something in the house, for example to wash the clothes and the childrens are heppy that they arte alowed to watch TV.
An ather argument against the statement is, that the children can learn something in the TV.
For example there were some shows in the TV who teach them wath is one plus one and this can help them in school.
Ihe thierd argument against the statement is, that the children likes it.
They are happy if they are allowed to watch TV.
All in all I agee with the statemant becouse I think it is amportant for the live of the children, that they learn in young years you could do something without technik.
You need only a ball to have fun.
And it is very good for the heals of the children becouse every thing the child meets in young yeas in a good way, the body don't defends aganst it and the childs don't have so many allergies.
There are different arguments regarding the topic of advertising especially targeting children aged two to five.
For example on the contrary side we have the simple fact that children in this age category are easily influenced and should therefore not be the direct target of adverts.
Even if they are only spotting them when seeing their parents are watching TV.
However the amount of influencial content shown to kids could be regulated by their parents simply by telling them to turn off the TV.
There would also be controls on the content of the adverts themselve through organisations like the department of security for youth.
The stongest negative argument against these adverts however is the development of the children.
In the ages of two to five many children start to develop their own individual interests and that should be state in which they are able to think for themselves instead of buying them of them to get the most profit out of it.
I myself would agree strongly with given statement and think that children should be able to show interest in things without having to have seen the advertisement in the media for it.
Sadly today certain patterns are allready seeable when noting that the varying trends today show a great deal of change from generation to generation depending on what is on the TV and other media and what is not.
Many little children already watch Tv-shows on programs, that are aspecially for them.
Often there are many advertising between the movies or series.
That`s why many people dicuss if it should be allowed to show television advertising directet to young children, aged two to five.
We live in a consume time, where it`s important to have many different and new things.
But children at this age are too small to understand the value of many things.
So it`s not good to train them already at this age for buying and that it is cool and neccesary to have many for example toys.
Often the little children can not even understand or realize what this advertisings are for.
But we also should consider, that nowadays children grow up with media and all of the modern technologies.
We should try to introduce them in the media stuff in order to try to hide it.
Litlle children should already start to deal with the big amount of offers in this world or with the electronics.
Also there could be a big problem to realize this wish of no advertising for little children.
Because often there are only two or three children programs on Tv, and there are times where the shows for older children start.
But sometimes the 4-years-old children watch them too, for example with their sipplings.
Then they also see advertisings, and you can`t fully isolate the little children from the advertisings.
It would be too complicated to seperate the shows for different aged children on different programms.
I think this is okay to show advertising on show
We are humans who have the best oppertunities to become great.
When you are one of the lucky persons who got the change to get born in Europe you have won.
In a land where our wealth increased and most of us living a modern lifestyle.
So why should we forbid our kids to watch television advertising?
Well, our kids are getting lazier and are unable to learn important things.
That's an alternative fact.
Sure it's not their fault, why should it be.
It isnt their fault that they are growing up by watching television instead of going outside and discover our enviroment.
Our kids are destroing themselves because they dont even build a social life just because they have nothing else to do.
They are to focused and they are so fascinated that they forget the real-life.
However, why we should forbid our kids watching television.
I mean they arent able to contact the companies who are advertising and most of the products they are offering aren't even usefull for kids.
They dont need a dating side because they dont want to fall in love, they dont need a lawyer because they are not in trouble, they dont need a new car because the aren't able to drive yet.
So most of our advertising is made by adults for adults.
Additionally it is our fault that they are watching television.
Because we are rolemodels for the kids.
If we did other things than wasting our time in front of the television, our kids would look up to us.
This leads us to a new way of life without the necessary usage of a television.
In my oppinion it's not that bad that kids watch television advertising.
The only thing is that they miss the oppertunity to get in touch with real-life.
You wasting so much time by watching television.
Sure the kids should grow up by themselves and maybe it isn't that bad to watch television.
BUt I can't appreciate that the are missing so much just because they dont know something else than watching television.
Nowadays it is much more common to advertise with some hidden messages than 50 years ago.
This hidden message is often based on a sexual meaning.
For example the new "Pneu Egger" advertise.
It is about a snowman with spring feelings.
But I think that kids do not get the sexual meaning of the advertisement, so it is not that dramatic.
Advertising on a sexual base is so common, because it wakes people up and makes them to pay attention on the product.
Children are really honest but also insecure.
They often believe everything what the company tells them about the product.
Sometimes children can get confused and dissapointed, when the product is much worse than the product in the advertisement.
To my opinion, it is really important to take care of the time, when these clips are shown on television.
If there is a company who advertises for sex toys in afternoon, a lot of kids will see this, which is totally negative for their developement.
On the other hand, kids will be able to learn about new products and know how to use some toys.
They learn how it feels to have a desire and get taught to wait until they get these products.
In my childhood there was a song of the toilet paper "candoo", which I loved to sing with my mother and my sisters.
In this case I was able to learn something from television advertising.
It is really important to create television advertisements who are funny and easy to understand.
After thinking about the pros and cons of television advertising for young children, I can say, that it is totally okay to advertise toward children, as long as they are suited for the age of them.
To my opinion, there is no need to forbidden television advertising directed toward young children.
I disagree with the statement that television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.
I am aware that at a young age, children are very sensitive to input from their surroundings of any kind, which includes their family, friends, media they consume and so on.
In this time period a lot of the base for the life they will live is being set and traumatic experiences can damage someone into having a troubled personality or fears their whole adulthood.
By being exposed to advertising at a young age, the children are getting used to the fast, constantly changing, consume-focused lifestyle of our world, which is a negative thing, but I don't think that this can be completely stopped by banning television advertising.
It's just not realistic because firstly, the children could still see ads that are directed to older children or adults and they will grow into it eventually anyway.
I also think, that many of these ads are not only directed towards the children but to their parents too and it is primarily them who push their children into this consume-focused lifestyle by constantly buying them new toys.
If people start to see the problem in this way of thinking and living, I think they will realize that it can not be changed by simply not allowing advertising towards children.
In my opinion, the real change needs to happen with the parents because they are the ones who have the biggest influence on their children.
If the parents do no want their children to see TV ads, they can simply stop them from watching TV.
In our days, there are other ways to watch shows or movies, for example on streaming services like Netflix, where no ads are shown.
This way the content they consume can also be controlled, stopping them from watching unintelligent and unfunny TV shows.
Before this can happen, people in general need to change their way of thinking and start to fill their lives more with memories and knowledge rather than things they don't need.
To comparise my answer, I think that television advertising towards children should be allowed, because the change needs to happen within the families and the way the children are brought up and not in the way of what is on TV.
In my opinion, children shouldn't watch as much TV anyway and putting a lot of effort into banning these ads is a waste of time and energy because it simply will not help as much as people may think.
pro advertising: Advertising is an important instrument of a company to make their products or brands popular.
This is essential for the economy, stricter regulations would not only hurt the marketing business, they would have an infect on every business.
And since there are not only swiss tv-channels, a law only in one country could not work at all.
therefore, all the other countires with tv channels that are available in switzerland would have to do the same- otherwise it wouldn`t work.
And it`s not probably that so many countries would see the need for stricter regulations of advertising.
It`s also problematic to say which ads are directed toward children between two and five, not five to seven etc.
Marketing is only necessary because a company needs to be popular to sell its products.
The market can therefore regulate itself without any difficulties.
If a company addresses ads directly towards young children and peoople mind, they could just stop buying the products of this company.
If it really matters, more than just a few people will boycott the company and then, the enterprise will change something for sure and stop the problematic advertising.
contra advertising: Opinionating advertising that has an influence on little children is dangerous, because young children are easy to manipulate.
Therefore, they ain`t able to distinguish between true facts and only advertising elements that make the ad more intresting, like for example flying toy cars.
If there were an ad with toy cars who would start flying during the ad, little children would buy them because they`d think the cars would fly at home as well.
It could also affect the developement of the young children, since they are very easy to controll, because they can`t know yet how the world is working.
Should there be televisoin advertising directed to young children?
In my opinion, advertising shouldn't be made specially for children.
There are many channels for kids, who use long advertisments to keep showing their program.
Often the advertisment shows new toys, the children want immediately because they are so easy to influence and sometimes don't even know what the advertisments are.
Besides, some advertisments are made for another group of people, for example teenagers or adults, so it has a bad influence on them.
On the other hand, like I said before, a huge part of the channels that are available in this country need the advertisments to keep the channel running.
They can't afford to show movies or TV shows without it.
Yes, there are channels who don't really use advertisments, but usually they are not made for children this age (two to five years).
It isn't possible to leave out advertisment from the channels, so parents should talk to their kids instead.
Tell them what adertisment are, how they work, and that they are often made to bring someone to buy their product.
That would also help the child to evolve a better sense for things they need, or better don't ask for.
Another option is to not let the child watch TV, but that isn't really a solution, because from time to time it's possible that they do it anyway.
I wouldn't stop showing advertisments to young children, but to choose the shown advertisments better.
In addition I would reduce the time of the advertisment breaks, to lower the amount of advertisments directed to the children.
Another possibility is to stop huge companies use the easy influence on kids to make them want something from the advertisments.
Maybe there should even be a special  "Advertisment-Free" time on channels made for children young age.
Essay-Should television advertising directed toward young children no longer be allowed?
Firtst of all lets discus what are television advertises directed toward young children?
Mostly the thing trying to be sold with these advertises are toys.
But the vaiarity of toys is huge.
These days there are plenty of electric devises for kids, like Nintendos or cumputer games.
But there are also outdoor toys for exemple a bike.
If a kid sits in front of a TV to see a Nintendo it really would like to have, for playing inside, well this is questionable.
But if a kid, maybe a kid that berly leaves his room to go play outside, sees a bike it wants to have and as a result it goes playing outside, thats a good thing.
But on the oder hand, not every family is so wealthy that thay can easily and every moment afford a bike.
And if this is a big dream of a kid, to have  bike, not getting it, can be really stressful.
But as a kid does not have any money for itself the danger that it would go and just buy all the things that looked so great in that advertise and as a result be broke is not existend.
This danger  is greater in the adult world, as also adults are not always suchan adult as thay should be.
But tis text is not about this problem so lets focus back on the children and discus this problem from another piont of view.
What would it mean to a company when its avertising section is shut down?
Television advertises are most important advertises of a company thats because so many people at once can be directed.
Thats why I think a company in our time can not survive without television advertising eventhough all its competitiv compenys have the same problem.
And thats why I think the benefits for a child without television advertises is to small to out weigh the disadvantige
Television and other electronic devices are becoming more frequently used by younger audiences.
This movement is rapidly developping as its always more normal for a child to have a smartphone, to own their own tv, or their own laptop.
It is a widly discussed controversity among scientists, psychologists and other professions.
Promoting a product over the tv which aim at young children further normalise this tendancy and can manipulate young children.
Is this a bad thing?
Young adults and elderly people argue that in their childhood they didn't have things like a smartphone or a pc at home.
They only had a couple of channels on tv and in the case of the older generation these channels were in black and white.
Which this meant is that they say they have spent much more time outside, interacting with friends.
Futhermore having advertising aimed at young audiences can unconsciously plant an idea inside their heads.
Young children are very easily manipulated in that sense, so if they see the new barbie or action man they immediately want this new toy and ask their parent sif they can have it.
Often it does not matter what the product is exactly, as long as it looked cool or cute in the advertisement.
On the other hand having a growing audience, businesses unsurprisingly want to take advantage of the situation.
Esecially because there is less competition for this target age.
It's a big opurtunity for smaller firms too.
In effect to forbid this kind of advertising would mean to limit chances of product sellers.
In addition it isn't always a bad thing for a young child to desire something they see.
After seeing that new doll on tv, young girls might think, "oh I want that for my birthday".
Whatever happens, it results in something being learnt.
For example, a girl 3 years of age sees a pink unicorn toy in an advertisement.
Then the girl may ask the mother if she could have it.
If the mother was to say no, the girl may be disappointed, but understand she can't have everything in life.
If the grirl was to get said toy, it may have to work for it, or get it for her birthday- 

In conclusion I think advertising aimed at young
Television advertising is a very common topic in daily life.
Many people ask themselves if advertising directed to young children is a good thing.
The difficulty in advertisements for children is with the parents because they always need to reject the wishes of their children as they cannot buy everything for them even if they wanted to.
In general, kids are very believing and as advertising is always at least a little bit manipulating, so that they could have problems with dealing with lies in future life.
For example, playmobil advertising always shows the figures moving on themselves but in reality they are very static.
Even by this little movements, children might be confused about the unmobility of the figures when they see them.
It's difficult to find an example for advertising towards children because almost everything they show does not really work like it is shown or does not even exist.
Nevertheless, television advertisments have also positive aspects for young children.
It could also be that they learn to handle with rejections and understand in early age, they cannot get everything they want.
Also the television advertising will always be present for them even if they are older, so advertising kind of prepares them for the adult life.
If children get confronted with problems very early, they have more time to learn from them.
In my opinion, there is no need to forbid television advertising directed towards young children.
If there was not such a great amount of advertisements for adults too, I would have thought about it again, but as children have to deal with advertising until their death, they should also learn to deal with it in younger ages.
To me, the lies in advertising are not a problem for children too because I think it is important to not limit their imagination and to support it.
Fantasy is only present for children and we should let them believe in it, as it is also part of growing to point out the truth.
The statement asks if television advertising directed toward young children (agede two to five) should not be allowed.
A big adventagen from that is, that the children would not know which new toys their parents could buy them, so there would not be any arguments about buying the latest stuff.
But on the other hand the children do not have any ideas what they could wish theirselves for their birthday or for christmas.
So the parents would have to walk into the toy store and there, the kids would see even more toys and everything at once so that they could not decide theirselves and it would take a lot of time and money.
The difference would be that the children could see the toys in reality and that could be better, because children in this age cannot understand that the reality is different from the TV and that the advertisement wants to influence them.
But to see it from another perspective, there happen a lot of funny situations because of children who understand an advertisment wrong.
They just asked their parents about it or they are so attached, that they think for example that everyone in the family really needs an own vacuum.
In addition you can think that this children are still too young to see so much advertisement but it is a chance for them to have a break between the series or the films they are watching so that they can go to the toilet or get some food.
In addition the brands and fabrics should have the chance to show their products to everyone.
It would not be fair if they earn less money than other shops just because the others are selling things for adultes so that they are allowed to show advertisment.
So I think that it is okay to show advertisment in the TV to young children, because it is an fair possibility for everyone and it is part of the everyday life.
And if anyone is against this rule, maybe they should just let their children watch less TV.
In the following essay I intend to answer the question, of wether television directed toward young young children (aged two to five) should be allowed or not allowed.
Television, even in all it's forms is a relatively young invention.
Today, most people in western civilised societies own a television.
Just like the newspaper, the radio etc.
it is a form of media.
The purpose of media can usually be divided into two main subcategories: information and entertainment.
For example, many of us watch television to catch up with the news and we watch documentaries to educate us on certain topics.
In the same way, television can be used as a form of entertainment and education for children.
It's a different and exciting opportunity for them to learn new things about the world they live in, while at the same time having fun.
There are many TV programs that cater to the aforementioned things, some better than others.
Another positive aspect worth mentioning is that showing television to children is an easy way to relieve some stress from parents.
By letting their children watch their favourite TV programs, parents have more free time to do the things the need and want to do, whilst also keeping the children happy and entertained.
However, letting children watch TV comes with its downsides.
Firstly, watching to much television has been linked to having adverse health effects, especially in young children (aged two to five).
Another problem is advertising.
A lot of channels create and use advertising targeted directly at young children.
The ads often include the endorsement of unhealthy or unsuitable foods, as well as advertising many unnecessary consumer goods.
Additionally several studies conducted on this particular topic found that children watching too much TV were prone to become dependant.
The activity was also strongly correlated with reduced physical activity, which could result in young children becoming overweight or obese.
In conclusion, the negative effects of watching TV appear to point twoards a ban for young children aged two to five, as they outweigh the benefits.
Television advertising is seen by everyone daily.
Companies are advertising their products and special offers.
Adults know how to deal with advertising but we were asking ourselves the question if television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.
Advertising made for young kids is usually about toys or cartoons.
It's made colorful with lots of big impressing pictures which is why kids think it's interesting to watch.
If there is an advertising about a brand new toy the children always want to have it so they go to their parents and ask them to buy it.
The kids are too young to understand that people always want to sell their products and kids are the best way to do this because parents usually can't say no to their young kids.
They also don't understand that all of these toys cost a lot of money.
Nevertheless children at the age of two to five don't understand most of what's said in advertisings which is why I think that it doesn't really matter if companies use advertisings or not especially because they won't be able to remember it the very next day.
In my opinion television advertising for young children are very tricky because kids with their positive minds believe everything and they get impressed easily.
So I think a few advertisings can be allowed if they are made carefully.
But there shouldn't be as much ads as for adults so the kids can focus on their cartoon without beeing interrupted by multiple advertising.
Also parents should try to explain to their kid that they can't have everything that's advertised, I think it's important for kids to know that.
Television advertising is pretty controversal, especially for young children.
While watching TV, the majority of young children is influenced by the music they hear or the colours they see.
They often like colourful and noisy things which make them laugh or dance or sing.
Most of the television advertising is just like that today and I think that these children are really into this kind of advertising.
When they see a cool toy advertising with a nice song you keep in your mind they admire to have it and start to annoy their family because they want it as a gift for christmas or their birthday.
Otherwise television advertising is good to help the kids making decisions about their wishes for christmas, eastern, etc.
There are TV channels only for young children which don't show any advertising and I think that this is very good.
There are only the TV shows and no advertising for adults which could be bad for the education of them.
Many terrible things happen daily and young children should not get the brutal impressions of terror and pain because that could be bad for their view on people in their later lives.
You can also make advertising for useless or bad things and use nice characters or colours for it.
As long as it makes them happy, the young children don't care aboout the content of it.
For example there is much advertising for sweets which re not good for young children's but they want to eat them because of the interesting TV spot.
That's the reason why I agree with the statement that television advertising for young children should not be allowed.
They start wanting to have the newest stuff and they only get influenced by colours and sounds because they aren't able to think about the content yet.
In todays world television included the advertising is a big topic.
Almost in every home there is a TV and even the youngest in the household will use it.
This leads to early confrontation between children and commercials.
Many companies use advertising especcially directed to young children in order to sell their products.
The strategy behind this is that the children will convince their parents to buy certain stuff as they are much more likely to fall for such commercials.
Many parents may do not even recogniced that the childs' new desire comes from television advertising.
Also, television advertising directed to young people is often seen on children channels and inbetween films for children.
By placing the commercials this way they make sure as many children as possible get to see their products.
Because children are much more naiv it should not be a thing to show commercials designed for them.
One main reason therefor is that children aged two to five are not able to buy things.
It is the parents job.
So there is no sence in using commersials directed to children.
It may be a good strategy for companies but it is not a fair concept.
In my opinion there should not be any advertising directet to people in general who are unable to afford anything.
It should not be allowd in either televison, on paper, or on the radio.
Today you can see a four year old child on the playground with his new IPhone and playing games on it.
Also there are lots of children at home in front of the television and not outside anymore.
That is our new generation growing up with technology.
But is it healthy for a child or should it not be allowed for young children to watch television?
On one hand I understand the issues they have with children who are just watching television or are already having an IPhone with four years, especially beacause they are very young.
Young children in this age should play with toys or outside on the playground and should make games with their mothers and not with their phone.
On the other hand they can learn something on television.
There are plenty of good series for kids for example Dora who learns the children counting or the coulors.
Also it has an social aspects.
If the other children are allowed to watch television and your child is not, then your child can be excluted.
There are also lots of disney films who are for children and who the parents can watch with them.
Furthermore the child can learn about moral and friendship.
In my opinion you should find a balance between it.
I played often outside in my childhood especially in summer but I also watched television and learnd something from it.
Propably you should not allow it to a two year old child but a five year old can defenetly learn something out of it.
It is also important that you care.
If you do not care about your child watching television they can be in front of a television for hours.
Then of course it is not okay.
In conclusion it is every parents own decision how long and if they even want to allow it their children.¨watching television.
When you turn on your television nowadays you more often are confronted with ads that advertise especially toys for children even under the age of six.
Are those ads really necessary and are little children already allowed to watch so much TV that there should be ads for them.
I think that it is not important to show ads on the television for children under the age of six.
Firts of all I think that those ads should not be allowed because it would only encourage young children to watch more TV.
Children at the age of two aren't even able to understand what the television wants to tell them.
Secondly because it is a waste of time for little children to watch more TV I think it is not necessary to show ads on television that espeecially are for pre school children.
On the other hand when parents of young children at any time can't spend time with their kids the parents just put them in front of the TV so that they are entertaint.
And so that the parents are left in peace and can do what they have to do and if those children are watching a channel in which they show ads directed toward children with their age they are more likely to like what they are watching.
Also to put a child in front of the TV is another way to learn the language and for the parents to teach them the language without talking to them.
In conclusion my opinioin is that advertising directed toward young children shouln't be allowed because children under the age of six shouldn't anyway be watching TV so often that there should be ads specialised for them.
Television has a huge impact on people and especially on children and teenagers.
The biggest influence is the advertising.
The world sees a product being advertisied and then they think about buying it, because the product is well presented by the company or because it is useful in the household.
But under what impact are the young children and teenagers?
The question for this essay is if television advertising directed toward younger children should not be allowed.
On one hand, the children are too young to understand the message of the advertise.
They will look at the presented product and won't associet it with themselves.They may think it looks nice and that they wanted it, but they would soon forget about the toy, for example.
Instead they would wait impatiently for their favourite show to come on again.
Only their unconscisnous would remind them perheps that there is something that they wanted.
On the other hand, people cannot be sure, if the child really doesn't pick up the images of the product.
Maybe the child runs to the perents instantly and they have to buy it and if they don't the child is going to be angry.
Furthermore, it depends what kind of advertising it is.
If it is for a doll or a ball it is not dangerous, because every child has something like a ball.
But what if it is a gun for playing soldier or games with shooting in them.
That is when it will be dangerous.
This kind of advertising could have a big impact on younger human beings.
They could turn into a whole other person in the future.
They might like shooting guns or the idea of taking drugs.Their future could change.
I personally think that television advertising directed toward younger children should be allowed, because iitit
I once visited ma aunt whose children are two and four years old.
I saw them looking television at seven o'clock in theevening.
First they saw a film than the film was interrupted by an advertising.
I heard the chilren asking their mother to buy some thing that was presented in the advertising.
So I was wondering if this advertising poses a problem or if not.
And if it poses a problem if it should be prohibited.
On the one hand there is no obligation to look television.
Parents are free to decide if they want to let their children looking television.
If the parents think that the advertising has a negative influence in their children's behaviour they can stop letting their children looking television.
Andeven though it could be a problem, the problems are far more alarming in other aspects: Super markets put the candies on the level of the childrens eyes, to make them asking their parents for those candies.
We should first find a solution to those huge problems.
And in the end everybody has the possibility to open a television chanal so why should one not have the permission to show in his chanal what one wants?
On the other hand if there was a regulation the owners of the chanals would still have other possibilities to make money.
They could make advertising for older children for exemple.
But the children are not the only victims of the advertisin.
The parents have to buy all the stuff.
And this is not fair for them.
So the parents are not entirely free to decide if they want to let their children looking television, because there is no television without advertising.
For me the most important factor is the fact, that children are easily influenced.
I personally think that it is without any respect to use this for making money.
Such a thing schould clearly be not allowed!

If I walk down the street young children do not greet me anymore.
I would say this is rude and that in my childhood I would greet every older person because I was afraid of them.
I had a huge respect towards elderly.
In my opinion the technology is a possible issue which causes rudeness.
Many parents do not know how the raise their children.
It is likely to give them a mobile phone or to let them watch television for hours.
The time of goinig outside playing with neighboors is gone.
When I look at the problem from this angle it is plausible to me.
If they are not allowed television would be less watched.
Imagine the your favourite television series would not be released no more, you would not watch television either.
I guess this would work quiet the same for children.
As a result children would not go more outside but they could get a distance between the television and in my opinion this would be a huge development.
On the other side the economy would gain less money.
Furthermore some television programms have an effect of learning.
In my childhood I got to about some animals by watching television.
If I had not the possibility to watch television I doubt that I would be interested in animals now.
Rudeness has to to with caracter.
I would say that I had not been rude in my childhood because my parents knew how to raise me.
From my point of view the television has an impact on the caracteristics of a child.
Additionaly chldren who are busier in watching television than in other things often do not know how to act proparly in society.
In essence, I see the point of the statement.
Children get a lack by watching to much tv.
I am pretty sure that this trend can not be stopped that easy but if we do not make something about it will get worse.
By striking advertising television we could create an impact towards the children in a more positive direction.
The statement that advertising  directed toward young children should not be allowed is false.
One of the most commonly used argument is that the influence advetisment has on the young children is too big.
The fear is that children belive everything they get told and think it is a hundret percent true.
This fear may be reasonable, but it is just how the world works.
Later in life they will get linked and the earlier they learn, that not everything people say on television is true, the better it is.
Another agrument the supporters of this argument use is that advertisment has an affect on the brain funktion of kids.
Generally speaking they mean that it makes the children dumb.
But that is not true.
Studies have shown that people that watched a lot of television and advertising are not going to be more or less affected in their ability to think.
A way more greater danger lies in how young children spend their free time, because is going to affect their succes in sport.
This is because the age we are speaking of is the best age to learn new movments and develop their skills like throwing, catching or jumping.
If the children miss the oportunity to do so, because the just sit infront of the television watching TV all day long, they will have struggles to keep up with their classmates in sport.
In conclusion you can say that showing advetisment to young children is not going to have a bad affect on the chlidren.
Instead we should worry about the amount of time they spend infront of a TV, not being out in the nature running aroung and developing their skills.
If we not manage to do so, we will have a generation that might still be as smart as the generations before, but might not be able to properly play footbal or do an other type of sport, as good as generations before them.
Nowdays in mostly each hose is used a television.
But there are a lot of discussions about the use of children.
A lot of  people think the youth is to  much time on their phones and televisions.
But what is with the use of young children aged two to five?
Shouldn't they be allowed to watch tv?
The use of a television can help with their education.
They can already learn in young age things about the world, and this in a way with fun and pleasur.
There are a lot of series, which include a good preparation for the school and this in a way the children like to watch it.
On the other side young children should go out and play with other childs, instead of sitting along in front of the tv.
The children should be outside and have fun.
There are to many dumb series in the television, which doesn't have any avantage for the childs.
One example is Sponge Bob.
Parents should look for their childs and make little advantures with them.
The family can go to a museum of dragons, a hike through the mountains, and the childs will have a really good day with a lot of memories.
In opposite, a child won't have good memories of a day iin front of the tv.
In my opinion children are allowed to watch tv.
A little story befor they go to bed isn't got bad at all.
But if the parents just let their childs watch tv all day, just that they don't have to look all day long for their childs, it is wrong.
Children should go out and be in the nature and in the sun.
Television  advertising specialy for young children could drasticaly improff the money wich large companies, wich produce toys for young children, make, because the children see the toys in television and then want they parents to buy it.
Annother aspect would be that this adviserments only run on television channels which are especialy made for young children.
With this method the adviserments would be only seen by their target group.
The television channels for the young children would get a lot of money this way and can use it to show film and series with higher quality.
Possible reasons for not allowing television advertisaments for young children could be the kids of this age cant realy differenciate what of the advertisament is real and what is only a special effect.
At this age the children dont have a real own oppinion, which means that if the advertisament say that they need this toy and everybody wants it they think ist true and then they also want this toy.
A problem with the advertisaments on TV channels for kids would be that kids dont like it to wait.
But if the advertisaments are like the ones for adults, then the children would have to see 15 minutes of advertisaments just to see the last minutes of they favourite series.
For some parrents the advertisaments would be also a problem because they want to know what they have to expect what they children see on TV.
FOr the normal TV programm you can just look it up but you never now which advertisaments will be there.
And if the special advertisaments are shown on the normal TV channels the adult people would just get annoied by them because they are not interrested in in unless the yhave children in that age.
Also there wouldnt be as many kids like on the channels for children to watch it.
As we can see there are more reasons agaist special television advertisaments for kids than for allowing it, so it would be a good desicion to not allow it.
In my oppinion its also really important to protect the children from content which is not good for them, so the advertisaments shouldnt get allowed.
The following text is going to discuss wheter it should be allowed to direct advertising on TV towards young children.
Children in the age between two and five years are easy to manipulate.
An example for that is the fact, that children who come from a family that smokes, are more likely to start smoking in the future as well.
If we take the side of the companies, it is easy to find good arguments for advertising products by manipulating small children.
They will see things they like on television and are going to tell their parents that they want them as well.
As a result, children are going to have a lot higher standarts towards presents and other things similiar to presents.
Either they get them right away and develop a thinking that they can get what they want just by asking their parents often enough, or they get mad at their parents for not buying these products, maybe because one other child has it.
Furthermore, children should not be watching a lot of television in this age as well.
It is a fact that children who are watching a lot of television in their childhood are more likely to get a bad eyesight earlier than usual, and it has other negative effects ,concerning development of the body, as well.
In my oppinion it should not be allowed to direct advertisements at children between two and five years, not mentioning the fact that children are not supposed to be watching a lot of television in these years anyway, because it is an unfair way of manipulating human beings into the habit of consuming and buying everything they like, even in young years.
Parents should take care of what their children are watching on TV, if they let them watch television at all.
Children should be outside as much as possible when they are young, and not waste their time inside watching brainless series on TV and buying some toys full of toxic ingredients.
However, as a company you can advertise as much as you want, and direct it to the people you want to direct it to.
Even though it should not be allowed, there will probably never be a law which is going to stop companies from doing that.
I watched the first time televison when I was like 3 and the I watcched my DvDs.
I think children are supposed to play outside and enjoy the life and not sit the whole day in front of a televison.
It is also the responsibility from the parents what their children are watching.
When I was young I hardly watched televison and till today I can not watch any horror move or something like that.
From my point of view there is not that much diffence between televison advertising directed toward young children and adults.
Of course it is always a good way to make money.
Little kids are watching TV an they see something what they want and I can tell there are things every little girl always wants.
Puppies who can talk and Barbies with long blonde hair who can sing an so on.
The problem is that many children have then an imagination of something wich isn't real but their parents have to tell them.
But just because there is advertising doesen't mean you have to buy these things your children have seen.
It is the part from the parents to say no.
Otherwise your kids see something interesting like an advertising from a zoo or museum so they can also get imputs and learn something new.
What might be a problem is how you deal with it.If parents think it is not good for their children they have to decide if the kid can watch tv included advertising or not.
I think it is not an option that advertising shouldn't be allowed.
For many people is this the way to make money.
Of course I also find it kind of annoing when there is that much advertiting in the Tv.
From my point of view advertising should be allowed for everyone and if it schouldn't then also for everyone not only for young children.
The topic is that children between two to five dont watch TV.
The first agument is that Children dont go outside and learn by doing.
It is importat that children learn thing.
For examble they need to hurt himself or build a snowman.
If the watch TV is a way this thing by watching not doing.
Then children learn bad things like bad words or violence, because in the TV are a lot things with violence or hate.
Also children need to run and go outside to get stronger and it´s a training for them.
Real social Friend are more importent then friend in TV, because friend are importet to have a happy life also as child.
Then if your are lonely u get depressed and sad.
A other agument is that children get problems with her eyes and need glasses.
On the other Hand they can lean things about politics or economics, if they watch TV,, they can use it for her future.
Or the Parents can do things and dont need to play with the childrens.
A other positiv agument is that childrens learn things by childshows.
At last Tv can be good, if it is the right show and not bad content about useless things.
Then they can learn writing or speaking with this shows.
In my opinion i think it should not be allowed, because TV is not good for children and the parents need time to play with his children, if they don´t have time they don´t need to make children.But if the parents had no time they should get his children into a babysitter or daymother.
For many people television advertising directed toward young children should be banned because it affects them to much and they do not understand that they are being manipulated.
Firstly, the advertising can affect and influence young children very heavily for example when there is an advertisement about a toy they most likely want to have it and they will not give up unless they get this toy, but when they watch this much television that they do not give up until they get this certain toy one should blame the parents and not the advertisements.
Secondly, the children do not understand that they are being manipulated in being or liking a certain toy or cloth et cetera but the parents have the responsibility to explain the use of advertisement to the child in an of course simple way so that they understand that the toy they saw in the television is not that great as they expected it to be.
Furthermore advertisements directed toward children or just business strategies which are aimed a young children that their parents have to buy more products are not only used on television but also for example in supermarkets with the stickers which they can trade with each other and glue in their album, but the parents only get these stickers when they buy products for a certain amount of money which results in a big profit for the company.
In conclusion I do not agree with this statement because the responsibility lies by the parents and they should make sure that their child understands what advertisements are and that their child does not watch to much television and because there are much more ways where young children are used to make mor profit so you should either allow all or none.
One the one hand children get influenced easier by adverts than adults, but on the other hand it should be allowed to create advertisement for every product.
You can't forbid advertisings for toys or other childrenstuff, because then the products wont sell and the people, who sell the products have a disadvantage compared to other companies, that sell things, which are allowed to advertise.
It would be just unfair.
But you can't ignore the manipulation in these advertisements.
Children get manipulated by them very easily.
Advertisements show children products in a way, that they really want to have them and they almost force their parents to buy them.
And the problem is, that parents get pretty annoyed by their children, when they always ask for new stuff, they saw in the TV.
So they will buy the toys for their children, just because they want them to be quite.
The advertisements for toys also are often made very colorful, joyful and crazy to catch the minds of young kids.
But this happens in every advertisement in the TV, because the people want their products to get sold.
So I don't see a problem in making "ads" especially for children, because it's made almost in the same way for adults.
"Ads" are made for the interest of the people, who are seen as the "buyers" of the shown product.
And why should we make an exception for children?
In the end it's their choice to buy new stuff, and it's also thei fault.
The same as it is my fault, if I would by new videogame I saw in TV or if I watch a new film, just because I saw the trailer and in the end it's worse than i expected it to be.
Products need to get sold and so they also need to get advertised.
Everybody should care less about things said in advertisement, because often the producers lie to support their product.
It is the responsibility of the parents to buy toys for their child/ren and if they buy things, that aren't that great it is their own fault.
Parents should decide, if the advertisement is bad or good.
But I dont think advertising for young children should be forbidden.
That would be wrong in my opinion.
I totally dont agree with the mentioned statement.
One the one hand young children are easy to manipulate and they think that everthing what in Television are shown was real and partens have the problem that they should to explain the children that advertising often lies and do everthing to sell the products they show in their advertisting.
One the other hand many children aren't often outside in shopping centers with their parents, so they don't see maybe what they want on next brithday.
When young children see Television advertising they can easyer know what they wish for maybe christmas or on birthday.
Furthermore partens should look out that their children only watch Television advertising for the age of his/her child.
Otherwise the quantity important as well, because young children should play with toys or doing something outside to learn more acout the world und do more expericenes.
So all in all in my opinion television advertising d
This generation is called the ''Social-Media-Generation''.
Almost everybody has any technical Object, for example a mobilephone, tablet or television.
Even young children have these things and the question is, if television advertising should be allowed or not for young children aged two to five.
They're so many television advertisements these days, that it's nealy impossible to control what your children is watching all day long.
These advertisements can include some terrible images and words, for example sexual abuse, crime scenes or things that can lead the ''watcher'' to buy products and get trapped by that, especially lucky games or something like this.
When young children watch television it's most of the time movies or series specifically made for children, with toys, animals or something to learn.
So if the movie is over there are advertisements made for children, for example with new toys or movies (for kids).
But if the child switches the programme, they could see advertisements they shouldn't because they're made for adults.
Maybe the new trailer for an action movie or an alcohol advertisement.
I think some advertisements should be allowed for children, because they're not brutal or something and the kids can watch these without there parents watching over their shoulder.
In the season before christmas, when the children don't know what they wanna get from santa claus, advertisements for kids are very useful, because parents can watch these advertisements with them and if the kid likes one of the toys it can be the present for christmas.
But there is the big problem with this social media thing.
Every young kid has a mobilephone and their parents can't control what they're doing and what they get to see on these.
As a parent you can control a little bit what your child is doing on their smartphone, beacause you can download some kind of safety app, which only allows some games, and not apps like Facebook or Instagram.
But exacly these games incluse advertisements whether you want to see it or not.
You can't avoid them, because the app only works with these advertisements.
So if a kid just wants to play a mini-game on their phone they could accidently see an advertisement for a brutal game which includes weapons and murder.
Sometimes it's the case, that you click on one of these advertisements and then you get directly to the app-store/playstore.
If a child now likes the game but this game costs money, it's a big problem for the parents to check if they're not buying things there not allowed to.
The children coud download this game and the parents get the surprise that they have to pay for it.
You can say, that the internet and these television advertisements are not safe for young children, especially aged two to five.
Because they don't know what they're watching or doing and it can cause some trouble for them and also for their parents.
All in all i agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward children should not be allowed, because it's not safe for them to watch advertisements which are not made for them.
In my opinion television advertising especially made for children are ok like the ones with toys, if they not include crime or something like that.
But the other ones shouldn't be allowed for these young children.
In the following I will discuss the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed and support my opinion.
Advertising in general is known for manipulating the brains of their viewers and indicating them to buy specific products.
Especially in television these advertisements have started to use psychological tricks to really get into the viewers mind and trigger certain feelings.
Of course in an advertisment they only show the positive aspects of their product so we are really fascinated by it.
For us adults it is a lot easier to realise this and also think about the negative parts of this product.
Children at the age of two to five don't have this kind of critical thinking yet, so when they see for example an advertisement of a speaking doll, they don't understand the consequences this doll might have.
So when they see this advertisement where they show this really cool doll that can talk to you and repeat what you are saying and even connect to your smart phone they will go to their parents and ask for the doll so long until it gets what it wants.
This example has been argued a lot about recently in the news.
There was a doll on the market that could be connected to your phone and wifi in you coul tell her what to say with your phone.
A lot of children, especially young girls, got this doll until the law made this doll illegal.
It was used for secret services like the NSA and could spy on families that own one of those dolls.
Children would not recognise dangers like this and not realise the bad sides of their toys.
As I said, in advertisements only the positive aspects of the product are shown and in cases of childrens products you can also only see children playing with said product or toy and having the best time.
In those advertisements they use a lot of bright coulours and sounds that appeal to the younger viewers to get their attention and keep them interested.
Also if a child really wants to have something, even if it is not dangerous or harmful to them or their families, it is very hard to say no to a crying child.
They start to throw tanrums and make a huge disaster out of it until their parents give up and buy them what they want.
So if the telesvision advertising is always directed to young children who are very influencable, the chance of getting their attention and fascination is a lot bigger than with adults.
I do not think that television advertising should be completely forbidden for products that appeal to younger children, but it should not be directed only to them.
In general I think children channels on tv such as Disney Channel or Nickelodeon should be completley advertising free, so parents can control what their children watch on the television.
With no doubt children are a lot easier to manipulate and this should not be abused by companies that want to sell controversial products.
Television advertisement can be very controversial, it can be very usefull to build up economics as selling children furniture is a well-paid business these days butit can also be a factor that can damage children's education and pushing them to controversial materialism.
As we probably all know children are way more influencable than adults.
They can not measure the value of money and furniture yet.
Children also do not plan things into the future, it often happens that they become a present, for example a toy, and then are fascinated by it for one or two weeks and and after they don't use it anymore.
They also don't see a reason to save the small amount of money that they get for the upcoming needs, it easily happens that they splurge all their savings at a time on something not always satisfying.
Getting a toy that was advertised and that a lot of friends have is a good reason to do so.Children are known for being cute and innocent, so getting what they want can be way more easy then for other people like me.
We all know that they master the art of seducing their parents to get what they want while walking down the aisle of the toy store, so if the saw that fun new toy on television earlier, they will more likely try to get this toy with which they are already familiar.
This influence can be damaging for thej kid's education, as they don not learn how to evaluate the value of something on their own.
It is for sure a huge business and a well-paid market, but all-in-all I think advertisement for children should beforbidden because it seems that they get so influenced by it that it feels like children get not only their money stolen but also a part of their education.
"Advertising"

whats my opinion about the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
So, for me it makes especially mo matter.
Such young children can not be affected of a television advertisment or not, because they to young to think about this things.
they sit on the sofa and watch into the screen of the television and they only think about amusant things they see in the screen, so i think the aimgroup of television advertisment are children with the minimal age of ten years, and there won't be a law of showing these things to children aged two to five.
Another aspect is that the main goal of a advertising will take peoples interesting to buy some things, and the statement, that parents of two to five years old children buy them all things they need, so this reason also makes the statement on the top unorrect.
I can also understand, that there is a discussion about this topic, because young children often watch TV and to much is naturally very bad, so there any many reasons to make this statement correct.
I am not good enough informed to say if these sentense is correct of false or if i agree with it or not, but i think it's important to look that children don't look to much TV because in younger age it is better to make experiences outside and not the hole time before a screen.My opinon is, that it makes no matter-
Since the last few years television became a bigger part of our life.
There are not just more possibilitys to watch television as well there are more and more movies and television shows for young children.
More and more we have to ask us how good is that.
With watching television comes with less time to be active.
Children, which grow up to watch television in early their age, are more depence on television.
Today there are television shows for everyone and specially for young children.
This television shows promote that children learn important things with watching television.
The television shows want to teach children Math or English with little games.
This games are easy and should be fun.
That moves more and more parents to give their young children the apportunity to watch television.
In this time the parents do not have to look after their children, because they are watching television.
If the children are older they still want to see television, because they grow up with that.
To play outside is something that many children do not know how to do with bad concequenses.
We find more children in our time, who needs glases.
The most of them are first in kindergarten.
Thre is a connection between the qualitiy of eyes and watching television.
Sincetists say the children need glasses, because they have started watching television with an early age.
There are good things on television as well.
I am sure children could
In my view of point television is not just bad, but young children should not watch television to often.
One or two times in a week will be enought.
Advertising is all about knowing how to influence the audience.
Kids between 2-5 are too young to be influenced by television.
What do you want?
This is a really hard question to answer nowadays.
When I was little though, I remember knowing way better what I wanted and what I didn't.
Everybody did.
This is why advertising young kids is so much easier.
Theyare predictable, easy to influence and with that to be fooled by ads.
They will look at this clip on the flatscreen and since the advertising market knows exactly what they are doing, those kids will be sure that this is the thing they need, now.
They will go to their parents and beg for this toy.
This way the ad is working through the kid to reach the parents.
It gives the advertiser an easier job, but are we really aloud to use kids for business?
At this age you could call most kids naiv.
They live their life day per day, like they would go through a big game.Even though they do forgive and forget way faster than adults do,  there is dohave litlle fights quite often.
A tease hera and another there, it doesn't need more for a kid to start crying.
Most young children get their first experience with the different Money-status of their family vs. theone of another.
This wouldn'tbe anything bad if it wouldn't mean that they haven't got something, other kids got.
I'm not talking about a rugby ball, I'm talking about those expensive toys, which get advertised in TV and a few families just can't afford it.
After a while, those expensive Toys get to a trend and those kids with the poorer familiesget bullied because they don't have those new toys.
I think that advertiser shouldonly be aloudto promote something to someone who actually understands what's happening.
There is no reason, they should be aloud touse kids to reach the parents, even if this would be the easier way for them.
They should be able to choose without any in
Television is a big topic in our society nowadays.
Everybody has a television at home and knows the evenings were you just sit on the couch watching television.
The following text deals with the statement " Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. "
This questions is connected to a very controverse topic.
First of all the adults should decide if there chilldren are allowed to watch televison.
There are many channels especially only for children e.g.
Disney Channel, Nickelodeon.
When children are watching these programs I think it is good to have directed advertising for the children because the television can be very "dangerous" by showing some murder scenes or something like that and for these sepcial channels it is okay to have advertising only for young children.
But when you send advertising like this you have to know the risks of these ones.
In this young age the children do not know what is good or wrong all in all, so advertising directed to children can change their opinion, mind or development.
Another point is that little children like I already mentioned do not know what is good or right and you can influence them very easily in every single way.
Besides you also need to be informed about the risk that the children can be very sad if there parents do not buy them the newest presented toy.
The children do not understand if  they really need this new toy.
The parents might can not offer so much money for this stuff but the children are so manipulated so they will get there parents to buy anything they want.
In my opinion you have to be very soft with these television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) because you can not know what an influence it has on young children.
To sum up I think it is better to have advertising directed to young children than showing them some dangerous scenes but you also have to know that you easily can manipulate childrens.
So I disagree and television directed to young children should be allowed but the parents have to controll there children and also to protect them.
I grew up without television and I think that wasn't that bad.
Nowadays the problem is that alot of parents use the technology more often then mine.
So the child also, but it is bad when the child just watch TV without do something with the neiborhood childrens.
The kids can watch TV thats absolutly no problem but they have to do also other things.
It's also important what they watch on TV, if they watch some shooter movies is that acutually very bad.
But kids also could learn from watching television, when they watch documantary about animals that isn't that bad, beause they learn something.
I think the parentes should watch what there children watch on TV.
But like under five years I think they shouldn't watch at all TV.
At that age the kids have to learn more important things.
At this time they aren't even in the kindergarden.
But you can't say that it isn't allowed, because how do you wonna know that?
The parentes should make the decision even if I say no to that.cIt's actually normal that today the people work with more techonolgy or just always use it.
A live with out smartphone?
Alot of people can't imagine that.
So it's just likely that the kids grow up with that.
Even if it would be better with out.
For me it would be no, I won't do that.i know alot of kids which grow up like that.
But writer now we can't make a decison, when this generation is at our age we can tell.
Not before.
A day ago I read an article about parents, which don't care about there kids, so thats just an excample how it could end.
If you wonna chill with your friend and just because of that your kids watch TV it's worse.
Television advertising directed toward young children is a controversial topic.
Some people think it is okay at the age of two to five, other people think it should not be allowed.
In the following text I will give reasons for and against it and tell you my opinion about this.
One reason for that advertising could be that children get in contact with the medium at a young age.
Like in today's world they grow up with such "influence".
A reason against it, which is mentioned often, is that children, especially young children, will become numb because of the huge influence that the TV and, not only but surely, advertising have.
Another reason against it is that the parents of the child should have the control over what they buy for it.
Of course they should look at the wishes of their child.
On the other hand there are things being advertised which are not suitable for a child and these wishes should not be accepted.
A reason for the early advertising could be that the children can specialise themselves on what they like and what they do not like.
All in all I think there should be this form of advertising.
It does not harm the children.
In addition the parents need to have the control over what their children are watching.
Not when they are older but at this young age.
In the following essay, I am going to discuss the question wheter television advertising direct toward young children ( aged two to five ) should be allowed or not.
To begin with, there are a few arguments against this kind of television.
In general, the children are influenced by the media in a very young age.
Nowadays, they are a lot younger than they were for example ten years ago.
By forbitting a television advertising these young children one may be able to stop this development, or even trend.
Another argument for young children against watching television is the fact that they then do not spend a lot of time outside.
In that young age it is important to experience things by themselfes and not only seeing them on television.
On one hand, there are all these negativ aspects about television for young children, on the other hand, there are also a few arguments for allowing it.
First of all, the parents can control the time that their children spend in front of the television.
Watching it once a week for a short time means a huge difference  compared to watching it every day for a few hours.
Secondly, some  TV shows for children can actually help them to learn new things without them even noticing it, for exemple a foreign language.
In Germany, there excist a few TV shows that explain English vocabulary and grammar by telliing exciting adventures to the kids.
To sum up my opinion, I find the argument that the parents should control the time their children spend watching television the most convincing, because the children in that young age (two to five) shoud not be influenced by the media all the time.
In my opinion, you can not replace talking to your child, or ging outside with them by letting them sit in front of the TV all day.
If they just watch it once in a while, they can actually learn a few things.
Therefore I thing that television advertising direct toward young children should be allowed.
Advertising is everywhere.
It influences people and makes them buy some unnecessary stuff.
But is it right to influence young children by television advertising?
Children are very influencable.
They imitate and copy to learn.
Their dependence from adults is huge.
Small children are not yet able to think in a complexe way.
They often can not even say what they need or want.
So it is not right to show them television advertising - they will want whatever they see without really knowing what it is.
They are helpless and can not understand that they are influenced.
If television advertising gets a normal thing, they may be more influencable when they are adults.
On the other hand, they do not have a long term memory.
When they see the product from the television advertising in a magazine, they will not remember the television spot.
So the advertising may have almost no influence on them.
I think that the advertising adresses the parents.
They imagine the joy their children will have with the product and maybe they will buy it then to make their children happy.
In conclusion, i do not think that television advertising toward young children is useful.
Maybe it has a bad influence on them and it would be better to forbid television advertising directed toward young children, but I think that it adresses the parents and not directly the children because they can not say what they want, so it makes no sense to forbid it.
I disagree with the statement, although I can understand why someone would say something like that.
Advertising and it's rules is something which is really hard to define.
Many people are getting annoyed if they are watching television and every twenty minutes or so there is about ten minutes of advertisement for some random products and stores.
But eventhough people are getting annoyed this advertising is still neccesary for the people selling a product and it is working because many people will actually buy the shampoo that they have heard about and not the one that they don't know.
Especially in television there is advertisement for almost everything.
Sure it depends on the channel and on what time of the day or the year you are watching, but beause of that it almost seems like a logical conclusion that there is also advertising for products which are demanded by children aged two to five.
In the view of a producer of a product for kids, for example a doll, I totally get the point.
If you are making advertisement for your doll on a kids channel and around Christmas your sales will increase for sure.
The reason for that is that children in that age can be annoylingly demanding and if they see advertising for a toy or on my example a doll they want to have, they will beg their parents as long as they get it or as long as it is written down on their wish list for Christmas.
On the other hand, the point I've just made also works the other way aroud because if you are the parent of one of those kids, the situation can be very hard and stressfull.
Everytime your kids watches TV it will see all these fantastic toys and everytime it will come running to you afterwards and beg you for one of them.
And what should you do now?
It's no good parenting if you always just buy your kid everything it wants but you also don't want to have the same argument everytime your kid had watched television.
Or maybe you want to buy your kid that new doll it is always talking about but you just can't afford it.
As a parent the situation is bad and I can understand why they would make a statement like the one which had been made in the task.
As I mentioned in the beginning, in my personal opinion I think it is okay to make television advertising directed toward young children because I think this belong to a free market system and is an important point for the econimic nowadays.
In the private channels exist a lot of movies for very young children and as well a lot of advertisements.
In this eesay I will answer the question wether this should or should not be allowed.
On the one hand, adverisements for young children are no good idea because they are unable to way up the advantages and disadvantages of the product and simply want to have it, even if they do not need it.
The companies use the simple brains of the young children to make them think of their products.
But on the other hand these children have not the money to buy the products they want and so they need their parents money (And until the age of five I got no pocket money).
With this step the problematic becomes much smaller because the child´s parents should be able to decide whether this advertised product is necessary or not.
And if they are not one will have to forbid all advertisements.
Another advantage is that the young children are the customers of tomorrow and with the advertisemnets they get an overview about the varieties of toys, sweets or games in our modern world.
And if you are realistic they will always have to deal with adevertisement, so why not start in their early childhood?
Furthermore I think that the adds are not really for the children.
The companies try to influence the parents if they use the direct speech from television to child and want to make the parents think about spending money for this product wich seems to be directly made for their child because the television says so (Many humans are really naiv).
The only real disadvantage is the "stolen time" when the children have to watch the advertisement until they can continue watching their movie, episode or whatever.
But this problem counts also for adults, so it does not support the cons.
Finally, as long as there is no real risk, we live in a free country and should not simply regulate everything becaues we can and even if there is a risk, it will not happen because the economies influence would stop every law to this issue because they have to be able to earn more money
So I think we should not forbid advertisements for young children because it does not make problems because the children have no  money and it even helps them to see the possibilities in stores and to think about their real wishes.
And like explained at the end the question has no sense becauese nothing wwill ch
During the last couple of years television advertising became very popular and today nobody could imagine watching television without seeing any advertising.
Television advertising is made of many different categories, for example: food, health, fashion and toys.
Especially toy advertising towards young children is a much discussed topic.
In the following text I will state my opinion on the statement: Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
First of all I think young children between age two and five shouldn't watch too much television in general.
They should rather play with real toys or play outside.
I think that this is way better for their general development and health.
I agree that sometimes parents need to take a break and it is an easy way to put your child in front of a television and if in this case it's just about few hours a week it's totally fine for me.
In my opinion parents always should have on mind that their child gets manipulated by advertising just as themselves and I think most of them already have experienced that the child requests much more toys after watching television ads, especially in christmas time.
I think this isn't just the case in age two to five but also as an adult or teenager.
For example when you see the new iPhone generation in the commercial break and think about your old phone, which hasn't got enough space for all the applications you desire, you want to buy a new mobile phone even if it's not the new iPhone but just some newer better one.
But you have to have in mind that as an adult you should be able to resist and as a child, which is verey easy to influence, you haven't really got a chance to resist all the toy advertising.
In conclusion my opinion is that you shouldn't allow any advertising on television channels for children, because it's not fair to influence them while they can't really decide that they don't want to see the advertising.
In the following text I will write about to agree or disagree with the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
First of all there are many advertises for young children, not only in television.
For example in the city, in the radio and you can see advertising for children on the internet.
That is nothing new.
There are so many children in the world and it is a big group companys want to make money with.
Watching television is for many children something really important and they do it often very much.
So why should companys must not use this way of advertising anymore, esspacialy in the end the parents decide to buy the product or even not.
But on the other hand, there are sometimes advertises wich are not that good for children in this age because of different aspects.
I do not agree with this statment, because of the aspects in the text aboth.

Is television advertising manipulating our young children?
We need to know wich effect television advertising has on the young children (aged two to five), so we can decide if it should be allowed or not.
One of the problem is that i`ts very hard to tell if television advertising has an negative effect on our children.
If so, it shouldn`t be allowed.
We can say that the age is the problem, why it should not be allowed.
Children in that age can`t differencate what they are seeing, not like adult person.
We know that, what is sayed on the TV is not always the truth.
We know that companys often lie about their products in the television advertising to promote them and so to sell more and to gain more money.
In contrast, when young children see something on the TV they can be so facinaded about it, that they won`t to have it.
This can become to a problem, because the companies can manipulate or childreen.
They are trying to hunt of the young children with Barbies, Hot-Weels, Dolls to sell their products.
Because they know that parents can not resist the wishes of tehir children.
On one hand we can say it sholdn`t be allowed, but in the other hand it`s very hard to forbit it.
We can say it`s impossible.
Altough advertising on TV can have an negative effect on young children, I think it shouldn`t been forbiten.
We live in a free world and in a free economy.
In the ages of Internet and YouTube the most young children don`t even care about TV, they don`t watch it.
And the partents can always forbit their young children to see TV.
Everyone knows that parents are not interested in that there young children (aged two to five) watch television but should it not be allowed?
In our world young children watch television but are they influenced by them so much that they would not play anymore?
On one hand television has a big influence on young children.
They want to be like for example superman or batman.
When they watch television they see that the superheroes can fly and want also to fly and probably do not understand that it is not real and that they can not fly without for examo an airplane.
On the other hand is television a big part of our modern world and everybody watch some series.
If we do not want that our young children watch television probably we must stop it too or watch only sometimes when our children for example sleep.
Furthermore young children have the oppertunity to play with friends, with their parents or with toys and everybody knows that children have lots of toys.
So they can use their time better than to watch television.
They must learn to play with their self and probably they also msut learn to be ennoyed.
An other argument is the break between the series.
The children see new toys and want to have them.
When they would not watch television they would not see this new toys from the market.
Parents clearly not have to buy this toys for their children and they probably not buy them every toy but parents want to make their children happy but that is the wrong way.
Children must learn that they can not have everything they want and that they are not the middle of the world and when they do not learn it in younge age they probably never learn it.
In conclusion I think that it should not be allowed or that it have olny one/two hours in the week.
I personally think that young children must learn to play witih them self and to do diffrent things like playing outside or  drawing.
It is interesting for their life to can do something alone and that they do not have someone to entertain them.
They must entertain themself.
Television advertising is a quite big part of our daily TV programme.
Especially on channels that are meant to be watched by kids, there are countless spots about games, toys and other inventions that kids might like.
DO kids already understand what they see in TV and how are they influenced by it?
While watching TV, children may see a new product that they like.
They are inspired by it and have new ideas of what they could play or paint.
For example They can find another way to use a toy they already have.Such experiences support the development of the child's creativity and provide it with new ideas.
However, especially young children cant't understand yet how they are influenced by the media.
Every product seems to be perfect and a lot of fun on TV but they can't see the marketing stategy and the lies that are hidden.
Those children may be disappointed once they recieve their new toy or game.
Furthermore, by showing kids the wide range of toys that exist, parents are pressured to come after every of their child's wishes.
In addition, these products often are quite expensive, which enlarges the parents' problem even more.
To conclude, I would like to mention that television advertising should be limited, especially on childrens' channels because in my opinion it is wrong to use naive children to sell as many products as possible without them noticing how they are influenced.
Television advertising directed toward young children influences them in their young years.
If they see things in television they think:"Oh, that's cool!".
And than they also want this super cool new toy from the ad.
The children think they need these things to have fun with their friends and to be popular.
Because advertising want to show them that they absolutely need these things.
Television advertising can also give them inspiration that they can build their own opinion of toys and other things.
But children shouldn't be influenced by television advertising.
They should have their own opinion and they shall decide at their own what they like.
I think tv advertising toward young children shouldn't be allowed, because the children don't have the possibility to be individual when they are influenced like this.
It's important to show the children to be an individual person.
Should television advertising directed toward young children between the ages of two to five be prohibited?
First of all, advertising is not always a bad thing, but if we as a society ban a television advertisement for young children, we would be censuring the media!
Advertisement is in our favour, it is true that companies profit through advertisements but it is their job to sell their goods to us consumers.
Therefore it would be a bad thing to ban advertising which is directed to children, because companies have to do marketing somewhere and the best place for that is the media.
On the other hand, children can be influenced a lot easier than adults, they would automatically want to buy something that showed up in the advertisement.
Thus children would be aggressive and sad when their parents do not buy for them for instance the pink toy in the Toys' R'us store.
This would change in some of their behaviour in the future.
Futhermore, they would start to not listen to their parents from an early age which does not have the best outcome.
Nevertheless, advertisements are boring and definitely not interesting enough for young children, so why should companies invest in more advertising and thus spend more money on marketing their products, if it is not a hundred percent sure whether or not the children and their parents would actually buy the advertised products.
To sum up, advertisement toward young children should be banned because it would have an impact in their behaviour with their parents.
And companies would spend more money on advertising their products when they can not be sure if the chidlren's parents would buy their advertised products.
First I think its not a good idea to set the children before the television whith so much false and ,,dangerous'' advertising.
Because the child must have much contact to other children and even to the partens.
Thats the first fact beacause I disagree this statement.
Further in the television advertising there is so much humbug and that shouldn't see young children.
For example from a movie where real persons were killed or something like this.
Later the young child have much dreams of it or don't dare to be in a dark room when the child goes to bed.
So now I think the television advertising should be more normally than now on much tv channels.
When the child once look television then the parents should switch to a childchannel like ,,Super RTL'' or ,,KIKA''.
Because there are childfriendly channels which the advertising is more friendly for the child.
When it is such a channel I would maybe agree with this statement but its in general not good for such a young child to watch the hole day television.
The child must have social contact to other childs or sure to his parents.
But a further problem is when the parents also watch lots of television then the children look to his partens and do is like they do it.
So in general I surely disagree with this statement because there are so much other actvities for such young children for example drawing or go in the forest.
This way the childs could learn something about the nature or something for the future life.
Thats more helpful for the life after.
In the following I am going to discuss the topic of whether young children (aged two to five) should be allowed to get directed by television advertising.
Since the sienctist know that much information is captured in our brain without that we would even notice it I think this is a contraversial question.
First, there should be said that watching too much TV isn´t good for kids, for adults as well but for kids even less.
So do we want our children to watch TV programms frequently?
However, not all the parents have time for their children the whole day, they would wish so but its reality.
So sometimes watching TV seems an thinkable option.
But if the TV channels would not be allowed to show young children then how would they pay their programm?
The stream of TV shows is very expensive and advertisers pay a lot of money for the advertment.
So there would be lesser TV shows for kids because they don´t make a lot of money with it.
I think that if there would be lesser TV shows, the kids definitly watch lesser TV and like I said too much TV is not good for humans every age.
Because with less variety you would not be able too choose between different shows you allow your child to watch and so you allow your child less TV.
On the other hand, could it be right that TV shows for kids are able to transport a lot of soicially valunerable lessons?
Often the episodes of TV shows for children are about the moral and the friendly treating of other people, about tolerance and courage.
And that are important things to learn for the process of growing-up.
So, we just decided that watching TV can sometimes be helpful even when it´s not that healthy.
But should television advertisment should be forbidden?
The poor children watching these programms should not get attacted by the big pharmer and human rights hurting industries.
I don´t even think they underatnd what they are listening but the danger that in this young years during the structure process of the brain some information get stucked in their mind is very high.
So I don´t understand why there should be any advertisment on kids channel because it directs children that are too young to even understand the meaning of it and as a side-effect the parents get adreesed too, but I think it is absurd.
All in all, my final point is that there should be no television advertisment directed to children between two and five.
It is not nessecary and children should watch lesser TV anyway, so if they want to bring in the television advertising do it in programms for older people.
More and more young children between the age of two to five watch TV instead of playing with other kids in the garden or drawing a picture or something like that.
Has this change something to do with the parents who are to busy to look after their children?
When the mother and the father of young children have to work, they often can't pay attention to their kids and therefore they allowd them to watch TV.
Children who can watch TV are mostly calm and because of that the parents can relax after a hard day.
To watch TV is also less expensive than to pay for a babysitter who look after their kids.
But the negative points of watching television advertising as a young child are strong.
Young children should better use their spare time to play outdoor and together with other kids.
They should enjoy their age because they have so much energy.
Many children don't understand what the people on the TV want to say and what the background of an advertising is.
It's also a fact that children who see something on TV they like, for example a special toy, they always want to have this and then it's difficult for the parents to say no.
I personaly think that young children shouldn't watch TV advertising because they are to young to understand this stuff and they schould learn to play together witch other kids and to see how the nature functions and so on.
In the the following I will state my opinion to wether television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not.
Of course, children, especially of that age, are easy to manipulate and I definetely see the danger in ads for children, but I think it doesn't really matter, when the children are actually manipulated to the point, that they would buy a product advertised to them, because in the end of the day the parents are the ones, who have to buy something for their children and have to decide what their children are going to get.
Apart from that it is important to say, that children are influenced from everything around them, not just TV-ads.
Friends, family, kindergarden and also the series they watch in TV.
When you say, you don't want your child to be influenced by ads, you have to keep it locked in a flat room with no windows.
Also, when this kind of advertisement would be allowed, parents would or at least should be aware of that fact.
So they can decide to not let their child watch TV, when they don't want it to watch those ads.
So all in all I think nobody could complain about ads for children in a world, that is full of ads and different influences and when you are aware of such things as a parent you can prevent your child from getting in contact with something like that.
Also no child would walk in a store and buy something irrationally, simply because they have no money to do so.
Should young children watch television or not?
In todays society it is commun that young children are allowed to watch television during the day or even in the evening.
For parents is it easier to put on the television instead of playing a game with their children.
Parents are able to do some cleaning or some work at home, while the children are mostly quite by watching television.
At the opposite it is also important that parents spend time with thier children outside.
It's the only way for children to learn about our nature and dayly situations in real life.
Another aspect is to look at the health of young children.
It isn't healthy to spend all day inside and never get in contact with dirt or bacteria.
For young between two and fivenit is necessary to get a good immunsystem so they can't get easly sick or ill. 
 
As a parent you have to show your children animals, nature or a new environnement.
On televison of course it is easier to show those things, because you don't have to leave your house, but it is never as good as in real life.
In my opinion watching television in young age is not a good idea to replace time with parents or other children.
It can be a possibilty on a cold day but it doesn't have to become a habitant.
Even though it is lot easier as a parent to put on the television, I'm sure that children appreciate spending some time  with their parents without a television or a mobile phone.
The statement 'Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed' opens a very complicated topic.
In one hand, there is a big responsibility for older people to protect younger children against television programs which could have a bad influence to younger people.
But in the other hand, there are also interesting television programs for young children which could be helpful to learn a bit better or something like this.
In generall I would say that the most television programs are not so good for younger people, so we need to protect our younger people, so they cannot see them.
But in my opinion, there are also some programs could be very helpful for them, so we shouldn't be allowed to hide those programs to younger people.
Another interesting argument to agree with the statement is that younger people shouldn't waste to much time in watching television.
I agree, because there are also many activities like readings books or doing something outside for example which are even better than wasting the whole day on television.
But I'm not quite sure whether we are allowed to hide something to younger people, because these people could find another way to do this things when they want.
In the following essay, I am going to talk about television advertising towards young children.
In my opinion, i think advertising is anoying, doesn't matter wich kind of advertising, but there still are differences.
If you create advertising for adults, they have to deal with it.
It is nessesary for brands/factories to advertise, to sell their products.
But it is wrong to create advertising directed toward children or young children.
They don't understand what advertising is and they just think the product is so great.
They will ask their parents to buy it and they will probably say no.
Now the children think their parents just don't want them to have fun and they will get mad.
This is really bad for a family and so i think advertising towards children should not be legal.
But if zou think about television advertising it should be a different discussion.
If parents let their little children watch tv it is their own fault.
It is wrong to give young children a tablet or a smartphone and it is also wrong to let them watch tv.
If these children see some advertising on the tv or in the internet it is the fault of the parents and not the fault of the brands/factories.
In conclusion i think it should not be allowed to advertise directed toward young children, but television advertising is okay, because young children should not even be allowed to watch tv.
I`m beggining with some pro arguments:

No they should not be allowed because these young children are more easy to influence then people in any other age.
Beautiful colours, happy song whitin the Advertisments, sometimes yust straight lies about Products.
All in all things and stuff elder people know yust better.
By pushing all these Advertisments about Products into the kids brains, they learn that only the price matters on toys, not their Worth.
When this Progress proceses, this bad influended kids will ever have this revealing damage, of not knowing the difference between things costs and what theiy are really worth because there can be large Intefferences.
Childs could get really mad when they dont get the things they want.
If the parents know things better (and its up to hope they do) they will be the bad guys because they want, whitout any measuring reason, their kids to not get these toys.
If they get want they want now they will start to want to have other things right when they get those things they wanted before.
Now I am giving some contra arguments:
They should be allowed because in tho most cases their parents sit next to them while watching TV to tell them what these advertised Products are really up to.
They should be allowed because the kids-channels have to get their money anyways so why not about advertisments?
Even Kids aren`t that easy to influence, so that they want to have everything yust because they yust saw an advertisment, they have forgotten already right away.
In the end I will explain my own opinion:

I think directed to children in age of two to five advertisments should not be allowed because these kids have no idea of how the world really works.
They of no Idea of how does money works at all?
Where does it come from?
How does thing work, that makes the world function?
Even tho I don`t really do.
It`s better for kids in these age to be in contact with humans then with the TV, what they would need to have if they `want` the see Advertisments.
Actual the telivision has a to strong force about peoples meaning, for examples those people who watch really much RTL.
When Kids in the age of two stgart to become bound to the tv they will not have an easy life.
Although it can be pretty frustrating when a kid wants to see this one special episode of whatever and every 15 minutes it has to see some Advertisments, he gets close related to the these products if they have to do with whatever they see right know.
All in all Advertisment for kids of the age of under 6 is actual pretty bad.
Is it reasonable to advertise things directly towards young children that are easily influenced?
This topic has been discussed for a long time and today I am going to disscuss it here.
First of all you have to think about the childrens well being and health.
If a child is tricked to believe that certain stuff such as candy is really great and healthy because the TV says so, it is going to influence the childs eating decissions for all of their life and that would not be so great.This is the big argument regarding this topic bechause colorful and sweet drinks or foods are often made for children and also advertised towards them.
On the other hand you could argue that it is the parents responibility to look after their children and they should prevent wrong decisions.
They should clarify things for their childrens mind and influence them into making right decisions.
It is not the firms responibility to look after every child and if they sell a product for children they shuold be allowed to market them towards them.
Furthermore you should think about morals.
Morally it is not right to take advantage of children that age, or any age.
They are not grown up yet and they do not have the ability to act like an andult.
If they can't act like an adult, you shouldn't be allowed to market things towards them just like towards adults.
Advertising could also be seen as a promotianal entertaiment and entertaiment may not be forbidden for anyone.
In that case you would also have to fotbid certain movies and shows that include product placement and that are directed  towards children.
In addition marketing toward children could also influence their mindsets towards the world in the future and could move or destroy the self image.
If a young girl only sees advertising with "perfect" young woman telling her she should buy this or do this it is going to mess withher mind forever.
Finally, I personally think that advertising towards children should only be allowed if the ad is approved by some kind of group that looks  after the childrens wealth I think that it is morally wrong to take advantage of children but I can also see the point that parents should look after their and teach their children well enough so that they are not influenced by wrong information.
The questioon, if advertising for young children should be allowed is a highly debated topic.
In the following text I will comment on that topic.
At first we have to mention the bad impact, that if the children see so many things they want to own, they can`t create their own lives, because everything is already made up by the advertisers.
But seriously, why would children not be allowed to watch advertisement?
I think that the impact of advertisements are not that huge as some people believe.
It`s the parents job to not buy their kids everything they want and think of this: If the children wouldn`t watch those ads, everything would be dictated by their parents and I bet, that the same criticz would stand up against the parents and want the kids to be influenced by ads.
Furthermore I beg you to not come up with the arguement: "If those children watch adverts, they get stupid.".
I believe, that if you don`t want your children to get stupid by watching ads on television, just don`t let them watch TV at all.
And in todays world all these kids own IPads and so on, where they watch ads for grown ups.
And that is, what should be stopped.
All in all I don`t really care about this topic, so please take my text toooo serious.

Since the media plays such a big role in our current society and you cant prevent young children from watching TV and being influenced by its advertisment I am asking myself wether TV advertisment for children should be forbidden or not.
First of all
People could say that poor familys made not be able to make their children happy anymore because of their growing expectations of what they see on TV and that they could get into some financial problems because of that.
These children however are not going to be able to stop watching any other commercials either so they would have to deal with advertisment for the adults which is not better at all.
Children could be tempted to think that everything they see on Tv is the truth and that they can believe what the TV says it could lead to the point where they think everything they do has to be like in the comercial they saw and maybe are going to lack creativity for example.
But this could also be used in another direction where the children learn how to deal with advertisment at a very young age because they are going to be confronted with it for the rest of their lives so it would be bad to just throw them into the cold water.
The advertisment could lead to surroundings where children jugde each other by how many toys they have from for example specific brands they saw on TV like "Lego" or "Playmobil" and that this could lead to them always wanting the newest and the best toys there are because they want to be accepted by the others.
But when they see the advertisment and get all the information about the toy they want, they know how much it costs and they can compare that to other things they see on TV so they could learn how to be responible and to get the best there is with the least amount of money or affort so they get a feeling for how much the toy they play with is actually worth and they learn to respect that.
Because of the arguments I stated I think it would be useless to try to not allow advertisment for kids on TV.
When I was a kid I loved to watch TV, it was not so important, what i watched, but more that I could watch.
And in my experience, I was not the only Children of my generation which have the same story to tell.
So, for a Child it is great to watch TV but is it good for them or should it not be allowed.
First I have to say, there are more than one point which I think are important for this topic.
One is the sort of programm a Child watch in this age.
In the young age of two, the educational progress of a Child is much better than now, because of this fact everything that the Child sees, will have a more or less importance for the Child.
So if the Parents would show them a savage shooter, this would be a catastrophe for the young person.
But some shows for Childs can be good for the experience.
Furthermore there are some aspects of quantity.
To much Tv is not really good and healthy, for every age, especially for childs.
So this is the responsibility of the parents and there are sadly some parents which let her childrens sit behind the TV for hours.
there are naturally more than one cause for such sceneries like not time or much work or simlpy desinteressting.
Nevertheless it would be difficult to make a law which not allowed Tv advertising sing for young children.
Even tough it would be possible to make this rule, it is hard to control such a law.
So in my opinion it is not the responsibility of Tv canals to prevent advertising but the parents should look for her Childrens.
On the one hand the canals should show less advertising on the other hand is is the renponsibility of the parents.
Television advertising - Is it too bad for young children?
Television is a big part in our daily lives.
The TV program und advertising have a very big influence on every human.
Even young children, from age two to five, are influenced big time.
Because of that there are opinions telling how bad the big influence on young children can be and that especially advertising for those "kids" should not be allowed.
Of course this is an understandable opinion, but are children really influenced as huge as it is told?
Surely they do behave like it is told in television sometimes.
But furthermore I do think the biggest influence on them is really given by their parents.
They are the ones telling them how to behave and how to have a good life and not the television advertisements.
The children should be able to differ between advertising and real life.
Often there is a not existing world shown in television.
This is the biggest problem of those how have the opinion that television advertising should not be allowed, I guess.
But they do have to think about the way children watch television.
"Kids" at the age of two to five do not understand everything shown in television.
They just look at the little "movies" that advertisements deal with.
Because of that I think advertising for children should be allowed in a helping way.
They should show the "real" world and not the fictive worlds because it is very difficult for the young children to differ.
But all in all television advertising is a normal part of our ilves and even their lives and it should be allowed, even for younger children.
Young children need a ot of attention from their parents, their siblings and the whole families.
This can be very difficult and busy in situations in which you do not have a lot of time.
The problem of children who are looking for attention in such situations, can be solved very easily: place the child in front of the television so it is quite and you have the time you need to cook your meal, tidy your flat or do other housework.
Nowadays there are a lot of TV-programms which are especially made for young children.
There are some happy colorful animals who sing together some songs and your child is happy.
Isn't it perfect for a baby?
In contrast to this attitude there is the question if it is a good solution to leave your child in front of the television, watching some child programms during the family which is responsible for the wealth of the child every time, even on busy days, is occupied with other activities.
If they do not have anough time to manage the housework  and their child, should they even become babys?
Watching television in young ages is totally bad for the child's wealth.
Kids are not able to understand what is happening on the fluckering screen, because their brains are not enough educated.
In my opinion watching television as young children should not be a daily activity.
Although I todally understand young mothers who allows their young kids, watching television for some reluctant minutes, because they are very busy and had to made really important stuff.
I think being a great mother is a big challenge because children needs a lot of time and patience, as a result it is comletely normal, that mums allow things, from which they know it is not the best thing for their loved child (watching television, eating sweets, ...).
I think the most important thing ist that a child feels constantly the feelings of love and belonging.
Should televison advertising directed toward young children be allowed or not?
The question is clear.
Of cause, the first impression is that it is manipulating these kids.
Also the parents will be involved, because their child wants to get what ever is in the show.
On the other hand adults surly can be influenced too.
So we have to ask ourself, not if it should be allowed to direct it toward kids, instead we should ask, if generally it is a good thing.
Furthermore these people, who produce these things need it.
It should be a right to show their products to potential buyers.
That is how it works, without advertising, how people could know about it.
For kids in age two to five it isn't a good or bad thing, so why not?
In their live there will be always a way to influence them, if not on tv than in the kindergarten or at friedns house.
The next argument is that the kids need to cope with things they can't have.
They need to learn not to get everything someone wants to sell them.
Later on in life it will be there day in and day out.
Thus they need to learn it early.
Also if parents doesn't want their kids to be influended, they shouldn't let them watch tv at all.
Even more imortant is it to ask, should children watch tv without their parents during that age?
Furthermore, what is the fifference between five and six and how could they possibly manage it.
If the kids see something for older ones, they still want it.
Also some kids are further an other ones.
Or they want things, which are normally for younger ones.
For the conclusion, it souldn't be forbidden.
Television advertising is influencing young and old ones, there is no line that we can say, these ones yes and the other ones no.
Parents should be capable to leed them into the right direction.
And once again five minutes of bright clips of dolls and guns are being seen on the TV screen.
Loud noise and colorful lights explain in a very disturbing manner five year-olds why this or that toy should be bought and it seems like they actually succeed.
Kids today grow up with media, with advertising, with the Internet and many more things.
But should it be allowed to manipulate little kids into buying, to manipulate them into the world of capitalism and consum in that early stage of life.
on TV.
In my opinion, yes.
My main argument is probably the fact that this a new age!
It is simply not comparable to the childhood of my mom.
It is a new form of danger, yes, but children should be as fast as possible be able to deal with that kind of influence.
Others will argue that children have no understanding for this up until this point and I do not agree with that.
I grew up with television and I understood very early that first of all, television advertising is annoying concidering its length and how often it is placed.
I simply never thought of it as a platform to find new things!
Second of all, children are way to self-centered to constantly even care about what some people tell you there.
Yes, of course, sometimes I saw something and was tempted to buy it.
But buying it would have needed my mom and it was her resbonsibility to teach me how to consume in a good way.
You cannot simply turn off ads fearing your child might get spoiled.
Parents need to confrot this topic as early as possible.
What I often heard as well, was that parents are tired of their children begging for things they might have seen on TV.
Crying for attention and material things.
A world in which children are only satisfied when they hold the toy they so desperatley wanted in their tiny hands.
Well, parents before that had to fight in World War II, so I do not think there is any room to file complaints about being bothered by your children who want stuff.
Stuff that you could potentially buy, because we are living in the first world - priviliged in most ways.
Which brings me to the next argument.
Nowadays it is not just television ads, its YouTube ads that can influence our children.
Or a billboard, maybe only an old-fashioned ad in a magazine!
If you want to protect your child from all this, you would have to move into the woods.
There is no point in only not allowing TELEVISION ads.
You either go all the way or you drop it.
This is the century of the media!
And is protecting your child in this way really the solution?
And more importanty I wonder if this question is even relevant.
There is NO way companys will stop making these ads.
So what are we even talking about?
We should rather talk about how to introduce children to the media, which I now often recommended and pointed out.
Parents need to learn that there is no other way.
The internet keeps growing, smartphones are a part of our every teeanger (sometimes even childrens) lifes now.
If that is wrong or right should not be the topic of the discussion.
Accept it and deal with it!
What strikes me probably the most about this question is that less and less people watch TV.
It is going to die eventually.
Meaning, no, allow ads directed to children on TV.
Confont them, talk to them and make them grow up with it so they are not heavily disturbed when they are old enough to dive into the world of social media etc..
The actual world of manipulation and mainstream movements.
First of all it has to be said that adults are responsible for their children.
So if a child around the age of two to five is watching television then his or her parents are responsible for this.
So why should it be forbidden?
Is the influence on these young children to big or can they handle it?
On the one hand a good point against advertising would be that young children can not decide whether something is good or wrong.
So an advertise is influencing them more than older people who are educated and responsible for themselves.
So because they can not decide if the advertise is good for them it should be forbidden.
Another point would be that their parents have to controll their children all the time when they want to watch television because they can not know if there is a rude advertise.
So to stop them, the parents have to watch their children all the time.
On the other hand this really should not be a problem.
With television advertising young children can learn what different things there are on television and they can even learn something from it.
Maybe they see their next birthday present,their future dream job or even a good education plattform.
So advertising does not have to be negative.
If there has not been television advertising than they would just watch more movies or series.
To conclude this topic I would like to mention that the state should not be responsible for two or five year old children by making laws that forbidd television advertising.
I think that the parents of our community are the only ones who should say what is right or wrong for their children.
But clearly it can influence little boys and girls when they see advertises that are not made for them.
So to be really sure that your children is not watching any advertise you have to stop them from watching television and let them play outdoor where they can learn even more from the real world!
Because this is what life really is about.
To go out and experience the different aspects of life.
In the folloeing text I am going to write about television advertising dirercted toward young children.
This topic is difficult, because on the one hand their are children who have to be protected and on the other hand their are the producents, the companies which have to sell their toys.
Television advertising is absolutly normal nowdays, but if children are in the focus there are huge problems:
First, chrildren are easy to manipulate and this is nothing than maipulation.
The companies which are publishing a new toy and praise this in the television, they want the children to buy this.
Another point is that the german law declares that children are not be able to save them selves from influenes from outside.
As well as this their are also under the protection of their parents.
The parents have the ability and not only that, they must protect their children from these influenses.
Now you could say that the parents are in order to do that and why the state has to forbit the advertising for child toys.
Yes you could, but many parents are unably to know sometimes what is good or not.
Many very young parents or single mothers or fathers have to time to be there for their child and so they set them down, in front of the tv and the child watches tv without any protection.
This is maybe the minority, but there are some outside and they also must be proctected.
Also the companies have other ways to raise their sells.
The advertising should showed for the parents or for adoults not for their children.
The parents can realize what is what their are showing.
All in all, I think it is helpful to forbit the television advertising which are directed to young children in an age of two to five.
These children should not be allowed to decide what is good or bad they parents have to do this and the state should help the parents at this point.
No it should
Companies spend  a lot of money on advertising and one of the major advertising platforms is the television.
During the advertising breaks they try to reach several different customer groups.
Not only acccording to their age but also to their education, living standard and relationship status.
But should it be allowed for the enterprises to stream advertising in television which is directed to young children or schould it be forbidden?
First of all you should ask the question if the young children understand what is meant with the advertising.
Do they realize that it is played and not real?
During the early years a child is influenced by many factors.
How do the parents treat them, what are the doing in their free time, how do the friends treat them and for sure also what they see in the television.
During this process the personality of the children is formed.
Now is it good for a child to see that another child has the newest bycycle and it has to still drive the one from two years ago.
This could lead to some serious problems for example that the child is depressed because it never gets new things due to its parents which can not afford a new bycycle for it.
But you could also say that if you are allowed to advertise directing all the other age group why shouldn't you be allowed to direct small children?
For the companies it could be highly profitable because children can be very hard to shut down if they want something.
And if a child sees another child having fun with something they want to have this kind of thing too to have fun.
From my point of view it should be allowed to advertise directing young children as long they are themed and made according to their age.
For example that no violence is shown or something illegal happens.
And why not make an advertise for the new bycycle or just a chocolate bar.
As long the children are not afraid of it it should be allowed.
Influences from the new media, especially from ads, has already become a big part in our live, even though me often does not realise it.
But should we let the media have such a huge influence towards young children, too?
In the following i will answer the question if Televison advertising towards young children should be allowed or not.
First of all it's true that children aged around four years usually don't really know what money is how it works and that their parents don't have infinite money so they see something on TV and are like "I want that.
Now.
No matter what you say.
NOW!"
and drive their parents insane.
Furthermore is it true that children should not get anything they want even if their parents got the money for it.
But it's also true that TV ads are not the only ads towards children that may have a great influence and tend to annoy their parents until they just want to scream at them: In our time, it's not that unusual that kids, even that age, are given a tablet PC with some kids games like talking cats and jumping little monsters and if you ask me, that's just fine.
But those apps are usually for free so they contain ads and the producers now that children are playing their games so there are usually some ads for children there, too.
So the problem isn't just the Television.
Furthermore there are many other opportuinities to force parents to buy useless things they're children don't need.
E.g the in Germany so called "Quängelzone" is one of them, if you walk into a store, at least here in germany, there is usually a huge billboard next to the cashier containing lots of candy so while the customer waits for paying his items, his kid is watching at all those chocolate next to him and will start asking for some until his father is so stressed out that he will say yes.
And that is just one of many opportuinities, just have a look at the advertising strategys in the shopping centre, it's everywhere, also in normal supermarkets, so stopping just the TV ads would prevent nothing.
The last point to argue is if that's even an important question, I mean clearly its arguable if there should be such a huge influence from brands and famous products but is that really the thing that is putting children in danger?
Is it there where we should start to protect them?
How about dangers on the internet, which is nowadays used so much by children and theyre parents don't have a clue what they are even doing there, another example, related to the TV is what you can see on TV besides the ads: In Germany you are allowed to send nearly anything after 10:00 PM and so they send nearly anything, and even what you can watch before that time is very questionable and often disgusting you have naked people, dark horror storys and even the news may disturb little children and you may say "yeah but I control what my son/daughter is watching" I'd go like "don't fool yourself, then you can also protect them from watching ads, that's not the point here."
So after all it's definetly arguable if you should forbid TV ads, because they have many cons.
But if you forbid TV ads then please forbid anything else that may have some influence on children, too.
And please first take care of the real dangers before you play the godparent who is just annoyed by his or her child, wanting more and more stuff.
In our world it's naive to think that you can avoid the media and I don't think you should so calm down a bit and focus on the real problems.
One qustion is really often asked.
Shoud TV advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) be allowed?
In the following text I show my opinion about this topic and present my arguments.
First of all, many people may say, TV advertising toward young children could be a negative aspect on the child´s development, also it might be boring for parents or other adults.
Another point is, if the breaks between the episodes are to long, the children would likely lose the interest in seeing this channal.
This arguments clearly show the negative aspects, but in the following part I show the other side´s arguments.
Firstly, TV adverting could be helpfull for the children learning to speak.
The children could also speek about their birthday or Christmas wishes and this would be very great action for parents, who don´t know, what they should give their children.
Secondly, the TV advertiving toward young children might help in the education to modern, western mass consumers, it would help the children to assimilate themselves into the mass consumption community really early.
Thirdly, the children would be selected by their gender und could get differnet advertising, the gender mainstreaming would be sificantly helped, the children would be helped in their development.
Finally, it is the parent´s decision, if there children are allowed to watch TV and advertising, no child is forced to see TV advertising.
In conclusion you see, although there are aspects speeking against TV advertising toward young children, the most arguments are for the advertising and this is exactly my opinion about this topic.
I´m going to dicuss the statement "Television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" in the following text.
First of all one could say that the young children haven´t got any idea of advertising, so they would be (beeinflusst) even when the parents doesn´t want that.
It´s possible that the children would own all things they see in the television but sometimes the parents haven´t got enaugh money to buy those things or it´s even possible that the children have got enaugh i.e.
toys.
So the children could get sad if the don´t get what they want and the parents would feel bad if they can´t buy the things what the children want.
On the other side the children could get new ideas for toys maybe as a birthday present or for christmas.
And maybe they could share the toys with other children in their age which already own them.
In conclusion one could say that the arguments for advertising in the television directed toward young children are (stärker)because in reality no children would own all toys they these anywhere.
And for the (Erziehung) is it sometimes better not to (erfüllen) all wishes of the children.
My opinion is that television adversitsing directed toward young children should be allowed if it´s not too much.
In my childhood I saw advertising of toys in the television too and I dident´t want to own all things.
I found it even cool to look at these toys in the television because I weren´t interested in the most things I saw.
In the following I will explain my opinion on the topic of advertisements for young children in television.
An argument of the people creating those advertisements could be that children are just younger people so they should get advertisements as the grown-ups get them, too.
But an argument against it could be that children get influenced by those advertisements in a bad way.
So when they get for example an advertisement for a car for children which is maybe bad for the environment they are simply too young to understand that this is not a good thing.
They are just so overwhelmed by the effects and the happy children in the advertisement that they think that this must be something good.
That is why I believe many people think that advertisements for children should be forbidden.
They get influenced right from the beginning of their lives and are not able to make up their own opinion on things.
So this will also have bad consequences for their lives when they are adults.
Also it is just wrong in an ethical way to force young children to have the opinion on things that the media want them to have.
Because in the end it is always the goal to make those children critical and make them really think about whether something that is being told to them is true or right.
So I agree with the statement because they are too young to understand and it's so easy to influence them in a bad way.
It is better for the whole society to forbidd advertisements for young children so they get better adults in the end and maybe change something in the world for good.
But probably the creators of those advertisements and the whole company will make it very difficult to forbidd those advertisements at all.
Nowadays, television advertising is commun in quite every country and for every type of person.
So there are also lots of adds directed towards children, but is this ok?
Or should this be not allowed?
There are diffrent arguments for and against this and in this essay I try to explain some of these.
So for exemple the infulence on the children with the result, that they want to have everything.
Firstly, advertising directed children influence them a lot.
As a result, on the one hand, they want everything they see in the television.
This causes a lot of discussions with the parents and if they do not get that the classmates would mob them because they have not got all the new things.
So this causes a lot of trouble with the parents but also with the colleques.
It is hard to show a child, that it could not get this article, because it do not understand this.
So it will end in tears and a big catastrophe.
As a resualt the parents are probably going to buy it, so the goal of the sellers is achieved.
As I have shown this type of advertising and influencing is, on the other hand, a good tool to sell a lot.
Nevertheless, I think we should not alllow television advertising directed toward children.
Firstly the cannot buy things themselves and secondly there are too many discussions with the parents and unhappy chidren then.
Nevertheless, there are many sellers, who need this type of advertising to sell there products.
In my opinion advertising for childproducts but toward the parents would be a middleway.
So the parents are also influenced and would probably think about buying it, but there will not be that much discussions with the kids.
The sellers could sell their products even this way.
Futhermore there are also other types of advertising.
So if it is forbidden in TV , there would be other ways to make adds directed toward children.
To sum up, I can say, that it is not good, if we make advertising directred towards children in TV, but we should allow it for example in newpapers etc.
We should find a compromiss, which is good for both sides.
Television advertising towards children is a complex topic.
Some people think it should not be allowed for children aged two to five.
In the following I will name some arguments, why it should be still allowed and some why forbidden.
On one hand it ist very important for the marketing to manipulate young children.
It is the easiest way to sell a produkt.
It is less complicatet to make a child to want a product than a parent, but the child can manipulate his/her parents to buy the product.
On the other hand it is unfair to manipulate young children to buy products they do not need.
In the advertisement the product looks so amazing and it seems you need it to have fun.
That is all, what the children see.
They are not old enough to decide is it unsefull or not.
So they want this toy, for example, and they go to their parents.
So what parent would say "NO you can not have it!"
to his own child?
Also advertising in television never shows the reality.
So in television advertises you lie to the watchers, because of that you lie to young children.
Children which are too young to understand, that it is not the reality!
That you will not have friends or fun just by having that product.
In conclusion I would say that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed.
It is just a easy way to manipulate parents to buy something for their children by using the children, which cannot decide how usefull the product is.
"More and more childrens get influenced by the television adverising", thats what I hear sometimes from young parents.
But is that correct and should we forbit that?
In the follwowing I will list one argument for an some against this statement.
I think the only pro argument to this topic is,that we can't be sure, that these young children understand the advertising and became influnce.
But if it is so, there are many arguments for this statement.
The First and really important point are the false impressions.
Trough the advertising of drugs like alcohol or cigaretts, they could think its a good thing.
So the chance to comsume these drugs in the became more attractive.
In addition another problem is the much showimg of food.
The childrens watch to so many unhelathy food, that they became influence and eat more and more of them, that they could get overweight in the near future.
They lost their natural kind of eating.
In this case they learn that the people have to be beutyful neraly perfect like these in the advertising, they study it since the little childhood.
The last an and even bad argument is that they see many new and all times better toys as they just have.
They want to get the new, better and cooler toys.
They would be never happy about the things they already have.
If we look into the future the familiys which have not enough money to buy their childrens so many new things, the childs would have complexes of less.
The advertising in television can be seen from everybodey who is watching the right program.
Also childre4n between two and five years old are able to see this advertisment.
Is that good for them?
Advertisments have an influence on everybody who is watching.
The adult people are able to know how to work and live with these information.
But young children maybe aren´t able to see the difference between the shown world in the advertisments and the realitiy.
They can´t understand the task of advertisements and interpretate them in a wrong way.
These wrong understandig can have a bad influense for there coming life.
They maybe can understand from an advertisment about chocolate or other sweets that unhealthy food is good and makes happy.
The advertisement gives the children no chance to get informed about the negative aspects of the products.
They only shows the good and happy world you might have using the product.
But also that is a problem.
The children thing that if you use the product everything would change like in the advertisment.
But that ist wrong and the children aren´t able to understand that.
But on the other hand is the television advertising a part of the life of a normal person and later of the children too.
So why shouldn´t they learn so early as possible how to understand these advertisments?
When it wouldn´t be allowed to show these advertisments to young children than there would be a point when the children were able to watch this advertisings and aren´t also in the higher age able to understand this in the right 
way.
If they learn very early how to understand, they will later have nearly no problems.
On every channel you can see fucking television advertising.
It's not fucking funny, you kow.
The concern or wheever  is behind this advertising will make lots of money.
But they also give aout a lot of many becaus advertising special in the televison is very expenive.
Children are so young and they can't make a difference between reality and and this shit they send on TV.
I would say it's like a kind of proboganda in TV.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed becaus the young children today are oure futur.
Also a lot of parents are working and didn't know what the children of them is wathing on TV.
The big concerne aren't interesst in what is happen whith this kids later.
The only thing they interesst is to make money.
To make a lot of money.
So that was the negative aspect os this topic.
Now I'd like to show you some positive aspects.
I'm so sorry but after thinking about this topic for several minutes I haven't a good argument Televisin advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
Only one aspect I'll tell you.
Some times this advertising is a so fucking damn shit that I only can lough about this.
Some times I ask myself what kind of a bastard you must be to make a advertising like this I saw.
So you can see I'm not a big fan of this advertising on Television.
Nowadays, if you watch television, there are many adverts.
Adverts for shampoo, cars, new technologies but also toys for children; even though the children can not even afford these things.
I think it is actually strange to advertise directly toward young children.
First of all many of the children won't be able to even understand the advert.
They just see something in the television like a toy and they want it.
It is kind of manipulating.
That is why advertising directed toward young children is actually pretty brilliant.
Nevertheless, children aged two to five normally do not have money, hence their parents have to buy them toys; and I remember from my childhood that I was able to get many toys by just crying.
And the interesting thing about it is, that I rarely played with the toys (which I saw in television) I received.
So the television actually manipulated me too.
The advert showed a kid playing with a toy.
I somehow noticed that this kid was happy.
And because it is in human nature to reach happiness, my brain connected the toy and the happiness.
As a result I tried to get the toy too.
However, adverts about toys which manipulate young children can also be useful for their parents.
Maybe the parents are looking for a new toy they want to give the child as a present for birthday or christmas.
In this point of view such an advert is pretty useful.
Nevertheless, there are just few parents who watch these kind of tv channels (for kids), so they possibly won't even see the advert.
In conclusion, there should be more such adverts in tv channels for parents because I think that it is a better solution to show the parents what toys there are, because they have to buy them, than manipulate young children and give them the feeling of needing something they actually do not even need.
It is a fact taht in the USA or in outer countrys children acting is very popular.
Mostly are behinde evrey childhoodstar a strong mother or father, witch push the children to go one or to bee better than outhers.
The children have so a dificuld live and not a normal childhood.
If you see a smilling on the face of a childerstar you can not sure that this smailing are reel , because they are trained for that.
This are the resaons  I am agree with taht televiosion advertising diseted toward young children should not be alloed.
So i said behinde every childrenstar are parents or one parentpart witch push her child to do this.
The child can not dicide be her own because they have not the mentale talentd jet.
So they do waht they parents said, because they trust them and belive parents are allways right.
They have no mobilitys to say waht they want.
I think this fact allon shoud be strong enough to push tis disishon to a agree.
That the children do waht outhers people want, they have not a normel childhood.
So they go to spezial kindergarden or schols.Sometimes they not even have enogh time to play with outuers childs.
Because they have to go with her parants to a shoting or to a casting for an outer roll.
This children have to learn in a age of two waht is mean to sit quiet on a chair, and not waht is mean to play with outers the oll day long.
It is that the right way for a child to grow up?
I think not.
What ever I said here, it dosen`t metter even the child is not happy.
But that is the dificult part.
I think you can not be sure taht this children are happy, because they trained this for castings ect.
Mostly the chids had all toys they want because they earn many jet.
But they can not reely paly with them.
Are thise children happy with this waht they do and waht they have?
I think a children shoud have a childhood and not a perfekt futre in the show bisnues.
They shoud have fun, because in the childhood is the only time your live is perfekt.
If your are growing up the mashic of the wolrd goes a way.
So the question is, if Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Let us discuss about it and look at the arguments.
Firstly young children can be easily manipulated without noticing it.
They could use this fact to influence the kids to buy stuff they do not really need.
And it is not their money they use, it is money from their parents.
So the parents have to buy stuff the do not need.
The children do not really understand the economy system and in cause of that they will get sad, if they do not get the things they want to have.
On the other hand the parnets are the ones who decide if they buy these stuff for their children.
They have the authority to tell, what their kids can have and what not.
So no matter what the children see in the advertising, they have to ask first their parents before they can have the advertised stuff.
Even if the kids get sad or angry, the parents get the same problem, when they go shopping with their children, but there it is more embaressing.
What also could be important is the fact that parents have to deal with the complains of their children.
It can be stressing if the kid always argues about things he wants.
But this is a question of how to raise a child and this have every parents to deal with.
If you do not want to deal with stress then you should not have children.
Eventually it does not really matter if there are Television advertising, because the child do not have the power of buying everything they want.
It is the decide of the parents.
I think  advertising is a good way for the companies, which are running the TV shows, to get money and then they can use the money for even better shows.
Today the television is not that popular like in the past.
Especially the youth views much more Youtube videos or videos on social media plattforms in comparerision to the television.
But one big problem for all this media plattforms is advertising.
Sometimes it feels like there is more advertising than the movie itself.
The question of the essay is if television advertising directed toward young children aged two to five should not be allowed.
First of all how should it be controlled which channel the kids are looking?
The only possible way without beeing really expensive is a channel especially for kids aged two tow five.
The young kids should not watch television at all.
They should play with other things because in this young age it is important to learn basic things.
Although the advertise is made for everyone.
Only the advertise for people over 18 is late in the evening.
I would say advertising directed toward young children aged two to five should not be allowed because they should learn the first steps about life.
There should be a channel for kids with kids programm only and without advertise.
As a conclusion i can agree with the statement.
Should it be allowed to have ads, which are directed towars young (aged two up to five years old) children?
As you watch TV (Television) u probably have seen many commercials.
They used to be directed towards older people, like teenager or adultes.
But they are getting directed more and more towards young children.
Is this okey?
Should there even be ads for this kind of viewers?
I'm trying to find answers to those questions.
- With the help of those ads, parents or realtives have it quite easy to find gifts and presents.
Let's say your cousine has birthday in 2 days and you dont know what to get her.
In an instances, she sees an ad for a new barbie, which she likes/wants.
Without breaking your head and even so not finding something good, you know what to get her.
-Those ads are also helpful for the parents.
Because of those ads, parents are up to date with the toys, which are popular.
Imagine your daughter wants a scooter and you decide that you'll get her one.
But which model?
You dont want to end up with an old, unpopular one, which she won't like at all.
- But its quite known that ads show toys etc.
differently.
Better!
They often show things in commercials, which arent there in the real toy.
For example: In the commercial you'll see a Lego-castle with moving princesses.
Sure they are writing down that they cant move, but those young childrens probably won't see that and are impressed with the moving toys.
They dicide, that they want it and as they get it, they are disappointed!
- Children don't know the value of money.
They will see these toys and want 'em.
They don't know that their parents may not have enoght money for it.
Because of that they get sad.
I think ads for young children aint bad.
But, lets be honest here, they are often done out of a false idea.
They dont want to show the kids the toys, no, they want to sell it to the kids.
They often use effects to make the toys better than they really are, with the idea in their mind to directly sell it to the kids.
They often don't care whether the kid will be disappointed or not!
They just want to get money out of 'em.
To sum it up.
I think commercials are good because they show kids and their parents, whats great at the moment.
Because of that i think commercials directed to young childrens should be allowed.
Not the ads should be prohibit, no, they effects they use to make the toys "cooler" as they are should be prohibited.
Many people have a television and watch TV every day.
Allthough many parents take care of the children because they don´t want them to see bad things from which they will get nihtmares.
Because of this many people discuss about the question, if it should be allowed to show television advertising toward to young children between the age two to five.
One thing is that it is unnessacary to say that only children betwee´n two and five are not allowed to see this advertising because many young children don´t realize what they see in tv.
It would be more logical to make this persicion for children between six and nine.
An aspect for that theme is that the children collect in the age many expierience and talk about that in the kindergarten and some advertising they couln´t understand and maybe they are confused about what they see.
An other aspect against this is that young children shouldn´t sit for the TV the whole  day because they can play outside or meet freins and so on.
So it would be really unnessacary to make advertising for that agegroup.
because of all these themes I have the opinion that it should be not allowed to make advertising directed toward young children aged two to five.
Young children nowadays spend their time in front of the TV more frequently than in the past.
During this time they are confronted not only with the television shows directed towards them, but also advertising clips geared towards young kids.
Some say, these television adverts should not be allowed.
On one hand the television adverts give the children the opportunity to find toys that they would like to have and that they could wish for for their birthdays, christmas or other holidays.
It broadens their knowledge of things they otherwise wouldn't know about.
On the other hand these advertisings can lead to the young children developing a need that they otherwise wouldn't have for those material things.
They create a sense of importance for material things in the children's minds.
This can go as far as to children getting jealous of and starting fights with other children for having Toy "XY" that they saw in a certain television advertising.
Television advertising is always a manipulation and deceive of the viewer to some extent.
Adults and adolescents are able to see past the appealing aspects of the product being advertised, young kids however lack that ability to judge and are thus bombarded with information that they can't properly comprehend.
A child viewing for example an advert for popsicles in rainbow colours will want these popsicles just for their colour, while adults and adolescents will be able to tell that the rainbow popsicles will taste like any other popsicle of the same flavor.
I believe that television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed because of the negative effects it can have on the child.
While watching tv young children are exposed to advertising directed towards them.
Should these adds be allowed?
I do not think that it really matters since children that young do not watch a lot of tv.
On the other hand young children might be more influenced by television advertising than adults.
For me television adds are annoying and have always been so.
I barely watch tv and don't think that tv adds influenced me at any time.
We don't want to pay for our tv programms and they have to earn money somehow.
It might even be a good preparation for the kids for their future life, during wich they will be confronted with loads of adds and will therfore need to keep distance.
If you think television adds are bad for your child, just don't let it watch tv, what it doesn't know, it doesn't miss.
There are many other things to be discoverd.
Nowadays watching Tv is normal.Every child, also at an young age, is watching Tv.When they watching series or film which ar made for kids the topic of the media is made for kids and there are no points why theire shouldnt be allowed to watch them.
Between series or Movieparts there normaly are breakes for advertising.In the afternoon and in the evening there are adds for every type of products.
At some "Sender" there are no breaks for advertising.
An example for that is "KiKa".
Threre are no breakes,not even for something like puppy and so on.
I think this is because Kids could be influenced easily by the clever marketing of the comanies.
For Kids it is very importent to have an "peaceful" Childhood which is not influenced by adds.When young Kids see a lot of advertisments maybe they want to have all these "cool things from the TV" and then they are never happy with what they own.
"TV-Sender" like Kika choose the right why for making TV for Kids but the mayority of the "TV-Sender" is presentinng advertisments all the time and for these its important to ssend adds so it must be allowed.
The responsebility is by the parents for looking after their children and what they do or watch.
Televison advertising directed toward young children schould not be allowed, is the thema of this essay.
So why shouldn't it be allowed, whats wrong about that?
Agreeing or Disagreeing?
The problem is that kids are really easy believing and also easy to 'beinflussen'.
Next negativ part is about generaly watching TV in young age, the kids are sitting in front of the desktop and don't have to have own ideas or don't even have to play somthing.
The TV has something really magnificant, even for older persons.
Altough there are negativ parts, there are as well many good parts, if there is Televison advertising directed toward kid.
Shows which learn you words or things about animals can be a great oppertunity for the kids to learn by themself even they haven't been yet to elementary school.
When kids see things on the TV and choose that they want for exampel the toy what's wrong about?
Also you can't have to be in fear that your kid will hurt him because he/she is savely on the sofa.
In my oppinion it should not be allowed because i think that these kids shows aren't what the kids will help in further live.
They should have own ideas and should chose by themselfs what they like and what not.
I agree on the statement.
There are so many overweight kids as never before.
Also a negativ 'Auskirkung' from watchin TV.
The question if television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed is very complicated because it may influence what young children think and learn in their early years and this could change them for the rest of their lives.
There is no doubt that it isn´t that good for young children to watch TV because they can get sick or they only want to do this all day long.
But in some cases it´s very good and helps to develop the child and but it on a better way for his future.
I think that the programm/channel which the children watch is important because if they watch somethign like Spongebob, Firefighter Sam or other series and films from this category it could have a bad influence on them because there is no real content int this type of movies and it is only funny and for any form of education.
But on the other hand there are documentarys on BBC or National Geo.
about for example wild animals from Afirca, Asia or there are documentarys about the history of all live on the earth and this is a good type of Tv-program for the childs because they learn something about the earth and the history and may can think by themselves about the earth and maybe they start early to think about how to deal with todays world problems like clima change or bad enviormental behaviour so they can maybe influence it better.
But as a counter to this argument you can say that most of the children are to young to understand it right and the only important thing for them is to watch TV but personally I don´t think so because many young children are very smart and some of them can  think about complex task like adults.
So I have no sided opinion about this because i think it depends first on the childs which watch TV and also how they use this informations given to them from the documentarys.
The next important point are the adults which mostly choose the program for their child because they can direct the development of their child to a better direction by choosing the right program for their child.
But if I had to choose one side I would say that when you have the right program their is no porblem wiht this question.
Advertisement has become a debated tobic in our modern society, most specificly in the world of television.
Advertisetments inspire people from all ages to buy a product, which they sometimes dont even need.
Especially children are easy to be manipulated by advertisements.
The question is, should Television advertising directed toward young children be prohibited?
In this essay i will list the pro and cons and come to a rational conclusion.
For a start, children in the US and all over the world spend a lot of time in front of their televisions, watching their shows.
Once in a while, the show stops, and some loud advertisements fill the room with an annoying sound.
Children go to their parents, and scream about new toys they have been seeing in the television.
That is a problem, because most of the children are not capable to understand that they are just tricked into buying some cheap toys.
So the children are manipulated by the brainwashing advertisements to spend money.
On the other hand, how are TV studios which air a children show supposed to earn money?
Or creators of kids Shows or movies?
That would damage the whole television industry, because children entertainment makes up a big part of this business.
In conclusion, although it is cruel to manipulate children, i must say that it wouldnt work to ban television advertisments, because it would create great finincial losses for different participants.
We live in a world, in which we can not live without the newest technology.
You will find it everywhere
iPods, iPhones, Tv's and more.
People started reading books on their iPads (or iBooks) they are not reading real books anymore.
In a few years everything will change.
The point is, that children do not know, whats right or wrong.
With advertising they can change childrens mind and their opinion wouldnt be right or honest.
What the children see on television seems right for them.
In the other hand the children can lern in the age of 2-5 if they want to like something or not.
I defenetly agree with the statement on top of the page.
I think it is not right to direct advertising to young children, because they can not seperate, which part in the advertising is true and which one is not correct and the people of the industry only mentioned it, to make the product more interesting for the user.
I think, most of the advertising, which is directed to young children, belongs to toys or other things to play with.
But these things costs money and the children don´t pay for them by themselfes, because they do not earn any money and in the age of two to five they don´t even got pocket money.
The parents would pay the toy, so they have to agree with it.
Even if the kids are older than five and get pocket money of their parents, I think it´s not fair to manipulate them just because the toy industry wants to earn more money.
Many toys are really expensive and sometimes they aren´t as good as the advertising promised.
In that case the children could be sad and also they lost their money on a toy, which is not that, what they wanted.
The innovation of new products is really fast.
There are coming more and more toys and kids can´t seperate between those, which are really good and will last you forever and the ones, which are not good.
So they always want to have everything and because their parents wont buy it for them they will have an arguement.
Because of my arguments I agree with the statement.
In the following essay I will give you arguments for and against television advertising.
It is an controversial theme because it directed toward young children between two and five.
In the german tv for example are a lot of advertisings for alcohol, cigarettes or even sex websites.
And the time when the advertisings are in the tv aren´t at night.
The whole long day you can see things like that.
These aren´t the right pictures for a young child.
As well there are trailer for films or series who are dangerous and children aren´t old enough for films of this types.
For example the children see blood and can´t handle with these pictures.
They are afraid of this and maybe can´t sleep anymore.
But it is difficult because young children nearly only watch tv shows for children and there aren´t any advertisings who aren´t for their age.
As well it´s possible that they don´t understand the advertisings for alcohol and things like that.
So it isn´t a problem that young children watch television advertisings.
I think the most important point is that young children only watch tv shows for kids so they don´t see any kind of television advertisings who aren´t for their age.
So it isn´t necessary not to allow it.
There are many advertisements in television, therefore the ads are for every age group.
Some of them are specialized towards adults, some for teenagers and others for little kids.
The problem with these advertisements is, that the little kids are often fascinated by the big amounts of advertisements so they always want to watch more and have the things which are shown in the adverts.
That is one of the biggest problems with modern Television advertisements.
The little kids are building up a kind of addiction to the TV, although they're not in the age to understand and fully know what's happening in the advertisements yet.
On the other side most of the parents aren't even allowing such little kids to watch TV for so long.
Most of the kids are only allowed to watch one episode of ''Teletubbies'' or ''Sandmann'' in their free-time so they don't even encounter advertisements, which try to get the kids attention.
On the other hand many parents, mostly in socially lower parts of the society, do not really care what their kids are doing all over the day so the kids turn on the TV and watch it all day until they encounter advertisements.
After that they want all the new things shown to them in the adverts and if the parents are willing they buy all the stuff the kids wish for themselves.
As you can see there are always two sides of the medal, but as a responsible parent, whom most hopefully are, the kids don't even come close to the advertisements until they're at an age where they understand everything in TV and know that it isn't always real what is shown there.
So in my opinion there is no need to shut down the advertisements directed to children because it's in the parents interest to do their prarenting right.
When young children see things they can´t think about it in an abstractly way.
They take it as a true statement.
So it would be the same, when they see a television advertising.
Surely there have to be positive aspects.
For example the point that they learn early to decide what is right and what is only made for advertisings.
Their parents could and of course should help them by learning it.
All in all it is the excercise of parents to take care for their children.
Commercial creator try to show prducts as good as possible.
It is like the zine at supermarkets at the end.
Children are the best chance for advertising creator to sell new products.
On top of this no mother or father could say "No!
", when ´their children want to have something and look to them with their big blue eyes.
so you can´t say wheather it is true or fals to show television advertising to kids.
Of course when you show ut, it have to be the right advertising , which is "good" for they age.
The topic bring an other topic with it, the question how long children from age two to five should sit in front of television.
Television and expecially advertising show a picture of life children don´t know how it´s really is.
When they sitting all days the whole day on television they have no time to go outside.
They can´t explore the wourld and get own experiences.
To put it into a nutshell I would say that it is better to show children aged two to five as less as possible of television advertisings.
I think it is okay to show children programmes or show in television, but when thier is an advertising break they should go outside, so that they can learn early in their lifes to make breaks and find out that their are a lot of ohter things to meet next to the television.
Nowadays, there are a lot of choices on what you want to  watch at TV.
Especially children love watching it, but of course the channels don`t only show movies or documentaries.
More and more there is a lot of commercials and advertising between two programs.
I can say about myself that I know many advertising quotes from different companies, and for me they`re easy to remember.
Young children may be more influenced by commercials than older people, so the question is wether television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I agree with this statement because in my opinion it`s a good idea not to show TV ads for children younger than five years, or maybe even older (e.g.
until seven years).
Most children like everything they`ve seen at TV and want their parents to buy it for them.
But mostly after a month, it`s broken or not interesting anymore, and they want to have something new.
I think this is just a waste of money.
The problem is, when everybody has this special thing and only few kids not, they feel sad or seperated from the others.
But of course this is the strategy of the advertisement industry, and they gain a lot of money with things like this.
If something should change, for me it`s important that the parents do a step and "save" their children from the mighty industry.
To put it in a nutshell, I think there is no chance to forbid TV advertisings because of human rights relating to expression of opinion.
This essay deals with the following statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
Young children from the ages of two to five are not as much able to think in a logic way as older children, teenager or grown ups are.
They just started understanding the world by learning how to talk, walk, eat and think.
So it is a matter of course that they are not able to find the difference between the world they can see with their own eyes and the world they can see through the television, tablets, mobile phones or other electric devices.
For someone who just started to see things clearly, everything must be real.
So, the people in the television must be as real as the people arround them.
Television advertisements want to make us feel as if we truly needed their product.
To cause such a feeling is esier the more the person who watches the advertisement believes what he or she sees.
If a commercial can make young children believe that the happy girl they can see in the television is just as happy because her mother bought her that new lego toy, they will surely ask their mother to buy them such a toy as well so they could be as happy as the girl they saw in the advertisement.
So, the way commercials make their use of a childs natural naivity is a pro argument for forbiting television advertising towards them.
But what if a young child never saw a television advertisement?
What if the little girl who wanted that lego toy so badly had never felt the sadness after she bought it and the world did not suddenly change into a perfect place?
How can a child learn to take care of itself and not to believe everything they are told, if you never let them be disappointed.
Though a little child will go through some disappointments when it sees, that even the nice lady in the commercial, even the little girl in the television lied at them when they said that this lego toy would make their world a perfect place, and when they bought it, it actually didn´t.
But these experiences are important, so later they will have learned not to believe everything and to think themselves.
Television advertising is a medium, that can be used to manipulate people.
For example if a product is presented as a speial deal, so you get 2 for the price of 1, a lot of people will buy this.
A simple explenation for this is, that people think that they make a good deal and buy lots of it just to save money.
In reality the company selling the products is just profiting of the whole situation and the people buying the things are loosing their money.
Now the problem with children is, that they don't have a lot of experience and are there for more manipulative.
If a girl sees a commercial for "Pink Fluffy Unicorn", that is sprinkled in glitter and covered in light rays, then the kid feels attracted to it.
Or if a boy sees the new "RC Speed Car" he will ask his parents to buy it for him.
The parents loose more and more control over what their children are watching due to the rapid technology enhancements.
Children learn earlier and faster than ever before to use electronic devices and may also find a way to use dad's creditcard to buy things online.
These payments often aren't refunded and therefor a problem for the family.
The rude part of the whole thing are the companies producing these ads.
They are looking for children, which beg their parents for a new toy.
And if a todler accidentally buys something of the internet that costs much, the companies simply don't care because the only thing they see is profit.
My general oppinion is, that companies still should be able to do ads specifically for children, but its not okay to just gain from their misshappenings.
Two young kids are sitting on the couch and watching TV.
The mother of the children is cooking meal in the kitchen.
One second later the kids are running into the kitchen and shouting: ´Mum!
Mum!
Mum please!
Can we have the new fantastic robot who can clean our rooms and brushes our teeths?`.
When we talk about television advertising we think at boring and wasted time between our great movie or series, but in reality television advertising is a psyche manupulation.
Especially for young children who trust mostly everything and everyone.
A study is saying that people connect for example with coca cola only the things like santa claus or the cola truck and this only because of the cola advertising everywhere.
This makes clear that also when we do not know advertising has a huge influence of everyone.
Especially young children who trust only at the best seeing the advertising and will trust it.
They think that everything the advertising is saying is true.
They do not have the education to see the wrong sides of the advertising like the most of the people.
There is something good at the television advertising.
The first thing is that the children learn from their parents that they do not can trust everything.
The second thing is that when the advertising would say the truth it would be a nice way to tell their parents what they would like to have to birthday or what they wish from santa claus.
Television advertising is good for factorys and (unternehmer) to sell their products etc.
It is a important part of the economy of the world.
I think television advertising do not need to be not allowed (verboten), but maybe some rules for it would be better like saying the truth.
When television advertising directed toward young children because of their level and education than also all the other television advertising need to be (verboten).
Because in every age are stupid people who trust the advertising.
No matter how silly they are.
And the young children have lessly theit parents who will bring them on the right way.
the time is so short..
When it comes to advertising a lot of companies are very creative.
Especially the ones that are directed toward young children.
Those usually sell toys, clothes or food which has fun looking logos and mascots.
Nowadays a lot of children from the age two to five are being at home left with their nannies or simply don't get enough of distraction or playtime with their parents.
An evident soloution for them is television.
Television is very popular among youger children, they have their favorite tv-shows or cartoons and they have their favorite characters right there on the screen.
But most of the time advertisements are running.
And they are indeed very convincing and seducing for the youngers.
Those advertisements have everything in them what a child could dream of.
First and foremost we have the product that is tried to be selled, let's take a simple toy for an example now.
This toy is now presented by a child (or a group) their age.
So already now our kid will feel a connection.
Secondly the way it is presented is the main catcher.
The toy seems to be the reason for all that fun on the screen, for all the kids laughing and jumping around, having a good time alltogether.
We will find a lot of bright and vivid colors in the ad, fun music playing in the background, anything a child could wish for.
All those placed and intended tricks receive a positive ressonance from the young audience.
Finally it shouldn't be very surprising if your child is going crazy over a toy in the store.
Personally I feel like this shouldn't be that big of a problem, since the kids themselves are anyways not able to purchase anything alone without the parents.
The parents on the other hand are left to be a bit strict and say no to their childrens wishes.
And eventually if the child gets a toy he saw on TV it will make him appreciate it even more, knowing that it is a more special kind of toy.
Should be not allowed are very strong words.
In my opinion its impossible to prohibit television advertising for children.
Its in the responsibility from the parents.
And its the same with much other things.
The parents wants to shelter the children from every bad things.
Sometimes also advertising is bad.
Also here the parents decides how much they want to shelter their children.
But at some point of age the parents couldn't shelter the children from television advertising.
So it doesn't matter what the parent do?
No, its matter very hard.
Because its diffrent for the children if they see in the aged three everything in the advertising or with eleven.
So at the end the parents have to asked themselves: What it good for my child?
Now i wrote much about parents and their children.
But whats with a child which see every television advertising at the aged from two.
I think its have more influence then we think At first children learnd from everything something.
So they would learn for example the language from the advertising.
Also
In my opinion it's impossible to save young children from advertising in general.
If television advertising for young children should not be allowed they will see this advertising somewhere else.
This days you see advertising everywhere you go.
If you go in a supermarket with your children you will see advertising every step you go or if you go to the cinema before the film starts there will be advertising.
It's not possible to ignore it because you see it everywhere and you also get influenced by it.
And of course your children too.
So I agree with the statement that advertising for children should not be allowed but I think it's impossible to do that.
On the other hand I think that children have to learn that they can't get everything what they see in the advertising.With adults it works the same way.
We see something in the advertising and we want to buy it.
We get influenced by it because the advertising is made for catching us.
It's the same with children they see advertising which is made for them with for example plays or computer games and of course they want their parents to buy it.
But there is the point I mentioned they have to learn to get not influenced by the advertising that much and don't want to get everything they see.
The adults had to learn or have to learn the same.
So in general I think advertising is not good for nobody because you get influenced by it, the children and also the adults, but it's impossiple to not allow it because advertising is everywhere you go and especially in the internet and at the television.
Television advertising direced toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed.
On one side I agree with the statement because I think the children are still very young and have to play in the garden or at the playground.
They are at the age of two to five and I think this isn`t a age where they have to make Television advertising.The children are too young to make a decision and so they parents ahve to make the descion for them.
But maybe the children don`t want to do this they can`t say that because they are too young.If the children are always in the Televison advertsing they can`t find friends and can`t play with children in there age.
maybe they will become popular and thats to early for this age because then they will never have a normal life because they always in the television.
Also i think that children in this age don`t have to work.
Because maybe when they were older they are angry with their parents why they have allowed the television advertising.
On the other side I disagree with the statement because its the desicion of the parents and if they said my child can do this its okay.
but i think the televison directors have to talk with the parents and have to say them what thze problems are.
Also the children can only make 2 hours televison advertising because they must have enough time to spend a normal life and to go in the kindergarden or something like that.
The argument that it is bad when the children become popular isn´t good.
For example the daughter of Kim Kardishian is popular too.And she`s always in the newspapers,magazines and in the televison.
But the reason why she`s there is because her parents are famous.
She will always have a life where everyone know who she is.
She can´t do something against this.
I think the best decision would be that televison advertising should not be allowed in this young age because the children can say something against this.
they should make their own desicion when they are older and then if they want they can also make something in the television advertising.
They can live as normal children and can play with children in their age and can make things want children make in this age.
Advertising directed towards children of all ages should completly not be allowed.
Children don't have the mindset of beeing capable to judge for themselfs and are just influenced by everything they see.
So it's crutial that we can regulate what children can see and what they shoulden't be abel to see.
I think it would be good also for the parents, because if their children saw something they would want on the televison, they would go to their parents and ask them to buy them the shown item.
This can be difficult to handle for yunger parents and parents who don't know how to handle a toddler who wants something so badly that he begenas to scream without a reason and parents who arent as rich than others.
It would also diminish the advertising time an the television, who in my opinion is just rubbish and is the reason i stopped watching television.
Maybe channels would be more attractive to people because they have no advertising at all.
Toddlers in general are too small and too naive to comprehend anything that is going on, but when its something flashy and colorful they will want it.
But children who are a little bit older who comprhend already a litle bit of the whole concept of television (that you can see moving images) they could maybe already understand that they can't have it just like this and they are more influencable of all thos advertisinigs, the reason is they can't have any of this bit they want it very badly.
It`s definitely okay to have advertising directed toward young children in television.
On one hand it`s something clever, made by the industries.
They want to attract children as soon as possible to get caught by there advertisements.
But on the other hand children get caught by multimedia anyway.
I know quite a lot children in the age of 3 years whose birthday present is an iPad so they can play games on it.
But then I find it even more irresponsable to leave his child alone with an iPad than letting him or her watch a spot about barbie dolls in the televison.
Most of the children in our times don`t play with Playmobile, Lego or dolls anymore so I don`t guess that advertisements about toys will influence them badly.
I rather think that it`s a good thing to show the other possiblities about "playing".
So that they can see there is even more than electronical stuff to spend time with.
For sure its another periode of time we`re living in and its mostly based on multimedia but is that a reason for keeping children away from real toys?
I don`t guess so.
For that reason a don`t agree with the statement above because I think that there are even more dangerous things than advertisments for children.
It`s just a reminder of the real things children should actually play with and in my opinion these things aren´t computers, iPads, mobile phones or anything like that.
For sure these advertisements are presented in multimedia as well but I think it`s rather okay to let children watch some TV than letting them explore the whole internet by the use of those already named things.
A big problem in our social life is television advertising.
Many politicians critc that television advertising manipulate the children to buy something they have watched in the TV.
I agree with the statement for the following reasons.
A main advantage is, that the children do not want to buy new toys, because they do not know which toys exist.
They are not able to ask their parents, which new toys the store sales.
Furthermore, the television advertising tries to manipulate the children with the new toys and the shining colours.
The makers always invent new statements to buy something.
Nowadays the children are not able to see the advertising, because they see it everywhere.
You can't intend your child to watch TV.
When you are a child you just have to watch the cartoons.
But, today this is very difficult, after every cartoon follows some Television advertising.
Therefore so many children watch the advertising.
A other adventage is, that it isn't very nice to use the children, that the parents buy something.
On the other hand, the children could learn some new words.
In a advertising they use many useful English words.
At second, they see how the world is, which toys exist, what they can do with them.
It is a good measure to rise up our economie.
When the children in other coutntrys watch them as well, you could expand your issues.
In conclusion, in my opinion it should not be allowed to direct toward young childrens.
The children should be able to watch TV without advertising.
In today's word in our society everybody is in front of a screen every day.
Even young children.
In television there is even adversiting that is directed toward these young children.
In this essay I am going to talk about whether this should be allowed or not by mentionning manipulation, the responsibility of parents and people producing these advertisings.
Firstly, I think that it is not ethic to try to manipulate little children.
They cannot even think for themselves and that is why it should not be allowed.
To avoid this manipulation, the kids' parents should not let their children watch these advertisings.
It is the job of the parents to look after their two to five years old children.
So, actually the advertising should be allowed, because the parends shouls simply have control over how much advertising their child is watching and if it is not too much, it is not that big of a deal.
Finally, it is the job of certain people to produce the advertisings.
Their goal is to get the children to want what they are advertising about and there is nothing wrong about this.
How could they otherwise make the children want the toys they want to sell?
So this is another point why advertisings directed toward young children should remain allowed.
To sum up, there is something wrong about manipulate little kids, but finally their parents should be able to control how much advertising is seen by their children and people trying to sell children toys should be able to get to the children by television advertising, so I think that it should stay allowed.
First we have to take a look on the positive aspects of television advertisements, if a channel shows more advertisements they get more money and if they have more money that can easily result in a  better product.
If the product of the channel is better the ratings grow bigger and they can take more money for advertisements and they can expand or something like that.
So first of all it is quite good for the television channel but that`s the only positive aspect that i can see at all.
I think that young children can`t guess which pictures in the television programm are realistic and which are certainly not.
And also if the product, which is shown in the commercial is even good for them and get`s them something in the end or if it is just a waste of money or time.
Also they get a wish that maybe even if theire parents want to, can`t fullfill, or maybe get`s them into financial trouble.
Because the problem is that little children can`t handle and don`t know the worth that money has.
They follow the advertisement because it speaks directly to them and they don`t know that everybody only wants the best for them.
Also it gets more difficult for the parents or other people to raise the children because they got certain wishes that are shown in the tv.
But in my opinion the worst point of them all is that small children are moved and pushed to become consumers and spend their, or their parents money on products they have no idea of.
I think that it is wrong to say that this type of tv should be forbidden at all.
I think it has to be taken more liberal and parents shouldn`t let their kids watch tv and advertisements at that young age, even if that is far more difficult to look up if they really do but it is the better way in my opinion, but I would also say that I dislike this kind of entertainment or tv programm.
Nowadays almost every household owns a television and everyone likes watching television.
Moreover television has become such a big part of our life that many families even eat whilst watchig television.
So should little children be protected from advertising?
There are some good reasons to forbid television advertising directed towards children.
Children are easier manipulated by advertising than adults, for they don't realise that advertising tries to manipulate them.
Also recent surveys show that advertising sometimes misleads into perceiving fastfood and alike as something that's somehow healthy or at least not very unhealthy.
That of course has desastrous effects like raising the already high obesity rate of todays population.
You might argue that even with advertising towards young children forbidden there's nevertheless lots of bad influences on TV.
Every show has times when parents wish taht it wouldn't portray things as good even though they're quite bad for you.
And it's not only TV that gives you wrong impressions but also "normal" advertising where products are often praised as healthy, like fruit yoghurt that more than often doesn't even contains fruit but rather some chemicl flavor plus loads of sugar.
So is it necessary or helpful to ban advertising for children on TV?
It might be because in many childrens lifes television plays a big role, but trusting the parents, to parent their child, seems to be the better method.
Especially since it's bad for little children anyways to spend their entire days in fron of a TV.
Television advertising always was a controversial theme.
Even more so when directed at small children.
Is it okay for companies to aim at children as young as  two to five with their advertisement?
The first point to be raised on the pro side is that it depends on the product advertised.
Child-friendly toys such as puppets shouldn't be a problem.
Also, it is probably safe to say that the advertisement is less directed to the child itself but more to the parents, since they are the ones to buy it.
And a two years-old child probably won't even understand what they say in the advertisement.
To be said against that is that, while it sure depends on the product advertised, it also depends on the way the product is advertised.
There surely are some child-unfriendly ways to show your product on television.
Also the point about the advertisement more being directed at the parents isn't completely waterproof.
A child that sees something it wants on television - and just visually seeing it is enough there - can to a large extend take an impact on it's parents when deciding wether or not to buy it.
Also, just generally, children at such a young age just shouldn't already be confronted with potentially manipulating advertisement.
But then again, one could argue that it is up to the parents to keep their children away from the TV if they want to prevent that.
To my own opinion, I'm generally against too much advertising on TV, which is why I stay away from it as much as I can.
Therefore I say yes, advertising directed toward young children should be illegal.
At least very manipulating advertisement.
Or manipulating advertisement in general.
I especially don't see the point that the parents should keep their children away from the TV.
Why can there even be something that you have to protect your child from in television (before 10pm - or on supposedly child-friendly programs)?
In my opinion that just doesn't fit into a modern society.
The question is if it shouldn´t be allowed to show advertising to young children in television.
I personally disagree with that, but there are of course statements for pro and contra in every argumentation.
People who say that it shouldn´t be allowed always mention that this is a trick used by producers to lure the children.
Young children are often naive and listen to things they hear in television.
They are easily impressed by commercials with the result that they want to buy toys or other things shown there.
Often the parents don´t allow it what makes the children scream and cry if they are disappointed.
That destroys the bond between parents and children.
Furthermore it is possible that they see the advertising also at other locations, for example at a friends house or somewhere else.
And today there is also the internet a problem where children are able to see everything.
As already said children want to buy the things they see in the advertising and do a lot to get them.
If parents allow that after long discussions they are obviously the ones who gave up which makes it their fault that they paid money for useless things.
Parents know that this things are usually very expensive and useless.
But for parents it´s their duty to teach and inform their children.
Finally you can say that there are arguments for and against advertising like this which makes it harder to decide, but I will stay with my opinion from the beginning that I disagree with the presented statement.
If we look at it from a companies point of view: They want to sell a product for children aged between two and five of course they want their product to be known, so they do advertising.
If the advertising is especially directed toward the children it may have a bigger selling effect because if you explain it in an easy way: child sees it, child likes it, child wants it.
Children are easy to manipulate because they are still kind of naive.
Where as if you create an advertising of a product for children but the advertising is directed toward their parents it's much more difficult to convince the parents to buy this product for their children.
Because the parents are adults and they often have to see a reason behind the things they buy.
So the advertising would have to include way more information and sense.
If we look at it from a parents ponit of view: Maybe they don't want their children to see those advertising because afterwards they would have to hear all day long that their child talking about it.
The parents would maybe like to have the advertising directed toward them because like that they get the information they want and they can afterwards tell their child about it.
But if we now think of the point that it should not be allowed which means that it is forbidden to even create an advertising directed toward children, I would say that's to intense because the child won't take any harm of the advertising.
So I think it should be allowed because if a child watches TV, advertising is a huge part of it and maybe the advertising which is especially created for them is the only interesting thing.
Television advertising for young children should not be allowed... or should it?
I don't think it should, because in this age you can influence children very easily.
Sure, for the market and the economy that's a great thing, but from an other point of view, it's cruel to use the natural believe in good things children have for getting more money.
Big shops try to influence children with loud sonds, flashy lights and exited voices, so they really want to have this new toy, chocolate or whatever is in the advertising, because it seems to be so much fun on television.
That's not fair, because children this young often can't think in a logical way about the products, they just see how amazing it's claimed to be and they want it.
The people who are selling this products get rich that way, but the familys if the children often lose a lot of money, because most of the time these products are not cheap.
Children are not old enough, and they often don't know enough, to tell the difference between good and bad.
The flashy lights on TV impress them so they think the things they see have to be good.
I know I'm repeating what I just said all the time, but that's just because I dont know a lot this topic.
I thought you want to test my english knowledge and not my point of view on TV advertising, I expected questions like "where do you get your knowledege from?"
or "how often do you use to speak english?"
I'm not trying to be disrespectful here, this is just me talking (writing) a little bit of english for you to know I can speak this language, even if I never really thought about television advertising directed toward young children.
Should I talk a little bit about where I get my knowledge from?
I know I should not but I've still got four minutes left so....
I watch a lot of english videos an youtube, most of the videos I watch are about guitars or cars, because those are the things I love and I'm interested in.
I'm a guitarist myself so I like to gain my skills on youtube.
Youtubers like "Music Is Win" or "Simon Smith" are really good for this case.
And I talk to english people on the internet a lot.
Somebody says that television advertising which is directed toward young children between two and five years old should not be allowed.
But it is really so bad?
A toys advertising is possible.
They can show their parents want they for christmas or for their birthday.
The young children will also learn something from the advertising like how to use the toys.
A advertising is also good between a cartoon for a break.
But the Televison advertising isn't a good thing for young children.
Children shouldn't watch television with this age.They can be addicted to TV later and will not play anymore with the dolls and toys.
They also will not concentrate what is going on when their only staring in the television.
The problem is also that televisions damage the eyes from the children, because they are still very young and their eyes are still growing up.
The children should not be victims for the advertising market.
The children are to young to know that the elder poeple use their low knowledge for their success.
They also use advertising like this to influence the children to make their parents buy these products.
I agree with this following statement.
Because I see that the young children are vicitims from elder people who want only power over the children.
Those advertising can influence their mind and how they will think and act later.
Maybe the advertising is furious and scary.
I also think that a young child doesn't need a advertising for chose his toys or dolls.
I don't think that television advertising toward young children should be allowed.
Young children want everything that looks ,,fun".
Girls want everything that is pink and boys probably everthing with cars or dinosaurs.
And when they get it they play with it one time and then never use it again.
It's just money making for the big companies.
It's like when you go into a supermarket: all the sweet stuff is in the lower shelfs where small children can see it and THEY WANT IT.
But then; what for a difference does it make if you see television advertising when your five or fifteen?
If you think it's cool and your birthday is near you are probably going to get it.
I think the parents should be asked if television advertising should not be allowed, 'cause I don't look tely anyway.
Little children shouldn't be watching television at all.
It's not healthy and they will not learn all the important stuff they will need in life.
They should go playing with there friends.
Outside.
That would be much healthier for them and for nature.
But when children watch tely they are usually quite.
Their parents have some free or at least quite time to chill out a little.
I mean our parents are doing a major job with use as their children and they are not getting paid for it, they actually have to pay!
For nearly everything their children do, the parents have to pay in some way.
Okay, back to the topic: television advertising directed toward young children....
I don't have another argument against it and I don't think that there is a really good one FOR it.
Not out of sight of the parents.
The companies that pay for the advertising, they have arguments for it.
I mean, they somehow have to make money.
And children are the most expensive thing one can have, because unless they die before their parents, they are there all the time!
You can't just get rid of them.
Well you can, but you shouldn't.
Somebody (the children, the prison) will never forgive you.
My closing word: the parents have to decide what is best for their chidren, they are their responsebility.
The present statement represents a difficult and discussed topic as there are various opinions concerning the use of electronic devices by children.
It does not only affect television advertising but also TV in general, the use of mobiles and computers.
Many companies misuse their influence regarding the minds of young children, trying to appeal directly to the young audience.
The following essay deals with this problem and tries to give answers, whether directing towards young children between two and five years in TV-advertisement should be allowed or not.
In my opinion it is undoubtelly to say that influencing children in TV advertisement is much easier than convincing adults.
Children are expecting the TV to tell the truth.
Therefore advertising could have bad influences on the childrens minds.
Consequently it should be forbidden to abuse the weakness of those young children by trying to make them willing to get a product.
On the other hand it is up to the childrens parents to forbid their sons and daughters watching television advertising.
They are responsible for them and should not let them watch advertising.
Hence, it is a matter of education whether the children are able to be manipulated or not.
The parents have to protect their children in every situation, and not every bad influences can be forbidden.
The next argument defending the prohibition of this topic is that the advertising companies have got a duty concerning moral.
It is not fair trying to appeal to kids as it is proved that they can be manipulated easily.
In order to not let this become reality, a forbid of advertising towards young children should be compulsary.
To sum up it is undoubtelly to say that moral aspects underline the arguments against permitting it.
On the other hand the parents are responsible for their children in nearly every situation of life.
I personally think that this kind of advertising is unfortunately never going to be forbidden.
However companies should not abuse their force of manipulating young children.
An argument aigainst advertising would be that children just have no idea about what they really need and what they just want to have at this young age.
They see happy kids playing with the newest barbie in the advertising for example and want their parents to buy it.
They just get influenced by advertising too easy.
It could also be that the parents of children have not got enough money to buy their children what they want.
So when children see something in the advertising that they want to have the parents would have to explain them why they are unable to buy it to make them happy.
Espacially if all the others playing around with it in the kindergarden.
A child would be unable to understand such things in such a young age.
But in the other hand the parents could also give attention that their children do not watch the advertising in the TV or even do not let them watch TV anyway to be sure there is no problem with that.
Also the parents can see what they might buy their children and can decide what is good and bad for them.
So in my opinion advertising for young children is not really a big problem, because there are enough possibilities for the parents to make sure that they do not get influenced by that.
First the children gets early in contact with the consumer-society if they watching advertising which shows a products like playstuff, so they're learning early how to deal with this kind of advertising.
But on the other site they cant really decide which of the products is good for them or not.
That is part of the parents work.
Also the can't deal with spending and holding money, so they always want to have everything they like and this is what the companys aiming for.
But advertising dont have to presenting products olny.
It can help the parents to show the children whats wrong, like non-violence advertising.
The fact that children can't deal with money and that they cant buy themselves anything, makes the children when thay see al lot of product ads a irational feeling of how to deal with money.
So the parents have to decide which stuff is good for the children which not, so they have to fight vocaly with their children, cause they want to get all, but someone, in this case it is the parents, have to teach them right consumer-thinking.
Also the most of the time products of the advertising aren't that usefull for children in this age.
In most of the cases it's just stuff to play, but it isn't important at all.
The ads on children-channel in TV are only showing this kind of products, so at the end of the day the parents have to pay for it.
At the end u can say that the advertising itself isn't the problem.
the problem is how children gets in contact with the consumer-society.
Watching TV makes people stupid.
This common saying may contain some truth.
Especially television advertising bring people up to buy strange products as media shop shows us every day.Children in the age of two to five may not understand statements from television, yet there are some dangers which might explained why television advertising should not be allowed .
However a child could also be the door to sell different material things.
On the one hand side television advertising is good to intrduce new products to a person and for kids aged two to five it is optimal to buy toys that are used by the kids.It might prevents to buy things they are not interested in.
With Television advertising they can easily decide what they can use or not.
On the other hand side children cannot decide what they need.
In my opinion children want everything they could have and a few parents buy them, because of their love, all things they want.
Therefore it is the door to sell toys, because the parents want the best for her kids.
Another point against telivison advertising is, that a child have to learn to read and with waching TV they only sit on the couch and see some pictures.
According to a current survey television makes really stupid.
This act is not good for the education and their health too.
In contrast to this point of view we have to realize that it included also a sense of music to understand a few television advertises and they have mor imagination and creativity.
In conclusion the television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, due to the argument that the children do not need many toys or other material things to be happy.
There are a lot of other possibilities not to sit in front of the TV and to create the free time.
Television is a multimedia thing and is in all countries very popular and all childs use television advertising all day.
But is this good oder bad?
On the one hand it is good because the childs can learn early to comunicated with other people in the world and understand how possible it is to use television advertising at the day.
Otherwise it is good because you can learn how easy all things can be.
For example how easy it is to write a text on the internet or how cool it is to look things on the television and can lay in your bed.
On the other hand it is bad because it is too eary with a age from two to five.
The childs are childs and must be playing in the garden or somebody else but not use television advertising.
Therefore the childs want too early to go on the television everyday.
Otherwise for the childs (umfeld) is it not good because you do not have many real friends.
I think that the childs from age two to five should not be allowed to use television everyday because it is too early and not in all things good for the child.
All in all I can say that is it not allowed for me and for me is it not okay that so many parents allowed the childs to use television so much in there freetime.
The latest dolls, pets with fluffy fur and much more things children love are shown in advertisings on tv.
But is it really smart and ethical correct to direct television towards young kids?
On the one hand one has to admit that it is the producers' right to present their articles.
And television commercials are one of the most effective ways to do that.
Therefore it would be such a disadvantage to forbid this kind of advertisement.
On the other hand the way of presenting is very manipulative and even makes grown-ups buy things they have seen on tv.
And children are even faster attracted to things and easy to lure into something.
Therefore, seen from the parents' point of view it can be nerve wrecking to always have to discuss the need of something their children saw on tv which also can lead to a bad realtion between children and parents.
Furthermore kids should not be forced into this kind of thinking at such a young age.
Advertisings they see could lead to the attitude of wanting more and never getting enough.
In conclusion it is not responsible to allow television advertising directed toward young children.
But instead of forbidding those commercials completely you could just direct them towards the parents.
By that the producers also do not have a disadvantage.
My Essay will tell you about my opinion abot ''Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) shold be allowed.''.
I think this topic is very difficult, because it always depends on the TV-show or film they watch and the time children are spending on watching TV.
On the one handit can never be good for the future, when a child siting in front of the television, all day long.
If they are siting there the whole day it will be very bad for them, because they have to learn e.g.
social interaction.
In the age of two to five children have to lern speaking, drawing and many other things.
It is also a poor statement for those parents, who are leaving them allone in front of the TV.
Children in this age have to speak with there parents for learning to speck correctly.
In my opinion reading books (by them-self or outreading by their parents) could be much better for children, because they can create a story on there one head.
On the other hand e.g.
some Walt Disney movies can be very important for children,while watching them they are learning some important ethical ''rules''.
This ethical rules are very important for children to know for there whole life.
If parents are not abled to tell theire children this rules by life, they have to learn it in another way.
All in all my opinion is children watching television can be okay, if they aren't sitting there all day long.
Maybe a half to one hour and a half hour will be okay, but this depends on the child.
If the TV is always there instead of the parents, the child couldn't become a social person.
I think for the children outreading a book by the parents, the grandmother or anyone else will be very much better.
Even if they can not read by there own, the children will imagine the story in there head and will paint pictures on there own, this is very good for there creativity.
And if we never learn to be creative, what is the difference between us and our pets at home, or any other animal?
People have to earn money and how should people get to know something without advertisements?
Not, so they're necessary.
Young children can't defend theirself from getting affected and they can get influenced by television advertising and not everything is good for them.
If people take the service of letting their children watch TV and not have to pay attention to them they have to pay the price for it with children asking to get the stuff from the advertisements.
Young children shouldn't get intouch with comertionals that early because they can't understand that this is manipulative.
It's a good selling stragety because parents will buy the articls for the children so the keep quite and stop asking for it.
I don't agree with this statement because if people take the luxury of letting their children watch a lot television awith this young age the parents have to give something back and in this case its the advertisements.
Because I don't think they have very big longlasting consequenses, so it's not realy unheathy for them.
I think it's mostly just annoying for their parents but on my point of view it's most od the time their own fault.
Firstly one can say, that children are even influenced by their friends in kindergarden, so if everyone of your mates has a special toy, of course you would like to have it as well.
For example my kind of generation loved pokemon, and because of this trading with cards was acually very common.
So it does not matter, when they are influences anywhere.
However I believe children do not even understand everything, which is brought to them in advertisements, because their brains are not developed in a way like it is compared to an adult brain.
Furthermore espacially young children tend to become addicted faster than exampally teenagers.
In my oppinion it is not helpful for two to five aged to watch television that long, because their minds can not progress all the different impressions.
Espacially for children it is essencial to experience nature rather than just looking at screens.
Because if this generation loses the interst for nature and the amity to animals, they surely will not respect it, when they are grown up.
We are all living in a world, which lost the care of nature, because making profit and wealth became more important pastly.
At least we should care for the future of our following generations, because there is no reason of taking them all their opportunities, by just living "our" life.
To put it in a nutshell, I believe that advertisements for young aged children are not helpful and therefore should not be allowed, because they are too influencial and it is better for young children to grow up without a lot of technical supply due to them becoming adults really fast these days.
Many people have a TV at home and watch TV nearly every day.
But is watching TV good?
Experts doubt this and say, that especially television advertising towards young children in the age of two to five years old should be prohibited.
Young children are influenced by what they see, when they are young, and act like that.
It's not good  that those children watch TV that early.
If those advertsments show some  bad habits, those children might learn those and do them later in the life.
For example if violent videogames would be shown to small children, those children might have then, after some time, an agressive character.
Or if for example unhealthy food and sweets, like cookies and candys, were shown to those children, they might be influenced by that and start eating unhealthy food way too early.
But on the other hand, those chidren might find something nice on the TV and start doing it.
For example a hobby like sports or something like that.
If  good advertising is shown on TV, it won't be bad.
It isn't, that there is only bad stuff on TV.
There are many good things aswell.
Children who watch TV will learn good new stuff and do it, so prohibiting the advertising is a bad idea.
In my opinion, it depends on the advertising.
If there are nice and good things shown it is okay, but if there are bad things shown, for example violance or smoking, it's not good.
Young children learn, what they see.
The parents should be carefull of what they permit their children to see and what not to.
If the advertising would be prohibited, many people would be mad and would be against it.
Especially the television programmes, since they earn a lot of money through advertising.
In my opinion prohibiting advertising on TV is a too immense step and makes no sense.
I would rather just overwatch the advertising better and try not to show stuff, those children shouldn't see.
In the following essay I will show arguments for and against allowing advertisment for young children (aged two to five).
Not allowing young children to watch advertisings in TV is really hard for the television concerns.
This concern live from advertisments, so they need them.
IF they could not show every ad they want, the could get bankcrot and this means in the long run that will kill the television.
On the other hand it is not good for young children to be influend by advertisments in young age.
In this age childrens try to learn from thinks around them.
If this thing is advertisment, It could have a not so good effect on them.
My opinion is, that partens should watch out what they childrens look in TV.
<*_*>
Is television advertised directed toward children useful?
Children are known to learn the fastest.
That is necessary because they have to learn a lot to survive.
So as you may assume, childhood is the easiest age to influence.
So the question is if advertising toward children should be allowed or not.
Children are easy to influence, so television advertising could manipulate their growing a lot.
Advertising is a way to sell products and young children are not really capable of making good decisions, so their parents should decide for them.
But with specific advertising the children get to know products they probably want to have (like toys)  and their minds get used to buying and consuming.
This would mean that later on we would have a society of consuments, which would be great for economy but bad for the environment because of the high amount of CO2 and trash.
On the other hand, the children would have products they like and therefore they would be happier.
They would create groups of interest and socialize because they would be sharing the same good.
Advertising could help children to create an opinion and maybe to learn how to discuss, for example if they would have to convince their parents to buy a toy.
But does more stuff equal more happiness?
The children would have so much stuff they would not use.
That would be a waste of material and money and that all for a short moment of happiness.
The children should be able to socialize without needing an object.
That has been possible for so many years, why should it be different today?
In my opinion, advertising is better for the factories than it is for us, non less for young children.
As I was younger I used to have many toys and I did not play with all of them.
But I have to admit that there are some useful toys that my parents and I bought,like lego, but I do not remember seeing them in television.
I think that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it influences them to much.
In my point of view that would really create a society which is concentrated towards buying and consuming and that would harm the environment.
People would buy much more stuff that they do not need than they already do.
The only group that would really benefit from it would be the factories and similar.
When I was a young little boy, I used to watch television at home.
I had my series which I liked and enjoyed watching them.
But after an episode there often came a short period of adverts.
I hated the adverts because on my television channel they used to be very boring and not entertaining.
After some time I realised that a few of them have a persuasive way of interacting to me.
What happens when a young child gets into this propaganda?
Firstly, the adverts indeed can be a kind of propaganda.
So the problem is now that young children can be convinced pretty easily because their minds are a little bit naive.
Nevertheless, the adverts can claim something that is not true or they really could implement some lies.
In addition, the children could believe those things and start to desire products which they don't really need or they only know and need now, because the advert told them this.
Secondly, television advertising is able to change reality in the mind of childrens.
They start to believe things that can not be true and never will be true.
Moreover, this fake reality is also connected with a specific product which the producer shows to the ones who are watching.
For example the thesis of Redbull of giving wings to the one who is drinking their product.
My third point contains the thought that adverts also can be dangerous for children in a diffrent way.
Maybe the kids are forced to see sexuality and the use of drugs.
This can have bad consequences for the future or their lifestyle.
It's possible that they are even shocked and frightened by the adverts.
Maybe they can't handle the advert.
In a summary, I am against the television advertising directed toward young children.
The propaganda can contain lies, reality could turn into a fake one and in adverts there can be things, a young child should not see.
In the following text i will comment the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
First I give you some points to disagree with this statement.
Most of the children aged two to five will watch tv everyday so it does not matter if they are watching advertising made for them or not.
Furthermore it is even better that they have advertising for them instead of watching some durex advertising or something because that might hurt their brains more than the new Winnie Pooh Bear or something else.
Otherwise it is not really positive to show the children that much television because they should do something outside and not watching tv the whole time.
So the children allready watch that much tv that they should not also have some advertising which might addict them to buy something or saying their parents that they need to have this otherwise they will be bored for sure or something like this.
So it should not be the aim of the parents to let their children watch tv the whole day and if there is advertising not directed to them they will have not that much interesst to watch tv so they do not watch that much tv automaticly.
To put it in a nutshell i think that there are pretty much opinions for the advertising directed to young children and today it might be usual that young children watch tv not like twenty years ago when everyone want to go out and play football or something and furthermore it is propably not the best idea to connect the advertising to young children because they should not get addicted from tv that fast.
They should still have the chance to have a nice growing up without that much tv and playing outside or something, of course the time has changed and without electronic hardware there is no life but in the young ages you do not need this to have fun.

I bims 1 bored dude, lol.
It´s an important theme nowadays and so i would like to talk about the statement "television advertising directed toward young children should be not allowed".
I agree with the statement because television isn´t good for children with these ages.
My brothers are 8 and 13 and today i see this problems.
There are also arguments for this statement but the most children can´t live without the television.
They watch television very very often and the advertising directed toward them isn´t good.
They pass their time inside the house in front of the TV very often and don´t want to do important things like doing homework or playing outside with friends.
And they begin with 2 years to play with the smartphones of the parents, play videogames with the brothers or sisters, or they look TV and for example my brother cant live without it now and his marks in school aren´t good.
After that in television aren´t true storys.
In television are cartoons with fantasy characters and for those young children i think it´s hard to understand what´s real or unreal.
The parents should stop to place the children infront of the TV.
With watching TV in this age the children strike their plans for future.
Maybe the series with logical thinking or explaining is good for learning.
For example "Dora" is an english speaking fantasy girl and she teaches english to the children.
But many series arent good because the characters are figting in a war and so many series are drastic and the children could think that war or fighting is good and many children nowadays are playing with swars or plastic knifes and want to "kill" their friends while playing outside  and so television has also bad results.
And a last point is that only before 12 AM exist series for children from 2 to 5 and this isn´t a possible time to watch TV because they are in kindergarden or primary school.
So they have to watch the brutal series in the afternoon and i already told that this series aren´t good and should not be allowed.
Summarized i think some series should be forbidden for this young-aged children and the parents have the exercise to look for what they children do with the TV or for example in the internet too.
If that do not happen the children are starting to watch TV with 1 year and this would not have a good end.
First and foremost this essay is about advertising directed toward young children.
First there is no big problem with advertisment for young children if they are for them.
If the advertisment is about toys or learning it is okay as long as is connected with their age.
There should not be advertisements about alcohol or some thing like that.
But in contrast young children are easy to manipulate so the companiese use this to sell more products which is really bad.
Although advertisement has some freedom at TV, there should be a rule against advertising directed toward young children, because not all of them understand what is said or ment in this advertisment in such a young age.
In conclusion for companies which sell toys or candy it is a great opportunity to sell more, but i believe it is wrong if you do this.
I think it is against our moral these days.
I can not support such advertising and although I said in the biginning there is no big problem there is still a problem.
You can not forbid every single advertisement, because somehow the channel need some money, but I suppose the advertisement shown to children in this young age should be more about how they can be creativ and that learning can be fun.
Something like this can at least help the children when they grow up.
As long as the advertisement helps the children in their future I believe it is okay to direct them toward young children.
The world has changed in the last couple of years.
With the inventions of digital technology people started more and more to consume entertainment at home in front of their screens.
First, those programs, especially on television, were only for grown-ups.
But this has certainly changed.
First also teenagers consumed television, then children under ten.
In the last few years companies discovered that parents that don't know how to entertain their children just let them watch TV.
For every age there is also advertising in television to gain money.
But is this legit for children under five years?
First of all, for creating TV shows and films production is very expensive.
If people want their children being able to watch TV for their age, companies have to gain money to produce it.
Advertising is the only way to gain money from showing their productions on TV.
Adults won't watch those shows, only their small children will, so it's logic that ads will also address children.
On the other hand it's way to early for children to spend time in front of a TV screen.
They get manipulated and in this age they can't know what's right or wrong.
For companies it's easy to trim those children to buy their products by pretending this to be the best product on the market.
Also those companies do not care what is good or what is bad for small children, they only focus on what gives them the highest profit.
For example "Kinder Schokolade" is a product almost every child likes, but it's very unhealthy and it has a lot of sugar in it.
For me it is clear that advertising for small children should not be allowed because children can't differentiate between wrong and right.
I am shocked that parents just put their children in front of a TV screen and don't really care about them.
Companies just make use of this disability of parents what I surely don't support, although there is much money around in this market section.
In a few years this could lead to a big problem because teenagers then won't know the real world and how to "survive" in it.
In the following essay, I am going to write about whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
First of all, the children get used to seeing advertisements at a very young age since such advertising is allowed.
This is introducing them to a society that is all about consuming things which are probably not even necessary.
So what if these commercials are shown to innocent children, who are not able to think about the pros and cons of buying a certain product?
The children are manipulated by advertisements.
But adults are too.
Additionally, they are actually able to buy advertised things.
So is advertising directed toward adults even worse?
To sum it up, I would say that advertisements manipulate everyone but that is not necessarily a bad thing because it is a huge part of economy.
and since the children's parents are the ones, who buy their kids the toys, they should be responsible for the advertisements, the child sees, as well.
If the parents do not want their child to watch certain advertising they have to switch off the TV themselves.
The law should not be blamed fo that.
First of all I think that television advertising should not even being allowed directed to adults.
I think it is a critical thing because of the fact that there are people with problems like lack of money or lack of money because of an illness where you want to buy more and more eventhough you do not have the money for it.
Even if the advertisement is directed to children in the age of two to five it can be possible that there are adults who want to buy it for their children because they think it is especially for them and it is proofed to make them happy.
But the problem is that like I mentioned there are adults who do not have the money and it leads them into money problems.
Otherwise I think it is mostly acceptable that some advertising is directed to children in this age especially in christamas or easter time.
It is easier for the parents to choose the presents for their children when they see some toys in advertisements and it is presented for them what you can do with it.
Also the parents can watch the advertisement too and they can give their statement if it is good or bad for their child or children.
In this case the advertising takes away the parents job of finding the right present because the children find their wish in television.
But also it should be mentioned that there are not only adults who can not handle with money.
Children are known therefore that they can not handle with money because they mostly spent every single piece on something they would like to have right away and eventhough when they save their money for a specific toy that they saw on television it does not mean that they learn the right dealing with money.
It is right that it is a good start to save the money for something specific but I think it is not good that they do not really learn to spend their money right away when they have the abilities to.
Eventhough every kind of advertising on television is important for the state and companies to get money it is still a bad thing for people who can not deal with money especially for children in a young age like two to five.
It is a good way of teaching children to save money but not the spending.
All in all I think that it should not be completly forbidden but maybe it should be used less and not that directly to the children.
In the following text I want to explain why children of the age between two to five may watch television advertising and how fast they could be addicted to them.
In my opinion children of the age two to five may watch television advertising because it influences the children not that much.
In most cases the children do not understand the meaning of the advertisment.
They only see a toy which they want and say "I want this so much mum can u buy it for me".
And so it goes all that long.
But sertent spots are not created for children this age.
If the parents controlle that their children do not watch this kind of advertising it is not bad to let them watch television.
Another point is that advertisment could be bad as well because it is controlled by the product which is presenting.
Sertant products awake the feelings of addiction and childs this age can not handle this addiction (some adults also not).
The television production desinged the advertisment very colorfull to get the attention of the children and the children react to this very easilie.
To stop this addiction might be very hard, annoying and difficult because if a child save sertant advertisment it could not be delited.
All in all I would say that advertisment in general is harmless to childs without any problems.
But some spots are not that good for children.
If their parents protect them for this kind of addicting advertisment they might be save.
In this age children should not watch that much television.
I agree with the statement because children aged 2 to 5 should not even watch TV but go outside and play.
They might be influenced by the advertisements in a bad way.
It is just money making by the advertisers.
Young children are easy to influence, these kids are not capable of making there own opinion.
Businesses can easily take advantage of them, for example they can make an advert on toys and bring it on TV.
The little ones want those toys now and parents have to buy them.
I really don't think that there are benefits when television adverts are just made for the younger ones, they can't buy things themself, so parents would haveto buy all those things, and honestly which parents buy everything they see on TV?
So the adverts should be directed toward the parents, they are the ones with the money.
I guess, parents are responsible for their children and should make enough rules, so that the kids don't get everything they see on television or the parents make rules on the limited use of the TV.
In this way the advert should't have a big influence on these young kids, it would also be a really good lesson for them, they learn, that they can't have everything they see.
So, I'm not really against the use of these adverts for young children, because the parents are the buyers.
Companys should make the adverts for both parts, parent and childern, because in the ends its the decision of the parents what their kids get and which things aren't good enough for them.
I think, parents nowdays are very picky which toys are good enough for their kids.
Toys should have a learneffect on children and parents won't buy the first thing they see on television.
So for me it's useless to make adverts just for children, the adverts should impress the parents and should show them the benefits of the advertised object.
But companys may, see that a bit different than me.
We all see it on television every single day: advertising.
Often directed at young children or teenagers.
But should advertising towards children between the age of two to five be allowed or should it be banned from TV?
First of all of course it is great that children can see products they might like on TV.
It is easier for them to find new toys which could help them develope special skills or just provide fun.
For examples they see some kind of kids music instrument on TV.
This instrument might awaken their love for music and it will have a good impact on the rest of their life and childhood.
However it is way easier to influence children than to influence their parents.
After all this advertisments are a way for mostly big companys to sell their products.
It is often found that children get excited just because the advertising for a toy or for sweets is good.
It is also clear that most of the time the children don't pay for the advertised things they see on television.
So there should not be advertising towards young children because they can not buy the product anyways.
These advertisings are just an easier way to get the parents to buy something for their small child.
The better it is advertised the more the child talks to their parents about it, so that they maybe buy the product.
Knowing that it is also a lot easier to sell products with a low quality.
Since the children do  not care or know about quality you could basically sell them anything with a good advertising strategy.
For example a toy they only have for two days which than breaks into two.
To conclude I have to say yes i agree that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed because it is just an easy way for companys to sell a product.
In the following text I want to tell you if it is right that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
At first I want to give good reasons for the statement and later against the statement.
Young children could be addicted to the television because it is a good entertainment for their.
Also they chould see another films which they should not allowed to watch.
If the parents do not care about this it is difficult to show the young kids in his later time the right direction.
But it is good that also young children are allowed to watch TV because these are a important sources for kids where they can learn and comprehend.
The Tv is more than one film.
The kids have the choice to watch what they want in this age.
Surely, there are silly films too because you can say in slang these films make the kids silly.
It isn't really exactly this.
But you can bring kids with films in a different way and that's let them make bad things.
That is why parents should care about what their kids are watching.
If they did everything is okay and it is  even a succes for the young children.
I disagree with the statement.
The fact that kids in this age (two to five) are very easy to manipulate by everything makes it very hard to discuss about if advertising should be shown to kids in this age.
I agree with the statement; I don't think advertising should be allowed to be shown to kids in this age.
First of all as I already said kids in this age are easy to manipulate which makes kids just a tool for the companies to get the money from the parents.
The children see things in the TV and start crying about how bad they want to own this toy.
On the other hand its good to show that there are oppurtunities in which the parents could invest.
Not every advertising which is shown on the TV towards children (two to five years old) is manipulative and some are maybe helpful or may cause a better influence on the child.
But in generel the companies don't seem to care at all what people buy or how healthy and good for kids it is, all they see is the money they make by showing TV advertising towards kids this age.
Most of those advertisings are just really colorful and full of sounds and jingles which stuck in the heads of children.
I don't really think it may cause damage for kids to watch those kind of advertisings but I'm not truly of the opinion that its helping in any way too.
I remember when I was child I always wanted the big toys to be mine no matter how expensive they were and I knew I never had to pay for them in any way because I knew my parents would get maybe get me them.
Most of the time I didn't get them but sometimes it really helped and they got me those toys I wanted.
And all of this just because I saw loud and colorful advertisings which showed toys or other stuff which wasn't that good as expected in real life then.
Sometimes I was even a little bit disappointed by the toys I got then.
The advertisings mostly just come up with new stuff every year e.g.
for christmas.
Every year the same: 2 moths before christmas time starts they keep showing advertisings towards children in the age of two to five.
And basically its the same toy they were showing 4 years ago just a little bit different.
Basically there is no real problem with showing advertising to children of this age but I just don't seem to like it somehow because I think its a "trap" which snaps every year again.
And its not only about the Christmas time, is it?No, its about the whole year.
Everyday there are hours of advertising and hours of the shown advertisinge towards kids.
Children who are allowed to watch e.g.
2 hours of TV a day always come across advertising.
Like theres no real chance to get around it.
In conclusion I can say that I don't thinks TV advertising should be shown towards kids of this age but in fact it doesn't matter at all because there will always be advertising which is shown towards children and there will always be other ways then TV for example Radio or Newspapers.
Although, in my opinion they shouldn't be allowed to present advertising for kids in the age of two to five.
Should television advertising directed to young children be banned?
On the one hand it is good for the industries to present their products in all ages.
It will stay in the brain and also things for older people are known years later.
If this is banned they does not sell much as possible to pay the workers.
But young children can not control their brain as much as possible to know what is good and what is needed.
So they are easy to quote as a buyer.
But they can not buy it because they are too young.
So they asks their parents to bring it.
The problem is that parents have  an other seeing to this because they see the real function wich is not much as good as the one from the advertisement.
So they stay strong and does not buy it.
Or they have not the money to make their child happy.
So the children gets angry and "hates" their parents for the next time.
This happends only because of the advertisement.
Many advertisements can inspirate and the parents can build their one game with the children.
Others can buy it if they want.
So everybody can do what he wants.
But many games are too complex to create by their own.
Or the advertisement shows an animated film that doe not complain with the real one.
So it looks like a very nice game but it is not.
To put it in a nutshell television advertisements for children are often not good for the familys but all kinds of children adversising can not be banned because of the industries wich does not can stay without their advertisement.
So the parents have to handle it with the right words and ore make their children happy with a present.
Television advertising belongs to our daily life.
Everytime we are watching our favourite show it gets interrupted by various commercials about new hair products or the newest car we could buy.
In those commercials the target groups are mostly adults between the age of 18-60+.
But what about advertising directed toward young children?
Should it be allowed?
The probably most obvious advantage for advertising toward young children would be that companies that sell products for children in that age could directly promote their products to their target group.
And with that hopefully have an increase in their revenue.
From a child point of view, it can be interessting for them to see what new toys and other items are new on the market.
And with that it would be easier for parents to know what kind of product their child likes.
However, what speaks strongly against advertising toward young children is that they would already be influenced in buying products at such a young age.
At the same time young children do not have the ability yet to realize how commericals influences them.
In addition, from a psychologial point of view, we do not know how advertising can affect a childs way of thinking.
Furthermore, some parents might not have the financial ability to buy the newest toys for their children.
In conclusion I think that adversting directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Children should not already be influenced by advertising at such a young age.
They should be able to enjoy watching television without interruption.
In the course of this study, I was asked about my opinion on the statement that advertisements on television tailored towards children between the ages of two and five should not be allowed.
I will form an opinion at the end of this essay after carefully evaluating the arguments and counter arguments.
On the one hand, companies with a demographic between the ages of two and five should be allowed to advertise to those children since those are the people they want to sell their products to.
Telivision is the perfect medium for this because of channels specifically made for that age group and the ability to produce especially exciting advertisements utilizing both audio and video.
On the other hand, children that age are very easy to manipulate making this practise morally questionable since the children can not see through obvious marketing ploys at that age.
Also, the children are not the ones spending money - It is the parents.
And since, as I said, the children will fall for advertisements much easier, the companies are basically just exploiting an easy way to get peoples money; Instead of marketing to the harder to convince parents directly they market to them through a proxy - their children.
To conclude, I have to say that I agree with the statement that TV advertisements directed to children should be disallowed.
The children simply can not make informed descisions on potential purchases yet and can be tricked to easily.
Of course in the end it is still the parents descision but once the child wants something the parent will likely try to appease it by making the purchase, especially if the child is that young.
I will talk about the question if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
On the one hand it is very important for the success of firms to have advertisment on TV because you can reach the most people.
It is clear that they need advertisment for younger people too because there are a lot of products for younger people.
Also it is very important because there are TV shows for children and it makes no scence to show products for older people in the advertisment between the shows.
No one will pay for older people advertisment between younger people Tv shows.
On the other hand it is not good because it is easy to impress younger people and so they want to have what the saw in TV.
The manipulate the young children because they can not understand that this is only advertisment.
Maybe the product is non-scences but in the advertisment it looks very good and maybe funny when it is something to play with.
All in all I think that advertisment for young children should be allowed because without the advertisment for young children there can not be Tv shows for them.
Also you do not have to let your children watch the advertisment.
Advertising directed toward children is in my opinion one the biggest branches related to advertising.
But what an impact do these advertisings have on childern?
All advertisings directed toward children are commercials in my opinion.The only reason for that we have such commercials is because it works.
Children seeing a spot about a new game or toy and they go completly crazy about it.
The child starts to want this one toy and every time it sees the commercial again, their want for it gets bigger.
But i rather prefer, that children see these commercial instead of the commercials beeing on Tv on midnight.
Where does this leads towards?
As I said the children sticks toward the thought that without this toy it is not happy.
And that leads us towards the point were we all know it: Parents and their children standing at the shoppingmall and the parents try to explain to the kid why it cannot have this toy.
But the kid is not able to understand why.
The only thing it realises is that it cannot have this toy.
The kid starts screaming, crying and throwing things around in the store.
I think this was also the reason why this quote makes sense.
Children that are really into something but their parents do not want it to happen are mostly going completly crazy.
In my opinion we are not really able to prevent that there are these commercials directedtoward children.
There are many TV-Channels that are making so much money out of these advertisings.
But i dont really think that thesetelevision adveretisings directed toward young children should not e allowed.
If you really want to do something against it as a parent you should better sell your television because there will be this situationof you standing in the shopping mall andyou dont know what you should do about your screaming child.
While John is watching Toggo, his favorite TV programme his mother enters the room.
she starts to get angry:" What are you doing?
I told you not to watch Toggo its so much advertising, I'm really getting tired about all this advertising for childrenchocolate and toy stuff!
It annoys me and I don't wnat you to see it."
she turns the TV off and tells John to wash his hands for lunch.
Suddendly John starts to cry: "What?
Mummy but thats my favourite serie!
I wanna see how max goes for e swim with the dolphin!
And can we buy some chocolate?
I have seen a advertissment for a very good looking chocolate egg!"
Allday Johns mum discuss with John.
she hates to see how her son get manipullated by all those advertissments for chlidren.
Many people aren't happy with it.
Advertissments ments for children are really good for buisness tells mister Lancelot A. from the Toy's house.
its much easier to sell ware when children ask their parents if they can get something as when parents would buy it for them to bring it home ones a year.
Its also nice for the kids when they see live is also for children, even TV shows everything for them and it's not only for adults.
Lancelot is happy with his concept and he would never cancel it how I understand soon.
BUt there are also many advertiser (contra) advertissments towards that young children.In first place they are parents and young adults.
they don't understand how some people can missbrauchen children for their buisiness.
they say children need a free live without someone who tells the what is good or bad or in or out and their time playing out got much shorter since they need more time to watch TV because every serie goes longer beause of the advertisment breaks.
Somehow I would say it destroys their free childhood thells us sandra M. a mother from South Caroline.
Finally I can say I understand all these mothers.
I don't think it makes sense that they see all these advertissments.
They can go to the Toy shops theyselfs and choose the toys they like.
they can go to the supermarket and can ask their mum themselves if they could buy the cholclate.
but they could live free
Sometimes young children watch television because they like episodes, which are specially made for children.
However, the television advertising is a very big problem because the advertising isn't always directed to young children.
Often advertisings are about internet websites, supermarkets or about something, which aren't allowed for young kids.This could have negative effects on the children.
For example they watch an advertising about alcohol or cigarettes, children maybe want to try it because they don't know what it is and that it  is very bad for them.
It's also dangerous if there is an advertising about internet websites.
If they visit this sites, they could buy something even if they don't want to or go to illegal websites because they don't know what they are doing.
Not everything, which you can find on the internet, is nice.
On the other hand it could be logical to make advertisings specially for young children.
The advertisings could informate children about kipnepper or bad people, what they have to do and how they find help if they meet such a person.
This must be done in a way children understand, they should not get scared.
I do not agree and also not disagree with the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" because both sides have advantages.
I came up to the conclusion that it would be good to find an option, which is good for young children so the parents don't have to care about advertisings their child watches.
You can't change the fact that young children grow up with advertisments.
Advertisments are everywhere and you can't controll it.
It doesn't matter if television advertising is allowed or not.
Children don't only see these in television they also see advertisments on the street or in the newspaper.
It is everywhere.
You have to see the point that it is  negative in the way that young children don't only see the advertisment for games for their age it is also possible that they see an advertisment for daiting apps or something like this.
This musn't be because they are too young for that but what can you do against this?
Nothing because 50% of television is advertisment.
It also influences the children negativly because they see the 'fantastic' things and they want to have it.
However, they don't know that everything only seems to be perfect in an advertisment.
It isn't the truth they are talking about in it.
And that is a big problem.
The television channels today are seperated into channels for children and channels for adults.
And mostly there isn't much advertisment on the channels for the children but the danger is that children can always switch between the channels and they can also watch channels they are too young for.
But it can't be a consequence to completly not allow television advertisments.
It also depends on their parents how much they controll the channels their young children are watching.
All in all I would say that you can't controll advertisments so it's okay if it is allowed.
It is the task of the parents to controll the consum of television in their children's life.
You can manage it on your own which and how much advertisment your child is watching.
Pillows, toys and clothes in pink and light blue- a tipical television advertising.
In this case, it's obvious that the advertising isn't directed toward adults or teens but toward young children.
There are fervid discussions on this topic and if it should be forbidden.
Have you ever seen a young child aged two to five in a supermarket buying things all by itself?
No?
Me neither.
You know why this is so?
Because they are with their parents all the time.
I do indeed understand that a child shouldn't be influenced and manipulated at such a young age and that is the case with advertising.
In my opinion, advertising may be directed toward young children but it is the decision of their parents if things are bought or not and also what products are bought and used.
Therefore, I don't think that advertisings directed only toward young children even exists.
The opinion of parents, mostly young adults, matters to companies trying to sell their product.
Furthermore, young children at this age mainly don't spend their freetime infront of the television but outdoors playing.
Even if they sometimes watch television the chanels for children are already without any advertising.
Moreover, it's easy to attract a child's attention because of their young age.
They have hardly any experiences and therefore everything they see ist something new.
Even if they get attracted by an advertising I don't think that their excitement will last.
It's more likely that they forget about products they've seen and find something new to think about and to wish for.
Finally, you can say that I see no sense in or need for abolishing television advertising direkted toward young children.
As I don't have any children and don't remember my childhood very clearly, I don't remember my behaviour against television advertising and so, I'm not able to answer this question from a child's point of view, but from a teenager's one.
There are some arguments against television advertising directed towarts young children, for example the fact, that young people under the age of five don't know the consequences of television advertising.
The marketing and advertising branche has the aim to gane lots of consumers by presenting a product as attractive as possible.
Many people believe, what they are told and buy the product.
We are a consumer soceity and if there's a chanche to buy a product, which is attractive and cheap, we buy it.
I think this is a big problem of our soceity, - we believe everything without asking ourselves, if we really need this product.
Many adults know, that what we are told isn't always true, children don't.
They just want to buy the new toy and don't understand that everything costs money and nothing is for free today.
But on the other hand, many adults don't know the consequences and the goal of advertising, either.
They buy many things, too.
For example, if there's a new smartphone dropped, many people will want to buy this smartphone, because it's new.
They do already have a smartplone, but they are told that the latest one  was better.
And they believe it.
So the advertising is like a which circle.
If we believe ones, what the producer tells us, we'll always believe it.
I don't think television advertising is only a problem for young children, but also for teenagers and adults.
But what should we do?
Shouldn't we just say that all television advertising shouldn't be allowed.
I think we couldn't don't do that.
Without advertising, an enterprise woldn't gane any consumers at all and it would run out of money.
To conclude, we can say that advertising is a today's proplem, but not only for children, but for the whole soceity.
We can't do anything against advertising, but we can change our behaviour and start to think, if we really want to buy everything we don't need.
Advertising has always been such an important thing to make people buy their products or follow their business.
Television advertsising is especially in our the days the most important thing for a business to get new customers.
But in this case we have a little dilemma because it is fact that there are adverts which direct children aged from two to five.
And here we have to ask us if it is essential to make television advertising for young children.
Are they mature enough to think about adverts or do they just watch an advert an ask their parents to buy them this product?
Firstly, young children can't have an useful opinion towards adverts because they don't have any idea of the real life.
They are just there enjoying their childhood and living their life.
Secondly, they do not really understand everything they say in the advertises and so they can't decide if a product is good or not.
It could be that a child watches an advert and just sees all these happy children with these toys and so they really want to have the toy too.
But in fact the product isn't good for a childrens' grown but they can't know thaat because of their lack of knowledge and lack of experience.
On the other hand, all of the television adverts are nowadays so important because of all the new technology.
Children nowadays grow up with all these electronical devices and they might watch TV everyday.
An advert for children is not just an advert it is also an inspiration for a child and could make a child dream of something.
A child doesn't want to watch TV if in the pause it has just adverts for adults.
An advert could also be a good distraction.
To sum it up it is important to say that cutting of television advertising toward young children wouldn't change a big thing.
Children would always see some adverts, for example in a journal or somewhere else.
In my opinion it is essential nowadays to have adverts for young children, also to have a little switch to the other adverts.
If you watch tv you see lots of advertises.
On channels like Super RTL for example are mostly advertises for young children.
The question is if advertises which directly advertise to young children espacially in age two to five should be forbidden.
The problem of those advertises are that things are shown better than they are in reality.
Small children who don`t know about that see those advertises and want to have everything that looks interesting even if it isn`t in reality.
For example if a little boy sees an advertise of a new Playmobil ship which looks very interesting this boy wants to have this Playmobil ship.
It is much easier to impress a little child than to impress an adult because the older you are the more you know about life and who you get influenced by advertises for example.
Companies use a lot of tricks to impress people because they want the people to buy trhier products.
On one hand this can be very annoying for his parents.
On the other hand parents can decide on their own what they buy for their children.
Parents can also tell their children that they should not believe everything they see and that things aren`t as good as they are shown in advertises.
nother reason why those advertises should not be forbidden is that nearly every type of advertise is allowed.
Also advertises of sex toys on pages like amorelie are allowed.
And this advertises are in tv in a time every child can qatch tv.
Sex toys advertises or alcohol advertises should be forbidden in times children can watch tv.
I think those advertises should not be forbidden.
Advertises can influence children very easily but small children aged from two to five are not able to buy everything they want.
Their parents earn the money of which they buy everything.
As a consequence of that they also decide what they buy for their children.
I would more think about forbidding other types of advertises.
Today more and more children sit in front of a tv screen already at a very young age.
It is clear that children not only watch the childrens programm, but also the advertisments inbetween.
What is the danger of having ads directed to those young children?
And should we go as far as to bann those children oriented ads?
Firstly it is importatn to state that five year olds watching those ads might get influened in the sense that they see a new toy and beg their parents to buy them exactly this toy.
On it's next birthday said child might even get the toy.
On the contrary I have to admit that I am not too sure about this influence on children below the age of five.
Two years olds are not old enough to get truly influenced by advertising.
Such a young child might not even realise that the toy in the ad is available in stores and it could ask their parents for it.
Furthermore are those ads for children in almost all cases for toys.
And the want for new toys comes not only from the tv.
For example a child is at a friends house and they play with dolls.
And the friend just got a really pretty new doll.
The child is most likely to go home that day and ask it's parents for the same doll.
The effect is the same maybe even bigger than the one of television advertising.
We cannot and should not forbit playing with other children, only because of peer presure, so can we forbit those ads?
I am concludingg that we should not bann the ads in childrens programm, since for now there is no real danger for it.
We should though keep an eye on those ads and if there shows to be an actual threat from them then we have to bann them.
The real problem with this is not the ads, but that even two year olds already watch tv.
I think it is highly problematic that some children sit in front of a screen all day and lack social contact because of this.
Maybe we should reduse watching tv for children to one hour a day or even less.
That way there would also be less ads, which might or might not influence children.
Advertisement is something we all know as we are confronted with it everywhere.
On the streets, on your computer, on your mobile phone and so on.
However, with the statement that advertisements is only manipulation can we allow advertisement that is directed towards young children?
If children watch advertisements and they actually like the product that is advertised chances are high that they will keep watching television as they are keen on watching other products being advertised aswell.
If they are constantly confronted with something they like they won´t stop watching it causing them to be addicted to television  which is bad for a young child that should grow.
It also is really manipulative as children won´t play with friends or study but only watch television and those advertisements.
Children will be keen on having the products represented in the advertisement and complain about not having these products if their parents won´t buy them.
Of course you can say that parents shouldn´t allow their children who are that young to watch television in general, however children don´t necessarily need to watch television directly to be confronted with advertisements because they could also be confronted with it due to their parents watching them.
If they happen to just randomly go to the kitchen and on their way they see their parents watching television in the living room they could see the advertisement causing the same effect as watching it directly.
There is also the argument that parents won´t allow their children to be have those products as they won´t buy them.
However, children can be very stubborn and always complain until they get what they want.
They whole witch cycle where they constantly watch advertisements doesn´t make this any easier because children are then much more confronted with the television.
At some point parents just can´t withstand the constant complains causing them to give up and and buying the products which are advertised.
To conclude, television advertising should not be allowed for young children because they are manipulated resulting into them constantly wanting to watch television and complaining to their parents if they dont´t buy them the products.
Television advertising should only be directed towards the people who aren´t as manipulative as young children and already know how to resist temptation.
Everybody gets influenced by advertises.
Espacially in the television advertises can trick people to buy the product even if the don't really need it.
So most of the young children gets affected and are influenced by these tricks.
There are lots of arguments against the television advertising toward young children.
Young children can' recognize tricks of the producers so all they want is to buy the product.
Due to the fact that the children want to have these product the parents are affected too.
The children want it and they don't know if the parents have the necessary money but there is a positive aspect too.
There are some products which has to be bought by the parents for example the clothes.
So the parents have to be informed about the latest products for their children.
It means that the consumers have to knoe which products are for their children and where you can buy it.
another negative aspect is that the children might think if they see the advertisments they don't have good parents who buy them just boring stuff.
When they see the latest Playmobil modell the only thought they have is "I want it" but the next Playmobil modell will be released in 2 weeks and the they want this.
So for the parents its don' even possible to buy all things for their children.
My opinion is that the television advertising should be in the evening or in the late afternoon, so the parents see this advertises and the children don't get influenced, so the children can get new products but they don't want the latest of everything.
Should televison advertising directed toward young children at the age of two to five should really be permitted?
There are pearents who don't want their children not to watch television.
They say that there are also programnms on televison which are teaching their children something new.
Furthermore watching televion is a good opportunity for children to learn a new language whos family have migrantal background and therefore don't speak the language at home their children have to speak in kindergarten or in elemantary school.
But there are more arguments for a permittion.
Beside the fact that watching television is bad for the children's health because of radioactivity and also for their eyes, children who watch to much televisio per day will get isolated of society one day because they learn to just be alone watching televison and not talking to anyone except Dora.
They will get less and less communicative which will be bad for their future since we all have to communicate with each other to be successfull in life.
Like once a famous poet said : '' No man is an island of his own''.
Moreover there are much more effective, healthy and communnicative ways for children to learn a new language and imrpove their speaking skills than watching television.
Meeting with other children for example who are native is the most easiest way for a child to learn a new language.
Not only they would learn the vocabulary which is necessary for their daily life but they also would learn to interagate with others and become part of society.
So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed since all the arguments which say that it should not be permmitted can be easily
The main objective of advertisments is to influence the viewer, to buy certain products.
Advertisements are always directed at certain Groups of people.
In the breaks of an action Movie for example, the ads are directed at mature audiences.
On Kids channels the Ads are directed at Kids.
The Problem with that however is that young kids are easier to influence than teenagers or adults.
Advertisements for Toys for example speak to children really well, because they are very important to them.
They spend every Day playing with Toys.
They bind with them linking certain emotions to them.
When they see ads of new Toys, it is only natural that they want them, because the ads are desinged to influence them.
Often times however, the ads display a false image of the product.
A Hotwheel car jumping through a flaming ring of fire, after comming out of an awesome Looping, for example, is something so unbeliveable for a young boy that they want to see it, recreate it.
Just like a giant Dollhouse with lifelike animated Barbiedolls talking to each other is for a young girl.
But these images are not real and create a false image in the head of children.
Tricking them into wanting the toys even more.
There are laws against false advertisement for products targeting other age groups to prevent excactly that.
To stop getting people tricked by these ads,
it doesnt make any sense why something like this does not exist for children, who are way easier to influence.
Another problem with tv ads is that children watch more tv than adults.
Their parents just let them watch Tv for a few hours, so that they can enjoy some silence.
They often times dont even realise that their own kids get influenced right at Home on their own couch.
Another point that maybe should get taken into consideration is that these Televison Advertisements might force a certain role model onto the children.
If a young boy only sees boys play with Cars he also wants to play with them and if he only sees girls play with Babydolls, for example, he doesnt really care about them.
But I think that children should choose their Toys free from any influences.
If Tv ads for children really get banned the toy manufacturers loose their main advertisement platform.
It will be hard for them to find a new way in wich to reach.
All in all I would say that advertising directed a t young children should be banned.
It creates a false image and influences them to much.
Television advertising is and are programs and shows for little kids which are ment to teach the kids specific topics.
Television advertising is for families where the parents don`t are willing or are not abel to spend time with their kids and practise with them.
So these programs help the kids to learn, to speak and so on.
However kids must learn from their parents or other humans, if a normal education is wanted.
The TV or a computer are not as good as humans for kids.
Furthermore such programs are far from perfect and often show a different point of view on the world than in real life.
A good example would be a viedeo where animals are explained on soft figures.
These figures all have the same tall and sometimes a different color than the real animals.
Furthermore the kids then develop a relationship to such programs, videos or the computer and not to the humans.
This could result in real social problems when the kid grows up.The kids also learn to speak when they watch, hear and somehow feel their parents or other humans speak.
This is just given with television advertising.
To sum it up, i definietly think that television advertising is not good for the kids and should not be allowed.
If the parents have probolems with time for their kids they should look for help in institutions and should not use the TV or the computer for their kids.
The use of technological devices is a main issue in our current life.
Also the television determines our lifestyle.
So it is understanding that also the advertising contains to the television a field where a big group of people can be directed.
Some opponents of this development warn of the influence of children and claim that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Of course it is understanding that some experts see a problem in an influence of the childrens because young children often do not have a critical opinion towards the advertising and are going to be fascinated by every product and every advertising.
Added to that experts fear that the contact with television advertising could lead to a worse education because of the easy language and wrong funny meant facts children could assume to be reality.
To sum up children might not be able to develop a right behaviour towards television advertising.
On the other hand there are loads of arguments which come to a different conclusion.
In the opinion of the supporters it is really important to start having contact with our technological devices in young years.
They claim that the child using the devices like television would have it easier to understand other, more complex technological devices.
What is even more the children who take use of television advertising would develop a better behaviour towards the television including not beeing anxious about it.
In connection to this argument lots of people state that the forbidden is the most interesting.
So if you forbide using television it will be more and more interesting for young children so that you have an opponent effekt.
One last argument to make which should not be forgotten in this contexts is the intention of the advertising directed towards young children.
With this strategy concerns want to increase their quote of selling.
Young children serve to be a way to increase selling which might be instead of the many arguments for allowing this advertising the main argument not to allow it.
The moral aspects stands on the top of all other arguments.
To sum up you can say that our technological development also includes the use of television but anyway the right treatment concerning to television advertising is of paramount importance.
In my opinion it is wrong to deal with a direct television advertising towards young children because they believe easily in many things and are used as a way to sell products.
As far as I am concerned for me this is an unmoral behaviour.
"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
This is a very contoversal statement, which was already uttered by many politicians.
In the followings lines you would find an opinion on this statement.
Firstly you must say that every person, no matter who or which age is confronted with advertising in everyday life.
Either the advertising in newspapers or the advertising on the street, you are not able to stop the contact with any kind of advertising.
It´s a very difficult issue.
For example why should be advertsing for people at the age of six  allowed?
It´s proofed that children of that age are able to keep the external information they get from parents or somebody else in  mind.
In my opinion it´s a fact that advertisings have the task to influence the public opinion for higher sells in the economy, so why should that not be allowed because the kids get informed by their friends about new toys or something like that as well.
For me it´s difficult to set a frame of the age for allowed advertising.
To come to a conclusion I would disagree with this statement because you can not hide advertising.
If parents are against this they should be able to forbid to much television in general.
Thank you for reading my essay about this exiting statement.
The statement is quite controversal.
Many young children watch TV all day and their thoughts are pretty easy to influence.
Because of that, the cool new toys or whatever they see in the commercial breaks, is all they want.
This forces parents to likely unapproachable things, when their 5 year old son wants the newest Hoverboard for $400.
On the other hand you could say that these children wont buy the articles anyway and it´s more for the parents who need to collect ideas what toys their kid wants for christmas.
I think these commercials are quite important especially for the companies that sell toys, but how these commercials look is wrong.
In my opinion they are brainwashing the children.
You hear the name of the toy like three to five times with trippy music in the background and euphorical children who overact in their roles.
But it needs to be said that these ads are also essential.
In fact they cant influence the buyer of the product directly because the adults, who would buy the articles, do not watch kids TV normally.
When you notice your kids being influenced by television too much you maybe just have to switch the device off and go play outside with your child.
In order to make these commercials less controversial one should overthink exactly what they show there and not adress it directly to children this young.
I do not think they should be forbidden completely, but their appearance and what they show there in which way definitely needs to be changed
I totally disagree with the statement that Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Television always has advertisings there will not be any program on television which hasn´t any advertisings in there.
ALso young children can watch this, they can see new toys or shows they want to watch so it can be useful.
Especially in the time before christmas or the birthday parents can listen to their children and they can say "I want to have this toy" so the parents can buy this as a present.
By the way you don´t have to pay much money to watch television.
That´s because of the advertisings you see on television.
Companys "buy" time so they can show their new products or anything else.
They pay the money to the television transmitter and that is how the transmitter earns money so they can "sell" their shows much cheaper to us.
Probably a lot of the parents will say that their children are not allowed to watch advertisings and that they should be banned out of kids tv but if these parents don´t want their kids to watch this they shouldn´t let their kids watch tv at all.
Instead of watching tv they should go out on a playground with their kids so they must not see this advertisings.
If they don´t want this and want to let their kids still watching tv they shouldn´t complain about it because the advertisings in the kids channels are not bad for them.
They are always nice and friendly designed so the kids often even don´t recognize that this is an advertising.
We're are living in a decade where television advertising is the main income of a channel.
But sometines those advertisings are especially made for young children.
The state which I'm going to write today is about the topic if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
The first point is that with the television advertising the children always wants to have more and they love to act like the child in the television.
A good example is the advertising of the brand GEOX.
With showing the children their shoes in a kind of cartoon, the children become influenced by the advertisement and so when they go out shopping with their parents the only wish they have, is to buy some pair of GEOX shoes because your foot can breath in there.
On the contrary of the first point the children learn a lot about their own body.
Retaking the further example is the advertising of GEOX the children learn that the whole body breathes and that the body can't survive for a long time by inhaling oxygen only from the lungs.
The third point of this topic is that if a brand invests a lot of money in television advertising the product shown in the television will cost also a lot.
And a lot of parents cannot affort to buy the specific product.
But the parents wants to make the child happy and they buy the product nonetheless when they can't afford it.
This leads that the parents have much more debts than they normally have.
Resuming of all the points I prefer that television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed because those kind of advertising act at the children like a brainwash.
This brainwash leads to the point in which the parents could loose the control of the children because they get so much influenced by the television advertising.
And also there is a high risiko of bullism at the kindergarten if a child doesn't wear a pair of shoes which can't breath.
The only one solution for stopping this brainwash is to not allow the children to watch television for a long time.
There is so much on tv's.
Today the publicity is exploding even tough in the tv.
There's lot of manipulation which is made threw television advertising.
From time to time the publicity for children is getting much more.
I think every child is watching tv and is also allowed to do this.
So the television producers take their chance and manipulate the young children which are impressed by this publicity.
They believe in their true as well.
On one site there is television advertising for children which is useful and full of interesting informations.
These informations could support the childhood and could take a good influence on their behaviour.
On the other site there is a lot of bullshit in tv.
So the thing is that the young children believes instantly in these curious opinions.
That's the main problem!
When a young child sees something dangerous in tv then the most of them want to try it.
These things should be forbidden.
The influence which these things can take is so big.
I remember when I was five.
I wasn't allowed to watch normal tv advertising or series.
I just watched things for children.
I think that could be a good solution because on these chanels there is no television advertising or manipulation or whatever...
I think it's difficult to forbid the tv-producers to make publicity for the children.
Even when it's forbidden they would do it as long as they could.
They don't care about what's forbidden and what's actually not.
But we can prohibit that there's no advertisement on the channels for children.
In our sociaty advertising is a very normal thing to do.
People are used to it and often adjust their behaviour of watching to the advertising breaks.
For example many people go to the tiolet when there is a break because of advertising.
They don´t think of the real function of advertising.
The function is to influence the viewer and make him remember special products.
Also if you know about that function it still works.
So what about the children?
The children don´t know about the function and are exrtemely easy to influence.
This way companies could be able to make children buy things and influence the way they use their money which is a questionable thing to do.
Nowadays children are watching TV increasingly often because their parents need to work, maybe also at home.
That fact is making the advertising adressed to children even worse because the parents often don´t watch their children while they are sitting in front of the TV.
Actually you can compair it to the internet.
There is a lot of advertising inviting the children to click on and see whether there might be something intresting for them.
The TV is not as extreme as the net because it can´t collect information about a single person and adjust the ads to what the person is interested in.
But the advertising on TV is closer to life because often they are made of short spots that you do watch, instead of showing pictures like the net does it.
Actually I´d say that the responibility to teach the children a good use of money is at the parents, but to their defense they can´t always "fly above their children" and watch them all day long.
They have to work, too.
That´s why I would say that it should be illegal to direct advertising to children, especially if they are between two and five because it doesn´t only make them buy things, it also influences the developement of their brain in a bad way.
For that TV is not a good thing to do at all, but the advertising leaves traces in their heads.
I guess everyone learned some TV spots by heart one time which is exactly the purpose of advertising.
But in my opinion this purpose is no good for children at all.
This is why I would support making it illegal to direct TV spots to children.
Everybody sees advertising.
on the busstation, in the train or in the TV.
advertising is the most boring part in the whole TV.
But advertising toward young children is the worst advertising.
Small kids who see this advertising  want this product advertised in the advertising.
In the very first years of a child the kids learn from seeing what is in there world aroud.
So they see the advertising and this product stays in their head.
Advertising in television is a very bad instrument to get costumers, but the shows and the producers have to do this because their money comes from the advertising.
just so they can stay on scene with teir shows.
New ideas could just be made in reality because of advertising.
Advertising is a bad thing.
For all of the people they see this advertising.
But when I see this question I must ask myself "What is wrong with parents who let watch their children television.
For me it is not clear why someone should do this.
Children in this age should go outside with their parents and whatch the nature or go to the zoo.
When you watch television you can not learn anything in this age.
Also the advertising to this group of age is very agressiv.
Children in this age have to speak with their parents or with others around.
They should not wach television.
And of cause not advertising.
To come to a conclusion, advertising towards small children should be abolished.
But also it have to be forbidden that parents let their children watch television on a age of two to five.
"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
That is the oppinionon of many worried parents desperatly trying to raise their child to the perfect young adult they always dreamt of it would be.
But what are they really that afraid of?
They proclaim that cruel comanies from all over the globe try to ivade the brains of their children and spark the firely desire to posess the advertised product.
The TV spots are immature, unrealistic and of course harmful to the children's mentality.
That or and many other similar points of view is probably what drives the most worried parents- But why?
From the economic point of view, for the TV station is is necessary to air advertisement to finance their shows and even the station itself.
Also for teh companies producing products for children it is important for their success, not to ... the parents, but the children who eventually will actually use it.
But let's be honest.
None of the arguments above really matter.
The problem it self doesn't matter.
First of all it is the parents themself who allow their children to watch TV knowing well there is going to be TV spots trying to sell something to their kids.
But thats only one part- A lot of times I see parents just letting theri kids sit in front of the television instead of actually spending time with them.
I think it is kind of stupid accuse companies of airing inappropriate TV spots, when you can just turn of the TV or forbid the children to watch Tv.
And there lies the problem.
The problem is not thst there are TV spots for children, but that parents just let their children watch Tv.
The discussion about advertising towards young children is a pretty controverse one.
Some people say it should be prohibited to stop the influence on children.
Others say that the companies selling toys for kids should have the opportunity to advertise their products as well.
And so do I. I think that in general these kind of advertises should be allowed.
Of course critics could think that these advertises would influence children in a bad way and I totally agree.
Children could get a wrong view on things like morality if they see advertisings of gun toys e.g..
But especially in cases like this parents have the obligation to protect and educate their children so their children wont be influenced this much.
And I think that most parents are reliable by communicating the morality basics to their children.
Additional the parents still decides what the child gets.
So parents can still control what their child get despite the child watching these advertises.
And because of this the children learn that they wont get anything they see in TV and the presents they get get more special.
On the other hand children could get angry if they do not get what they want but in this case the education relies on the parents and the major parts of the parents know that.
And we can not prohibit advertising because of a small group of parents who do not know how to raise their children.
The good thing about children not getting what they want is the increasing of creativity.
Children who want something really bad but who do not get what they want will build it by theirselfs or just imagines having it.
This will increase the creativity of the children.
To conclude I dont think that this kind of advertising does really hurt anyone.
If the children are raised in a right way, they wont be influenced in a bad way too much by these advertises.
But here we have to rely on the parents doing their job.
In the following I will explain my opinion to the statement, that young children in the age of two to five should not direct toward television advertising.
I think on the one hand it's absolutely ok for young children to be in television advertisments if it's ok for the parents and if the children have fun through it.
On the other hand it can be a problem if the child is afraid or has no fun.
In this case I think it's better to do this not.
The child should also do just easy things in the advertisement if it wants to do it, like just laughing or playing.
Directing belongs not to this things, so I am against that.
Complicated things can be not good for the child.
When the child is too young, it has in the most cases no opinion about what it wants or what it doesn't want, so the parents should decide what's the best for their child.
A situation, where I would say that it's absolutely not ok to let a child be in advertisements is when the parents do it just for the money.
They let the child work for their own money and that's false.
They should do it when it makes fun for the child and the money can be wasted in a teddy bear or something like this for the child.
Furthermore it's not good to do it with a very joung child.
When this child is older, it's maybe embarassing for it to be as a baby in advertisement.
A point whrere every parent should be careful is what kind of advertisement it is.
They should informate themself about the organisation, what they do and if they are good and famous or not really good.
The money which they would earn is also importent and can say a lot about the advertisement.
To conclude, I would say it's always the situation which is important to decide if an advertisement is the right thing for the child or not.
The child should do it just when it really wants it and when it's old enough and physically good enough to play in it.
The child should also do just easy things and no directing.
I am convinced that television advertising should not be directed towards young children for moral reasons, but there should not be law against it, because I assess this kind of advertising is not effective enough to be made.
It is quite easy to influence young children between the age of two to five, but first of all, those children are not able to buy stuff, they are too young to have an influence large enough on their parents.
Second, those children are not involved in the buying process, their parents do not consider them as reasonable enough to make a choice for themselves and often, they are not even taken into the shop.
Finaly, I assume that the children do not watch enough TV to be strongly influenced.
The majority of children watching TV are way older, for example six to ten years old.
On the other hand I think it is moraly unacceptable to influence children, advertisement in this part  of the could strongly influence their developement.
c
An important point in aour modern society is the media.
There are many different possibilities to use it and also many different ways to think about it.
A topic which is discused by many is the influence of television and internet on young children.
it is often questioned if so young children should be allowed to watch TV or use the internet this often.
First of all it is important to make a distance between normal stuff on TV an series which are made especially for young children.
Some parents thnk that those shows aren´t good for their children because it is just some dump content or unimportant facts.
But others think it is good for children to wach TV because they can learn things for their life or they get someone to look up to except their parents.
It is important to included that there are also different kinds of shows for children.
Some are made directly for teaching and others are just made for entertainment.
Some critics say that parents should use the childhood and even the early childhood of their children to do something as a family.
For example to play outside or visit a zoo but the TV is not good for children because they would learn from nonexisting characters what life is about.
Others say that it is a good posibility for parents who have to work alot because they can keep an eye on their children but they have the time for their job too.
To take a look at the topic from another position the television is good for young children because it is another way to teach them how to speak or how to name different things.
When children wch TV they have got the chance to talk to their friends about it and maybe their parents can use it to introduce them into the daily life.
To summerize it is anyway a topic which will be discussed alot in the future because there are many positive points but also many points against it.
In my opinion it is good that there are shows for children but they shouldn´t watch them if they are to young and they also shouldn´t watch TV too often otherwise that could effect an addiction.
But I don´t think TV shows for young children should be banned in generally.
I disagree with the following statement ,,Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) shold be not allowed" because the parents of the children can do what they wanted to do.
But I also think that the parent would have a timeperiod in which the children can watch TV maybe 1 hour a day.
This is important because lots of joung children dont know what to do in their free time.
For example if a children always watch TV and the parents are not able to play with the child it dont know what to do in freetime in contrast to this a child who dont watch TV every day or not so mutch, is often more kreativ and dont need others to play with him.
Another negativ point ist that their are sometimes TV shows wich are not realistic or just nothing for childs at the age of two to five but the parents let the kids watch this.
Although watching TV is a way to give the childs something to do when the parents work or do other things but for a long time it istnt the right way to support the children.
on the one hand you can disagree to this statement but on the otherhand you know taht it is dont realistic.
If the television time can be limited children can whatch TV when the parents are not there but it also is not so mutch that the kids dont have time for themselves.
But of cousre that isnt very realistic too because you cant see if the parents are wanted to do these rools and if not you cant say you have to pay for that.
Nowadays, children watch more television than ever.
It is easy for parents to just let their children sit infront of the TV, where they can watch their favorite shows, sometimes educational, sometimes not.
During this time, parents can do housework or prepare things, without having to provide entertainment for their children.
But children do not only watch the TV shows, but also the advertising inbetween.
Often, they are coloful and full of joy, showing children having fun with friends.
Should children really be already exposed to consuming and buying goods at such a young age?
My first argument would be that if the young children see the right advertisment, they could improve their lifestyle.
When a child sees an advertisment for a fun thing to do outside, let's say a trampoline, and the parents agree to buy it, the child will automatically spend more time outside.
Furthermore, you could argue that if healthy foods are put into an advertisment, the children will see it and recognize it the next time they go shopping with their parents, and will convince them to buy it.
But showing children advertisments at a young age can also help them to be prepared for when they are older, and the world will be full of dangerous advertisments.
If a child already realises at a young age that advertisments often show exagerated or fake things, it will be less difficult for them to realise late which kind of advertisments are dangerous.
If you never see advertisments at a young age, how will you recognize that even when the advetisments for cigarettes say it is a good thing, it really is not?
On the other hand, children are very manipulative at that age.
The brands which do these advetisments know this, and try to put themselves in the best light.
If they let the children think that they will be a superhero or that there are some special gifts inside the advertised good, they will want to own it.
And what do you do as a parent in the supermarket, when your child sits down infront of the brand cereals with the special bowl inside from the latest disney movie and starts to cry?
The parents give in and buy their children the good, even if they do not approve of it and there is the same non-brand good for a lot less.
In my opinion, you cannot forbid the televison advertisments which are directed towards children.
Brands will always find a way to show their advertisments, and does it really make a difference if children see advertisments directed towards them or their parents?
I think it is also a task of parenthood to let your children realise if things are bad or not, and what should influence you.
I also saw advertisments as a young child, and I think I can say that nowadays, they do not affect me, because my parents showed me that you do not need to have the brand cereals, even if they have the newest disney figure inside.
In todays live we often see advertisments which are directed towards us or your group.
But to direct advertisments toward young children doesn't make sence at all: In the age two to five children should be playing outside.
They shouldn't watch TV.
But if they watch TV there shouldn't be any television advertising which is DIRECTED towards young children.
Television advertising which is dircteted to somebody especially to young children is very dangerous: often those children really want that, what is shown in the advertisment - of course thats the reason of an advertisment - but young children's live shouldn't be inluenced by television advertising.
The influence of other advertising (for example supermarket-advertising) is high at all.
So in generell television advertising should be allowed but if television is directed towards young children it should be illegal.
As I already said the influence of television advertising towards young children is too high that it should be allowed.
An argument against advertising directly towards young children is that they're way to easy to influence and they can't judge like an adult person can if they need to have the advertised product or not.
That means if a young children sees an advertisement they are more likely to feel forced to buy that certain product than an adult.
In contrast to that there are also arguments that support the television advertising directed towards young children for example the companys who produce product for children aged two to five want to sell their products so they advertise like any other company and if a children is aged two to five the parents should decide if the children should get the product or not.
Also the parents can decide if the children should watch TV or not so in the end it's all about the parents.
Another argument is that the children, in most cases, can't buy the products anyway because they don't have any money so they have to ask their parents if they can get the product or not and if the parents say no the children maybe learns that it can't always have everything it wants to have.
If advertising directly towards those young children would be allowed many adults would probably also lose their job because TV stations that are for children are most likely to play advertisements that are for kids so if they would be forbidden the TV stations can't play advertisements that are for their viewers anymore which would mean that some companys would really lose much money.
In my opinion the TV advertising directed towards young children should't be forbidden because of the arguments above.
Also as I mentioned before I think parents should watch over their children if they watch TV and not give them all they see in the advertisements so I think this is really about the parents.
Also in my opinion not allowing these kind of advertisements is some kind of censorship.
Save the future of our children

People these days cannot live without electronic machinines.
Almost in evey household theres more than one computer and TV.
The children grow up with a televiosion, which is on the whole day.
But television advertising directed toward young children should definetly not be alllowd.
One reason is, watching television the whole day, makes you stupid.
You are not using your brain anymore and you lose important skills.
The brain cannot develop anymore.
They are only focused on watching and their brain has no work anymore.
In this stage of age it`s absolutly important to learn things.
Listening, speaking, physicaly and psychology things.
Only if the parents support creativity etc.
the children can grow up to an intelligent adult.
Not every show in the television is made for children, but they`re watching it.
Sometimes the televionsion shows things, which are definetly not good for the psychologycal developtment.
The tv shows us movies full of violence, wars or horror and in this way they can scare the kids.
Scaring instead of caring is always not a god solution while growing up.
Relationships get lost, because of watching too much tv.
A lot of parents aren`t interested in spending time with their kids.
They are always buisy, have work to do or just not in the mood for playing with their children.
Instead of caring about their kids, they let them watching tv all the time and this is definetly not the idea of having children.
The problem today is, that many parents have no creativity anymore and because of that the tv is on during the whole day.
But this can have negative influences on the young children.
We should forbit television advertising directed toward young children, just to save their future.
I think television advertising directed toward young children has both, advantages and disadvantages.
To say first, in my opinion children between two and five years shouldn't watch much television.
If they watch like one film a day (which lasts about one hour) they mostly can't see any adverstising.
So I think it depends on the parents if the advertiser can influence the children.
I just see one positve thing about television advertising; that children probably learn to speak and say their opinion if they see things they want to buy in the television.
But there are way more negative things about it.
The worst thing is that children inbetween this age believe nearly everything.
So the advertiser can say what they want to and every child thinks it's true.
So if they would say you can now buy a brandnew dragon which can fly, do all the household chores and is as big as a real one, every child between this age would want to buy it.
I think this is really stressful for the parents.
The children will cry at home and want to buy this dragon and they'll get angry if you say them that the advertiser don't tell the thruth.
Another disadvantage is, that televison advertising can "help people to turn into shopping addicts.
In general I think that television advertising isn't good for people from all ages, but especially for little children it's a really dumb idea.
You can influence them so easily and children get stupid with this thoughts that the television tells always the truth.
Since the technology developed in the past years it is nearly normal that every child watches TV or play with mobile phones, tablet computers or laptops of their parents or already their own devices.
A good point about television is that there is a control what children are doing and what they watch.
On the world wide web you can never now which page your child just visit and what the content of this page is.
That should not mean that Television is good for kids and that they should be allowed to watch it as long and as often as they want.
The biggest problem with adverising directed towards young children is that they can be manipulated really fast.
For example if your child watches an advertisment for a toy and on TV is is presented with chilren playing with it your child maybe really wants to have this toy as well because in the advertisment the children all looked so happy.
Allowing the direct advertising could effect that the products the advertisment is for are already seen by the kids and not by their parents so the childen can choose on their own if they like the toy or not.
If just the parents get to know this advertisment and think that this could be good for their children the children could not like it and are manipulated by their parents if they introduce the toy to them and tell what the good things are about it.
But controverse to that point just named,it is important that young children mostly watch TV to see the next story of their favorite children series.
They do not want to the story to be interrupted because of some advertisments, they want to know what will happen with the people and animals in the show.
To come to a conclusion, I defenetly agree with the named statement.
Childhood should be playing outside with friends and do what children like to do.
And if they watch a children story for half an our a day on TV they should be allwoed to do that and not be interrupted by things their parents should buy to help the capitalism to rise.
In the modern age it is hard to to not be affected by any sort of advertising.
In form of television ads companies try to make their products more popular or better known in general.
By having national wide tv ad they can find new buyers of their product very easily.
On the other hand children especially young kids aged two to five shouldn't be confronted with monipulising ads.
Because children often believe in the things they are told they can be tricked into wanting everything that is advertised on tv.
Television advertising helps a company to increase their profit and this also means that it important for the national economy.
For example the German politicians that made the "Abwrackprämie" in 2009 help a car company to get up after the crisis in 2008 and to make this very important event well known in the public the car company made tv ads.This of course didn't affect the children but it still shows the importance of television advertising.
Children could be tricked by ads into thinking that they have to have one special toy to be cool.
Television ads also often build stereotyps that are very damaging especially for children.
When they see on tv that only girls play with Barbie or that only boys can dress up as a pirate they often start to adapt these stereotypes themselves without even realising it and this doesn't only affect them but also the people and kids around them.
If they start to believe in these prejudices in kindergarten age they will propably still believe in them when they are in their teens or an adult.
I don't agree with the statement that television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed because I think that the companies have to get their products to the people somehow.
But I also think that when they make an ad for a new toy they should show a bit diversity and let boys play with a doll or girls with sword.
The last thing is that I believe that kids that young should not watch tv at all.
As more and more content is brought to our television, also the audience has changed compared to the last century.
Children frequently watch TV already in a young age.
This circumstance is used by private channels to  address their advertisement not only to adults but especially to toddlers.
The question therefore not only is why the channels do so, but also if they should be allowed to.
With the ads tlevision gains a lot of money, so the more advertisement, the better.
Ads for children usually contain  toys or the latest series or films to watch.
When the children see those ads they make their parents buy them these toys and are willing to watch even more TV.
Like this the enterprises and the channels gain a lot of money.
But what about the children?
Why should advertisement be bad for them?
They are influenced already at age two to five to buy anything they see and have no real relation to the product they want to have as they don't think about it like they would do in a shop.
In addition to that they will watch even more TV,which is according to several studies bad for the child's mental development as it does not have a sense for fantasy or thinking itself.
In my opinion advertisement towards children should not be allowed as they are being influenced by it and don't learn about a toy's value.
In the ads there are many adjectives like "fantastic", "awesome" or "brand-new" that tell the child that the product was almost perfect, so that the child does not choose it's toys by it's own preferences but by the way it was promoted.
Another big issue is the way that toys are promoted.
Today almost every brand has toys for boys and girls.
Thereby the boy's products are blue or black and the girl's pink and white.
In the ads there are also always only girls playing together or boys, but there seem to be no more toys for bothb to play with.
Like that the children are already confronted with gender stereotypes that are neither right nor have a place in our modern society.
As a conclusion I can say that ads for children only have bad influences on them and should not be allowed, as they transport the wrong ideals and stop the children of thinking themselves.
In the following text I will give my opinion about the statement, if television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
First I want to say that I agree with this statement, because in my opionion televisison advertising manipulates the young children.
In my opinion television advertising is only useful to show the interests of the young children.
But young children are not able to know what is right or what is wrong and they also do not know what is good and what is bad and in the way the producer of the television advertising do not present the products in a reality way.
So the producer of the television advertising use this traits to catch the interest of the young children, so that the young children want to have the products, which are present in the television advertising.
Furthermore this shows that the producer of the television advertising just want to sell their products and therefore the use the young children.
To conclude, I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
It is a controversial topic if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
Of course, the industry wants to make as much money with their products as possible but should they use children too reach their goal?
On the one hand it is important for buisness to use advertises to make their products popular and they have to be directed to the group the product is about but on the other hand even if a child likes a product from an advertisement it has not the money to buy it.
Furthermore are children from two to five very easy to influence and it is unfair to use this.
In addition to this, children are not able to decide what is good for them and what not.
If there is for example a television advertisement about sweets which could damage the teeth of children no child would care about it if they look yummy and buy them anyway.
In conclusion I think that it should not be allowed to use television advertising directed toward young children because they can be influenced to easy what is against the moral.
Children are very often agree with the statements from the parents.
They think all the things that they hear is all right and correct.
We can connect this with the advertising.
Sometimes a television advertisment is colourful, with music and some other brilliant aspects which the children loves.
So they want to do the same things like the other children in the television.
But they don't know what advertising mean.
So the children have another perspective of the television, his advertisings and here meanings.
Sometimes the parents need the children for living the dream that they couldn't.
Many children are to young for decide alone But often the Childrens lean a lot from advertisings.
Maybe they learn new words in different languages or they learn how to do something.
In my opinion, the television advertising directed toward young children shoud be allowed.
But it have to be a good combitation of learning what the advertising mean
Today politics debate about tevevision advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed or not.
So the main question we have to answer is, if this question will help and push the process of learning.
In the following main part I´m going to discuss about that important question.
The main point of this debate include the question what is meant with television.
We would say a programm which helps the progress of learning with the kids and parents combined.
A process of learning not only about the parents and other non fictive persons but also with a virtuall help.
In some steps of learning it might carry the process.
On the other side you have the problem of the virtuall world.
The children will have problems to combine both worlds.
Also there is the problem of helthness.
Television might increase illnes in futhure.
All in all that´s the main problem of advertising televison dircected toward young children.
They might learn easier and better but I don´t want to play with the future of my children when it´s not profe that it makes ill.
In future when it might be profed it will be advertising, but in the moment I would say there we have the non profed responsibility of a better learning process and noone will take this opportunity.
First I have to say, that i't's an interesting question.
It's a new problem, that we don't know for a long time, because i'ts a new century with the televisions, smartphones and other electronic gadgets.Also the companys which make advertising are growing very quickly.
Below I want to write about some pro and contra arguments and at the end I want to give a statement.
I'ts mean, because the kids can't handle whith these advertisings and the aren't able to know the value of money.
That's an argument people say, who want to forbid the advertisings.
They say that the childrens are very small and the can't protect from the advertising.
Also they say i'ts not fair for the mother, because when the kids see something in the television they really want it and that's for the mother a hard time.
Now the people who think i'ts television advertising for these kids is correct.
They say, that the mother can say no and when she once said no, the kids know that.
So the mother has to be very strict the first time and after that i'ts no problem anymore.
And these young kids don't have to watch television that often, they better play outise with other kids.
Then the prolem is solved.
At the end my opinion.
I think, that i'ts the responsibility of the mother and that she can handl it.
Also the kids should better play outise, because they met other kids and i'ts more fun for them.
So the televison advertising should be allowed.
I agree with this statement with diverent reasons.
The children in this age are not enough old to decide if the advertising is good for them or if the producer of the advertising only wants to make profit.
They now that the children could influence their parnts quite much.
If the children see such a advertising they would also ask their grandparents to buy them products, which they saw in the Television.
I think with the technology we have today, children are more and more able to watch television and often they do it without their parents.
In cause of that they have no one who takes care about them and who looks that they do not often look such television advertising.
I think normaly the children do not even realice how many toys actualy exist and so they dont want to have it.
But the nature of childhood is, if we want ore not, that they always want to have what they see.
In television advertising the toys look sometimes much more realistic, than they actualy are.
The children are going to think that they have only stupid toys and there would be many better ones.
In cause of that the children give everyhing to become new toys and as far as they have new ones, they want to get an other one, cause there are again new advertising with bether toys.
On this way the childre are going to get trained to buy everything what they see in a television advertising.
If they grow up they will not come away from this.
They always want to have the best and the newest things.
From time to time the humanity is going to get more and more influenced.
It starts, as we see in this example, in joung years.
The statement if advertising for young children should be not allowed in television is a very controversely discussed topic.
At first it is important to know, what adcvertisements does with children.
Of course they suggest them to buy special food or toys.
Although this could be mentioned as a part of the economic engine of esociety, it could cause problems.
Kids can't critizise the habit of wanting something that was well advertised, but is not very practical or good at all.
They would believe without questioning what this advertisement says about this special thing.
And of course they would need the advertised toy and a few parents would buy it to make their kids happy and quiet again.
Maybe there are people saying that the influential part of advertising is not very important.
Kids get used to it very fast and the special channels for children would earn enough money to survive.
But does this kind of ignoring the problem solve the problem?
Not in any way.
Short: It should not be allowed to show advertisements in channels only for children.
Although these channels need money to work too, it should not be earned with advertisements, because the children could not think critically enough about it.
The kids can't understand whats the secret of advertising, they can't see the lies in the fog of blinking and shining colours.
Their brain is simply not developed enough to question what they are seeing and that is indeed a rather big problem.
For the statement "Television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
",which is in my opinion an important one to discuss, can be found arguments for and against.
One argument against this statement is, that the children can learn from the television while watching, because they see what to do.
It ist a type of leraning.
They see something and they can copy it and try it on theire own.
But children are also able to learn without televison, but from theire parents and other people.
Maybe children in the age of two or three are not able to understand what goes on on television, so you do not need it.
Another argument for this statement could be, that children get used to early to it and maybe later always use it.
I more agree then disagree with this statement.
Of course you can say television advertising is a part of our society but I think it is not right in the age of two to five, because in my opinion it is not right that they could get used to it so early.
Learning from real people the children have arround them they is in my view much better then from televison.
It is easier if the parents help the children to learn new things, because they actually now how the children is reacting.
"Television advertising directed toward young children (age two to five) should not be allowed."
is an often discussed statement in this time, bacause the media with television, computer and smartphones is more present then ever.
At first it is to say, that the TV Programm nowadays isn´t really made for children in that age.
The Programm for that age is the same as for older children.
And in most families they just watch Tv with there Parents and they don´t like to watch childreens programm.
In this case they see things they aren´t supposed to see.
An other point is that if they start to watch a lot TV in this age they always want to watch TV an don´t go outside or go play with friend.
LAter they just communicate over the computer and smartphone.
They don´t learn the thinks they should.
Also a really important fact is that there health system is´t going to work well, because they just sit inside at the coach or the bed to watch some kind of stuppid program.
In my oppinion the Television adversising directed toward young children schould not be allowed.
They don´t have a childhood with the TV.
They don´t learn to play.
They get stupid, because they just know the world in the TV and not the real one on the outside.
They don´t learn to live.
The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" is a thing which is often discussed in the media today.
More and more parents allow their children to watch Tv every day in the morning and also in the evening, often the whole day but the question which we should think about is if that is good for the health and the brain quality of our children?
Children which are looking Tv every day have a more bad concentration than kids which are not looking Tv the whole day because the "Tv-kids" don´t know how to give tasks to themself and how to not going to be boring when they are alone in for example their room.
Children which are not looking Tv the whole day or not so often know how to play with themself and they have a better concentration because they can play with things longer without beeing boring after a time.
A second important point to say is that the kids which are looking Tv every day have a bad fantasy because their own fantasy is not very supported by looking Tv then in Tv everything is how the executer wrote it and the children don´t have the chance to change something in the history or to create new characters.
So their creativity has a limit but children which are not looking Tv the whole day have a much better creativity because when they play they can imagine everything and there is no limit like in the Tv.
The most important argument is that parents which decided to make children shoud take care of them and for me it´s not to make the Tv to the animateur of the children.
When you decided to have kids you have to take always care of them for the rest of your life and try to make them happy in every situation of their life.
At the end I can say that children are a big responsibility and that it should be clear that you can´t give them away when they´re getting on your nerves or if something don´t happens like you want it to happen so I think Tv advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because there are so many things you can do with them and which are making your childen more happy than just sitting towards the Tv and looking on it.
Humor and sarcasm are often used in advertises.
Sometimes they are even polarising and controversial.
The problem is that young children don't have the ability to understand the hidden messages of humor and sarcasm yet.
So they will believe almost everything that is said and are easily influenced in general, because they barely know the world they are in and there a lot of impulses they have to evaluate.
The companies, who produce for example toys for children and advertise themselves on television, are aware of this weakness and use it for their advantage.
For example they try to raise the interest of young children with bright colours, adventures and happy childrens faces.
On the other hand a child can't buy anything on his own yet.
The parents will always have the last word and it's there responsibility to watch over their children.
In our society there will always be advertisements and everyone will be confrontated by it.
So the children could already get used to it in their young ages.
In advertisements often a perfect world is presentated to convince the customer to buy the products of the companies.
Children could understand this perspective wrong and think, that the real life is presented.
This can cause various problems with their mindset and how they think the world works.
All in all televison advertisements have a huge influence on children aged two to five and can influence them a lot.
So there should be a resct
          Nearly ervery social group watvhes television but one loves it more than any other: Young children from the age two to five.
This is why brands started to develop advertisments specificcly for these kids.
In the following it's gonig to be discussed wether or not these advertisments should be allowed or not.
An argument for the advertisments is that the products are for children in that age only and seen by an adult they don't make any sense.
For example if a parent sees a toy advertisment he doesn't think my son or daughter would love to play with this but that the advertisment is too loud or the product has too bright colours.
Only when a member of the target group watches television and sees the advertisment the need for the product can really develop and the kid can ask and get on the nerves of hi/her parents in order to make them buy it .
You can tell a kid in the age between two and five nearly anything and they will believe it.
That's is why these commercials are really dangerous.
Children in this age are so influenteable that when for exapmle a little boy heres "This fire truck is the must have toy for a boy everything else is boring and he can't be a real manly firefighter!"
He will live the next few years with the thought that he never really experienced real joy while playing and he never can be a grown man just because his parents wouldn't buy or just didn't have the money to buy this one toy.
In conclusion I can personally say that these advertisments for young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed because children in this age can't understand the reason behind them and are way too much influented by them.
Oftentimes you can observe advertisements on TV or in magazines catering to children of a rather young age range.
These advertisements try to indoctrinize children into believing they need these products, such as expensive Barbie dolls, branded clothing, and so on.
Consumerism is the consequence of this madness.
Children are generally easily influenced by the actions or statements of others and therefore tend to be overly impressed in comparison to adults and teenagers.
So, when they see the new Barbie doll advertisement with its sparkling and bright colors, for instance, it can trigger outright obsessions with the advertised product.
Of course, children are incapable of buying these items themselves, but they do have the ability to coax their parents, who only wish for the best for their children and want to see them happy, into spending money on things they maybe cannot afford, or which they simply do not need.
Such commercialization of young children is immoral, since they lack the rational judgment of an adult or teenage person.
You could almost call this entire structure "exploitation" because the companies are taking advantage of the young, innocent, and unexperienced minds of children in order to make money.
Additionally, it is needless to say that the means of advertising used by the corporations themselves are more often than not flawed.
Marketing practically lives off of overstatements, false depictions or portrayals, etc., so it can shed a good light on the product to sell it, regardless of the deception that is taking place because of that.
It can be damaging for children being exposed to these illusions made by the companies, e.g.
unrealistic beauty standards in the aforementioned commercials for dolls and many more, as children are tempted to try to imitate the behavior shown in these advertisements, just as it is with everything else they see.
Therefore it can be concluded that advertisements should not explicitly target very young age groups ranging from two to five years, since this can cause mental harm such as too high expectancies of oneself and monetary damage to the children or the parents of a child.
The topic if telivision advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed is in the modern age of technic important and because of the fact that young children are more and more likely to watch television including advertisement it's imortant to think about this topic.
The main question is how high is the impact of advertisement on little children and should advertising directly towards them be forbidden.
Starting of with an argument for the topic the question is if young children are influenced by advertisement in the television.
And after thinking about the facts that young children are mentally not as good as older children and do not critizise or questioning things they see in the television it's likely that they will be influenced by advertising a lot.
After watching an advertisements younger children could be highly influenced for example with advertisement of a candyfactory and now they do not think critic about candy anymore.
But on the other hand children aged between two and five can not buy themselves things or are able to do their own decisions.
There are always their parents which should teach their children that candy isn't good for their theeth or that always having the newest stuff isn't important in life.
That is the job of the parents, so they should take care of their children and teach them how to think about advertisement and avoid an impact on the behavour of their children.
But taking a closer look on this argument you can easily see, if the parents do a bad job at teaching their children their kids get quickly influenced by advertisement, especially from advertisement directed towards them.
Little children quickly believe what they see and watching advertisements which are saying ,,You need to buy our new product otherwise you will be uncool'' or ,,if you don't buy our newest stuff other kids won't like to play with you'' will quickly have a high impact on these kids.
At least the half of the kids will start thinking the same.
So maybe they will starting interacting like in the advertisements.
Always ask their parents to buy the newest stuff or stop playing with kids in their age which do not have these new things.
All in all the topic if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed is difficult to anwer but on my opinion i think these kinds of advertising shouldn't be allowed.
The main reason is the on my oppinion too high impact on the little children which could lead to social problems.
Advertising in ourdays is the main financial resources for television companies.
Therefor they have a great interest in showing as many advertising as possible.
As you probably have once noticed, there is a huge diversity of publiciy shown directed towards all kinds of telepublic.
But should it be legal to direct specificly andverstising towars little cildren?
In the one hand, there is to be said that little children have a great impact on their parents, so when they realy want something they saw somewhere parents often buy the product.
They are in a way manipulated by their children.
It is then unfair tu push the children to manipulate their parents for buying an article seen in an advertisement.
In the other hand, there is first the responsability of the parents towards the education of their child.
Sofar it is the responsability of parents to watch as theit children don't get everything they want.
This has to be one main aspect in education ourdays, exactly because of the increasing number of advertising directed towards children.
Second, an advertisement isn't an obligation to buy an article.
Aigain here it has to be your concious decision as parent to buy or not to buy this article.
It is no case the fault of an advertisement if parents buy their children everything they desire, it is a question of education and responsability of the parents.
Finaly, I personally disagree with the statement.
Advertising is in my oppinion a very important feature of our economy and also of interest as consumer, for example when a new product is released that is in your oppinion more useful than the older one.
I think it is the task of the aducation by the parents and the state to inform the children or adult consumers about advertisement an there aim.
I think that forbidding advertising (as far as it isn't a shocking one) directed towards children isn't an issue.
My question is: Can a 5 years old child understand what an advertising is?
or How they get information about that?
Since the 20 century, the world has been changing in many ways: in electric, scientist, politics and more.
I'm agree that many young children use mobilephones, television or other electric stuff.
On the other side the advertising has been grewing up and many stors or factories are depending on advertising.
If it had a law that children in aged two to five not be allowed to watch advertising, the television would change in the programm.
In the fact, people who works by the television wouldn't send advertisement because they can't control which guy are watching TV.
An other problem is, young children can't understand what a meaning by an advertisement excactly is.
If they wanted to buy something because they saw this in the TV, the parents could decided to buy it or not.
Children can't buy something allone and normally, they don't have the money for this.
But one problem has advertising.
Advertisement about leisure activities like diving or swimming in a river or something other dangerous is for a young child a new experience to do this.
Children want always to learn new things.
I'm afraid that many accidents like this in the world has passed.
In the end i can say I'm disagree with a law because many people depending with advertisement and parents have a jop to look at their children what they do.
In one point could change the TV-Programm.
Channels for children is that a good idea.
I thing advertising makes not sense their.
This programm should be only for learn new experience and to show they what passes in the world.
Advertising is a huge deal, on TV, on the radio or in the cinema.
Children, especially young children, who watch a lot of TV are mentally not as strong as adults.
Because of that, they can be even more influenced by ads that are directed toward them.
Also, ads are mostly made in a happy, positive way so that children don't see the problems of a product such as bad quality or high prices.
On the other hand, companies need to make advertising to get the attention of the children and sell their toys.
Not only would it be hard to control the ads, but so decide if something is directed toward children or not.
Kids aged two to five can hardly buy something on their own so the parents have control over it.
At this time, 2017, the influence by other media, espcially smartphones, affects the young boys and girls even more.
To be fair, they shouldn't watch as much TV anyway, but go outside and play with friends.
There is enough advertising, so the youngest generation shouldn't also be overwhelmed by ads that are directed toward them.
In the end, adverising can't be controlled as easy, so it doesn't make sense to forbid advertising toward young children.
Nearly everybody of us has a television at home at watches TV on it.
Some of us do it more often some of us less.
But what about little children?
Should they be advertised with television?
Especially mothers with young kids are dealing and struggling with those questions.
There are different opinions on it but in the following am I going to give some arguments for both sides and my own opinion this topic.
Having a little child isn't always easy.
Not just because they cost mutch and need help with many things.
They also nearly always need attention.
They always need someone to look for and play with them otherwise they get bored and start to do stuff they're not allowed to and they better shouldn't do.
Just put them infront of the TV and letting them watch kidsprogram seems like a welcome possibility to occupy them and get some time for yourself, to do some work, cleaning the house, making dinner, whatever.
And I swear, the little will be pleased.
They will be pleased for a while but in generall is watching TV nothing that really occupies little kids.
They're not used to sit the whole time staring at something which might be funny for a little while but after some time they will start to get bored again.
But if they're not they get used to watch TV.
They might like it and start to want it more often and that is where the main problem begins.
Little children should experience the world to get to know more, to ecucate themself in a playful way.
They should maybe play with friends in the garden to experience the nature, they should bake cakes in their own little face kitchen to get fun in doing things for the houshold or they should take care of their little babydool to feel responsible for something and have something to deal and play with.
Children can't just sit infront of the TV the whole day.
Of course, it's nothing bad with it letting them watch TV maybe half an hour aday just to let them maybe watch a serie they like.
By doing that the children get used to our media world, to our advertised world in which tecnology gets more and more important.
But they shouldn't sit infront of the TV for too long.
They should play and experience the world.
So I would say that it's nt all in all bad to let young children watch TV but it defenitely shouldn't be to long, to mutch.
It's more important that they have fun and enjoy their lifes by experience by themself and not by watching other doing it on the TV.
I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Children aged two to five haven't got their own opinion yet.
Like this they are forced to do something they probably don't actually want to do.
After all they are pushed into publicity and like this they are in great danger.
Think of all the celebrities which always have to be guarded because they have so many enemies.
I also think that they can't life a normal life like this.
If they would go to school other children would envy them and they wouldn't want to spend any time with them.
On the other hand, like this they probably are going to have a clear future.
But as I sayed, it's probably not their wish to life a live like this.
An other point why this statement could be wrong in my eyes is, that these children are maybe creating their personality very fast.
But I also think that they could have lots of problems in their future because of that.
So it can be positive and negative as well.
If you love yourself too much, because you are too selfcentered, nobody will like you in the end.
Actually it could also depend on what the advert is about.
If it's for example about clothes then it's not such a big deal to me.
But it could also be about something where the children are naked.
I mean of course they are children and they can't complain, like I already sayed.
But that would somehow be pornocrafic to me.
For some reason anyone has invented clothes even for small children.
Or an other example is that it could be an advert about a exersice for children in their freetime and it could be dangerous to produce the advert.
So you're just risking the life of very small children to make an advert whichs duration will be about twenty seconds in the end.
But I think the most important point to me is the one I mentioned in the beginning.
That children which can barely walk or talk are forced to do something which is probably going to change their lifes and which they probably totaly disagree with.
They are robed by their parents, which allow something like this, and by the people which have ideas like that.
These people rob the childrens childhood to me.
The statement i will write about now is that television advertising directed toward children under five years old should not be allowed.
Against this statement is the argument that the young children are learning the language with this ads.
They are interacting with the television which may be positive for there development.
Another argument is that the kids may be entertained.
They maybe have fun when somebody in the television speaks directly with them.
In addition even if there are negative aspects in the advertising the children are not influenced very much because the brain does not remember very much when it is so young.
On the other side children can be influenced very easy, much easier then adults.
That can be negative for the development of the children.
The second argument is that children do not need advertising because the adults buy all things anyway.
Also the people in ads sometimes do things that children should not do or they say things children should not say.
Examples are maybe illegal or dangerous things to do or very unpolite words to say.
Another point agreeing with the satement is that in ads often topics are mentioned wich are not good, topics with a bad influence on the child.
That are topics that are only for adults like alcohol or sex.
All these negative aspects have a negative influenece on the child and his development.
After all these arguments I think it is important to protect the cildren from the media in their early years.
It is more important that a child has a positive development with aspects that are important in the later life.
I would say that the advertising makers are so good that they can influence the children very negative and that would not be good.
So finally I agree with the statement and in my opinion advertising directed toward young children in the televison should be forbidden.
Television advertising is often critizised especially if it comes to children and their media consume.
That's why many people think it shouldn't be allowed, but is it really necessary to permit television advertising directed  toward young children?
For the factories it is much easier to let children think they need for example this new roboter, even if they already have one, than to let adults think they need something new because adults know what television advertising want to reach and they have a better feeling about money.
Additionally children should also have a chance to know what's new on the market so they can make wishes for example for their birthday or for christmas.
On the other hand it is a problem that young children are so easy to manipulate.
The factories use it to make more money and let them think the toys they already have aren't good enough.
The children want everything that seems cool to them and if they can't have it because it's for example too expensive, they are disappointed.
So the factories take this risk only to sell more toys.
Another consequence is that the children can't be happy with the toys they already have because they saw all the new things on tv and want to have them and only want to play with them.
That makes the children unhappy and they can't appreciate their toys.
The factories send a wrong message to them.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed because there are so many reasons against it.
The most important thing for me is that the factories only want to sell more things and don't think about the children and how it affects their happiness.
In the following essay i´m going to discuss if televiosion advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
Against this statement is the fact that televison advertisment could influence the children on from a very young age.
It would be more difficult for the partens to control the developemnet of their own children.
It could interrupt or cause problems in the education of children because they start to want things that are advertised but which maybe don´t fulfill the wishes of the parents.
In favour of this statement is the fact that it isn´t proofed that the influence is strong enough to effect the childrens development so the parents just have to be careful enough that their children dind´t go crazy in their "later life".
Furthermore, the economic effections on stopping televison advertising toward young children could be drastic.
It would interrupt the whole freedom of advertising products and with this the marketing companies would lost an oppurtunity to promote their products which can led to lower sellingnumbers.
All in all, television advertising directed toward young children will stay a controversial topic because there a many reasons for and against.
In my opinion it should be allowed because it´s a theme every single parent has to deal with on their own and decide what is best for the development of their child.
The reason which led me to this opinion is mostly effected by the argument of the companies who sell products and whom would have taken away an opportunity to promote their products.
The question if young children should not be allowed to watch TV is not that easy to answer, there are a lot of pros and cons.
At first young people are much more easy to influence than adults so they may think that everything told on TV is real.
On the other hand children are often very interested in things they don´t know and they can also learn a lot while watching TV and that´s quite a good chance.
But in this young age it´s not neccessary to watch TV there are so many things they can do to learn and know what´s going on in the world.
But sometimes it´s just nice for the parentes to have a break and most of the childen like to watch TV and so the adults can do what they like and don´t alway have to do something with their children.
The last point is that there aren´t only nice and unscary movies on TV so childs can be scared or shocked by what they see.
At least i think it´s okay when children watch TV but the parentes have to check what and how long they watch.
There should be a limit which every family can discuss on their own, so the children know that they aren´t able to sit in front of the TV the hole day.
I think that it is important for the process of growing up and the individuality of everyone, to go out, meet people, make friends and so on and that´s not possible if you are just inside and never leave the house which is a risk when you have nothing to do and so just watch TV.
Television is in our modern world an object, everybody knows.
Some years ago there were not as much TV is as today.
The world changes and we have to change our live to!
The young childrens between two and five years are living with the family.
They are looking much TV and between the films and documentaries there is coming more and more advertisings.
The Television advertising leads the young people to buy things the actually do not need.
It is a Problem!
We can say that the advertising leads the young guys to buy things they actually do not need.
And they have not so much money and then they are getting in an situation were they are not able to pay.
They should invest their money to an bank, and keep the money save on it to have much money for the live after they live by Daddy and Mummy.
That is a problem, but we also have to see, that the family, special the fathers and mothers have to look that the childrens keep their money on the bank and don't buy the "rubbish" from the TV.
Maybe they should take off the TV when the advertising starts.
The shops want to buy as much as possible.
They have to give attention to their products in the community of this new generations.
The young boys and girls between two and five years are involved by the television advertising.
The advertising on TV is more "dangerous" for childrens in the higher age.
Because the teenagers have their one money and can buy such things.
They are also not every time with the adults on the way and the adults have no involvness to them.
The Television advertising leads young person in the age of two up to five not to buy these objects from the advertising.
But for the teens it could be an problem.
The teens can looking for themselves and the young children between two and five have to be "controlled" by their parents.
In my opinion, if the young children are controlled by their parents, the television advertising could be allowed.
Television - everybody watch it, no matter how old they are.
And everybody knows this situation when you watch a movie or series and then the advertising break starts.
Especially young children are often annoyed of this.
Young children don't watch so much TV, but when they do, they watch Disney Channel or something like that.
Between the different series there is often a advertising break.
The breaks shows toys, magazines, sweets or books for young children.
But should television advertising be allowed to be directed toward young children?
On the one hand, everytime seeing the lucky children in the TV with the new toy (e.g.
Barbie), they want to be as lucky as the children.
But how can they be as happy as them?
With the new toy!
So everytime when they see an advertising with a toy they like, they want it, too.
And everytime their parents get annoyed of that because they have to pay for all the toys.
And they are expensive!
But on the other hand, they see new toys and when you buy this for your children (e.g.
for christmas, birthday), they will be so happy and thankful.
And the shining eyes, little cute smile, and laugh will make your heart melt.
Only this is a reason why television advertising toward young children should be allowed.
They will find some new toys, books, magazines, which will make them smile.
It doesn't have to be expensive.
Sometimes the little things make you smile.
To sum up, when I was younger I loved television advertising because I found new stuff I like and when I get this, I was so happy.
So in my opinion television advertising should be allowed.
Advertising

I think that television advertising for kids isn't a good thing, because they have to watch TV to get this information.
When the childrens are too young they shouldn't watch too much TV or look at other displays, because that hurts the eyes after a while and the kids won't go out anymore.
If there weren't an advertisment for this kids, they couldn't can watch it.
Often informs the advertisment about things which are not comparable with the real facts or it shows you something which is made for adults and is just a little bit changed for a young child.
So the kids get connected by that with things, which are not for there age and maybe they make out of that a wrong imagination about there lifes.
On the other hand are advertisments for young children a good thing, because they can learn something new and maybe there is a good product for them.
When parents watch TV with there young children, the kid has something to concentrait on and the parents have some time to relax.
Then when the kid saw something interesting on TV the parents can buy it and don't have to go in a store.
That makes it easier for the parents and the kid has something to play with.
But another fact is that advertisments are only between two shows on TV.
When a kid can watched TV it saw automaticly the advertisments aswell.
When you don't want, that your young child didn't see an advertisment on TV, you shoudn't allow him to watch TV.
They are both not good for a human in such a young age.
I agree with this statement, because I don't want that kids get hurt and stupid from TV advertisments.
And when they are watching TV they shoudn't get some stupid information about a new play.
We all know that kids build fast their own opinion.
Thats why big companys do much advertising on kids-TV-channels to sell their products.
Everyone of us can relate to the situation that we saw an advertisement of, for example, a toy and wanted to have it really bad.
So bad, that we told our parents, we cant live without it.
Thats the negative aspect of commercials toward young children.
The kids keep the loud and colorful commercials in mind and start hurassing their parents.
In addition to that maybe the kids dont even want this toy and were just impressed of the commercial.
In some way they dont have an own opinion in this moment.
The only positive aspects are for the companys, which sell their products this way.
With their loud commercials even adults keep their products in mind.
They know how easy they can impress kids and can make fast money out of their young viewers.
Because they are the direkt path to the parents, who will buy the product to make their child happy.
In a nutshell, I think advertising toward young children is pretty bad.
In one hand, they get influenced by big companys and the parents often feel forced to make their child happy.
But on the other hand, how else can the comanys promote their products for children, when the consumers are mostly just reachable through Television.
So in my opinion are commercials in kinds-TV-channels just okay, when they dont influence them that much and when they arent that often.
We live in a time where the media just gets more important every day.
We are conencted with everybody through it and you cannot live without it anymore.
This is a great possibility for advertising.
Whenever you consum the media you need to be able to handle all these adverstisment.
Esspecially the television is known for its long breaks between TV-shows.
But how should we deal towards small children as they whatch television too.
Should you allow the advertisment directed to them too?
On the one hand, they can learn pretty much from it.
It is the phase where they start speaking and learning the language.
Whatching TV will help them.
Moreover, they become more creative due to the fact that there are many diffrent kind of ad's.
In addition, they get to know the world and what they can discorver out there.
You should also think about that they get some nice intention what they want to be interested in as advertisment shows them many diffrent situations.
On the other hand, it is not so good to be infront of the TV for little children and watching advertisment what will acctually happen if you allow advertisment for them.
Children should discover the world with their own eyes and get used to everything by themselfs and meet friends or do some sports.
Furthermore, there are advertisments that are not for their age group.
It is completley useless to age restrict movies and TV-shows if noone cares abotu this in advertisment.
Last, you should mention that children and esspecially babys have no own opinion.
They get inspired by everything and they cannot make a diffrence between the normal television and the advertisment.
That is the real problem due to the point that children get convinced so easily and fast that they want to buy everything what is in the advertisemnt.
To come to an end I think that you should not allow advertisment for young children.
It is so important that they ahve no own opinion.
If they have no chance to create it for themself they will be lsot in the future and get convinced by everything.
Watching TV in genreal shouldnt be allowed for those young children because they should rather do something outside then wasting time infront of their TV indoors.
The following Essay is about "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be alowed, do you agree or disagree with this statement?"
First young children should not sit in front of the TV.
Instead of watching advertisements which tries to explain the world for these kids, they should play outside and explore it for themselfes.
Flowers and trees are also outside and not only in the Television.
you can see Planes in the sky and not only in the TV where they are speaking.
This is blurring of their realitiy.What advertisements show should be real and known by the children.
Then why is there advertising for children aged two to five?
Programs like Kika wo are made for children, don't show advertisements.
So what are these channels kids are watching?
And even if Kika shows advertising,then at a time, normals kids should sleep.
On the other hand advertising, espacially advertising made for young children gives inspiration and more fantasy.
They get to know about things they'll never found in nature.
They get to know how something works and it's easer to understand it.
Advertising directed toward children is concepted for them.
So you won't find words they don't know or things they don't need to see.
It's all made for they're age, so it's no problem for kids to watch it.
For example Lego Duplo only works with sounds children know and with easy forms in their joy (like a Train is just a role with three balls at each side to let it "drive").
So it's just fun for them to watch advertisiment because they just don't realize it.
Finally I think it's right than children should play outside instead of watching Television but if they do it's also okay if they see advertisements as long as they are concepted for them.
I think that they really just don't realize it because it is like the series which are shown.
It's okay for them if planes can speak, that only fits in they view of life, in their fantasy.
An often discussed topic is if televison advertising directed to young children schould be not allowed.
An argument for a destriction would be that the young children did not now that the advertisement is made to convience the people to buy something.
And an outher point is that cildren did not know the weath of the money and that there is not limetless money to buy everything.
But on the outher hand side the idustie earns a lot of money when they use advertises espacelly for children and so they mabey speend there more money for new jobs and so everyone profits of this situation.
A point against a distriction might be that the childern did not even know the sence of advertising when the time of the districtin of advertising ends and in the end there are the same problems like we had before.
And in the end it is the problem of the parents when they did not inform there children or been strict it is not the problem of the idustrie.
So all in all I thing that it sould be allowwed to creat advertises especelly for young children but the childen should be more informed about advertises because only this halps againat the problems that comes with it.


Since decades the TV is an important part of the modern sociaty.
It provides information and entertainment in one.
But since a few years the television for young children ( aged two to five) became popular and with it the advertising, directed toward them.
This text will discuss wether this advertising should be allowed or not.
The major problem with the advertising to children is their strong longing for their objective, compared to adults.
The companies make use of that and try to reach the easier target group.
Once  children saw something they want, they have to get it, but can not judge how long it will be used and if it's worth the price.
On the other hand the children have to learn these abilities sooner or later and since they are so young their parents have the final word in the matter, when it comes to buying.
*
I think the television advertising directed toward young children should not be banned, but limited instead.
Children *spend their time watching the whole day in the first place.
In the end the parents have to decide if they want to let their young ones adverts, because they have to deal with the consequences.
*So the only harm, the adverts do is make some watchers sad.
Another problem, however is their increasing time in front of the TV.
Most of the people watching TV are annoyed buy the Television advertising, but not children.
They are interested in them and that supports their time spent to watching.
*are not supposed to
Advertisments take a long time span in the modern TV.
Often the adverts are personalised for the watchers.
For example on the childen-television-program there are shown adverts for games and toys.
But hasn't got this a bad influence espacially on the little children who are easy to manipulate?
Well, the economy wins a lot of money because of those little children that force their parents to buy them this specific toy or that specific game.
This is good for the economy of the whole world and means success.
They also know what they want.
A child that watches advertisments would always know what it could want as a birthday present.
And maybe an advetisment break would have the effect that those children would switch off the TV and they would go outside because they're bored of the long advert-breaks.
But this would only mean for a very few number of children.
The children that continue watching would always want to buy the things that are shown to them.
This could summon up fight in the familys and would influence the relationship between the parents and their children.
In addition these children espacially from age two to five are in their learning process.
The adverts would teach them that they are what they have.
They would know that wealth is everything because you would be able to buy much more to improve your pride and dignity.
This would mean that they wouldn't know that family and friends are much more important and that they wont ever be happy without them.
With the believe that wealth is everything they would work all their lives and would always want more.
They wouldn't ever be able to be happy and satisfied.
So in conclusion advertisment shouldn't be shown to young children that much.
It would influence them a lot and escpacially when they are that young it could have huge effects on them and their whole lifes.
They could be much more happier if they wouldn't watch that much television.
Essay:
Television Advertising toward joung children has postive and negative sites.
On the one hand many children are not allowed to watch TV at such a young age, so the ads would probably not even reach them.
But on the other hand the children, who watch television at that age, are not able to go shopping alone or to buy toys etc.
on the internet.
By seeing advertisements for those things on TV it would be easier for them to find out about the stuff they could get.
Also the childrens parents would see those advertisements and could buy for example books or toys for their children.
Young kids don't have money or a bank account.
They can't buy what they want on their own.
Their parent or older siblings are the ones who do it for them, so the advertisements doesn't have to reach the children.
But what also is important, is the fact that young children aged two to five should not watch television, because it can have bad effects on their health.
Of course their parents decide wether they are allowed to watch TV or not, but studies warn about negative side effects.
Children should use their time to meet their friends and go on a playground.
They should go outside and have fun by not by sitting on the sofa to watch TV all day.
On my opinion advertisement toward children aged between two to five should be allowed, because their parents would also see those ads and could get ideas of what to by for example for their kids birthday.
But children at that age should not be allowed to watch TV or at least they should only watch it for a short time.
Advertisement is something what everyone sees on a daily basis.
Practically every product from skin cream to cars is advertised in some way or another.
Companies need it in order to gain money.
A popular way of advertising is to do it on television since many people watch tv.
But like that many young children are prone to advertising so this creates a discussion.
Should advertisement directed toward young chilren be allowed?
It should be allowed because the companies which is specialised in the production of child products have to advertise their products and direct them to their group of costumers.
Yes, obviously the children won't buy anything but their parents will.
It can be that children will take interst in their offers.
And if they want it why shouldn't they have it?
Secondly, even if they aren't interested in their products it still won't harm them to develop some interest in the specific things.
If they don't do it when they're between two and five years old they'll just do it later.
But on the other hand the natural development of the child is stopped and it's alread prone to the "real" world of marketing before it could develop a child's view of world.
With time it will obviously change, but a nautral change is of upmost importance or else they'll become confused.
Not forget they develop the idea of marketing and exploiation of people for the accumalation of wealth for themselves.
They will develop unhealthy ways of thinking and won't try to share their stuff with others, but try to sell it.
All in all there are arguments for and against television advertisment directed towards young children.
Personally, I would have to disagree with the statement.
I don't think children this young should have television advertisements directed towards them, even though I know that there might be some advantages to it.
One reason why it should be allowed is that even children aged to to five should be made aware of all the possibilities there are for them.
By that I mean that just because they're young, they still have the right to know about all the toys for example that they could buy.
Since television advertising is one of the most popular ways to advertise these days children should have the opportunity to be 'informed' in this way as well.
Additionally, older kids and adults have television advertisements directed towards them as well, so why should it be kept from the youngest?
Also advertisements could be a helpful way to later become a part of our society since many of the commercials try to subconsciously teach the kids exactly that.
These are all the possible advantages that I could think of.
On the other hand there are so many reasons as to why television advertising should not be directed at all toward young children.
For one, children of this age are not supposed to be watching much television in the first place so it wouldn't actually be very useful to direct advertisments at them.
But if they do a major problem would be the pressure they were under in order to feel accepted.
Older kids do have these issues as well but children between two and five are still in such an extreme learning phase of their life that this manipulation would affect them way to easily.
Apart from that it shouldn't be a concern of young children to be a functioning part of our society since this society is not anywhere near perfect anyways.
For me the major reason why I disagree with the statement is because children of this age are first of all easy to be manipulated into thinking they need to buy the things advertised in order to be cool and accepted and secondly because they should be exploring the world with their own eyes.
By that I mean going outside, having a lot of family time, meeting up with friends and not sitting in front of the TV.
If they do want to buy something new they could simply go to a store instead of watching advertisements and expanding their wish list with every new advertisment.
In conclusion, I very much disagree with the statement despite the few advantages.
I think they will be manipulated by media later in their life anyway.
It is important to at least have a healthy basis in life, a time in which the childrens' happiness didn't depend on media and being cool.
Therefore I think no television advertisement should be directed toward children of the age two to five.
Nowdays we are getting completly stuffed with adverst.
No day pases without us getting influenced to buy a new decetn prduct.
Like this the firmen creat new needs in us.
There is even advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five).
But insn't this a immoralic behaoiver?
Can people really try to influence little kids?
Firt things first I have to make clear that every big Firma wants to make buisness to get  money
.
This is the point of our capitalistic system.
So we should not critizize them.
It is only right to promotea product you have invested a big amount of thime in.
Even if it is to young children.
They cant buy themselves anything anywys.
So the parents are responsable to manage their kids and show them what they need and what they dont.
If their kids want something they saw at a tv commercial.
They have to show them the real velure of this  promoted thing.
But in the oppoite I have to mention that like this kids are teached a wrong sytem of values in their life.
Espacilly in this young age the kids get used to this kind of behaviour quit fast and they keep it for their lifetime.
A complety other point that is worth to mention is the stess for the parents that this comercials create.
Pleas immagine the following situation.
Your little 4 year old boy just saw the recent tv commercial for a fidget spinner and it gets fascineated by this things.
You hear it day after day that he wants to have this thing.
Parents get annoyed and kids get sad.
SOme parents cant stand tjis feeling.
SO what are they going to do?
Corecct they will buy it.
At this point we get back to the point I already mentîoned.
Kid getverwöhnt and learn a wrong system of values.
As a conclusion I can say that firmen should be allowed to adverstise products for young children.
But only for thigs this kids really need.
So it hould be forbidden to create new useless needs in young children.
Because they are influenced really fast.
But in the end it all comes down to the parents.
They have the most influence on their kids.
Even if this adverts are allowed in the future the parents have the might to teach their kids the real values in life.
LOL
"Should television adverstising directed toward young children be allowed?"
This is a difficult qustions and a controversial topic.
On the one hand the direct adverstising is a possibility that children can decide on their own if they would like to have the advertised product or not, on the other hand the cildren aged 2 to 5 do not understand the function and the system of adverstising.
Some people might say they learn it when they grew up with advertising directed toward them and can handle it better and earlier.
But i think the young children would like to have every product they see on tv.
This can causes big conflicts with their parents because they can not and often dont want to buy everything their child want to have, for example toys or sweets.
Of course there exist also a lot of "good" products for young cildren but they do not figure the right ones out.The parents of young children know what their kids really need.
Thats why I agree with the statement that the advertising directed toward children aged two to five should not be allowed because it influences the kids too strong and they can not handle it because of their age.
Nowadays watching TV is a common thing.
Advertisements effect all of us.
Sometimes we don't even realise what effect advertisements have on our actions and mind.
For example: we tend to buy products we know and having seen them in an advertisement once, we automatically think we know it.
Most adults are aware of the effects advertising has on us.
But it comes to a problem when advertisement is shown to young children.
They get effected by advertisements extremely indirectly as they do not know the intentions of it and sometimes don't even understand the content, which sometimes isn't appropriate for children at this age.
On the one hand I agree that televison advertising to young children should not be allowed, on the other hand I think that there's no way to set a law for this.
The government can't control if there is any young child watching TV at a specific time and therewith can't control if any child is watching the advertisement it isn't supposed to watch.
In our society we would have to stop all kinds of television advertising to make sure young children don't get affected.
So I think it's up to the parents to make sure their children only get to watch what is appropriate for them instead of not allowing television advertising.
Everthing what a little children sees, he or she wants to have.
The question is: Is it right to show thus little children an advertising?
I agree with the statement above, it should not be allowed to show a television advertising directed toward young children because children can not buy the toys themselves because they does not earn money.
They are dependent to their parents who earn the money.
In contrast to that the children also need their toys and they should decide themselves which toy they want to have.
On one hand colours and sounds are everthing what children want to hear and see and these things lead the children to their decision.
Following everthing with colours and a nice sound many children want to have.
They do not think about the question if the toy is useful.
Thus the toy they want to have is usually useless.
But on the other hand the children have the right to have an own opinion.
For example they should decide if sounds and colours are what they want to have and if they only want to have colours and nice sounds they should get the toys which they see in the television also if they are useless.
Finally you have to mention that children do not bear responsibility.
They are not old enough aged two to five.
They can not render an own decision.
They are not responsible enough to buy their own things.
For that part of their life they have their parents who have to decide it.
And althoug if they want to have an own opinion they can go with their parents together into a shop and buy their toys there.
To come to a conclusion I still follow my first statement that it should not be allowed to show a television advertising directed toward young children but only to their parents.
With the advance in modern technology and it being normal that every household owns at least one tv, there come many problems parents face when raising their children.
How old should they be when they start watching television?
Will watching tv make my child dumb?
How will the ads on tv affect my child?
In this essay I will discuss the pros and cons of advertising on tv for children.
Everyone knows those moments when right at the most interesting part of a movie, suddenly there's a break.
Those annoying times when one ad follows another and there just doesn't seem to be an end to it.
But that's not all there is to advertising.
The whole point of ads is to convince people if not even manipulate them into thinking they need a certain product.
For adults this might not always be so affective as with children.
Adults have a certain amount of self discipline and an understanding of money.
Whereas children will see something thy like and not think any further.
So if a child sees an ad for a toy on the disney channel, it is most likely going to go whine at thier parent to get them this toy.
So aren't advertisment companies using young children to make more profit off their parents?
Isn't this "unfair"?
Some my agree but others might see it differently.
The situation of a child wanting something from their parents, already existed long before the tv.
Just think of all the crying children you see in supermarkets throwing a tantrum just to get that pack of biscuits they like.
So some people might say that televison ads can't be blamed for parents not disciplining their children.
A problem might be that if a child grows up already influenced by ads on television they will grow up thinking that it's normal to see something on tv and then going out to buy it.
So the process of learning how to spend money wisely is much more difficult, especially if their parents never take the initiative toteach them properly.
Something to consider is that children don't just get confronted with ads on tv.
Everywhere in the streets, in the supermarket, even through friends, children get influenced into wanting to buy products.
Then again it's the parents' responsability to discipline their child and not rely on society to do that job for them.
All in all I believe that television ads should not be banned for children because it can help them understand how to spend money more wisely and it can increase their self discipline by being experiencing what it is like to not always be able to get what they want.This of course only works as long as parents take responsibility and show their children how to do this.
The question if television advertisment should be directed to young children or not can be seen in different ways: On the one hand side children can tell or show their parents what they think they will like and what they will not like before the parents go shopping, so maybe the parents save a bit of money.
It also is the parents' choice if they let their children sit in front of a televison or not, so they decide if it is acceptable to let their child watch the advertisment on the televison.
On the other side people in advertisments sometimes do impossible things which for example would cause injuries, but as children do not know that, they could copy the people in the advertisment and could hurt themself.
It can also influence their social life: If some children are not allowed to watch televison or less than others and they do not see an advertisment about a product but everyone else does and gets it, they could get excluded by the others.
Furthermore it can influence a childrens life in a bad way, especially as they cannot see the dangerous things inside the products the advertisment is about.
If they watch televison alone and the add comes up and then later they go with their parents grocery shopping, they will not understand if their parents do not want to buy the stuff because inside is something dangerous.
If the parents let the child have the product they saw on televison and the parents do not check what inside the product is, they could eat or touch toxicated things.
The statement that television advertising should not be allowed for young children is not right i think.
On the one hand it is right that children have to play in the garden or in their rooms or anywhere else but on the other hand it is sometimes okay when they are watching TV.
You can use Television advertising for new languages for example.
From aged two to five the children learn very fast.
It is easier to learn something in this age.
Exspecially languages.
So the children in germany could watch english films.Our community is very national today, so it is very important that people speak languages, exspecially english.
For jobs, for traveling and many other things.
Further more television advertising shows many situations and there are many special canals for children so it is easier to understand.
Watching TV is not only watching TV it is a way of learning.
The children see pictures and maybe someone explain it so it is the first part of learning in a easy way.
Nevertheless in my opinion the children are watching to much TV.
Many parents sit their children in front of it so they have free time and this is so wrong.It is so important that children are going outside and that they are meeting friends and play games and that they have fantasy because this is the best part of our life to be a child.
Children have to espect the reality and not the fake world in the TV.
They have to experience their life and they have to live the real life of a child.
Another point is that their are many situations in TV which are not really good for children.
They show horrible things and the children get fear.
In my opion Television advertising should be aloud but the parents have to watch out which canals the child is watching.
So it is no problem and is more a help for children, exspecially when they watch TV in a other language.
In our modern society we often watch television.
Especialy kids like watching it, instead of going outside and play with other children.
They watch programms directed toward them for more fun in watching it.
But because many kids now don't go out, should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
First of all, we are a digitalized society.
Computers, mobile phones and televisions are parts of that society.
Young children should be introduced in using those technologies as early as possible, so when they get older they won't have any problems in using it.
That's the reason why television advertising directed toward young children is a good idea.
Such an advertising makes it funnier for children to learn something about digital thecnologies and often those programms also teach them in counting and social habits as sharing and the importance of friendships.
Second, parents have a short break while their children are watching those programms.
On the other hand, television advertising directed toward children makes the kids stay at home and watch television.
They are sitting in front of the display, often alone, and learn something about friendship, instead of going outside, and actually make friends.
Not to talk about the importance of fresh air and moving, they don't have when they act like this.
All in all television advertising directed toward young children has it's importance, because it can teach the children in some stuff and parents have a short break when their children are watching tv.
But there shouldn't be to many programms like this.
So children also have time to go out and have fun.
Imagine you were younger, remember your childhood when you were in the age between two and five.
You probably watched tv and the advertisements very often.
But should the advertising directed to young children be forbidden?
The advertisemnt is very important to show the children which sweets or games are modern and where you can get them.
Due to that  fact it is much easier to find a new present for their birthday or for other children.
For example if the children watch a "HARIBO" advertisment on TV, they are interested in the new product and the parents going to buy it.
Another positive aspect of the adverstising is that the kids think more about the different products which they could buy.
After they watch some different ads they easily know which products they like the most and which ones not.
The advertisemnt could help the children to built their own opinion about the products and compare it to other ones.
On the one hand the tv advertising helps the children to find new products and they can play with them together with friends, on the other hand the young children are influenced by the advertising in a negative way.
For exemple they watch a commercial about a new "Barbie" and they just think about that "Barbie" and not about other products.
The influence of the advertising is very onesided and the young children do not know much about other products, they are fixed on one product.
The next negative point is that a young child thinks that he/she has to have the product and if the childe does not get the product, it could be less "cool".
In my opinion the advertising directed to young children should not be allowed due to the fact that it influences their opinion in a negative way.
They are just fixed on one product and cannot think about ohter possibilities of the product.
The advertising manipulates the children and they are victimes of the big companies which make a lot of money with the
I agree with this statement.
It should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward young children.
This could be really bad for their development.
If children at the age between two and five get involved with television advertising, They could become really materialistic and no one would like to have a child, which only cares about materialistic stuff.
A child shouldn't care about such things at all.
It would be a problem for the parents aswell because their children would start to want everything whats in the television advertising.
They have always to say no and this could affect their relationship really bad.
For exemple if a young child gets everything it wants, because the parents never say no, the child will become really bad.
As it gets everything it wants, the child has no strict rules or something like that.
On the other hand there will be parents, which won't allow their children to buy anything.
This children will always see the television advertising and know:"I never get that from my parents."
This children will start to lie sooner because they want to have at least something "cool" or to do "cool" things.
But the television advertising isn't the general problem.
The real problem is that young children shouldn't watch television so often.
They should play outside an meet their friends to play soccer or catch and hide.
They should run around instead of sitting alone at home in front of the television.
So if the producers make advertising directed toward young children, it isn't completly their fault, because parents have to look after their children.
So they should be able to control with which influences their children get in touch!
I come to the conclusion that eventough it's really bad for the development and behaviour for children to watch television advertising which were directed toward them, it's not the entire fault from the producers and the television industry.
Because if there weren't that much children, which are watching television, the big companies haven't had the idea of directing television advertising toward such young children.
So you could say I agree totally with the statement, that it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward young children, but if there wasn't such a big amount of children which are watching television there wouldn't exist television advertising toward them.
Of course it has to be said, that buisness is and will always be buisness.
A marketing strategy is not being guided by what is right nor by any moral standarts one may have, but solely on what works.
But as the question isn't if ads are being directed towards children or not, nor if it works or not, the question is if it should be allowed.
Children are proven to be more submissive and more easily influenced than adults.
If you don't believe that, just look at how vulgar words are being learned by children just by hearing adults say them.
Advertising in Television isn't really a problem, if you have raised your child properly and are financially stable.
If you have not raised your child properly it could be a problem, but just a mediocre problem.
It just tends to be really annoying for the parents.
The child sees a toy it wants on TV and hell breaks lose.
The cry and beg until they get what the want, because the mother or the father will eventually give in, in order to get them to shut up.
The real problem is if you are financially unstable, might be working more than one job, and as a result don't have that much time for your kids.
You put them infront of the TV as it just is convenient.
And if you get home after a double shift, you are in pickle, either you give in because you are tired, as a result you either can't buy the toy because of financial reasons and dissappoint your kid, or make debt, or you endure their nagging.
All three are either bad options for the kid or for you.
ALthough having stated only reason for why it should be banned, I am of the opinion that it shouldn't be, the right thing to do would be to boycott coorperations which use this technique.
As we shouldn't be forced to do something by the government but by society.
Television-advertisments are more and more directed to children that are younger and younger.
But sholud advertisments for young childs really be aloud, I will explain you my point of view in the following paragraphs.
Young children watch a lot of cartoons and other series targeted at them, so by putting advertismentss befor and after this kind of series could help promote toys and other thing.
Also the ads would not come up after some ation movies and would not annoy older people.
Whre else then on television the kids see the advertisments, nowhere so this is perfect.
Plus the simplistic language could also help the kids so they might hear other words they are not used to hear in normal circumstances.
Advertisments for smaller children should be prohibited because it is unessecary and they do not understand the most of it any way.
If small children see to many advertisments the could be tricked into thinking the world is full of toys and other good stuff but really it is not.
They might harass their parents because the want all the things they saw on televission but the parents probaly are already at the limit of their strenth and in most case the probably do not have all the money to buy everything.
The avertisments for young children should go over the parents because they know best any way what is good for their kids and what not.
I think if you do not abuse your position as an older and broadcast advertisment that are reasonable and in reasonable amount it is totally correct to make avertisments for young children aged two to five.
But in the end you have to thinks about them and their parents to not overflow them with false impressions.
I agree with the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
for the following reasons.
First of all, it is very easy to influence young children, because they can not prove if a statement is true or false, they just agree with these people and do not think on their own.
For example when there is an advertising for coke, the children think it is great and they want their parents to buy it, even though it is bad for them (because of the sugar and the caffeine).
Furthermore, todays young children sit in front of the TV an enormous long time and when there is a lot of advertising, even on the prgramms for young people, they spend much more time watching TV than playing outside ore studying for school.
For example when they want to watch a TV series of thirty minutes, it takes about fourty-five minutes, only because of the advertising.
On the other hand, there are helpful advertisings, too.
Sometimes you can see a show with information about internet-sites to study maths or a new language.
This is very useful for their future in school or later for university.
In summary, I think television advertising for young children should not be allowed, because in my opinion they should make their own experiences with all the mentioned issues in the advertisings and they should spend much more time of their childhood outside, to move and build social contacts.
In the following text, I will argumentate for and against the statement if television advertising directed toward young children, aged two to five, should not be allowed.
At the end, I will also show my own opinion for this statement.
On one side, children aged two to five normally don't watch television.
The are some senders like 'Super RTL' or 'KIKA' in german free TV, which is especially for children, but you can normally see films and series for children aged six or seven.
In cause of that there isn't a high rate of danger for children watching TV.
But on the other side, a danger is, that younger children will watch more and more often TV, when they see in the televison advertising for example a trailer for films and series in the following days.
They wish is also to watch these films and will sit more often in front of the TV.
But if television advertising for young children is not allowed, children could be also protected against agressive advertising, for example advertising which is especially made for boys like fights, crimes and more.
In addition to that, you can see wissensreiche advertising and information children can learn from it.
They can also be prepared with its new knowledge for school and the normal life.
In my opinion , television advertising should be allowed also directly for younger children.
I think that the advertising you can find especially in german TV is very altersgerecht and not agressive.
You can let your child watching TV without having any bad thoughts.
There are also advertising about school life, so that also children of younger age could be prepared for primary school.
The amount of TV-advertising increased throughout the last years and still increases.
Even channels for children are full of advertisement for toys and other products for toddlers.
Should these advertisements directed toward very young children be prohibited?
Due to the digital age and modern family structures, young children tend to spend a lot of time watching television.
When I was young, for instance, I was usually allowed to watch television at the weekend only, whereas nowadays my younger brother can watch his favourite TV-show every day.
This negative trend should not be encouraged by advertisements for childrten aged two to five.
Furthermore, young toddlers are too easy to manipulate and take the advertisement-promises for granted, as they are not yet able to question the credibility of advertisements.
On the other hand, there are many companies selling only products for young children, like "Playmobile".
They must be allowed to advertise for their products, otherwise they would have a great disadvantage compared to other companies.
Moreover, advertisinng agencies should be able to decide on the target group of their advertisment.
It is simply not acceptable to deprive them of their freedom of choice.
In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children must not be forbidden, because every company has to sell their products, thus it is indeed appropriate to advertise for products on TV-channels, which are popular among children.
When you watch television one thing you notice more and more is television advertising directed toward young children.
There are advertisments for Barbie or other puppets as well as advertisments for computer games.
Now I wondered if this is a bad thing and if this should be allowed or not.
On one hand this is advertisments are great because they give children ideas for what they want to have for their next birthday or christmas.
It's also much easier for parents or other relatives to get the presents for the children if they can give them detailed information, that they got from an advertisment.
It's also a great thing for the advertisment industry because they can spread the news about their new toys faster than they could before whn there were only posters.
And if parents really don't want their children to see those advertisments in television they can still forbid their young children to watch television completety.
But on the other hand the children might watch television when they're at their friends' home without their parents knowing and then they still see those advertisments.
The only way to prevent that to happen would be, that the parents forbid their children to go and meet their friends but parents can't do that because that would not be good for the child either.
And children seeing those advertisments can be really dangerous, because young children are easy to confince that they really need something and that might be a real problem for families that don't have enough money to afford all those new toys and computer games.
The children might become really upset when they don't get or have what they see in television all the time and some will envy those, who get all the new toys from the advertisments.
Others, who can't aford them, might be bullied in kindergarten or when they play with other children.
It could also happen that a child, that doesn't own for example the newest Barbie, can't play with its friends anymore because all the other kids have these super new, technical Barbies that can speak and dance.
This child will feel really isolated and depressed.
All in all I think that those advertisments schould not be allowed, and I also think that children of the age of two to five shouldn't even be allowed to watch television at all or only sometimes.
I personally don't like the idea that they are already influenced by advertisments.
Nowadays, many advertisements are directed to children in the age of two to five years.
But should this marketing strategie be allowed or is it to be seen critically.
In the following Essay I will controversially discuss the topic and give my opinion.
The fist thing that came to my mind when I read about this kind of advertisement was :"How can that be effective".
Normally, at that age, parents purchase everithing their children need.
They know and decide what to buy, not their children.
And even if they would listen to them, the least could express their wishes on what to buy from which brand precisely.
The most critical point about the whole topic is in my opinion that children from two to five years are very easy to take influence on.
Although in that time, they probably won´t buy any of the products which are advertised, they might remeber the brand and make their parents buy it later on.
That way the early advertisement would have an effect.
I personally don´t think that advertisement directet towards young children should not be allowed because in the end the parents have to decide on what to buy.
In addition there are multiple advertisements directet to any group of people, with the direct goal to manipulate them, and make them buy different things.
They are allowed too.
Should television advertising directed to young children not be allowed?
Kids are wonderful.
Especially when they are at the age from two to five they see and learn new things all day and it is a blessing to be able to watch that.
And parents are playing a big role in this learning process.
Now imagine the kids are watching TV and they are trying to understand all these advertisements.
They would asked questions like "what is he doing there?"
or "why is he doing this or that?"
or "what does this or that mean?"
which is normal for kids.
But wouldn`t it be beautiful to see the children noticing and learning all these things by themself?
Because in the television not everything is good.
There are also strange and sometimes also bad things in advertisements which I don`t want my kid to learn from the TV.
I mean don`t get me wrong advertisements are not usually bad  they are actually pretty good often in times.
People are always searching for new ideas of getting the attention of the whole world which is pretty impressive on my opinion.
I just think that there are better ways for young children to understand life and get used to everything.
It is just way better to play in the garden and enjoy the nature for example.
In my humble opininon television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
In fact, the children in the age of two to five shouldn't watch tv at all.
It is also quiet ineffective to direct Television advertising toward the young children because the aim of advertising is to sell their products but in the age of two to five you dont even realise what is going on in this advertisement and it doesnt affect you to buy this stuff.
Television advertising can also be dangerous for the children: many advertisements have plenty of things which could affect the children by showing violence for example.
In the childhood, watching tv without parents is dangerous.
The parents should allow the children to watch specific Programms on specific times.
This way doesnt have to watch advertisements at all.
The Television advertisements for "pampers" are rather made for the parents than for the children themselves.
But I dont see the purpose why the adults should buy this product because they saw it in a television advertisement.
To sum it up the parents are responsible for their children not the advertisement company.
Thats why it is not necessary to forbid the television advertising directed toward young children.
chuchichäschtli
In my opinion, television advertising directed toward children should not be allowed.
First of all, children in this age are more llikely to believe everything.
Therefore, advertisments with talking animals would spreed a wrong reality in the heads of young children.
On the other hand, television advertisments can pay the child's attention to thing they interested in but never heard of it before.
For example, if they watch an advertisment about the Heide Park in Germany.
They might be totally excited to go there so they plan a family trip and have a lot of fun and a great experience.
So in this case, the family that did not know about the Heide Park would have missed an awesome family day if the child would not have seen the advertising on the television.
But this excitments could be used by companies.
Instead of wishing the best for the children, they use the advertisments to manipulate them and to make a high financial gain.
The companies tell them that their product is needed to bhe happy.
All in all, I think advertisments to children should not
In the following text I am going to write about the statement if television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
First of all on the one hand young children maybe do not know what they are wishing for christmas or their birthday.
If they watch TV they can get an idea of what they want.
On the other hand television advertising directed toward young childen can have such a massive impact on them.
In those young years you do not know what you actually want.
Every day children discover something and learn something new.
So if the television tells them to like that or do this is has a such a big effect on them because they do not know yet what the main things in the world are.
The television may teach them a not appropriate language and espacially when their brain is improving it can have a bad influence on them.
Furthermore children from two to five do not know what they are even watching.
You do not understand the concept of television at all at such a young age.
They might get in the situation where they don not know what is reality and what is imagination.
The worst case it can get to is that the children only want to watch TV because it is so new and interesting for them.
In these young ages you should not just sit in front of the TV and watch this stuff all day long.
You sould go outside and play with your friends and get to know the real world.
I agree with the statement and in my opinion television advertising directed young children should not be allowed.
As a child with the age two to five you should get to know the real world.
You should get to see what you can do in this world.
You definitly should not sit in front of the television and maybe even get used to an not appropriate language.
Many young children watch TV on a daily basis.
Mostly they do not only watch series for the right age that leads to them watching television advertising.
Of course,advertising is not bad in general but it could lead to arguments within the family.
For example because the children want their parents to buy a new toy that they saw in the TV.
The parents could easily get annoyed if their kid always asks for new thiongs to try.
And as all of us know, advertising often does not promote the truth.
That is another negative aspect because we, the consumers tend to believe anything that is told on TV and we spend a lot of money because we want our kids to be happy and we want them to have a childhood that is worth to be remembered.
Also many advertisements are not useful and distract children from learning things that are important.
They may try what is shown and get hurt.
On the other hand it does not really matter if they watch it.
They easily get used to it and get inspirde to try new things at a young age and that is not bad at all.
They do not even pay attention to what is shown and often get distracted.
And I think that the parents should be able to control what their children are watching, they should dicide what is good for their kid and what is not.
To sum it up, I am of the opinion that it does not matter if a child watches televisdion advertising or not.
In our television are advertisments every time between series or just in a break between them.
But who should be directed?
Only adults and teenager or also young children?
Children also watch TV but not the very young ones.
If parents allow their kid to watch TV they also have to know what they will see.
Not only which program , also what they see inbetween , that means things like advertisments.
Young children shouldn't
 watch TV often but if they do , they can also see what they see in toy shops or other shops.
Advertisments show games and toys in a special light , that means in the best way, but parents have to control what kids get and why.
The children also see the advertisments by visiting a friend who has got this amazing toy so it depends on the parents if they tell the kid what is real and what is fake.Some kids also can see what they could wish for christmas or their birthdays so you don't have to go to a shop and stay there for hours because your kid can watch TV and all the toys and games in there.
That can be useful for the development of the kid so it learns from a young age what media does.
There are also programs with no advertisment at all so if you don't want to forbide the television you could install only these programs.
But on the other hand there are some negative facts about advertisment to yound kids.
A lot of kids haven't got so much money and they also watch TV.
When they see these advertisments they want some toys like other kids but they know or get to know that they haven't got the money.
That could make them feel bad and not good enough compared to other kids.
Another fact is that they don't know what is real about this advertisments and what is not.
Maybe they think the "Playmobil" firemen can really walk but in real they have to move them by hand.
They also can't know what is useful and what is not that could make them want things they don't need and maybe they get them but in the end they are disappointed because they thought it would look or be different.
If the children are allowed to watch TV the programs should be useful for example a school cartoon which helps them to learn maths or something but it should not be unuseful by showing a lot of things they will never get.
I think advertisments to young children shouldn't be alloweed because you can go in a shop and see which toy you like and then your kid knows what it is in real life and can think about wanting it or not.
In the following text i will write an essey about the influence of advertising television to young children.
At this time, the beginning of the 21st century, a lot of people, especially young people and children, are watching TV and get automaticly much information about whats modern at the moment,what seems to be nice to own etc.
...
Depending on what program you use the most, you get best advertisment fitting your interests.
Young children are usually whatching programs fitting their age so they might get shown creative activities, modern toys and because of that they can get impressions of how to be creative.
Furthermore they are learning to become carefully and learn about the possible risks if they are discussing this with their parents.
The problem which could come up is that children at this age are believing many things they hear and see and dont know about these risks what would become a problem if they dont talk about it with their parents e.g.
Today its easy to get acces to the intenet and their were already problems internationally known of children buying things or games on the intenet, not knowing they cost money.
In my opinion it shouldnt be allowed influencing children on porpuse with advertisment beacause of the reason i talked about above and the fact that children shouldnt spend that much time infront of the TV, sometimes just waiting a long time for their TV show, bacause advertisment is on screen.
"Mom, I'm bored, what can I do?"
"I don't know, why don't you go watch some TV?"
This is a conversation between a mother and her child which is quite normal these days.
It is easy having children sitting on the sofa, watching TV all day and not doing any noise.
You do not have to worry that your children get lost when they are in your living room instead of playing outside.
You do not have to play with them yourself when they can watch easily TV.
And why not?
I mean, it is perfect when your children are not bored neither annoying neither communicate with friends or doing some sports.....Exactly.
Children cannot make friends with anybody if they are just sitting on a sofa all day long and even if they have friends and they are watching TV together they do not learn social contact, they do not learn how to do a conversation.
Furthermore when children do not move much when they are young they often get really unconcentrated when they get older, so they could have problems of paying attention at school.
Moreover children could get health problems by watching TV all day long!
It is not just that it is not good for their eyes, it is the fact that they can get really fat when they are eating without moving and doing some sports.
And being fat is really, really unhealthy and also dangerous for children being bullied at school!
Because of all those arguments, I think it would be a good idea to permit television being directed to children under five years.
Nobody wants their children to get unconcentrated students or lonely and normally if people get children they also want to spend some time with them, right?
I would even say that children under ten should not watch TV, because It is that bad.
But most important is, in my opinion, that they do not get used to that consum of media that early.
So that they could have enough time to get smart, sporty and healthy humans, which is definetly not possible while watching TV!
In todays life advertisements are everywhere.
On the TV, in the streets or even at railway stations.
Because our children watch more and more TV than earlier, the companies produces more and more also advertisements for children.
The text try to give a answer on the question hould this be allowed or not.
One reason to support this idea is that the advertisings could have a bad impact on the children.
For example when they see a ad for chocolate and want to buy them.
That could also be a reson that kids are more overwighted nowadays.
In some cases the could that the children eat more sweets.
Another point is that they tend to do what they see.
That could end that the children watch a lot of TV instead of go outside and move.
On the other hand it can be a good thing when the advertisings are good made.
They could teach the children to be polite, go with a smile through your life and so on.
In the end the parents of the children can still decide whether the children can watch TV.
The children
In the following, the statement "Television advertising directed toward young childre (age two to five) should not be allowed will be discussed.
First of all, one could support the statement by saying that the advertisement could influence or even manipulate children at such a young age.
Young children are not aware of the influence that advertisement might have on them and they do not understand that some advertisement is unrealistic and creates a wrong picture of some situations.
For example, there are advertisements in which a girl talks to a cow that produces yoghurt.
Advertisements like that might make children of a very young age believe that they will have the ability to talk to cows once they ate the yoghurt.
They will be unhappy to realize that they will not have that ability.
On the other hand, one could say that there is no problem in advertisement directed toward yound children because children cannot be prevented from advertisement anyways.
Even if advertising directed toward young children would be prohibited, they would most likely see advertisement directed toward older children or adults.
This could cause problems because the advertisement could be unappropriate for a young child if they are about controversial toppics.
The influence that this could have on children can be much worse than the influence of advertising directed toward them.
Therefore I believe that children should rather be introduced to advertisement that is appropriate for their age so they have time to realize that the advertisement is meant to influence them and can learn to cope with the effects that advertisements have on them.
As a responsible parent, one could also talk to your children about television advertising and its impacts.
Television advertising directed to children aged two to five years is a theme which is important in our century.
Many kids watch TV.
Sometimes with older brother ore sisters but also some children get an television for them selfes.
This is not the problem.
But when they watch TV automatically advertisions are directed to them.
Like toy advertistions ore advertisions for a new holiday park.
What is good on the advertisions is, that they could give the kids new inspiration for wishes, ore things they would like to do.
Also they can take a short break from watching TV to go in to the bathroom to make themselfes ready for sleeping ore they can loose their will to watch TV when there is always a short break in between there series ore film.
Advertising is allowed so children know what it is and what the will from the producers is.
But children from two to five are maybe to small to get the right message, which the advertise produces.
It can be completely incorrect in understanding ore the children get to know things which the shouldnt.
Parents have no influence which advertise their kids see, and which not.
For example a kid wich is two years old sees an advertise which is directed to children who are aged five.
The smaller kid thinks about the advertise and maybe it was an holiday park were kids under five are not allowed.
In this case the message is wrong for the two year old kid but it has seen it already.
This is one example how the children can missunderstood the messages which these advertise produce.
In my opinion advertising directed to kids aged two to five should be not allowed.
There are to many things in the world which the can explore themselfes.
They dont need advertises after every series they watch.
Especially because they mostly did not watch so much television that they see advertisions.
Mostly they watch one series ore film and when the film is over the parents turn off the TV and so they did not watch the advertise, which starts in normal case, right after it.
The question if television advertising towards young children should be allowed or not is not easy to be answered since the opinion of society towards this topic is divided.
On the one hand, it could really help children with developing their character.
It is often said that children should be able to develope own wishes, thoughts, preferences and hobbys without being told by their parents what to do and what to like or not.
This developement of character structures should start at young age and since enfants can't just go outside and explore everything that is possible, television advertisements can be a perfect way to show them their opportunities.
But even if it's said that television is the place where everything is possible and everything can be shown, it can' show the real world.
Television advertisement often is unreal, shows things more perfect than they are, doesn't matter if we're talking about toys, food or outdoor activitys.
The technical industry uses many programs and tricks to make things look different from what they really are.
From time to time, the modern advertising became more unrealistic and the problem is that young children often are not able to understand the difference between advertising and reality.
That's why the modern things which are advertised are also a problem.
Violent games and toys, beautyproducts which are giving an unrealistic picture of beauty and many other things are taking over the toy market and show children an unrealistic picture of the world and living in it.
Sure children can be inspired with wishes and preferences by advertisements, but these days it's usual that television advertisements are also telling children what to like, not to show them what is possible.
I think that television advertisement in general is not bad for children, as long as it's really made for them.
But when I'm watching TV and an advertisement includes violence, an unrealistic representation of beauty or other things children should not be confrontated with, I'd prefer my children to do other things to get inspired.
Everybody knows the moment when they watch a movie or a serie on TV at home and every fifteen minutes there is some advertising.
On older people these ads doesn't have a big impact but if young children, aged two to five, watch these ads, do the ads have an impact on them?
In the following text I will analyse the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".
On one hand many ads concern things that a little child should not see, such as things with harm or sexual content.
The children at this age are easy to influence and they are in a learning process all the time.
So if they see something, they copy it because they think everything what they see is the right thing to do.
But on the other hand, most of the ads are harmless and about shampoo or travelling.
Children aged two to five normally don't watch channels concerning advertising such as Pro7 or Sat1; so it would be not necessary to forbid advertising on these channels.
I think, Television advertising directed toward young children should still be allowed because the Kids often only watch Kika, which doesn't concern advertising.
In my oponion, parents have to decide by themselves if they let their kids whatch TV or Advertising or not.
I think, children at this age would better play outside with other kids, than watching TV inside the house; but that's to decide by the parents.
Sometimes when I sit infront of the TV at home there are these ads, which are obviously made for children.
To this, there are many positive, but as well neative points to this.
At first, what is the point of an ad?
It is to sell something.
But to sell something to a child is not really fair, because a child of the mentioned age (two to five) is not really able to make decisions in wether he would spend an amount of money for something or not.
The professionals behind these ads have to know this, so they are using kids in an unfair way to make money an adult wouldn't spend.
Despite of this, there are few positive things about it as well, for example the kids would see some things their parents wouldn't show or even buy them.
The kids are a little bit more independent from their parents, they can choose the toys they like themselves and not the ones their parents like them to play with.
But there is the next negative point: Kids change their minds very fast, so if they had money, they would buy just everything they like, what is quite much.
So obviously as a parent, you can't just buy anything your child would like to have, which would make your child unhappy, what would make you angry and so on.
And a next reason for not being necessary is that when you take your child to a shopping mall, they can see all those things as well, and then choose a few.
And the  parents would still know what their child likes.
In my very own oppinion, these ads are quite unnecessary and using the kids ability to not consider seriously wether something is usefull and a funny toy or just stupid.
And they are trying to set the kids up against their parents if the kid would like to have something, but the parents wouldn't let them.
Maybe the advertising people just didn't consider, but it could easily happen.
A big part of today's television is advertisement.
After every ten minutes the show you love stopps and a good looking woman appears to try to sell you a shampoo that'll make your hair grow smoother.
We are adults and we know that sometimes advertisement lie and try to manipulate you to buy articles you don't need, but what about children, especially the ones from two to five?
Is it ethical to make advertisements toward them?
Children are easily fascinated.
Advertisements can take advantage of that to manipulate a child into wanting the advertised article.
If we put it this way, they are taking advantage of helpless beings to make money and that would be morally wrong.
Another aspect is that the advertisers could crush the hopes of a young chld, after its parents disagree to buy the article the child was tricked into wanting.
The advertisers play with the feeling of a young child, abuse them mentally in a way.
Small children are easily impressed, but they are equally easily turned off by something.
It's not like they like everything that they see.
In that sense you still have to have the right idea for a toy to impress the children.
Addionally if you have invented a toy that makes children happy, is it really ethically wrong to try to get these toys to them by advertising?
If the toy makes the child happy and the parents are willing to buy it, won't that make everyone happy?
The child is happy, because it got the toy, the parents are happy, because the child is happy and the advertiser is happy, because he did his job right.
Another argument is that parents are not powerless.
They still have influence on their child and could talk the child out of it.
In my opinion it is not wrong to advertise toward young children.
I think children who are two years old can't even react to the manipulation from advertisements, because they're too young.
They just like it or not and we are the same.
We either like something or not and if we do like the concept of something, it wouldn't matter if there was manipulation, we'll still buy it.
Even if the kids were tricked, would it really matter?
The goal of everyone would still be achieved right?
The child would still be happy?
Hapiness is still hapiness and would not become a wrong and bad happiness.
Today many children watch the television and so they often see advertisements.
The majority of these advertisements is directed to older people for example to their parents but there are also advertisements directed to young children too.
But should that be allowed?
First of all there is always television advertising, nearly on every channel and for everyone at any time.
So why shouldn't the be advertisements for young children too?
A problem could be that toddlers can be easier influenced by the advertisements than older people because they understand less and often take everything for real.
This fact could be used in a bad way.
But on the other hand children at a young age usually don't have the ability to purchase anything anyway, so it appears as if  the advertisements, children see in have no effects, but children could try to influence their parents to buy them things.
Although this could be, parents have to control what their children watch and they are responsable for their children.
Moreover children often don't understand the avertisements directed to older people and it would be nicer for them to have advertisements directed to them too.
Furthermore it isn't that easy to say if an advertisement is really directed to children who are two to five years old and them forbid them.
There are many grey zones and it would lead to more work and costs to control the television advertising.
In my opinion advertisements aren't that dangerous to watch for children and I'm not concerned that children are badly influenced by what they see on the television.
Moreover I think it is better if there is television advertising that they understand than only for older people.
All in one I don't think that television advertising should not be allowed.
Essay "Advertising"

Consumers become younger and younger.
There's no child that goes with his family into the shopping mall and only want some chocolat.
The want the "longest Praline in the world" or  the chocolat with the goo milk inside.
Should we protect our children against the kind of manipulation?
In the following essay I'll discuss if it would be good or not when "Television advertising directed toward young children shuld not be allowed".
First of all, you have to think about for who the ad really is.
For the young children, speaking only  a few words, or for there parents, to know what kind of toys the sholud buy for there child?
And if the parents can't withstand this advertisement, it's another proplem, but the kids themself have no money, no chance to get into the mall without there parents, so it should be the task for the parents, to teach there children, what to buy and how to manage money.
Never the less the ads has a bit of influence to the children, and the may want things, the parents can't buy them.
This could end in a bad situation for the parents and the child too.
All in all, I think ads are an important part of our lifes because they manipulate us in different ways and it' s the parents exercise to show the children, that not all of the advertisement are good for the consumer, so the younger they learn that, the better is it for them and of course better than see the first ad with 10 years and want to buy this without any kind of Mäßigung.
Advertisement is a very large segment of our industry.
It shows the big aim of all trade; making money.
But within which borders is this still ethically acceptable?
How far are is one allowed to go to sell our products?
Can one target children?
I say no.
Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.
It should not be allowed, because it means attaking the weakest part of our society for selfish means.
It is a missuse of our psychological understanding of children's minds.
Of course, one could say that seen this way the advertisement targetting adults is nothing else but a missuse of psycological human understanding.
But adults generally are rational, responsibly living and have had some life experience while the consciousnes of small children is only developed to a small size yet.
They don't have any life experience, they are not able to be responsible for themselves, to understand what it actually means to 'buy' something, they are not yet critical thinkers.
Therefor the parents should be in charge of what a child needs and what should be bought.
And directing all this advertising towards the children only makes it more difficult for the parents to raise the rational, critical thinkers we all want to be with in our society.
Nobody really likes advertisements, but if the question comes up, if they should be directed to young children aswell, the societys opinions start to split up into two groups.
First young children are humans aswell as adults and both are getting manipulated by advertisemants, but until the age of five years it is definitively the parents fault, if they buy things for their children, which were seen in advertisements.
In our modern society there is manipulation everywhere, so it would be awkward if the children to an age of five were the only ones not getting involved into the system of the modern life.
On the other hand it would probably be better to take children out of the system until they are five years old, because they are not yet certain of a division into poor and rich that much, because nobody is really investing money to get expensive clother from special designers or toys from special stores.
So there wouldn´t be such a division in poor and rich in zhe first years of a childhood and poor people would get involved into society a lot easier.
On the other side the world market is also aiming on convincing young children of their own products so a whole marked would be forced to get a lot smaller.
Furthermore the children do not really get informed about the amount of toys and clothes, so they probably would not know what to buy.
But another thing to mention is that it is not really necessary to manipulate young children, because until the age of five there is not that amount of time they spend at media and if it is possible to protect them they could develop themselves a lot easier, because they don´t have to worry about not having the best and most expensive toys and clothes.
Until the age of five it´s mostly the parents part to buy sweets, clothes and toys, so it wouldn´t matter that much.
Last but not least the parents of those children are watching TV aswell, and so it would just remain more of a mental problem, because the parents are rather buying things that are shown in advertisements, than things that were never shown.
To put it in a nutshell I am convinced that it should not be forbidden to make TV advertising directed toward young children, because until the age of five it is the parents job to buy things for their children and care about it.
In the following i will comment on the question, if television advertisement directed toward young children should be allowed.
I will start with the arguments against advertisement towards youngh children.
First of all, it is very easy to manipulate the opinion of a child in that age.
The advertisment could manipulate them and interfere with their raising.
Kids a these ages dont know what advertismend is an could easely think, that everything in the advertisement is true, so that when they get the produkt they are sad that it is not as good as in the advertisement.
Also Kids should not get familiar with big companies to soon.
Our world is all about companies and names these days and we should not raise our children in a way that supports this.
Children could also form grops and exclude those, that cant afford or dont like the toys in the advertisement.
On the other hand Kids should learn to live with advertisement.
They should learn to know when the advertisment is honest or just a polished version of the produkt.
Advertisement can also be a good way to inform Kids and parents about the new produkts on the market an maybe help them save some time at the store.
The television chanels only show advertisment because they pay them money, so that they can funktion as a companie.
So if advertisement would get 
vorbidden there would be little to no tv channels for kids, because they are not profitable.
Advertisement is also gut for the economy.
Thanks to advertisment hundreds of people have a job, starting at the janitors of the tv companies all the way to the people who advertise their produkt and the poeple who disigne the ad .
In conclusion i think that advertisement directed toward young children is ok and nessesary for the tv channels to exist.
Even if the ads could interfere with the childs raising i think the pros just outweigh the cons.
First of all the television is one of the tegnology thigs that children want to jouse.
but if this is good or bad, that ist the questen we are tacking today.
television gets more poplar and everyone whants to have it.
ore ather thigs like handys and computer to do the same things ore ather stuff.
kids films and other games are the moste uesed  think and the children get in a conversation withe the television.
the eys geting bad and they need glasses.
but the comunication gets better and better and worlds from the undersee and the univorse what perents only can show with books.
living animels and flying fishes are interisting then just imagen it.
the imadgening of children can help them later.
i think that children from aged two to five should not be allowed to sit in frond of the television, for more then two houers a day.
it is not goot to sit the moste of there live at the television and did not see the word.
the bauteful of the naitger and there freedom in the world.
the aktivitis and all they can do exept of sitting in frond of the television and just starring at the screen.
Having not watched television in a long time, I just recently turned on the TV and sat down for a while.
But I was not able to concentrate on the program, as I saw a television advertisement, which was obviously directed towards young children.
A question came to my mind: 
Should television advertisement directed towards young children be forbidden?
First of all, the biggest benefit of advertising thing for children aged two to five is that is helps these young people to develop new interests, as they probably do not know everything they can do (and/or play with).
For example, if a child has never even heard of Lego, it may get to know it by watching advertisements created for chilfren of its age.
Secondly, parents often do not know what their child wants, or wants to try.
They could find out what their child finds interesting by letting it watch said advertisements.
However,such young children do not really understand advertising and its way of influencing your opinion, so they are very easy to catch by an advertisement that was created with these children in mind.
Additionally,  advertising directed towards children aged two to five probably influences the way that these undeveloped minds develop, it makes them gettin gto know the world of consum very early in their lifes, which is not good.
On top of that, many children are easy to convince to change their opinion towards something, as their minds are not as far developed as those of older people.
This can be seen by parents who want their child to do a certian action, and all they have to do to get the child to doing this,is telling it that this action is fun, good, etc.
Older people may be more resistant to advertising, but children of young ages are not as much.
Concluding I can say that advertisements in general are okay and fun to watch, but advertisements directed towards children aged two to five should be forbidden or restricted by law, as it influences them too much.
In the following text I will discuss the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
While many people say that companies have to direct advertising toward children, so the companies can make more money.
On the other hand are many parents who are defenitly against this technique of advertising .
Many children are watching more and more TV and so they are perfect for advertisment in the TV.
They see a new superhero action figure and please their parents to buy it.
That's a good technique by the companies to make money.
Another aspect could be that the children grow up with these advertising and learn how they have to handle them.
But on the other hand there's the opinion to not allow companies to direct TV advertising toward young children because they're too young to know how to handle this.
Children shouldn't watch their most loved TV series while they also watch many minutes long advertisments in the pauses.
That's what many parents think and me too.
The young children should go outside and play with their friends on the playground rather than watching TV the whole day.
I personaly think that it shouldn't be allowed to direct TV adverstiment toward young children because of the already mentioned aspects and because it can damage their way of thinking.
In advertisments everything/everybody is so happy, colorful and lovely to each other like it's not "real life".
It's another world which isn't good for the children because their not old enough to see what's real and what's unreal.
Television advertising for children is a very controversial topic.
In the following, I'm going to comment on the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".
Whilst some people might say that companies need to advertise their products to make more revenue, it really shouldn't be allowed to advertise products for young children.
This has a few reasons, which I'm now going to elaborate.
First of all, childs don't have as much experience as older people.
For example, children could think that if the boy in the chocolate advertisement does have perfectly white teeth, chocolate wouldn't harm their teeth either.
This could lead to serious problems, because the child may eat more chocolate than appropriate.
Second of all, small children are much more easily influencable than older children.
It is the same reason, why children aren't allowed to vote if they're under 18 or in some cases 16.
Children don't know what's good for them and what not and advertising can give them a false idea of sweets, for example.
While parents could tell them, that it isn't healthy to eat sweets every day, advertising might tell them things like this, so the company can sell their product more often.
These are just few examples of cases, where television advertising would have a negative impact on children of that age.
Concluding, it should be forbidden to advertise for young children.
You can look at this statement in a lot of different ways.
Firstly, let's look at why these commercials shouldn't be allowed: Many children in that age don't understand the principal of buying something.
The can't quite grasp yet that they can't get everthing for free.
Secondly, children can be manipulated quite easily.
They belive almost everything, especially when it comes on TV or an adult tells it to them.
Now we will look at why these commercials should be allowed: At the end of the day, it's not the child that buys the toy, it's their parent.
It is the responsibility of the parent not to buy the child every single toy that comes up on the TV screen.
If the parent doesn't buy everything in the first place, the child will learn and will not always beg for more.
And surely, children can be manipulated very easily, but so can adults.
Look at all commercial for womens undergarment, for example Victoria's Secret: Just by putting beautiful women in your underwear and putting them on huge billboards, millions of women drag their husband to your shops to spend a lot of money.
This shows it is even worse with adults.
In my opinion, childrens commercial should be allowed, because it's responsbility of the parents, and they are as naive as their children.
Some people have the opinion that television advertising for young children shouldn't be allowed.
Maybe they are right.
Young children have to learn about the real world.
It won't be good for them to take in front of a television and learn with it.
If this happens, children will only know about a virtuell world.
They wouldn't know much about real things.
In worst case young children learn only similuar things.
So in future there won't be personal charakters.
Young children has to talk with their parents.
It's the exercise by mother and father to learn with the child.
They have to give them informations about life and important skills, like speaking and walking for example.
But on other side who and how will look up to this new rule?
Nobody is allowed to check up the privat life by a young famaly.
You can't controll people at there privat house for advertising the television by young people.
And parents are old enough to decide on their own whats the best for their child.
Only on this way we have different people with differents skills at the world.
In my opinion is the statemant wrong.
The parents should be allowed to decide about their children.
Not everything at the television is wrong and bad.
People can learn lots of important things there.
Maybe in future children learn with television speaking.
I think for children with parents who comes not out of the country it is a good selution.
So the young children can learn the languge correct.
And people who don't want the televison advertising have not use it!
Advertising nowadays is something really important.
The economy to a huge part would not function without advertising.
A big part of the  money-making egame are the kids because if they see something they want to have it immeadiatly, it doesn't matter in whichway.
As a birthday present, as a christmas present from the their grandparents, or even from their own pocket money.
So that's why the children from the age two to five are a huge target in the economy.That leads to the reason, that the economy would never want  the advertisment to be bained.On the other hand the mother's don't have it easy with the advertisments, because the children would become spoiled, if they got everything, they saw and wanted.
So in the end not only they would not lettheirchildren see  the advertisments, it would lead to not letting them watch television in the first place.
What would bother and harm the TV channels which are specialy made for kids in two diffrent ways.For example none of the children would watch tekevision so they would haveless viewers which would lead to less companies that are ready to pay their channal forrunning their advertisment.
I think that everything should have a balance, so that everything can work whilethe other is working.
Like the kids should not watch that much television and desire for everything they see, but chose one thing that they like.
Meanwhile the chaannels for kids should not show many diffrent kinds od advertiesment ina break between to shows.
They should alwasy show the same three advertiesments.
One for boys.one for girls and another one for food.
Lastly the thing companies could do is not bring out.
I´ll discuss in the folling essay the statement ´´Television advertising directed toward young children (aged to to five) should not ne allowed.´´
First of all you have so say that nerarly everone of us watched television in young age.
It was like the highlight of the day if you could watch in the evening your favorite disneyfilm.
Furthermore children learning a language easier on television.
For example many immigrants in germany let their children watch televsion, so the immgrant kid´s are leraning the corect pronunciacion.
But television isn´t the only way to learn a language and a bad excuse for letting children watch televison for many hours.
Fact is, when you watching televison you are not doing something, just by hearing a lenguage without practesing speaking you are far away from actually correct speacking.
Television advertising is the only way to gernerate money for the film/television studios, so why should be everyone able to show advertising and earn many accept the moviemaker for children?
In conclsuon advertising is really important for the televesion studios and they can not not use them.
If you don´t want that you child is watching the fucking advertising, turn off the televesion and play with your in the garden or whatever.
(I can relate :D)
The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (age two to five) should not be allowed."
is understandable, but in my opinion a little bit too extrem and unrealistic.
Young people and kids are really easy to influence by informationce from the outcome.
They will believe everything what they see and hear, so they also believe everything what is said in television advertinsing.
This could be a big problem, because it's familiar that statements in advertising aren't true or just a part of it is.
If children see this, they believethat the advertising is true and this could be lead to a problematic world sight or wrong believs.
But in general, I think it's not the task of the government to solve this problem and forbit special advertising.
It's the task of the parents of the young children to protect them from information, that aren't good for them or what they just can't understand yet.
Another point, which is a problem with the statement above, is the actual usage in the reality.
How can the governemnt or the television program know, if there are kids in front of the TV or not?
And how should they filter their advertising?
Of course an advertising for choclate or other sweets is problematic, because children shouldn't be attached to want and eat this stuff, but it's not quiet dangerous.
And also the company who want to sell, for example, the sweets could have a problem with this rule.
For them kids are a really important part of their selling.
Kids see the funny and colorful advertising and now they run to their parents to tell the about these sweets.
It gets bought.
It's also problemtic, that the stament is only about 'TV advertising'.
Kids in the age of five often have the first contact with iPads and the internet.
There the advertising can't be regulated.
So where is the sense of regulating the advertising in the television but not in the internet or in the radio?
In my opinion advertising should be getting proved everywhere and for every age.
Also teenagers are easy to influence and people who didn't have this contact with the lies of the advertising aren't protected.
But there is the next problem?
Forbit the advertising of sweets because of the sugar?
Forbit the advertising of CocaCola and RedBull because of the coffeine?
Forbit the advertising of meat because the animals get slaughtered with an unhuman cruelty?
Forbit the advertising of hair shampoo because youtr hair will never look like it, even if you are gonna use it daily?
How it seemes it's not possible to protect our society and exspecially our children from advertising and the following lies.
So conclusioned it have to be said that the statement above is not practicable useful, and the only way to reach the goal of the author of this stament is to tell and explain the tricks of the advertiser to the children.
So there should be an advertising in the television where young mothers and fathers and teachers are lead to talk to their children.
Advertising directed towards children has always been a controversial theme.
In the last couple of years the age of the children advertiser try to get to is dropping more and more.
The main reason for thar being that young children are getting more access to digital devices.
Since the goel of a lot of people is to earn money, they try to find any way possible to do so.
And the market for small children is fresh and new.
But a lot of people are against the advertising towards young children.
The mainargument is that they are too young to understand what the advertiser actually do to them.
They just see a new toy and therefore they want it.
Because they are so young, they are easy to manipulate.
They are unconsious of most their actions.
Thats why most people find ist morally unexceptable to do that.
Small children don't know what they are doing.
But on the other hand they are also very smal and have no money or any other way to actually buy anything.
They don't earn any money, so the only way to actually buy something would be through their parents.
If their parents don't want to buy something, they don't have to.
So i personally find it morally bad to do advertising towards small children.
But at the end it is still in the hands of their parents if they actually fall for a advertisement.
I think the problem insn't the advertising it's the television in general.
Kids aged two to five aren't interested in advertising.
They do not think about stuff like that.
They more are looking at stuff of their age.
Kids are looking channels in wich mostly no advertising ist showed (talking of german television channles).
So they are only interested in their series and make mind of their topic.
I also think that most of the advertising kids aren't able to understand.
They would ask thier parents or just forget stuff like that.
So advertising shouldnt be a big problem for kids of a younger age.
Maybe it become a problem because they just look at it and think that everything that is said must be true and correct.
They do not question it or something like that.
They aren't able to make their own mind about if the advertising is good or bad like adults or older person do.
But, as I said, thats not the problem of the advertising, it's the problem of the television in general.
If kids aged two to five were not allowed to use the television by their parents, the chance that they look at advertising that could have a bad influence on them is not given.
So my opionion is that the problem isin't the adverising it's more the television in general.
Also series are advertising but just in an other way.
So if parents wouldn't allow young children to use the television allone this problem could be stopped.
They would not get the chance to look at something that could be bad for them because the parents would stop that and without their parents they couldn't use the television.
Telivision advertising is the one wich reaches out to a big number of people.no matter in what age now a days nearly everyone who ca afford it uses television.
But should this kind of advertisement wich even reaches out to kids around the age of five be allowed for them ?
And do i agree or disagree with the statement:"Telivision advertising directed toward young children ( aged two to five ) ahould not be allowed"?
On the one hand the normal advertisement should be accesable to everyone if its fitting for people under eighteen years of age.Thats because Advertisements can be a kind of information wich could be important for some people.
Another aspect is that its not right to not allow those people who make the advertisement for their shop or business or whatever to bring their advertisement to every tv-channel they want.
On the other hand the informatin that is given in an advertisement is not always proofed so wrong informations could be spread to young people who maybe arent able to form opinion.The next risk especially for kids wich is going out from those advertisements is that kids are mostly really fast impressed or overwhelmed by thongs shown there.
All in all i agree with the statement because
In Germany there are two different main tv channels for children: "KIKA" and "SuperRTL".
On these channels children can watch typical series like for example "Barbie" or "Das Sandmännchen".
But there is also a big differnece between this both channels: on "SuperRTL" you have tv advertising and on "KIKA" you haven`t.
And now there is the question for parents, but also for the politics, should this advertising especially for young children aged two to five should be allowed or even not ande then, is "KIKA" a better channel for children then "SuperRTL"?
On the one hand there are the big tv companies which are wanting to get the most money as even possible and on the other hand there are parents who are thinking that this advertising could be very dangerous for their children.
In my childhood my parents only allowed "KIKA" in the short time my sister and I were allowed to watch tv.
When we get older, maybe since the age of eight or nine, we also could watch "SuperRTL".
In my opinion this was a very good solution for the problem with those two children channels.
I think for young children it isn`t a good idea to let them watch tv advertising, because in the age of maybe four ore five you can`t difrenciate between advertising and the "reality".
And parents maybe could have the problem of children which want all toys which were shown on tv.
Buit this problem you could also have with older ones...
And when the childre get older, in my opinion, they can start to watch "SuperRTL" as well but only with the support of their parents.
It is very important, that the parents explain the meaning and the sense of advertising.
Then it is possible that children can grow in an responsible way concerning tv and tv advertising.
But it is also very important, that the time children are allowed to watch tv is reduced to the smallest as possible.
In my opinion, children should play outside in the garden or in the nature with friends and should not watch tv the whole day or play games on a smartphone.
I think, it is very important, the the society keeps an eye on the education of children and takes care that tv, laptop and smartphones get an even smaller role in allday live than they actually have.
And for that, you haven`t got the problem with advertising in tv.
Nowadays millions of children are watching television every day.
As consequence, the advertisement is sometimes directed toward children of every age.
But should that be allowed?
I do not think so.
Firstly, children aged two to five can easily be manipulated by television advertising.
When they watch advertisements in which other kids are playing with exciting toys and having fun, they wish to posses these toys too.
But in reality children are not in need of them and they get furious when their parents do not allow the buy.
Furthermore, little children do not understand what television advertising want to say them.
So, it is not necessary to advertise products only for young children.
It is absolutley useless.
The most part of young children have not money to buy stuff for themeselves.
Their parents decide what they are in need of and the television advertising shows mostly needless products.
It would be much more effective to direct advertisements to children which have already reached the age of eight.
In this age children are ripe to make the difference between manipulation and needful things.
In conclusion, I do not understand why it is necessary to direct television adverstising toward young children.
The advertisments should include older children, teenagers and adults but definetly not younger people than six.
Instead of watching TV young children should play together with their parents.
"Televison advertising directed toward young children (age two to five) should be not allowed."
This sentense is an very important point in our life, because more and more younger children are allowed to directed for an advertising.
I tink that the childern are too young and the parents want that and not the child.
Most of the parents want that their child gets a better life with no money problems or something like that, thats why so many parents sell their children so the children stands in front of the camera.
The children can not dicide on their own want the want to do.
I think many children don't want to be in front of the camera and play for an advertising.
Everyone who watche TV see te children, and everyone has an own opinion on that and when the children gets older everyone know who their are and maybe the don't what that.
Some Children can get bullied in school and then the children has no better life.
But on the other hand it's good when the children want to do that, because the have fun with that.
To play for an advertising in TV is an great experience for them and almost the girls like it, because they maybe get dresses like a Princess and i think every lilttle girl likes a dress lika a princess.
When the parents are allowed it that their child can be a perosn in a advertising and everybody see it in Germany it is okay.
BUt i think some parents dont want that, because everyone sees your child on screen and everybody has an opinion to that, it can be good but it can be also worse for the child and the parents.
But all in all i agree with the statemant: " Television advertising toward young children (aged two to five) should be not allowed, because of the futre from the child.
It can be so worse and i think every celebritie person know how to feel wehn everybody has an own opinion on that want you do, worse and good.
Lika i said the children can not dicide on their own what to do and maybe the dont want to be a happy child in front of the camera.
I think it ois one of the important thing in life that you are free to dicide on yourself what do you want to do and wan don't.
Clearly no child aged two yeras can not dicide on their own, because they dont know whats right is and wats wrong, because they lived on two years.
So the parents should be dicide wrong and thats why i think it shoukd be not allowed and its forbit.
Ten year old children can be in front of a camera for an advertising on TV.
It is usual today that many companies try to place their advertisement in the TV.
Exspecially in shows for children, there are many advertisement spots in the break.
But should the advertisement directed toward young children should be allowed?
First of all you have to think about the fact that we are dealing with children: there are some things which are different about advertisement for kids or for adults.
You can influence kids more than adults with tv spots.
If they see a toy in an advertisement break they` ll want to buy it.
On the other hand, it´s the right of a company to have advertisement for children in tv shows.
There isn´t any law which says that advertisement for children isn´t allowed.
If you are a toy company and you want to sell a product, it will be the easiest way to make a advertisement spot in a TV show.
People who are pro advertisement come with the argument that if children watch adverdisement in the TV and they see a product which they are really liking, they will have to ask their parents first before they can buy the product.
But the con advertisement for children people doubt this argument because they say, if children see something inj TV they really want they will steal some money (or take their own) and buy this product anyway without any permisson of their parents.
All in all the parents play an important roll: they have to overwatch what their children watch in the tv (and in the TV breaks) and they have to control that the children won´t buy anything without their permisson.
And if some parents are against TV advertisement, they order their children to switch off the TV in the break.
If you wachted TV or go in the internet, you will usually find advertising really fast.
Our modern technology industries get much money with advertising.
So they bring advertising for every age out, especially for young children.
But should this be allowed?
Fact is that young children always want something, which is presented for them and don't even think about for example the quality or about the question: Did they really need it?
For the insdusty is this a possitive fact.
But for the children it isn't.
Especially in the young age childs must learn that they can't have every thing they wanted.
And advertising directed toward young children don't really help in that learning process.
Another argument is that the children, if they get most of the toys or something like this, which is presented in the advertising, they will play with this and forgot to go outside, meeting friends or do hobbies.
And this age is really important for the living-process.
In this age children should learn to communicate with other children and learn to work or play as a team.
All of that is very important ´for surviving in the modern society.
So finally I think, that avertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, becaurse of the missed learning process in this age, if they don't go outside and don't learn how they should communicate with other people.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed!
Is this statement true?
We can remember the situation when we where young kids and our parents allowed us to watch tv.
As everyone knows if you are watching tv their is so much television advertising that is driving us crazy even after a short time.
But this was not the same thing when we were young because all these twelevision advertising influus us.
We wanted to have everything: The new Barbie, the mini car, and the singing pink teddy.
So we often had an argument with our parents because they thought that we already had enough things to play with.
Also hopefully childreen are not allowed to spend much time with watching tv and it is not cool if they want to watch the new a
episode of Barbie but most of the time they have to watch a stupid but for christmas very inspiring television advertising.
On the other hand maybe kids can learn to handle money if they are confronted with television advertising.
They can understand that they can not own everything make decissons what they really "need" and work for there gifts.
(Santa is not coming to you this year if you are not a good kid, so go and tidy up your room!
Thanks Mum...)
So all in all I agree with the statement at the top.
Childreen who are only two to five years old should not watch television advertising.
They are getting to much inspired by them and it gets to expersive for the parents.
They are to young to handle it!
I think that there should be no more television advertising on the childreen channels at all!
There are reasons behind those advertisements.
In todays society there are a lot of small children who grow up with the use of computers and television.
While watching all the advertisements for adults they get bored so producers wanted to find something to keep these kids motivated to watch TV.
Furthermore are there many children with older sibling so they want to be just like them, for example by shopping an item they saw in an advertisement.
Through these advertisements these kids can build their own point of view on different things.
But there is an other side aswell.
By bringing small children in contact with television advertisements these kids will form such a strong mind that they for example laugh about other children if they don't have the newest doll or the newest shirt.
This can then lead to bullying as soon as the kids get older.
After having seen these advertisements these kids won't be able to form their own mind on what they like and what they don't like, they think because they saw this object in an advertisement it for sure has to be the best.
With advertisements precisely directed towards these kids they will have even more reasons on why to watch television.
Advertising something for children young aged will make it very hard for parents to explain to their children why they can't have everything they want.
These kids will want to have everything they have seen on TV and think that it is normal to have this particular object.
I personally think those kind of TV advertisements should not be allowed, because they take away the chance to form their own mind from these young kids.
In my opinion are these advertisements meant to be good but I think they only cause problems by showing these kids the newest toys.
These kids then will want to have those toys, even tough they just got an older edition of this exact toy a few months ago, while without the advertisement this kids would be happy with their older edition of the toy.
These kids are too young to be able to decide what they really want and what they just want because they saw it in an advertisement.
With all the reasons mentioned above I think these kind of TV advertisements aren't good at all for those young children.
Television is very popular in our generation and in every house you find one or more.
For many families its a possibility to give their children something to do.
But children cant learn to do something alone und so they arent interested in plays for their age.
I think children aged two to five should not be allowed to watch TV, because it isnt good for a right education and their own development.
In our society everything is used with media and you need it to live.
Many parents make the mistake also with their children.
They grow up with the same media problem and learn in young age how to use it.
Another point is, what you see on the TV.
A few years ago you had the possibility to watch series, which are also for young aged children.
Nowadays you have the modern serien with guns and sexual things.
It isnt save to watch TV to five years and also the ages after.
Parents never really know, if its right what their children watch.
We have many adults, who havent work, sit at home an do nothing.
They sit the whole day at home and watch TV.
Adults, as parents, are like an idol for the children and show with their lifestyle whats right and whats wrong.
When young aged children to have the possibility to watch TV, you could imagine in which familiy the child grow up.
The first ages are the most important years for their future life and in this time you have the best possibilities to teach them.
In age from zero to five and also after they forget nothing what they have done.
So in my opinion its the best way to give them something to do if you havent enough time for your childre, but the baddest way in the future of the children and not very ethical for the education.
For chiildren aged two to five it should not be allowed and the years after only a very short time and very strict.
Should television advertising directed toward young children be forbidden ?
My first question is, who and how should that be controlled ?
Like, turning the TV off when advertising comes ?
Only watching a programm for children without any advertising ?
Or just beeing able to watch a certain time of the day where no advertising at all is playing ?
It just makes absolutly no sense.
Isn't the better question, if such young children should be allowed to watch televison at all?
Not every advertising in genereal is bad, and, true story, not every serie or film playing in the television is bad, but if parents let their children watch television, then there will be advertising.
And that it not a problem, because why should it be ?
Almost everywhere is advertising, in the supermarket, on the childrens toys, in every shop they go all they see are colofull adveritses.
Even on the street are big (plakate).
There is no problem with that at all.
For sure, children want to have things that are advertised in the television and that can be stressfull and expensive for the parents, but when they let their children watch TV then it is their problem.
And if there wouldnt be any advertising in television, then children would see other things they want in a shop, at a friends house, on the street and so on.
You can't protect a child from what they are going to see or what they are going to want.
So no, television advertising directed toward younger children should not be forbidden, because it is normal in our period of time.
Advice for parents which are saying that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed: Let your children play outside instead of watching TV all day, then you didn' have to deal with such questions.
In the following text I will discuss the question, if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
This is a topic many people disuss and it is not easy to say if it should be allowed or not.
There are many points that have to be discussed, to make a decision about it.
One argument to allow the television advertising directed towards young children is that these children feel part of the society, otherwise it could be that children do not feel involved.
On the other side it could be kind of manipulation to direct television advertising towards children.
There are too young to deside on their own if an advertising or the product in it, is good or not.
That could be also an argument for television advertising directed towards children.
Maybe they could learn to deside on their own with this advertising.
For sure it would be better when parents could help their children in another way to learn how to make decisions.
Another argument for showing advertising directly to kids is that it could be boring for children when they see advertising for adults only.
There are more arguments to show advertising to children directly, but the only real good argument is that it could be to boring for children to only watch advertisments for adults.
But anyway I will agree to this statement, because I´m sure there are way more better activities for children from two to five than to watch television and the advertisments.
I dont care if young kids see the advcertisments on tv, they have parents to care for them.
If the parents dont do theire job right, its their fault if theier kids want some toys they saw in a tv commercial.
the advertisment industrie also has to make money and we live in a luxury world where everyone just wants to consume and think about himself.
Crying about the fact that many children are about to be roboters in the future is really funny because i think we should change our whole society and not only a bit stuff on tv.
I hate to sit here in this room with all the so called students who are slaves of our society and are about to have a monotone life that cotains: good abitur, uni, good job, find a family and DIE!
No way that I will fit in this boring society of robotic humans who click their computer like their life is conected to it.
If you read my text until this point, i hope you understand what my point is allthough I'm only 17 years old.
Go outisde and travel the world, eat healthy and stop sitting in front of your computer all day and lose all your energy to live.
Because, all we need is love!
Now to the part that will make you happy: Advertisments can influence kids in positive and negative aspects.
It would definitly be a idea to stop advertisments for toys like guns or other bad stuff that could bring kids a wrong idea of life and that hurting peolple is wrong.
To be honest I still have no idea what to tell you through this text, all I have to say is that all we need is to chill and spread some love.
I think I still do not have enough words, so now Im just filling up my text that it looks like I have written enough so yeah, blah blah blah I have no idea what to write... to be continued?
Or nor?
no one knows.
Television advertising deirected towards children is a theme often discussed by various groups of people.
There are arguments for and against it and it isn't easy to decide wether it should be allowed or not.
In this essay I'm going to weigh up the reasons to forbid and the reasons to allow television advertiing directed towards young children.
First of all if the selled product is an object invented for children, why shouldn't the advertising be directed towards the children?
Today the television is one of the easiest ways to communicate with people and to reach out to them.
Because a lot of young children watch television on a regular basis why not use the opportunity and show them what products meant for them are on the market?
An Argument against the point stated above is, that the children don't have to pay for the products them self and they don't know how to deal with money.
When they see something they like on television they're probably going to ask their parents to buy it.
For families with higher incomes this isn't a huge problem but parents who can't afford these toys or books or whatever is being selled are going to disappoint their children, because they cannot understand why they can't get it.
Beside that  children are very manipulative and get excited easily.
They can't decide wheter they need the product or not because they're blinded by the advertisment and its promises.
If some childrens parents can afford the products and some can't, there is going to be rivalry and jealousy because of the promises of the advertising, that this product is the best and if you have it you're better then evryone else.
But then again there are a lot of ways how parents who don't want their children to see the advertising can prevent them from watching it, like telling them to do something else like brushing their teeth or clearing up their room or  just mute the television while advertising is played.
Like this everyone can decide wheter they allow advertising in their home or not.
I personally think that advertising directed towards young children should be allowed because now a days where else can you reach ot to children as easy as on television.
And i don't think it harms children in any way.
Added to this i think it's the parents decision if they want their children to watch advertising or not.
Today there are television advertisings for everything, directed toward everyone.
But is it really a good idea to show advertisings that are directed toward young children?
Children shouldn't be manipulated.
You could say that if there are products for children, like toys, then it should be them who see it.
Today every product is advertised to have a chance on the market and it would be no use, if those advertisings would be directed toward adults, who (at least the most of them) aren't interested in toys for children.
But the problem is that children don't understand what an advertising is.
They can't distinguish between what they really need and what they are just told that they need.
A child believes the "big and wise" adult who tells it (with a big smile on his face to show that he cares for the child) that it's absolutely necessary to buy this product.
Children are easy to manipulate - but manipulating is a bad thing.
It's quite unfair toward parents to speculate that they will buy their children everything they want.
Maybe there are some parents who always get stressed as soon as their child has its birthday, because they don't know at all what gift they should buy.
So if the child sometimes is watching television, it knows exactly what presents it wants.
There wouldn't be any need of looking at all the gift catalogs or going in gift shops (which, honestly, isn't that funny with a child who wants every second thing it sees).
But it's also a manipulative thinking that parents will buy exactly the things their children want.
People who make these advertisings speculate that the children will tell their parents so often what they want, until the parents will just buy it so the child stops complaining.
Also a child should be able to be happy for every present it gets - and not just for the toys it sees at television advertisings.
It can be quite fun to go with children to gift and toy shops.
And even if parents don't have the time for it, or just don't like it, they will think alot about what to buy their children and don't want to just have to buy the toys from television (which are mostly quite unnecessary) to make their child happy.
My opinion is, that there shouldn't be television advertisings toward children.
There are enough other influences in this world, which aren't always good.
A child should learn to have its own opinion, to know what it really .
wants or needs.
And not what everyone else thinks is cool or what the television says is funny.
Different interests are important - a child should learn to be itself and not like the child in the advertising.
Many people say television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed anymore.
But why does it need to be stopped or does it even?
On the one hand side advertisement directed toward young children is very helpful.
It isn't helpful for the children but for their parents.
The parents are often watching way more television than their children and they are the ones who buy the products shown in the advertising.
They get attention on new and better products for their child and if they buy it the child hopefully will be happy which leads to joyful parents.
On the other hand the children get this kind of wanting everything that's new or seems to be better.
They get integrated in our "world of consume" far too young.
Children in that age can't decide wether something they want is useful or wether they need it or not.
They only see it on television where the products are shown as "perfect".
Negative sides of the product like becoming less creative are left out and the child only sees the good things.
The child becomes a consumer in an age it doesn`t even know how to care about itself.
I myself think that television advertising directed toward young children isn't something you have to stop.
Children in that age just shouldn't be allowed to watch that much television that this thinking of needing everythink can take place in their brains.
In my opinion it is in the parents might to let advertising not be a problem, but something that informates and is interesting for themselves.
There's a big discussion about television advertising toward young children and whether it should be allowed or not.
in the following text i'm going to discuss this.
For the television production it's important to get money with advertisment because it's often the only source of money.
They also need this money for the porduction of programms for children.
if they make advertisment for adults or teenagers during the programm for childrens they wouldn't get that much money by the companies that want to advertis their products and it wouldn't be interesting for the children.
This leads to the question what the television producters should show instead of the advertisment.
They can leave the advertisment out but then they don't get any money.
So as you can see they don't really have an opportunity to leave the advertisment out because without money they can't produce good television programms for children.
But everyone knows that young children don't earn their own money.
So when they see something they really want the pranets have to pay.
Another aspect is that children are easily to impress.
For example they see a doll in the television and it's the only doll they want.
Is has to be this doll.
And after that doll they see a school of Plamobil with a gym and a music class and the children forget the doll and only want that school.
As a conclusion i can say that it's a difficult situation.
On the one hand there are the television companies who need the money of the advertisment and on the other hand there the families who got porblems because of this adversisment.
I think the companies shouldn't make any advertisment for children who are that young.
They should make it for children who are older than five.
In today's society, advertising in television and the internet (or media in general) is one of the most important things to do for big companies and also for the economy.
Advertising in general has huge influences in society, especially on younger people.
While young people in schools mostly experience adversting through the internet and smartphones, children from the age of two to five do through television.
Parents do now fear that the influence of advertisements will have consequenses and want the government to ban advertisments towards younger children.
An argument for the ban of this adevertising is that the influence on children will be a lot lower.
The point is that through advertising, societies idea of the perfect human is being pictured.
For example, when little girls see barbies or any of these, skinny, blonde, white dolls with perfect clothes and flawless makeup on TV, they don't just want to buy the doll, they also want to be like the doll, it's kind of their idol.
It makes them think that everyone expects them to look exactly like this, which puts a lot of pressure on them, at such a young age.
This kind of advertisment is wrong to show to younger people because they can't think as far as adults and don't know that being perfect doesn't make sense.
Otherwise, companies can't not advertise for some products, because it is for both, adults and children.
Sweets and Soda or food in general would be a good example.
the government can't ban companies from advertising chocolate because adults like it, as well as children.
To conclude, television advertising can't be banned because companies obviously need to make money somehow.
An idea for a solution would be to simply show less and chosen advertisment.
The wrong kind of advertising won't have any influence on children anymore and companies will still make money off of them or their parents.
Also parents should have an eye on which programmes their children watch and when they watch TV.
If Television advertising for young children should or shouldn´t be allowed, I will discuss in the following text.
First of all you have to say, that the only persons, who can decide if their children are allowed to watch TV, are the parents.
Other people can think and talk about it, but can not forbid it and I think this isn´t nessecary at all.
When the children want to watch Series, why not?
What dangerous can happen?
A TV can not attack you or do anything by its own.
You can decide, wether it´s turn on or off.
Its just important, that the series fits to the age of the child.
They should´t watch scary horror movies or agressive action videos and they shouldn´t watch TV the whole day.
The younger generation today should know, how to play and use their fantasy like in former times too, when they haven´t had the chance to use any technology.
But I want to stress at this point again, that it isn´t my task to decide what children shouldn´t or shouldn´t do and nobodyelse should do so.
When the parents of a child think Television doesn´t hurt, it´s as right as to say Televisoin isn´t good for my child.
You can see this by your own.
Have you watched TV when you were younger?
I have and I am not terrribly gone wrong.
I have built with my sister a new house for our imagined friends in the morning and later I have watched my favourite Series "Biene Maja" and now I am writing this essay in English.
So I am the best example, that Television isn´t a machine for making you stupid.
It´s just a good way for relaxing and have some fun in your freetime but please, don´t go over the top.
Don´t put your Child in front of the TV, when you don´t know what you as a parent can play with it or let it does, what it wants.
After some time, maybe 30 minutes or maybe two hours, turn off the screen.
Everything should be enjoyed in pieces.
You shouldn´t eat the whole day, you shouldn´t do sport the whole day and you shouldn´t watch TV the whole day.
Just from time to time, if you want to.
The given statement ´ Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed ´ is in my opinion right.
My starting point is that it´s way better to not put children around the mentioned age infront of a television because they easily get addicted to the series but it´s way more importent for them to explore the real world around them.
Sure the shown series and movies are extra for children but the children should go outside and play with their friends, siblings or familiy members.
If they always sit infront of the television just because parents thinkn it´s  good for them the children could miss the an important part of there childhood.
So if the television advertising directly to young children wouldn´t be allowed there wouldn´t be an excuse for the children to not exlore their surroundings.
On the other side the television is especially made for children around this age so it should be easy to understand and also give them new things to dry.
For example are there lots of series like ´Art Attack ´which are about making new stuff with paper, drawings, toys and etc.
by themselves.
That is a pretty good opportunity for children to be creative and try lots of new stuff.
There is also a type of Series like ´Dora´ which is about learning english for children in an easily to understand way which is sometimes very good in my opinion.
Although television for children has good sides it also has bad sides because it´s sometimes an excuse for parents to not spend time with their children because they have other things to do.
Sure it is way easier to put the child in front of the television if it wants to hear a story than searching for a book to read because it sometimes takes lots of time to find the right story the kid is okay with but that isnt´t good because reading a book together brings parents and children closer together.
Finally I can say that I am personally against the television advertising directed toword young children.
Although it has positive sides like entertainment if there is nothing to do, it´s just to often used as an excuse for parents to not give attention to their children.
Children should go outside and explore, they should learn and try new things instead of sitting infront of a screen and watching a few colorful cartoon figures jumping around and telling stories.
Sure sometimes it helps the creativity of children and sometimes there are series which are good for children but the main part is just not so good as everybody says.
I think sometimes a little tv is okay but just not too much because then the children just miss the things they could do outside with their friends
Television advertising plays a big role in our life.
Every day we see these.
Children in young ages often watch these television advertisings because there parents don't want to spend time with their kids.
For them the television is a cheap babysitter.
I think these television advertisings shouldn't be allowed to young children aged two to five becauase they see them every day and know them better than some other and more important things.
My cousin for example often watch television because his parents work at home all day and he stress them and they can't do their work.
He's able to sing more television advertisments than songs for children.
His favorite advertisment is >>Washmachines lives longer with Calgon<< or >>Carglass fixs, Carglass changes<<.
I think it's not that good for their childhood when they're know these slogans and are able to sing them.
Children shouldn't watch television all day, they should be outside and get dirty.
This is a reason why more children gets allergic to some things.
Because they didn't had any contacts with it in their childhood.
In my opinion parents shouldn't be allowed to get kids, when they don't have any time for them.
But I think it's not a realistic thing to not allow television advertisings because you can't control if there is a child or an adult watching television.
The only thing you could change is the television advertising at the children canals like KIKA or Super RTL.
I also know some kids who just watch televisin advertisings.
They don't like television shows.
Television is getting more and more involved in the world´s daily life and so are advertisments.
At the moment we are right now, you barely can watch anything on TV without getting interrupted by them.
Especially advertisments directed toward young children have a big influece to them, which isn´t the best thing for those children.
In the following there will be a discussion, if they sould be forbidden.
First, the companies want to make the children buy there products.
The children sit in front of the TV and then they see an "awesome" advertisment spot about that one super cool toy and then they decide they really, really want to have that.
They go ask their parents and try to get them to buy that toy, so the parents go and buy that toy.
That is what the companies want to achieve and if there would only be one companie, it woulnd´t really be a problem.
Now if there would only be one spot, it could be tolerated, but sadly, this happens like 19 times in one break.
Because of that the children want to have every toy and the parents end up being under a lot of stress.
Second, the only thing the companies want is money.
They don´t care about giving the children a wrong ideal of beauty or telling them that they are only cool, if they have that one special toy.
The children are just being used as the people who buy the companies´ stuff and maybe not even seen as human beings, who don´t know much about the world and it´s people yet.
The children are just an unexperienced source of money and the companies use that to get the most profit they can.
With that point of view, the companies manipulate the children into buying their stuff.
I think it should definitely be forbidden to direct advertisments to children of young age.
The companies simply use the young age of the children to tell them they´re product is the best and give them fals ideals.
No, I actually wholeheartedly disagree with the statement, since I see no harm in products which are aimed at smaller children, being advertised.
For example: a family which is already making plans on what to buy for their newborn or young child will atleast get a new idea or direction for what product would be best suited for their child, rather it be food, clothes or toys.
Especially young mothers may not be entirely informed and secure on whether or not they are making the right the decisions when it comes to saciating her childs needs.
So on the note of advertising a product, although it may not convince the viewer to buy the specific product in question, I can atleast appreciate that the advertisement gave the viewer another reminder of thinking about the products they might be buying for their children.
But of course it would always be advised to get information from other media/sources since advertisements on television are often times just short, pretty and very staged for the sake of mass appeal for a massive audience (although it is still specifically targeted towards parents, the advertisements are played for everyone)

The others sources I mentioned should be a doctor with knowledge on nutrition and health for small children and also the internet in order to see whether or not cosumers of the product, which the parents are interested in are satisfied with or not.
The internet is also useful for when you need advice from other parents who have already made mistakes or who know exactly how to answer your question and can give insightful advice on how to deal with the problem you might be having or the difficult decision you have to make.
And that would already be all of which I have to comment on or have come up with.
In our time the advertisement, especially on TV, is mostly directed towards certain interest groups.
While watching a action movie with lots of explosions and stunts the advertisement, which is placed in the breaks of the movie you will get for example mostly advertisement for products that men need.
But in my opinion young children should not be pulled into this as well and it should not be allowed to direct advertisement toward this group of people.
Yes this would be an injury of the economic freedom for companies, which would than be less competitive in the world market.
Also this could start a chain reaction and more and more criteria would be introduced into the tv-advertising sector.
Also not all advertisements present a bad good.
There can certainly be an advert for a product that is useful for a child and can help it in everyday life.
But to be honest there are hardly people that get excited when the movie or tv-show that they are watching gets interrupted by an advertisement break.
Sometimes there is this funny or well made advert but in general they are plain, boring and tell you something that is only half the truth.
Teens and adults easily realise the false advertisement and see the intentions of the companies, but the young children, they do not.
They can easily be influenced and one could even say that they get brainwashed into a consumption cultur, because the idea of always having to have the best and newest product gets planted in their head from a young age.
To sum up I think children should not be adressed in advertisement because they are too young to distinguish between lie and truth.
An often discussed issue in our society is if the television advertising toward young children, from the age of two to five years, should be allowed or not.
One reason against this is that young children could get manipulated of this advertising and just do not understand what the producer is saying to them.
The children are just watching television and the there comes advertising from a "fantastic" toy in which often children are used because the producers just show them that every child wants that but do not say the toy will get broken just right after you let it fall for only one time.
So they are lying to the children too.
Another point why it should not be allowed to make advertising directly toward young children is that when parents say this "fantastic" toy is not very fantastic at all it could give some discussions between parents and their children just because the advertising lied to them and they did not understand it.
This is never a good thing because families should be happy together and no one should want to destroy their happiness just to sell a plastic figure.
The last point against is that the producers uses young children to reach other young children which can be very bad for these children because they get "selled" for making advertising and have to work in a very young age just to make their parents rich and happy and the producers too.
The only point why it should be allowed to make television advertising directly for young children is that this won't be sexual or aggressive.
Sometimes they watch a movie for children and after that there is advertising for sex toys or hungry children in Africa which is not the right one for children in the age of two to five years.
So this advertising for toys,etc.
is exspecially made for children which has to mean that in this aren't pictures or something else that children should not see.
All in all I think that advertising for young children is not a very good thing because I can't understand why someone is just lying to sweet children for getting money from their parents or uses children in the same age for this and make them so working for MY money.
Children should be just children and not manipulated by advertising, I think.
They should go outside and talk to their friends or playing games with them without using electronical toys or something like that instead of sitting inside and playing with plastic alone.
Watching television is a common thing to do to in your spare time nowadays through all the generations.
Parents of young children often use it to enetratin their children to have a little time to themselves.
But televison contains a big part of advertisments between the different programs.
Are these ad´s really good, especially those that are created for young children?
Is it good that they are legal?
Obviously, young children are very responding to advertisments that are created for their age and therefor the selling concerns earn a certain amount of money just because children can´t stop asking their parents for the toy they desire to have.
Ad´s can also be very helpful when it comes to ideas about what to buy for the child as a present.
But are advertisments really good for a child´s developement?
The children learn that they can get everything they want and they find role models in the actors of advertisments.
Now it depends on the content of said ad wether the child is develloping in a positive or in a negativ way.
To clarify things it must be said that advertisments created for young children are often constructed very easy and are questionable from the sight of an adult (or a teenager or anybody who left the stage of development where everything that the older kids do is fantastic and can´t be anything but absolutly cool).
In my opinion you shouldn´t forbid ad´s for children completly because they are too important "selling machines" in the economics, but what is definetly possible is to make laws around them, so that somehwow the too extreme forms of advertising towards children with questionable content would be avoided.
It has often been discussed wether or not television advertising towards children aged two to five should be allowed or not.
Personally, I think it should not for the following reasons.
First of all, a child of two to five years is not yet able to understand marketing strategies and make informed decisions on wether to buy a product or not.
Therefore advertising something towards them exploits their childish innosense for profit.
Instead products should be advertised to their parents who are responsible for making informed decisions for their children and protect them until they are able to do it themselves.
Furthermore, a child of that age would probably want to own anything they see on television and lots of annoyed parents would probably give in just to have peace.
However, this kind of peace is only going to last until the child wants to own something else.
This kind of procedure teaches children a craving for material possession from a very young age, as well as a mentality of buying something just to throw it away some time soon.
These are values that have already lead to great problems in the world, such as huge piles of waste on land as well as in the ocean.
I believe we should not instill the same values that have caused so much destruction to our planet already in the following generations again but instead teach them to make a change.
Therefore in my opinion it is unethical to advertise something to children who do not know any better yet and exploit them, their parents and our planet for profit.
I will analys the following statement : Television advertising directed toward young cildren ( aged two to five ) should not be allowed.
So I would start with an positiv argument for  the statement that not all advertising in television are comfortable for the age of young children, maybe they see something which scared them very much or something like this.
An argument against the statement is that childrens see all the beautiful toys in television an parents see what there child like and what the child wish there self  for birrthday or christmas and the parents can buy it (when the toy is allowed for the age of the child).
But then there is another good point for the statement that this toys the children seen in the television and wish them self for birthday then it can get cery uncontrolled, because the child don't see only one toy but so many toys and they want at the end every toy from the television which is not the key.
At the end I will say that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, I agree half to the statement, because on the one side I will say that it is good then kids see what is goinig on with new toys and to be up to date in the age of four or five.
But under this age I thing that the chidren don't really know what this is and what is good, also are toys not everything for these young children.So it have positiv and neagtiv arguments.
But at the end I asked my self, should it be allowed for children in the age from zero to three to watch televison ?
This is another question which is very criticaly to look at this.
I agree with this statement and in the following text I'll explain, why:
First are there series and movies on television which shouldn't be allowed for young children, because maybe in the serie someone died or kill a person.
This could be really dangerous for the psych of a child.
Second are there movies or series with no background story or sense.
In this age I think they should whatch something, where they can learn for example a language or names of things.
Movies like 'Barbie' are just for 'making money' and not healthy for the brain.
On the other side is television something, what you can't hold back from your child.
Maybe the kid whatch movies with their friends or when they visit the grandparents.
I think whatching a movie is okay, if they can learn something.
Maybe a movie with an ethical question, easy to understand for children.
It's important, that they don't  whatch movies, which make them dumb or are reclame for toys or food.
In conclusion I would say television is okay, if they can learn something or they whatch something, which don't make them dumb or are unhealthy for the brain.
And its important too, that they don't whatch to much on a day.
Maybe just 30 minutes or one hour.
That should be enough.
But in the age from one to three I would not allowed my children to whatch television.
They should grow up with the knowledge, there are other interesting things, not just something like television or a smart phone!
The question if television have not to be allowed to young children is diskussed from many people.
A big problem is the lenguage from many tv-shows.
For example "Teletabis" have a very bad lenguage, because the characters talk like little children they just start to talk.
So if many young children see this TV-show to often they don´t get a better lenguage.
On the other side there are many TV-shows where the kids lern new tings.
For example "Dora" in the german Television.
She teach children in english on a way that everybody can understand this.
So young children heard this language in young years of their life and maby they learn faster if they get it in a school lesson.
Children have to learn many things about our nature.
They have to learn what can hurts for example.
It is a big problem that many children and teenagers don´t go outside.
They sit in front of the computer or the Television to often.
But inside they don´t can learn how to climb on a tree.
Young children need a social life and it´s impossible to have a social if they´re always inside the house or the flat and also not in front of the television.
It´s a fact that the internet will be more important in our future.
Young children could learn how to use electronic things with help from the television.
They will be confrontet with technic very fast and every genartion get faster an cell phone or something else.
The Television could help to teach young children in technic.
On my mind every adult have to choise for him- or her self.
I know it could get problems if it not be allowed and other young children watch every day Television.
Because it´s a crazy atwenture to see for the first times unknown people or unknown animals in the television.
I would allowed my young children to watch television, because everybody do it today and I think it´s more easier for my child to learn this thing when it is young.
But it´s have to be a rule how long the child watch television.
Television advertising directed to young children is a complicated theme.
Some people say that the children are influenced in a wronge way and the advertising isn't good for them.
Other Opinions are that the children don't watch television anyway because it make them stupid.
Others say that isn't bad for them because they don't understand what they watch on the TV.
So what is better for them ?
I would say it isn't good that young children watch TV because they are in a age where you have to play with other kids or play in the nature.
Added to that adults and older children also get influence by the television advertisment.
But when a children watch TV the advertisment isn't the bad thing they get influence.
So when you try to make the TV more helpful for the children you must change something by the series or film the watch.
The series and films are most of the time some stupid stories without a moral or senes in it.
You also have the advertisment everywhere in citys.
So can't you go outside anymore because your children can maybe get influence?
I wouldn't say so.
It is the job of the parents that the children see not the advertisment.
They should see the important things.
In the end I would say that television advertising isn't the best one for our children but you can't change something and you must help your children that they see the other things in the world.

Do you know the saturday evenings, when you watch a film for the whole family?
And suddenly there is an advertisement directed to your younger brothers or sisters?
And then they'll cry all the time: Mum, i want this!
Dad, can you buy me this?
And when you are in the city with them, they recognize the things from the adverisements and cry again.
Should television advertising directed toward young children not be allowed anymore?
I'm going to write first arguments against a prohibition of TV advertisement directed toward young children an then arguments for a prohibition.
We live in a liberal country, everyone has the right to tell what he thinks.
Switzerland is also economically really liberal.
Because of this, many enterprises want to sell their products here.
When we regulate everything, it's not good for economy.
When you wouldn't allow advertisement for young children any more, because they could be influenced, you shouldn't allow television advertising for old people, because they could be influenced as well and so on.
You would have to prohibit nearly every form of advertisement, when you do this.
But there are many arguments for a prohibition of this form of advertisement.
You could influence little children really easiliy, because they can't think really critically at this age.
You just have to tell them in this advertisements enough times, that your product is really "cool", and then they wan't to buy it.
I think it's like indoctrination, and you shouldn't indoctrinate this little children.
It's a well-calculated advertising business.
They direct their advertisement toward a certain age of children.
In the statistics, they can find out, for which age a TV-show is produced an then produce their advertisement for exactly the same age of children.
And so much money from hard-working parents is spent for things, that the children don't really like, things, they only want to buy because of the adverisement and which is propably not good for them.
Finally, i think you have to prohibit this form of advertisement, because it's a really strong and well-calculated indoctrination of young children, which don't have the possibility to think critically and don't know how this money is earned, which the want to spend on things, they only want because of the advertisement.
Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
Is it O.K to show advertising in televison, which is directed to young children?
Do these young children know what advertising is and are they able to judge if the object in the advertising is somthing good or if it is a product they can not use?
In every televison advertising the things the company wants to sell looks so cool and useful.
Lego Airplanes seem to fly and action heroes figures are able to walk.
The advertising does not show the the products how they are in real life

Young children can't say if the need these things or not.
The advertising shows how cool these things are and the young people are automaticly attracted to these things and want to buy them.
When I was young, I wasn't able to make the difference between usefull stuff and unusefull shit.
I think it's not fair because the young people think of everything in TV: " Oh look at this cool airplane!!!
I want to have on of these!
Please can I have one??"
But I think there is also some usefull advertising for young children.
If the advertising shows websites and online learning platforms, which are only designed for young children, then I think it's absolutly O.K to make advertising directed to young children.
It's a good thing for young children to play easy games on websites like KIKA or SuperRTL.
These websites are specially designed for children.
The children can't do any faults or dangerous things on these sites.
And the children can learn pretty much from the games or the learning tasks.
The children can learn to use the Internet on a save way.
I think toy advertising directed to young children is not a good thing but advertising for websites and learning platforms which are save ist
Should advertising in the television be allowed for young children or not?
Advertising for young children should be allowed because it´s the excercise of the parents how often and how long a two to five year old children should watch TV.
If this advertisments are especialy for the children like advertisments about new dolls ore playmobil tractors there is no argument why the children shouldn´t see this.
Of course the kids want to have these stuff later but even this is the decision of the parents if the children will get this or not.
But there are even things that are not very good for young children.
But often the advertisment on the children chanals are not bad for them.
If you let the kids alone with the TV and they can change the chanal that is not good because maybe they get some advertisment from the new horror movie or stuff like this.
It´s a pitty that you can´t watch TV without advertisment but when the children watch series on Super RTL or KiKa and so on there is not much advertisment and only between the different series.
In my opinion Television advertising directed toward young children is okay because as the parent you have to decide when the children can look a film or there favourite series.
When especialy the very young children don´t look too much TV and advertisment it´s okay.
But it is very important that they even play in the garden or with theire brothers or sisters.

Television advertising is a big topic nowadays.
You can't watch TV without loads of spots about products you schould buy.
Even kids get involved in this kind of manipulation.
So there is the question, if this should be allowed and what consequences could be the result of it.
Young people always are more manipulative than adults.
Often they don't realize what is fake and what is real and that is the thing the advertising companies use for their sucsess.They show the kids a fake world with everything they dream about.
So the kids get manipulated and they wanrt to have all the bveautiful things they see in the televison.
Especially very young children are in volved in this problem, They can't judge the situation and don't see the real reasons and the conmpanies behind the great and fantastic advertising-world
You could say that this is a problem of the parents because they have to look after the young children and should decide what they see and what they don't see.
But  how can you protect your kid from all this advertisment?
It's nearlly everywhere and sometimes also very hidden.
In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed to make advertisment in TV for young kids.
In today's Society it is all about having things and wear clothes with the right brands.
Kids learn this behaviour nearly sinse they've been born.
And this shouzld be stopped.
Kids have to grow up with the kown of the right values and advertising in TV desstroys that.
This text is about the line " Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
First it's important to ask, if the children in these ages really understand the advertisment.
They see the product and  maybe want to have it, if they like it.
Probably the children will claim to their parents weeks and weeks, that they want to have the thing, shown in the advertisment.
But maybe they don't.
Advertising is more a thing for the parents so they have to decide, if they want to buy the product or not.
So if they are able to spend the money, the product costs or not.
So the question isn't really if children in these ages should watch these advertisments, it's more important if it's necessary that the children watch it, when they don't really notice.
What speeks for the advertising is that the children get motivated to concentrate on one thing so maybe, the concentration of them gets better.
Another point is that they see the new things , children in their ages can play with.
A negative point is, as I said, that the children maybe claim at their parents, that they want to have the product even, if the parents don't have the money to buy it.
So they will maybe argue with their children.
I think, that advertisment is like everywhere, in the streets, shops, newspapers, or just the child in the kindergarten, which has the product.
So it doesn't really matter if there is advertising in the TV or not.
Today, there are many television programs which are directed to young children.
But shouldn't we asked ourselves if these programs influence the life of the young children and shouldn't be allowed?
On the one handside, there are programs which can be good for young children because they wanted them to think and to learn about new things.
For example, in my childhood I often watched a television program where other children made experiments and I learnd about new things which I told to my family and my friends.
I think these programs are important for young children because they can also do these things at home and show it to their friends and families.
And they are proud about theirselves when they also made these experiments.
But on the other handside, there are also television programs which aren't important for young children.
The children can't learn from them and the programs only shows bullshit.
And then the children also want to do these things because they think it is cool and they can be proud about theirselves when they can make these things too.
But then the parents get angry and they have to tell their children that these things which they have watched in televison aren't good and that they aren't allowed to do them.
All in one, I think that television programs where the young children can learn from are very important because they have to think about new things.
But the television programs which only shows stupid things shouldn't be allowed because the children want to do these things too because they think they are cool, and that's not good.
I agree with this statement.
I think, that television advertising could influence children very much and often not in a good way.
Especially in the age of two to five children learn from their environement and believe in everything what they see and hear.
You can tell them something about magic or animals which can speak and they believe you because they don't know it better.
They don't have other experiences or can check something in the internet or in books.
They just trust you and the television "industry" knows how to use this.
So television advertising isn't good for children, because you can't controll what your child is looking at.
Another thing is, that parents are under pressure, if their child can see to much of television advertising.
Today, every family will be the best and happiest, so the children should have everything.
If the child see a new doll or a new car they want it and the parents will buy it.
But on the other hand I think it could be very difficult and complicate to do television without television advertising just for children.
Often the channels are financed by some companies or factorys which pay the channel for showing their products.
As an effect some of the channels couldn't maybe exist.
In the end it's a question of the moral.
What is more important?
The future of the children or the surviving of the channels?
I know this question isn't really fair, but for me it's simple.
I'm against television advertising and that's the reason why I agree with this statement.
Doues television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed?
What is the right way to educate children?
Some people have a clear opinion on this topic.
They told that children should go out and see the nature, they should do sport and that they need a lot of fresh air.
Other families do not have time to get out with the children, because they have to work a lot.
So the kids stay at home and when they told that they do not like to get out because it is boring there or the weather is not good, the parents let them watch tv.
Because when they do so, they are silent all the time and they sometimes learn also something.
It is clear that it is easy for the parents to let them watch tv because like that they do not have to look after the children.
I think that there will be more and more children who will look at tv because everything is getting digital.
This was also find out by the advertismentbusines.
So they try to get the money and if they find a new group of costumers it is better for them.
But is it dangerous for the children?
Maybe they can see the new things to buy and they always want something new and do not need the stuff they had since then.
So they could get really nobel and selfish.
On the other side, they maybe learn early that the advertisment is something to look at critcal because there are different strathegies to manipulate the people.
So if the kids learn it early they wont tap into a hole later.
My personal opinion is that children should not watch tv a lot, so they do not get in touch with all this advertisment.
When they are outside they can see the nature and the real life.
I think that it is not possible to make a permission on it.
Because they will always find a space in the law.
So if parents do not like that the kids can see this advertisments, they should not let them watch tv.
Nowadays many children spend hours in front of electronic devices and the worst part of it, they get animated by advertising and pictures.
Back in time the kids were playing football outside and today you can find them playing football in the living room, their eyes fixed on a screen.
Fist we should point out the medical part.
Spend to much time in front of the television can lead to overweight and socail isolation that has an effect to the physical and psychical life.
Children in their young ages shouldn't have any contact with electronic devices that are showing us pictures and impressions because eyes that are that young aren't able to capture all of them and the brain has not been ready yet to identify this rapidly chanching moments.
However, if children below the age of five get in contact with advertising especially produced for them, they make the parent to buy this stuff that appeared in the television.
The problematic is that familiys who have not that much money and  buy this things to make their children happy, often get in struggle with dealing way more important things like paying bills for school and medicine.
On the other hand we always get in connact with advertising, even if we are going to the supermarket or just for a walk on the strees.
Children see pictures that are producet to animate adults to buy something and if their seeing advertising anyway, why should they see advertisig directed toward them.
In my opinion it sould not be allowd to produce advertising especially for children under the age of five because they are not able to identify that impressions and it is nearly impossible for them to handle with all this pictures.
This advertisings in the television leads to a social isolation of the child and exactly in that young ages it is important to have connections to other children and familys and if they can not grow up with that knowlege how to threat and talk to other people it can have fatal influences for their entire life.
Yes.
Advertising towards young people should be forbidden.
In this age kids believe everything someone older than them says.
They should not be told, that everything that looks good in advertisings is good in real life.
Our life is all about consuming.
Even the youngest people are drilled to get the best toy.
This is ok, when it is something out of a good quality, like Pokemon cards.
But if you advertise this 200 gramm plastic thingything and everyone is buying it, you are a serious problem in this society.
We can not live towards consumption.
This was one argument.
The other argument is far more primitive.
Nor mother nor father want to have the stress, caused of a little kid wanting really bad this new toy out of the TV-advert.
Whoever lets this stress happen to parents on this earth, had eather no siblings, or was rich since his birth.
If I will ever have kids, my kids will watch kika, where there is no advertising going on.
I don't want to have kids who are always wanting something new.
If it is out of good quality, then sure.
But these toys will never be advertised in this kind of television.
To wrap it up, advertising directed towars young people is not that what I want for our world.
Advertising is all about the content these days and it is false to ban all of them, because most of it is harmless to young children

First of all ,Children shouldn`t be allowed to look to much tv anyway, they should do some activities for example: meet friends or go play outside.
Parents have to pay attention and take care of their children, they could watch TV together and if some strange advert comes up the parents should be there
to explain whats going on in this advert.
So its a question of how the parents raise the children, the adverts doesn`t have to be taken out.
And the other important thing is here what content it is in the adverts, it could affect the children a little bit perhaps to buy some games or something but that isn`t a reason to ban an advert because they`re an important part of the oeconomics, that wouldn`t be very rentable to ban it.
When its toward young children it won`t be very dangerous, they won`t ruin their future or harm them in an other way.
I disagree to ban advert to young children because it wouldn`t hurt them.
The most important reason why i am disagreeing with this is because that would be just to make  small problem not even a problem into something big that would just be unecessary action to do because it doesn`t affect them much, we have to concentrate on real problem.
For me it just to overprotective.
on th
A lot of people think that young children (age two to five) should not be in contact with television.
In the following text i want to show why i agree and disagree with this statement at the same time.
First of all I think that young children should play with other, real children and not with people in the television.
They should be in a direct contact with children in their age to grow old together.
They need to learn things together.
They should not just watch how things are going but learning it by themselves or together with other kids in their age.
In my opinion they also need to learn that you can have fun without electronics.
For example they need to learn that even with just a few stones you can play a cool game.
I also think that it is really important later that you have  best friends since they were young children.
These relationships are often really strong and important in one's life and last their whole life.
If these strong relationships don't exist, people could have problems to find friends later in their lifes, because they never needed to.
But i also think that these children are going to be in contact with these social medias anyways so it doesn't really matter at which point in their life it will happen.
In our modern world which is full with electronics it's nearly impossible to not be in contact with things like the television.
In the end I personally think that it is okay to let young children watch television, if it is not too much.
They should not watch television the whole day but I think it is not that bad if they are watching television one hour per week.
There's only one reason for a company to produce an advertisement for their new toy: It works.
It may be annoying for everybody else but there's a whole line of work occupied with selling their products including toys and it's inhumane to rid them of their occupation.
Frankly, why is it such a bad idea for toddlers to watch adverts anyway?
The only thing prohibiting it would accomplish is a whole bunch of young children watching adverts directed at older kids and adults as they stumble in the room when someone else's watching TV and who's to say this wouldn't be a worse influence?
To start with, there are many and more people working with the concept of selling as many toys to young children as possible and their livelyhood depends on this.
If you close one market you have to open another or risk to flood the job market with more people it can possibly support.
In protecting toddlers from influence which may or may not be bad you would certainly destroy much more.
This leads me to my second argument.
Is it really so bad?
Of course it's stressfull for parents when their child starts crying and whining about wanting this new plane but isn't this a parental problem?
You have to teach a kid constraint and other things, it can't just get anything it wants.
A problem which only concerns young parents shouldn't be the reason to shut down a whole market.
Since adverts are everywhere you look it whould be very difficoult for young children to never see them and if they're going to see a lot of them anyway why not have some of them directed to them?
It would certainly distract them from advertisements which may not be all that child friendly.
You can't shelter a child from everything.
If you bring it up sheltered and protected each second of the day it will one day stub his toe horribly on reality.
In this sense it would be nonsensical to prohibite something other lifes depend on.
If someone has a problem with advertisement directed at young children they should rather concern themselves with the values their kid learns and what's really important in life.
When I am alone at home with my little sister, aged four, she always wants to watch televison.
Normally I like that too.
But there is so much advertising, which makes her sometimes fear.
So I often ask myself should it not be allowed that television advertising is directed toward young children.
An advantage of watching advertising televison is that these children can learn something from the advertising.
But it is not so good for them if they watch tv the whole day.
They should spend more time with their friends and play together.
An other positiv thing is that the parents can have some free time, while the child is watching a movie.
But in these chase it is not useful if the child watchs television advertising.
A lot of people say that young people get stupid because of the television.
An other disadvantage is that young people don't learn to spend any time together and have fun without a television.
They should play a game in the garden or do something else.
An other negativ thing is that the children see things they don't know anything about it.
And that's not good for their evelopment.
I think it's really important that young children don't watch too much television.
When I was young we didn't have a television and i played a lot with my friends and neighbours.
The parents should look by themselves what's good for their children and what not.
I think it would be too complecated to itroduce these
My answer to the question if I agree with the statement "televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" is a "no".
Although I see, that it depends on the object of advertising, I don't think that general advertisement should be directed toward children.
Because children are children, they are young, and some things they can't and they won't ever understand.
For example would they immediately be sad or disappointed if their parents told them they couldn't afford that automatic play car that are always shown in between their favourite cartoon disney show.
Children can't think rationally enough yet to see beyond their own desires.
In my opinion it is wrong to manipulate children into wanting things ,they may not even be able to afford, just for making good money.
I see that there is theoretically speaking nothing wrong with directing advertisement toward children, because in the adult world it happens all the time, because that is how economics work, but in reality children aren't in that state of thinking yet.
Their only thought in their head will be: "Oh I want that cool robot Figure" and not: "Oh I wonder if mum could afford that.
I'm going to wait patiently for christmas season and ask if I may get it."
Children that want something but can't get it are a true piece of work.
It's hard for me to picture a happy, all flowers and rainbows family if the child every week asks for a new cool toy because it is apperently the 'Thing to get' when you're a five year old.
Many children often cry for something they want, let it be chocolate, let it be a toy, but I believe that - if advertised directly to the children themselves - it would be much worse.
Espacially if those things are sold as 'unique' and of 'brand', which not would make them more expensive but the kids would also grow up to only want brandy things anymore.
In my opinion advertising directed toward young children shouldn´t be allowed.
Those children are in a too young age to built up their own opinion and watching advertising could influence their brain and their way of thinking a lot.
Advertising with the wrong content and images could also influence their later opinion and behaviour when they´re grownn up, beacause they listened to those advertising when they were younger.
Promoting more and more wrong ideals and norms advertising has so much power and could so of course have a lot impact on the youth.
In regard to this advertising for young children may not contain wrong ideals and norms, because the content for young children would be more simple and just full of things that are funny and enjoyable.
Further more you could say that all those advertisings are always proved so that they should be save for young children to watch, but still there could always be some hidden images that the children then get to know.
The question is just: Can we trust the people who design those advertisings?
Can we trust society?
As it´s known society puts so many wrong ideals and norms in the world, so that everybody thinks he has to follow those ideals and norms.
So many grown up people are influenced by those images promoted in advertisings, that we should think about how much influence advertising than can have then on young children.
They are growing up, developing an opinion and get then of course much influenced by those promoted images.
As result advertising for young children shouldn´t be allowed.
They could get guided wrong and grow up with wrong images society has given them.
Especially in this young age they should develop their own opinion with things they experience by their own.
Television advertising may have some good and bad effects depending on your point of view.
It can beneficiate the viewers and the company advertising their product or it can cause some "damage" to the viewers.
Whenever young children are being directly "spoken" to through advertising, they immediately believe every thing that is being said, without giving it a second thought.
Toys for example are always very well advertised, sometimes it can even be a little bit exaggerated.
A very good example can be barbies advertisiment.
On tv the kids probably see a very nice adverstisement with a good story of this one barbie having a pool party with other friends in this very cool pool, for a not so expensive price.
The kids then run to their parents to tell them about the nice barbies and the pool that has just been advertised for a good price.
The parents of course believe their kids and once they get to the place to buy their daughter, or maybe even their son, these toys they get disappointed because the advertisement was for the pool without the barbies and the kids misunderstood this.
Another downside is the fact that kids may feel a pression to have that exact same product they saw on tv or on a magazine.
Whenever they see some of their friends getting it, they insist their parents to get it for them.
Sometimes the parents can't afford it.
Television advertising can also be somehow upsetting for the kids because of the fact that you see it again and again and again.
It has a very good side though, that way kids know what they want for their birthday or christmas, which makes it easier for the parents to buy something because they already have an idea.
The company advertising the product makes profit and the children and parents are happy.
If the kids learn the don't-believe-everything-you-see-on-tv lesson, it can make them more observative.
They won't just pay more attention to what it's actually being said and advertised on tv, but also in other different situations.
So television advertising can sometimes be educative.
To conclude, I don't know if I should agree or disagree with the statement because of both the up- and downsides, but I don't really think that parents or young children actually have something against it.
I know I don't and I don't know anyone who does.

On the one hand children can get influenced negatively from the advertisement, for example from advertisements which shows the ideal of women or men.
Advertisements which are constructed with a hidden message also can be dangerous for the child.
For example it is a hidden sexistic message and the child would not even notice that because at its age it does not no what sexism is, but when the child grows up it could be possible that it can get a tendence to support sexism.
Of course this is a extreme version of influence.
It also can be bad words in the advertisements.
The child hears them and automatically save them.
That could influence their future life.
On the other hand Televion advertisements are just a very small part in the childrens daily life, more important are the surrounding people like the parents.
It is more important that they let the child grow up without wrong opinions or a specific creed.
Furthermore it is the choice of the parents if their child watchs Television, because at the end it is their choice what they want to allow and what to forbid and they choose how to raise their child up and it is not the choice of any other person.
Also it would be difficult to forbid the television advertising towards young children because you can not monitor what parents let their children watch and if there would not be any advertisments between the TV Shows the TV Channels have to fill a lot of more plot.
My opinion on this statement is that there are several advertisements on televion which young children should not see because it could have influence on their furture life and opinion and these advertisements should not allowed, but it is the choice of the parents what they let their child watch.
Television Advertising directed toward young children

In racent years the amount of advertising young shildren greaw enormously.
the reason for this is the big influances of Television advetising.
Some people think it will be good to stop Televison advertising towards young children.
If there is a lot of advertising for young children, they will watch a lot of television.
The brain of young children isn't that smart yet.If there is an advertising,the children wants to have everything for their home themselves.This will lead to a big problem for their parents.
Not Only this is the problem of advertising towards young children on televioson.
Televison it selve is a big problem for young children.The eyes of young children can be damaged because of several things.
The big companies are not interessted on thhis informations.
They only see the money owned by the children parents.
If there is a company who directed advertising two years old.
they will realise that the advertising is more annoying than useful.because the children are to young to understand something.
From my opinion I completely agree with this statement.I do think Telesion Advertising towards young people should not be allowed too.
Its just very unusfull for bouth sides the companies and the young children.Last but not least 
everybody should do what they want to do
Children nowadays are able to watch television as much as they want, therefore they will eventually see many commercials directed towards older people but also commercials directed towards them.
I will talk about the use of such tactics and their manipulative substance.
Afterwards, I will be talking about the ethical point of view.
First things first, showing children advertises directed towards them can be really profitable for companies which for example sell clothes or toys.
Children at that age will not be able to withstand their desire to have it, meaning that their parents will have to buy it, unless they want their children to cry all day long.
It is a really smart move for companies to do so, nevertheless children lose interest in things quite fast.
They will not stick around with the idea of having the things shown in the advertises for a long period of time therefore companies need to make really smart and appealing advertises for the children to really want it.
Secondly, advertises are made to manipulate people into buying things or believing things that they would not do otherwise.
Despite the fact that it is pretty hard to manipulate adults, it is rather easy to do so on children.
Children, especially young ones under the age of ten, are very vulnerable against manipulation.
That is the reason companies can make a huge profit out of this fact.
Last but not least, I do not think that it is very ethical to do advertising directed toward young children, yet no one can stop it because, from a legal point of view, it is totally fine.
As I said before, young children are extremly vulnerable against manipulation and taking advantage of that fact does not seem right to me.
It may be helpful for companies to do some advertises for young children but it is not really fair, not for their parents nor for the children themselves.
To conclude, I think that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I believe that there are way more ethical ways for a company to make advertises than directing them towards young children which can not see that they are being tricked.
In modern times, media is an important pillar of our society and available nearly everywhere and to everyone.
Thus, companies realised the opportunities using modern media for their advertising and product placement in every kind of technology.
Many companies and firms especially rely on the big amount of young children (or potentional consuments) for their advertising, who are easy to manipulate and easily convinced by a remarkable advertising.
This leads to the question, if television advertising, which is available to nearly every child in the western world and in every age should be allowed legally?
There are several points that support the idea of banning television advertising for young children in order to keep them protected from being manipulated.
Companies know, that small children, whose parents are stressed and more or less careless in modern times, have a big influence on their parents and their shopping.
So when mama or papa leave the house, they often let their child sitting in front of the tv, letting it watch his favourite show.
By using this kind of knowledge, companies try every kind of advertising beneath the series/programmes or in the shows themselves in order to convince the children, that this product is neccessary for their "further life".
The children then tell their parents their new favourite product and won´t stop begging for it until it´s in their hands.
Kids are used as an indirect way to force their parents to buy companies products and are therefore intentionally manipulated.
Compared to modern regulation and law standards, these methods could be called a child abuse, as kids mental unstabilities are abused willingly in hope to gain the most profitable advertising methos.
With this fact in mind, everyone would be interested in stopping this kind of manipulative and abusing advertising, especially if it could reach their own child.
But t
Television advertising has become quite normal to us since we watch it on every chanel but is it the good for our children?
Children are easy to influence especially in a young age and the adds are trying to use this influence for their own good: Selling their things.
With advertisings children find out what all there is to get and it might be a help for the parent, knowing what the own childs wish is for Christmas, Eastern or the childs birthday.
On the other hand at that age the parents probably know better what is good for their children and most of the things shown on TV aren't.
A two year old most likely can't really judge if a game or any other advertised thing is clever to buy, so the child will get his/her parents to buy it and maybe in the end it will be laying in the corner of the room ot even the trash can.
That would be thrown out money but maybe the child would also learn to see what is behind the great looking add, a good thing or something for the trash.
I agree with the statement that advertisment of this kind shouldn't be allowed because it is not for the good of the child but just for the money filled pockets of the industry.
Also I think that parents are the ones who know best what is for their children (especially at the children's age of two to five)and not some stranger doing the advertising.
Nowdays television advertising is very popular and common.
The main question about it is if it should be not allowed toward young children.
This statement will be discusse in the following arguments.
Firstly, television advertising is dangerous for little children.
The are getting a wrong image for example the see a toy which looks very awesome and high quality but in real it is like plastic.
Moreover, childrens want more toy and have more whises for birthday.
When they see something very cool in television the want that and they ask their parents allnthe time to get it, so the parents get annoyed and they might want to see the child happy so the buy them the stoff.
A positive aspect is that the economies increase.
With television advertising they make a lot of money because the children see what it is to have thistoy and it shows them the fun and plessure and they want the parents to buy these things.
Secondly, they do not waste so much paper.
The economies do not use any paper to make television advertising, so it is better for the environment.
They do not waste as much as they would do with flyers.
In conclusion, I disagree with the following statement because of the fact that advertising increases our economie.
If a small child watches televison often, it gets to know advertisement, some of it is directed to them.
Advertisement especially for young children is often discussed controversy.
What are the main pros and cons?
Children need and want other things than adults.
So it is legitime to advertise for products for kids as for example plays.
Moreover, children might feel an unfairness if there's no advertisement directed toward their age.
However, they can't cope with such thing as advertisement.
On contrary to adults, children can't select between good and bad influences and they aren't as critish as older people may be.
So if they see a product in an advertisement they believe that it's great, as the advertisement want them to think.
The people who produce these spots know this exactely and abuse the children in this sense.
In general, children shouldn't be watching television too often because they only become dumb with what they see.
Advertisement adds a quite big impact to this.
To sum up, I think that advertisement directed toward young children only has a bad influence on them.
Advertisement is never good, but for young children it is even worse.
There are many children who often watch TV shows in the evening or especially younger children who even watch during the day.
Their parents might be working and do not have time for them or they just want to enjoy their liberate time after a workday.
But is television really a supportive way to entertain the children?
Especially nowadays when there are so many advertising traps?
It is worth to discuss this habit of the children because it might has negative influences.
But now, what are the most important aspects about television advertisings and why should/shouldn't they be allowed?
First of all, advertising is a huge business, and if i wasn't allowed there were many people who didn't have any jobs.
Additionally, it is always a fiancial support for the TV channel and they can use this money to produce important shows.
And last but not least are the TV adds also very inspirational for young children for playing and they get great ideas there.
But there are also many negative points, for example the need to buy these things which are in TV even if they are not needed in their househols.
Secondly, it can increase the aggression of these kids, especially for little boys, when they see plastic weapons and similar stuff.
So they start to think that war is something they should apchiate.
And as a last negative point, we could mention, that all these things just support the production of plastic garbage, and thats bad for our climate.
In conclusion, I can say that the negative points are more important than the negatives but evidentially, I can also understand the reasons why the industry is supporting these adds.
I think it would be very difficult to ban them from the televison business.
Television advertising is very manipulative, that's a fact.
With there pretty people and sneaky music as so text, they get into your head and almost force you to buy their product.
And the problem is, it's everywhere.
In Television, on posters at the street,...
So it is impossiple to avoid them.
The only way to not get manipulated is to question it.
Look through it.
But not everybody is able to escape it and so they get blinded by all the pretty and pricy things.
As said, it's hard to look behinde the manipulative trick of the advertising company and it's even harder for children.
Than young kids have an inocennt sould and mind.
They are not able to question the things they see.
Children believe what adults say because they don't know it better.
In that case it's very easy for the Television advertising to manipulated little children and to get into their heads.
Imagine a little girl is watching her favorite TV show, adoring the animated figure, her hereo.
But as the show is over an advertising of a doll showes up.
Of course the adverstising claims that this doll is the best and prettiest and that every girl in the wolrd needs it.
So the little girl jumps onto her feet, runs to her mommey and asks her deperatly to buy her this doll.
But when the mother refuses to buy the toy, the child gets mad and sad.
Television advertising has so much effect on the feeling on young children and the bank account of the parents.
To look at it from the otherside, in some points advertising can be even more dangerousfor adults.
Because different from children grown-ups have a credit card.
Luckly children don't have the ability to buy all the pretty things they see on television, otherwise they would get into lot of debts.
And sometimes the young children's mind doesn't understand what the people in the TV wants to say.
so their nsimple and naiv minde would safed them form the manipulative advertising

Summing up I think that Televisio advertising directed toward you children shouln't be allowed.
It's okay to watch here and then a funny show for children on TV, maybe they than even leran from it.
But in my opinion kids shoul be spending more time on playing on the playgroud with their friend, than sitting on the couch watching manipulative advertising.
Because when even adults get tricked by the advertising company,how can children be safe from it.
My broter is ten years old.
Like his friends, he likes to watch television and does is quite every afternoon.
Of course, as  we are living in the same appartment, I hear and see what he is watching.
I have notices that much of the TV program are advertising.
And often I hear him saying: "Mom, come and look... How cool is that?
Can I get this?"
You just have to see one time the advertising they are showing kids and you could not deny thaht telvision advertising arevdirected toward young children.
It is more than obvious!
Concerns know when and what to show on wich channel.
As children are watching channels specifically for kids, concerns are using this fact, or even better, the young childtem to sell their products.
Should it be forbidden to direct television advertising toward young children (aged two to five)?
Advertising serves to convince people to buy the product, so what is not right by showing adverts even to younger people?
I don't think we should forbid it because the concerns just want to sell their toys, they aren't evil.
If a mother or father has a problem with his  child watching those advertising, he sould not let him watch it or explain him seriously whats the point.
All our lifes we will have to face advertising not just as a kid.
I understand the problem with kids who are showed advertising.
They are easier to persuade and afterwards the parents have to be the bad people who are not buying him the toys.
But as I already said, if parents are having troubles with advertising, the should'nt allow their kids to watch television.
If we go further, we have to say that the whole TV program has a strong influence on us and our brains.
Parents who have problems with the influence of advertising should face the real problem.
Namely the whole entertainment program for kids and teenager.
It is normal that we belive mostly what we watch.
I thnk showing advertising yound children is the smallest problem, the parents just don't like it because they have to discuss with there children and be the bad ones who don't buy the toys.
Argumets why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed is on one hand that the parents have an overview of the stuff they could buy for their children.
If the children see the advertisments and like the toy, the parents know what the next birthday present could be.
On the other hand it's good for the company that sells the toys or clothes for young children because the mentality of adults is to make kids happy by giving them what they want.
The television advertising is the best, most efficient one if you are an adult with small children because when you are at home and you have things to do, you turn on the television so the kids aren't bored.
The companies can profit from this and don't hurt no one.
Television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed because they influence the childhood.
Children should make their own experiences by playing and being outside.
With those advertisments they just want to have what the kids in the television have because they seem happy with it.
Technology shouldn't be part of a child's daily life.
By showing this advertisments more kids start to watch TV.
Kids are influenced by those things and annoy their parents because they want the what other kids have.
Therefore, parents have to deal with kids, being influenced by technology that isn't made for them.
My opinion is that It shouldn't be allowed because it changes the childhood and the children's lifestyle.
Children should live the nature and not the technology like nowadays
My name is Raven Van Wood, part I
Once upon a time not too long ago there was a girl.
I was that girl.
Let me tell you the story how I met my best friend.
It was a thursday night and my frends and I were having a slumber party.
I didn't have many friends in High School, but the ones I had were the best one could have.
We had a slumber party because the next day I was supposed to leave town to go to college.
I was very excited and I couldn't hide it to go to college, since it wasn't a typical one.
They called it the college for special kids.
And I was special.
But anyway, I was excited to meet new people and make many friends.
After my friends left, I packed all my stuff.
My parents helped me doing that.
I saw it in their eyes, that they were sad.
Burt whenever I told them not to be sad they replied that they weren't sad but very excided for me.
While packing I couldn't think about anything else, then that that would be my last night in my own bed.
The next morning, my mom came into my room before the sun had risen.
She came into my room with a plate full of pancakes and a big jar of nutella.
I wondered it they would Have any Nutella at the college.
After breakfast it was already 8 am and it was time for me to leave.
I hugged my mom and my dad goodbye and stepped outside.
My mom wanted to wait with me for the bus, but I told her not to embarass me infront of my new classmates.
I waited, and waited, and waited and after a long time the bus finally arrived.
Maybe it was only five miutes that I waited but it felt like an hour.
I got into the bus and it was huge and there was only one seat left, next to a little boy.
I sat right next to him and asked what his name was.
He wasn't very talkative but he vas very nice.
His name was Bruce.
After seven hours of busdriving, we finally arrived to our destination.
Whitmorecollege.
It was a huge place.
there were about 12 buildings, one bigger than the other one.
I just stood there and stared at the place.
I never saw a school that big.
I always went to a little school in my hometown.
It had just about 200 stuents.
But here there probably were about 2000 students, if not more.
A very nice girl called Emily showed me to my room.
I didn't have any roommate but I was kind of happy about it.
My mother always told me stories about her annoying rommate and how she would have loved it to have a room by herself.
The first class I had to attend was the following morning, so I had the whole evening to look around and unpack my stuff.
It took me about an hour to unpack everything, so I still had an hour left until I was supposed to go to dinner.
I asked Emily if she could give me a plan of the school ground and show me a bit around.
She showed me the main building, it was a very old and elegant building.
It reminded me a lot of the church in my hometown.
Just about everyone has once seen parents with a young child in a supermarket, and noticed the inevitable consequence of this: While the parents are putting all their groceries on the conveyor belt, the child is bored and uses that time to beg the parents for the strategically placed sweets.
And if it tries enough, chances are the parents or the parent will just give up and buy it.
Because of this, there are people trying to ban TV advertising directed towards younger children in an effort to reduce that begging and make parent'slives just a little bit easier.
But does this make sense or will the advertisement's effects be short-lived and negligible?
Firstly, some people think that this just can't work, because "advertisements directed towards chilren aged two to five" is too hard to define.
What guidelines would advertisements have to follow?
Would this be abused by companies to ban their competitor's ads?
And how could is be measured and quantified towards what ages a product or ad is directed?
And also, there is the problem that a ban on certain ads would give companies' competitors in different countries a significant edge by improving their performance relative to the companies that have to follow the regulations.
This would ultimately be bad for the whole economy of the country.
And last but not least, the effects of the ads would be short-lived as the attention of the child shifts toards other things, so as long as the children don't watch TV immediately before leaving to a supermarket, the effect will be negligible.
But if you look closely at the anti-banning arguments, a significant self-contradiction is noticeable: the first two arguments talking about companies without ads being at a serious disadvantage seem to suggest that these ads are important for sales and therefore, their effect is big.
But inthe last argument, it is claimed that the effects will be small and not noticeable.
This suggests that the argument concerning the disadvantage could not be true, and that the effectis in fact so small that no one would notice the difference they make.
And lastly, if the effects are actually that big, why don't we make parenting, especially with younger children, a bit easier and reduce the amount of begging for sweets or whatever catches the child's fancy?
In conclusion, because young parents already have a hard enough job, I think society should really help the people who form our future a bit and ban TV ads for children.
It is even in everyone's own interests to have less children begging for something loudly and annoyingly by keeping companies from making ads that add to that sort of behavior.
I think this statement has a good point.
In my opinion kids shouldn`t even be watching television at that age, but if they have to do so anyways, at least there shouldn`t be any advertising made and screened for them.
Let`s start with what kind of commercials there are for kids.
Right now I have two of theme quite present.
The first one is for Kinder chocolate.
The second one for toys.
I want to talk about the chocolate first.
It`s a good thing to give your kid chocolate from time to time.
Chocolate makes happy, tastes good and contains more iron than spinach does.
But in the commercials you see on tv, they often make it seem as if the only thing that will make the child happy is chocolate.
And not even normal chocolat, oh no that would be to boring.
The chocolate the kids see on screen contains toys, has fancy names like Kinder Pingui (children will make the link to Penguin) and they are showed as the one and only thing you should recive as a snack during the break.
There`s this add right now where the kid walkes amelessly around the house.
The mom comes and gives it a chocolate bar.
It teaches out children that eating healthy isn`t normal and that if you are hungry, you should just eat chocolate.
Don`t know what to do, eat chocolate.
And in those products there are often some ingrediants that aren`t really healthy.
In addition it creates an unhealthy relationship between children and food.
If you have to direct foodcommercials to minors, at least do it with healthy things like fruits.
Now I`d like to change the topic to toys.
Approximately 90% of the commercials we have on kids tv are about toys.
A child that watches tv reguallarly will every two weeks see the new furreal friend, a new lego set or the new unicorns and what do I know.
But a child from about 3 years won`t be able to make a difference between I need this and I want this.
It`ll just see the happy faces of the kids on screen and thinks:"I want that too".
It makes our kids unsattisfied with what they have, only seeing that new, cool stuff the kid on tv got and wants it too.
For children it`s really hard in general to make a differenc between the things that are real and the once that aren`t.
Even as adults we sometimes struggle with it.
So how should a kid decide what is important and what isn`t, in the world that we created?
In the following essay i'm gonna write about advertising directed toward young children.
Well,the first controverse topic i want to write about is television for kids aged 2-5.
In my opinion kids shouldn't even sit in front of a television untill they are approximately 8 years old.
Especially in this age they have to learn a lot of other important stuff of their parents or siblings.
So they can learn what really matters in life.
Unfortunately, many parents put their kids in front of a television while they are doing other stuff.
What is more, parents kids in this age should have time for them.
Games like memory or puzzles are important for the brain and the development of them.
Its also very useful for primary school.
So i think kids prefer an afternoon on a playing field than in front of a TV.
Another thing is that ad in television is mostly not made for kids in this age.
They recognize it but they can't really understand it.
So  in conclusion, don't let kids aged 2-5 watching TV.
I totally disagree with this statement.
I absolutly see no reason why advertising for young people shouldn't be allowed.
But I see the discussting point because in this age of evolution you can manipulate children so easy.
The mean point of this is the developpers of the television advertising go directly to the feelings and emotions of the children.
The target is: they want to manipulate them that the children go to the parents and they say like: I want this teddybear I want it please buy me one.
But I think the advertising shouldn't be cancered because it is the case of the parents what they buy or not.
The parents also should control the using of the television for the child because advisement isn't the most dangerous thing in the tv.
But in general I stay by my opinion I disagree with the statement.
The best argument is the parents should control it and you never can say this advise is for children and this not.
Where is the frontier between them?
I rather don't know where and the managers of the tv channels have got the same problem.
So as a overview I can see some arguments for the statement but I don't see the better ones.
Mabye I can show a exemple of my life.
When I was younger, I always wanted an action man.
I wanted spiderman, batman and my favorite one superman.
In the tv there exist a advise for action man and I loved this adversing show.
but my parents never gave one to me.
Being parents can be very stressful.
They need to do the household and at the same time they need to care for their children.
Now a days thanks to the new technology it's possible to put the children in front of the television and get their work done.
As the children are watching cartoons there are always advertisements.
Now the government ask themselves if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not?
The purpose of watching television is to teach the children all the morals in life and to teach them the important vocabulary to speak the language.
Another purpose is to entertain the children.
Advertising directed toward young children would be the total opposite.
Children want the stuff they see and won't live in peace.
They start to rely on materialistic stuffs.
They want to buy everything that had been showed and think that only having these stuffs can make them happy like the kids in the advertisement always act.
Social media grows.
These days everyone has a cell phone, a computer or a television.
Many young kids come home from school and watch television the whole afternoon.
There are funny cartoons for children but also a lot of bad things, not ment for children eyes.
And from time to time there comes a advertise for a unnecessary product.
The kids see this product, for example a toy.
They see how cool it is and what you can do with it and then of course they want to have it.
So they go to the parents and beg until the parents allow them to buy it.
Then the kid plays with it.
Maybe for some days and then they'll forget the new toy.
I think that the parents shouldn't allow to watch television more than twice a week.
The kids can do so many other things.
I used to go outside, play with friends or do homework after school when I was young.
We never had a television and I am happy about that.
The young kids shouldn't see the horrible movies on television.
I'm not against television advertising directed toward young children.
I think the parents have to resist and say no when the kid wants to buy the products which was presented in the advertise.
In my opinion kids shouldn't spend the time in front of the television so they also wouldn't see the product.
I think it can be allowed to make advertising toward young children.
There is advertising everywhere.
First of all, it could be a problem if the children don't watch television.
In todays society it's sure quite impossible but some parents do still have a quite conservative mind and don't want their children to watch television.
Secondly, children can be manipulated very easily.
So if they see an advert, which is for sure an exaggeration of the actual product, the children will scream and shout until they get this, probably very expensive, product.
On the other hand it's a quite good idea for kids to see all the new products they could learn with.
Like this, the producers don't have to wait until a miracle happens and the kids or their parents will see the toy in the shop.
Also it could be a good way to teach the kids that they can never have everything they want.
Sure, for this the parents have to be quite strict, but if they are like this I'm sure the child will grow up an adult which has a lot of self-esteem.
Last but not least, todays children have so many difficulties to accept a no.
So many parents would do and buy everything for their kids and like this the child wants the parents to buy everything they see in the television.
Even if they will play just one time with this toy because after they already want another one.
In conclusion, I can say that I am against television advertising directed towards young children.For me, the best argument against these kind of adverts is that the children can be manipulated this easily.
Grown up know this for sure and that's why they do this kind of advertising.
And because of that it shouldn't be allowed.
One reason for not allowing advertising directed to small children is that children shouldn't be influenced by advertising already in such a young age.
When they grow up, they will understand what advertising is about.
But a two-years old can't even understand the meaning of a televison advertising and they don't realize that in advertising are made promisses that aren't true.
At that age they can't decide what they need or what they don't need.
One more reason against allowing advertising for young children is that a child doesn't understand how much a toy from an advertising costs, but although they will want to have it.
So the parents are under a big pressure and they almost have to buy the toys from the advertising.
That means that advertising for young children doesn't only disturb children but also their parents.
One reason for allowing advertising for small children is that the adults also have advertising for them, so why shouldn't children?
The adults and the children should be treatened the same way.
The next reason for allowing advertising for young children is that if there was no advertising for the children, they would have to watch the advertising for adults.
But children maybe don't understand what the advertising is about and they could be shocked by the content.
So it is better to let the children watch advertising directed to children than to let them watch advertising for adults.
My opinion on this topic is that advertising directed to children shouldn't be allowed, because I think children shouldn't get influenced by advertising.
The industry shouldn't say the children which toys are cool or popular, the children should have the right to don't be influenced by the main stream.
In order to be able to answer this question we have to differentiate two different kinds of advertising for young children.There are ads that are advertising products for young children but the target group are the parents.For example pampers are for young children but the targent group of papers are the parents and not the children.And on the other hand there are ads whose targent group are the children for example hot wheels cars.
A aspect that says that ads for children are totally ok is that even if there is an ad whose target group is the young children its still the parents buying the product in the end because children from two to five years old normally don`t have money.
An aspect that says ads for childeren shouldn`t be allowed is that the ads give pressure to the parents because their child is talking about this cool new hotwheels car the whole day until the parents buy it.So this leads to parents being under pressure to buy certain products for their children in order to satify the needs of their child.
Another aspect that says ads are ok is that children are confronted with ads all the time on the way to school on the way to the soccer training in the internet and so on.
So in the end it won`t make any difference because children are confronted with ads anyways.
One point that says ads for children aren`t ok is that ads have a huge influence on peolpe especially in the early stages of life.
That means that if the ad is about sextoys for children in kindergarden this is for sure not a good influence for the children.
In my opinion ads for childfren are totally ok because children are confronted with ads anyway in everyday life so they are used to it and because of that its not a problem at all.
We all know the way commercial TV makes revenue.
- The name already says it, namely through commercials, shown during commercial breaks that might even last severaly minutes.
The advertisement is often optimized for the target audience of the TV station.
If the viewership are adults, we get ads for adult products, like cars for example.
There are also programmes that are specifically made for the young audience, e.g.
Cartoon Network.
Their viewers are often little children and thus only advertisement optimized for this target group would make sense.
One may ask however if this is good or not, or if it even should be forbidden.
It's obvious that the broadcasting corporation must make money in one way or another.
If they don't generate revenue, they won't survive for long.
The only way that a TV station can really make money is by commercials or product placement.
If one would forbid them to do so, they will have to shut down in the forseeable future.
A downside of ads targeted at such young people is that the children might still easily influenced.
After seeing an ad for the newest toy they are likely to want said toy from their parents.
Not only can this result in high costs for the parents, but also in tears from the children when they don't get what they want.
Creating a desire in somebody through TV isn't only restricted to children.
The same happes with adults all the time.
If you would forbid commercial indoctrination by TV for children, shouldn't you do the same for adults?
What difference does it make in the end of the day.
The way many commercals work is that they try to convince people why their product is extraordinary.
Often they want to make us believe that without their product one can't be happy anymore and that without it your life will be less good.
This is very likely to give the young vieweship a wrong image about the world.
For example one can only have a nice skiing holiday when going to a resort with the latest and greatest activities for children.
Kids often don't understand the concept of money and won't understand when the parents tell them that something like that is really expensive and not really doable.
They'll get sad if their wishes won't be fullfilled.
In some way you can't just blame the television networks for all this.
It's also the parents who should take responsebility and avoid that their children are being exposed to ads that the parents don't want them to see.
To some extend the ones being in charge of them should make sure that what is being seen by them isn't harmful in any way or another.
I personally think that both the parents and the television networks should take responsebility for what is being broadcastet during commercial breaks.
In my opinion most commercials (that clearly appear as a commercial) are fine.
The only thing I can see being problematic are product placements.
The kids won't notice that it's a paid ad and thus might be influenced more easily.
If I had a say in what is transmitted, I would make sure that the products advertised are both childfriendly and reasonable.
I wouldn't want products to be shown that would come at a high cost for the parents or ones that aren't suitable for childreno of any age.
To start, I think that children aged two shouldn't even be allowed to watch television so much that they could be influenced by the advertisment.
But in general I think it's the parents task to be aware of the danger which comes from ads in television.
So they should decide whether their child is allowed to watch television.
I think it is impossible to ban ads from TV because the chanels earn so much money from them.
Of course there is the danger that young children can be easely influenced from TV advertisement and could have a wrong opinion of something.
But in the world there are many other things that could have a bad influence on a child.
So now, my opinion ist that the parents have to deal the same with TV advertisements than with other threats for their child.
They must prevent their child from being influenced.
They can tell their child what's wrong or just invented in the advertisements or they can watch less TV (rather unpopular).
An other argument for not baning TV ads is that there are a number of kids-chanels where there are less or none advertisement.
On the other hand one can say that every kid is different so every kid may be influenced more easely or less easely.
Maybe there should be a minimum age for watching TV at all.
In general I think it's important that the parents look carefully what their children are watching and that they teach them how to handel the advertisement.
In the following essay I am going to comment on the statement that "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
To begin with you have to understand that advertising is always a way of manipulating someone to buy, watch or do something.
This is very dangerous especially for young children, because it is changing their opinion and therefore their behaviour towards special things.
It is also dangerous because they have not learnt at that age to reflect advertising and basically everything you are seeing in a critical way.
At the same time you have to admit that some adults who are not highly educated also have not learnt to reflect on everything they see.
Therefore advertising for these adults should also be prohibited.
But as soon as you start reflecting you are going to recognise that nearly every product is not as good as it was shown in the advertising.
Terefore advertising would not work anymore.
If parents allow their children to sit in front of the TV, these children are not only influenced by the advertising but also by the Television program.
For example my family has not had a TV until I was fifteen and a half years old.
I grew up without watching TV and I do not think that this did any harm to me.
Everything that is shown on TV is having an impact on the children watching.
So they are not only manipulated by advertising but also by the normal TV shows or series they are watching.
In my opinion it the danger of advertising directed to young children depends on the fact if they are watching TV alone or if they are watching together with their parents.
If their parents are at their side I do not personally think that advertising should be prohibited.
Their parents could explain everything to them and could make them understand the advertising.
To my mind it is much more dangerous if these children watch TV on their own.
Personally I think that this should not be allowed.
Children between two to five should not watch TV a lot and they should definitely not sit alone in front of the TV.
Finally you can say that Television advertising is obviously negative and should not be allowed but at the same time it is much more important that young children should not be allowed to watch TV alone.
Should it be allowed that television advertisings are exactly made for young children?
I think there are many facts for and against it.
For example you could say that it should be permittet because the children are too young (two - five years old) to decide if the products in the advertisings are necessary for them or just nice but not important.
They also don not know which of these products are good for them.
If they like them, the kids want to have them and they do not care if they are maybe bad for their helph, like computer games which make the kids sit a long time in the front of their computer instead of going outside or like candies which make them eating too much sugar.
The television advertisings also uses that little children can be exited about things very fast.
So when they watch six advertisings every day, they will maybe like the half of them and want to have all those products.
Adults sometimes think longer about what they could buy but children just want to have things when they like them, so I think they schould not watch advertisings which are directed toward kids.
But there are also arguments for these advertisings.
I think children just should not watch TV so often, so they wont see so many advertisings.
And the parents have still the right to permitt buying the products becauce they decide what they buy and what not.
Television advertising has got a lot of influence on our society.
It gives us needs or wishes we should have.
And since more than three quarter of the population owns a television, we cannot deny the big range of influence one single advertising can have on us.
Especially young children can be easily manipulated, that's why in my opinion, telvision advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
To start with, television advertising gives the children very straight ideals about how they have to be.
Advertising dictates gender roles.
It shows exactly what a girl needs and what she doesn't (and of course the other way around for boys).
And children under the age of five are more manipulative than anything!
At the age, they are looking for idols, people to follow.
And they should find those idols in real live, not in faked television scenes.
Secondly, to make advertising for young children is a very "mean" thing to do.
Since it's not the children themselves who will spend the money on the product, but their parents (or some other adult).
Advertising makes children wish for things they did'nt even know they existed.
It creates needs that aren't there.
It's just a trick to sell things more easily, beacause children can quite annoying and persistent if tehy want something.
And in the end parents give in.
To finish, I'd say that television has a bigger influence on our lives, gender roles and needs than it should have.
And by not allowing television advertising directed toward young children, we could minimalize this influence quite a little bit.
But in the end it is still about us, or more, the parents of the children to regulate what they want them to see or don't, since they are the one who give them the permission to even watch television.
I mostly agree with the statement.
Watching TV in young age probably gets to a habit for the later life.
Watching a lot of television is not helpful for the education of young people in general, because the media has a too big influence on the people, especially for very young people in age of two to five.
By watching TV very often, the media presented by television is a very influencing form of giving information, which is not always firstly intended to educate young people - more there are a lot of commercials which manipulate the children and use their naivity for capital.
A young human being in age of two to five should learn to understand their environment by their own and not by consuming what is told and shown on the television.
Everything one consumes, consumes oneself.
Even though, watching television in young age can be a risk for the people, espeiaclly the young, we all have to learn how to use a TV, because it clearly is an important aspect in our society.
By not allowing young people to watch television, they will never know how to watch it with conscience.
They might begin to watch TV, when the parents can not forbit it anymore and the use of mass media with conscience can not be served.
In my opinion, young children in age of two to five should be allowed to watch TV, but for 15 to 20 minutes maximum, because so they know it is a part of the society, but also something parallel of the reality - so it does not give the young the picture of the reality and they can discover their environment and the world on their own with playing outside, making friends, going to kindergarten etc.
So, I agree with the idea of television and also other forms of media, like smartphones, tablets, youtube etc.
is not ideal for the growing of young people in age of two to five, but not forbiting it, because it is so influencial anyway
In the following text I want to discuss if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
In general I think it is a very normal thing that firm and concernes make adverts to inform people about new products.
They need it to have a successfull firma.
But the negative aspect of these adverts is the fact that they often do not tell the truth about a firma or his products, they just should convince the people to buy this product or to support this concernes.
I think older people like adults or children from 15 years and up can reflect the liing and the truth on these adverts so that they do not buy things without thinking on their own if the price is fitting and the products are as good and usefull as they are presented in the adverts.
Against this young children from two to five years can not think about these positive and negative aspects so that it is a very easy thing to have some influence on them.
Especially the television is a medium wich young children like very much, they spent a lot of time in front of it and think that everything on this screen must be the truth an a very good thing.
Furthermore the first few years in the life of a human are the ones in which they learn the most things and in which it decides who they are going to be and what they like and what not.
That is the reason why firms
The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" is a very controversy but actual theme.
I definitely think it should not be allowed to show little children advertisements.
Firstly because they see it often enough in public or here it on the radio.
Secondly because advertisement on television is so much more deep and figurative because of the possibility of filming, picture mmaterial, special affects connected with sound, lightning, colouring and camera movings.
These huge ammount of information and pictures in such a short time is too much for little children's brains and could lead to headache or other physical and even psychical problems.
Another thing is how you could seperate advertisement for grown ups and for children.
Nobody knows which television programms children watch and nobody knows during wich time of the day.
So it would be dramatic if a little child sees advertising for or against war, beer or cigarrets.
Like I said earlier children going to see these things soon enough so they should not be confronted with this in an even more accurate way on television as well.
Advertising often leads to depressions or self-harming, anxiety or eating disorders for many boys and girls (aged ten to more or less open end)according to several studies.
People start to compare themself or their life with others.
Actually they compare with advertisement whichdefinitely does not show real life and is always faked in many points.
But advertising seems to be real especially on television so people dont see how unusual and unnatural it is.
This is a never ending circle because people will always find new things to compare with, new trends are going to show up, advertising will change and companies produce new ones fitting to the newest trends.
Bacuse of that it is important to safe children from these wrong pictures and impressions about how life is which they get from advertising.
It is more important to show and teach them the real things that matter in life or even little aspects for example what a strawberry is and how it real and natural taste is.
The children of today are getting so fast old and behave or have to behave like teenagers or grown ups that it is very important to let them be little children as long as they can.
Television advertising is not a new phenomen in our modern technical world.
No matter where we are and go, there will be an advertise following us.
It might be in a town on a big promotion board, in the window of shops or it simply appears on our smartphones.
But what happens with the new generation that already grows up with such things?
Young children from two to five are highly affectable.
They copy the behavior of people around them all the time.
If it is the way we talk, how we treat people or simply our gestures, they will adapt to it.
This means that advertising directed toward young children might end really bad, depending on what advertise it is.
Imagine young girls, not even six yet, already get told what they should wear and how they should look to count as "pretty".
It sets up a picture of how life should be, rather then letting children try it out themselves by going out and discover new things in nature or with friends.
On the other hand, advertising towards children might not be too bad.
You could use it to show them how important a good school degree is or that sport is good for your health.
However advertising affects without us actually realizing it.
Can we let that happen to our children?
Can we just let them slowly be "brainwashed" by our economy?
No, we can't!
In my opinion, advertising is far too present in our modern lifestyles.
It affects us so strongly and not a lot seem to know or care about it.
I'm against advertising in general, but especially our children should be protected against television advertising!
In my opinion the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" is right.
There are many different arguements supporting but also some against my opinion.
One could say, it is nice for the children to have adverts made for them.
But considering that advertising is very influencial it does not seem to be a positive aspect for it is known, that young children can be influenced very easily for they do not have developed an own opinion yet.
On the one hand young children would get bored if there was not advertising fitting their age.
On the other hand parents will think, they can leave their child in front of the tv even better, because it will be busy watching tv and would not annoy during the advertising break either.
But still it seems wrong to me to make parents let their child watch televison without feeling bad about it.
Because children that young should not weatch tv.
Which other people think as well.
That is why there are only few children watching tv.
And because of that it is not nessicary to make special adverts directed to them.
Furthermore it does not really make sense because children can not buy anything on their own and advertising directed toward children will not make their parents want to buy the product.
To make my point clear: I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
First because mostly older people watch tv so there is no need to make adverts for young children and second because it would only make parents think it is okay to let their baby watch tv, when there is even advertising for them.
Advertising in general influences every human beeing in a different way.
So should advertising toward young children be allowed?
First of all there are many disadvantages.
In my opinion children are very manipulative and easy to impress.
Per example if children see toys in the television they run to their parents in order to get the toy.
Another reason why it should be forbidden is because they have so many offers from the beginning of their childhoods, which makes it difficult to learn how to deal with money.
In addition young people have to build their own opinion and should not be influenced by huge enterprises.
But on the other hand I disagree with the statement.
In our world full of globalization it is nearly impossible to prevent even young kids from advertising.
Per example if you walk through a city you will find in every corner an advertisment.
Moreover it is important to teach everyone how to deal with such a great amount of offers and sometimes also lies behind the advertisment.
But I have to say there are not just bad aspects about advertising.
They can be inspiring and bring up benefits for the little ones.
Some toys teach children more about language or maths per example even though they are funny to use.
In conclusion I do not agree with the statement because in our society every human beeing gets confronted with advertising anyways.
In general I agree with the following statement.
The fact, that children are way too easy to manipulate makes television advertising dangerous.
Todays kids can't build their own opinion about a product or service.
For many parents this can become a serious problem.
Their child has seen an advertising and they have to teach them, that they can't have anything they want and that they need to learn what things are really important in life.
Otherwise they have to spend a lot of money for every kind of toys.
Kids are quite easy to fascinate and a commercial television advertising can let their eyes glow.
I think advertising should only be directed towards people who can afford these articles on their own.
Little children are the wrong group.
In another way parents of todays century should know the danger of the internet and television.
Sitting in front of a tv-screen shouldn't be the most regarded acitivity of the day.
It's important that kids spend their time outside playing and creating their own little thoughts.
It's easy to say, that television advertising on channels like "Kika" or "SuperRTL" should be forbidden, but every single mother or father can deicide on their own how their child should see life and how they grow up.
Television advertising is a good money source and of course everyone wants to keep this luctrative business going.
Children have always been used to raise money, they are easily impressed, they believe nearly everything and and they can't differntiate that good.
But it isn't the fault of all the marketing agents, it's only in the hands of the parents.
I want to say that I have never felt bad about advertising.
It always fascinated me and it was enough to
Directed television advertising.
We all know it and it is often making the target group think, that the advertised object is the best and they shuld buy it.
But should children aged two to five really getting influenced by that?
Television advertising, which is pointing at young children is trying to inflict an young childrens mind to the point, at which they believe without questioning what they see.
Trying to inflict a children which may not be able to difference between advertisements and the truth, is questionable.
But who should decide wheater this is an advertisement, directed to children at the age from two to five, or to children aged between six and eight?
A law to illegallice television advertisements to children aged from two to five could lead to missunderstandings of advertisings and conflicts between the law and advetisers.
But isn't the real question wheater children aged from two to five should watch television anyway?
Anyways.
I think that directed television advertising at young children should be highly restricted, regardless of the fact that it is in the freedom of a television advertiser to make advertisements directed to children.
Television advertising directed toward young children is for some parents a problem.
The kids become angry and sad if they don't get what they want.
This get on the nerves of the most parents.
It's a shame that even the young children in our world are used to get the big money, they say.
Mostly exact these parents aren't just a little bit better then these people who made the advertisments.
Why do they let the kids watch television alone?
If it really is a big problem for them  they should be sitting next to their kid and watch with them.
Some other people say it has some advantages.
The children learn that they can't have everything they see.
Something that is important in their future life.
The people that never learned this are often the people who couldn't handle even with their own money.
If they see something in the advertisment or any where else that they like - for them, it has to be bought.
That means that there are two sides.
On the one side the children could have a problem with the parents because it thinks that they never get what they want.
When the parents never speak to them and tell them what the problem is it coud end in a bad relationship between them.
But on the other side they learn something that is really important in our life today.
They don't always get everything.
In my opinion this problem isn't that bad.
The most of the parents think their child just learns bad things if they're alone.
They aren't able to learn the right things.
Sometimes that's right but even then it's not that grave.
The parents forget that children can forget some things really fast.
On the next day they've already forgotten the problems of yesterday.
But the adults who are responsible for these children should learn from this.
If they can't handle to not always give what they see and want they shouldn't let the kid watch television all the time.
Television advertising directed toward young children is commonly used in todays culture.
Some people are against it and some say it is very important.
At the beginning, I have to say, that in most of the advertisements for kids, there are plots with morals in it.
For example to share your cereals with others or to work together.
Moreover, they teach them how to differenciate a real product from the product in the television.
Surely, disapointment will be involved and it's exhausting for the parents to calm their children, but it can really help to give them a prospective for the real life.
Not to forget is the fact, that the producers of the TV-advertising and of the products themselves earn a lot of money, because children believe everything they see.
On the other hand, this can also be seen as a bad thing.
Children are being manipulated and don't know, what a product can be like in reality.
Also they are often being taught, that if you buy and own a specific product, like a shoe for example, then you will be cool and can get along with everthing and everyone.
Furthermore, the parents can have a really hard time convincing the young children not to buy something, when they have seen it on television and think it would be cool to have it.
Every minute there's another advertisement with a toy or a product they want to have and that can undoubtedly be very stressing for a mother or a father.
Although there are more arguments speaking for television advertisements for young children, the fact, that they manipulate those little kids just to make big money, overweighs in my opinion.
So in conclusion, this should get forbidden.
Advertisement twoards children of a young age can be considered a good marketing strategy.
Children tend to be more naive and can thus be easily convinced by almost any type of media that is presented to them.
If the marketing sektor can make use of these "easy cusomers", they are garanteed a higher sales revenue.
Although children seldomly have their wn money to spend, they can quite easily persuade parents and relatives into buying specific things for them.
This strategy is more affective than advertising products for the children to the older generations because there will always be a doubt about the product itself and if the children would really be happy with the specific new item.
On the other hand i can be considered practically inhumane to use a childs mind to sell a poduct to their parents.
Since the todlers don't have the necessary knowledge to judge things fairly, they are eaily tricked into wanting things that migt not be in their interest or are simply useless.
At hte same time stress can be created in the houshold because of capricious behavior from the children that are led to believe they need a specific new thing.
The resultscan be tantrums and very unconfortable situations for all people involved.
It is an unfair marketing strategy and takes advantage of the childish mind.
I believe that rules should be made against advertisement targeted at children under a specific age.
Children in the age of two to five are nowadays often exposed to advertisment from different sources, one of them being the Television.
The following short Essay will state some pros and cons about this topic.
Even if the statement disapproves advertisment towards young children I will start with the pro side.
In this century one is constistandly surounded by adds, thus it's important to get used to it as soon as possible.
If young children learn that they shouldn't listen to the exaggoration which adds often include, they will be more resistant towards adds and the influence of media as a whole when they grow up.
They learn that nothing is as it seems in television and begin to criticaly think over the whole situation and in the end decide if they e.g.
want to buy the new bike which is displayed in the new add or rather stick with an older more trustworthy exemplar.
The negativ side is, that if the young children don't learn that adds aren't always saying 100% the truth, they are exposed to all those hidden traps and influences.
If they see their favourite cartoon character smoking in an add, they want to try it as well.
And if an add shows them which role a boy should take in life and which roles girl should take through the toys, those children will be pushed towards a stereotypical lifestyle without ever being able to lean themselves what they want to be and want they want to do in the end.
When I was a child I often watched TV.
There was often advertising for children of my age, and I loved to watch the advertising.
For me it was very intresting to see the new toys and games.
But is it good for the developement of a child to see alll the time new toys and things ?
The advertising is extra made for children so the actors use expressions whichchildren use in this age so that they everything understand.
The pctures are made for the kids eyes and after every every episode there is at least one advertising video.
First I think it is cool for the kids to see new toys and games in the television.
But when I was a young child I always wanted new toys and I never stopped asking my parent to get them.
In my opinion it can be very embarassing for the parents if the child never stops asking for a new toy.
So at least the parents buy them the toy and  the child is happy.
But some days later the child sees something new in the television and asks his parents one more time to buy this thing.
The parents don't want to tell the children off for asking for that and as a result they buy the new thing.
So it is a never ending thing.
Advertising is for the seller a very good possibilty to show the kids the new toys, beacause the kids have to watch the advertising more or less.
Without advertising it is very difficult to present the new games and toys.
In my opinion it is normal that there is some advertising for adults and for children.
Maybe it woud be possible to show less advertising because sometimes it is getting on my nervs when there are 30 minutes of a TV show and then 10 minutes of advertising.
But without advertising, watching TV would not be the same.
Adverts are something everyone knows.
Most of the time it is annoying and unpleasant.
Television advertising is common.
Mostly the film stops at the best moment just to show the faked picture of a woman with wonderful long eyelashes or other nonsense.
Is ist necessary to bother our little kids with this?
It is a fact that advertising is a good way to sell products; on television there are so many people who watch all these adverts so it is likely somebody is affected by them and buys the product.
It may be annoying sometimes but because of this adverts we are able to watch many things for free.
The advertisers are the sponsors and with their money the tv programm is financed.
The same goes for the programs for children.
Children the young age of two to five often do not even understand the adverts and most of the parents do not buy random stuff for their kids just because it showed up on television one time.
But it is a fact that people are affected by adverts even if they do not realize it.
Children are even easier affected.
They react to colours and shiny things very easily.
So it is possible that the children take some of the stuff they see in adverts and remeber it like that.
This can be dangerous depending on what the advert is about.
Also it might be a problem that children want to have everything that is advertised.
So they bother their parents to buy them stuff they do not even need.
And they do not understand what ist is exactly so they just stick with it.
In my opinion we should carefully teach our childrens and let them explore new things on television and sometimes just let them have fun.
We should not bother them with adverts and only show them unecessary stuff just to get money.
It is important that we let our children grow up without too much influence from the outside, they should explore life for themselves.
Advertising:
It is actual topic if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
Nowerdays the television is a more and more important thing to younger people andso also theadvertising.
There are a lot of advertisings directed to young children because if a product ist interessting for young people the chance is very high that they would buy it.
If you fix the youth he will grew up as a consuming society.
This are the best sights for a good working economy.Children at the age of two to five do not know that you have to work for the money and so they say without thinking, that they want you to buy the produt because they liked the advertising.
On the other hand you have to see that children at the age of two to five should not sit in front of the television.
The should play outside with friends or if the weather is bad they should draw or something like that.
Because if they just watch television and see the advertising they may will never see the reality.
They start to want things because they see them in the advertising.
They may loose the connection to the now and the reality.
And at this age you are not able to decide what you realy want or need.
In conclusion I have to say that I think it is up to the parents.
They should look for their children and should find a balance.
It is their responsibility.
And you also have to see that he company of the advertised product just does his work.
So if you as a parent think that advertising, directed to younger children at the age two to five, should not be allowed, you have to change your own habit.
You have to save your children from the advertising because it ist not up to the others.
It is your child and you have to be responsible for it.
Between todays tv shows lots of all kind of advertising spots play.
And this also on channels that are for toddlers and children, that are especially made for this age group.
Should that be allowed or not?
Firtsly, what would a channel do if he hadn't any commercials to play?
Less people would buy stuff and less money would be earned.
He couldn't pay all the tv shows that are on and we would soon not have  a lot of tv entertainment for our children left.
In addition to that the advertisments lead to a littke break after a tv show where the kids can play, get themselves some food or, maybe in more rare cases, decide to stop watching tv.
They would sit the whole day in front of the screen because Mickey Mouse plays non stop and why would you even want to do something different then?
Commercials "annoy" them and maybe get them to turn off the tv.
On the other hand are also some disadvantages that come with tv spots.
For example the kids get confronted with so many advertisements that want them to buy their stuff, that our generation will slip into a state of a non stop consume.
They will always want more and more.
This new barbie, that new play station.
That can't be healthy in the long term.
They also take the childhood from them.
Lots of todays kids don't play with they teddy bears anymore or go out to build a sandcastle.
Instead a lot of new media comes to the market which includes for example all kinds of gaming systems.
Kids will be more and more consumed by these machines and that doesn't bring a lot of benefits for them.
They would rather play outside at the fresh air instead of staring on their Ipads the whole day through.
In conclusion there's probably not much to do about these commercials.
They need to be played, otherwise the channels will be broke soon.
But it's also not that helpful for our children to grow up, especially when they advertise lots of digital things to play with.
In my opinion the ones that advertise such things should be banned from the kid's television.
They can play commercials for puppets or the newest monster truck racing lane, but not advertisements that destroy a beautiful childhood.
Since television was invented, people are attrracted by it and pay attention to it.
Brands and advertising companies use that, to sell their things.
Through television, people are confronted with adverts all the time.
Especially young children, from age two to five, are drawn into the consumer world very fast.
So should television advertising directed to young children be allowed?
Brands use young children to sell their products.
Children from age two to five are a good target,as their are innocent and it's easy to sell them something.
As long as the advertisement is held in bright colours with some pop music, the children will pay attention to it.
Children will see a new toy in television once, and they will think about it all the time.
In the first place, the advert reaches the child in front of the television, but indirectly it is also sold to the parents, grand-parents, aunts etc.
who are willing buy it.
In the best case, someone will buy the desired toy and the advertisement fulfilled its purpose.
However, children get drawn in to the consumer world very quickly.
Even if it works for brands and advertising companies, it's morally not correct to use naive children just to earn money.
Children get materialistic way too early.
In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, even if it is efficient for brands.
Children shouldn't be confronted with materialistic thing and consumation in that young age - they should have other values.
Advertisment.
Television.
Our society lives in a world of never ending stimulation.
Caught in an addiction to distraction from their miserable every day life.
Craving for forgetting the perpetual absence of the meaning of life.
And in such days we dare to ask whether television advertising targeting children should not be allowed?
Ironic and hypocritical how those people taking umbrage at those ads are the ones spending most of their time sitting in front of the TV, trying to escape the clutches of meritocracy.
The spark of joy in their eyes when not they themselves are being excoriated but rather the opposite.
Great can happen once you accept the nothingness of your existance and turn your back to bigger things than the struggle of finding the meaning
The question, if television advertising directed toward young childer should not be allowed, is a often discussed thing.
Advertising for young kids becomes more and more popular, because the quantity of kids watching TV was never so big.
My first point is that kids are more interested in other things than gaming and cellphones, when they watch advertising for kids.
They want to buy smartphones instead of toys, if they watch advertising for adults.
I think kids are there to explore the world and test everyhing out by themselves.
Advertising for kids can also be a good thing, if they sell books or intelligence games.
On the other hand, kids were also seen as money and profit.
The advertising lobby may take advantage of the kids and earn more money.
When kids want something they have seen on TV, they ask their parents for money and, as we all know, kids are not silent until they have what they want.
This could be problem, if some kids get everything they want from their parents out of the TV advertising and then loose their feeling for money.
This could cause a buying addiction in young years already.
In conclusion I think that the advantages overweight the disadvantages and that we can not give up advertising for young kids.
Television advertising is a big part of a programm of a channel and the companies earn millions of dollars by showing advertisement to their customers.
But do not forget, young children can watch that easily, too.
So should it be allowed for children aged two to five, to show advertisement to them.
Firstly, such young people do not understand the whole system behind their television and how companies earn money by advertising their products.
The children watch the movie or small video clip and think that is a fantastic thing and they do not realize, that this advertisement has nothing to do with reality.
Companies advertise directly to children to sell their products in a big amount.
The parents have then the problem, that their children wanted to have these things.
Therefor the parents have to explain them, that they do not get these things and maybe as you know this is a hard piece to do.
Secondly, advertisement is not good for the brains of young children.The young people have a false imagination of the world.
Furthermore, they have in their mind that all these products are amusing and a lot of fun, but they are not.
Only because the enterprises advertise their games or other devices so good and with a big strategy behind it, does not mean that they are useful and funny to play with.
On the other hand, every mother or father has to decide for himself, if they want to let their children watch TV.
The girls and boys should better play outside with other friends or play a game with their siblings and do not spend the whole time in front of the screen.
Social activities are one of the most important things in a life of a child and the best to grow up with.
Another point is that such a new rule is a lot of work.
So people have to spend hours to control the companies and for that money is needed.
So is it useful to produce such a high amount of work only that children, who spend their free time on the sofa are not attracted by television advertising.
All things considered, parents should take the part and decide for themselves, if they want to let their children watch advertisement.
So everybody can decide for himself.
So I think that it is useless to introduce such a new order.
It is hard to control and a lot of work.
Of cause advertisement is not good for the children but for them it is overall better to spend the time outside and have a lot of fun with their friends.
Today, most of people have a television at home and so theire children too.
Some of them waist a lot of time befor the television and ohters are using it very selten.
TV sends news, with that we can learn things and know what happens in the world, but it also produce a lot of stupid things.
But is TV somthing that is not good for children?
SHould we television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) not allowe?
At first, television shows us what is happening in the world and it sends also documantations, from witch we can profit.
For adults is this a nice thing because they can coming home late in the evening, beeing powerless and then they can sit down and watching TV and see the newest informations.
But for children at age two to five  is this not very important because they have probably no idea what this is about.
Although it also could make children interessted at politics.
Otherwise it also has programms in the TV witch is for childrens.
Par example "Dora" or "5 Friends".
These programms help children to learn deducating in a small grade, they help them to learn words and they make fun for the children.
But when children are sitting the howl day in front of the TV, they can't learn how to practice things, they are playing less with friends and don't going to know the "real" world.
So in the end, I think TV should not absolutly be not allowed, because they can learn from the TV.
But it should be eingeschrenkt of 1 hour the day, to
From my point of view thia atatement is absolutly true and I don't see a way where it's not true.
I'm positive that EVERY SINGLE ON OF US has seen an advertisement on tv they absolutely loved and we all tried to convince our parents to buy it.
Let's be honest people, the stuff in advertisment just looks so good, and if your a child you still believe everyone is good and that santa still exists and nobody is ever lying.
To be blunt, no 17 boy plays with children toys, they're probably at home playing their video games.
But if a young bay sees someone who's older and in theri eyes cooler and they do awesome tricks like jumping over fences and stuff they want to do that to.
And every child wants to have the coolest toys and show it to their friends.
A friendly advice, don't buy toys over the internet, it's almost all the time a fraud and your children will stop playing with it after a week anyways.
Television advertising directed toward young childeren (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
In our society television playes a remarkable role in many peoples lifes.
By many people it is used for relaxation purposes, to inform you about recent events around the globe or just out of boredom.
Therefore advertisers have found it a very good place for their ads, because many people of different countries, culutural background, intellectual standard and age can be reached with your ads.
If you confront yourself extensively with advertising, you will seek to answer the question, which age group you are most likely to reach and for which ones it doesn't make sense.
The advertisers should definitly be allowed to target young childeren, especially because the ads mostly consist of toys, most of which are harmless.
Maybe it gives them an inkling of what to wish for for their birthday or christmas.
The childeren ask their parents and they can decide to buy said toy or article, if found usefull or apropriate.
I question the use of television advertising for young childeren because I doubt they are effective.
Young childeren may be fast mulled over and excited by the item displayed and praised in the ad, however the are not capable of purchasing it themselfes.
Ads for  toys should be aimed at the parents who can then show their child what they find fit and present  it to them.
Childeren aged two to five are naiv and have no experience, they will choose the toy or item they are most partial without thinking about the price or usefullness, hence it's the parents or guardians task to give them what they need.
On the whole, young childeren should not be watching a lot of television at such a young age.
Their creativeness can be very limited and by playing (in or outdoors) they can develop a lot better.
Advertising is one of the biggest industries today,we use it on a daily basis and are confronted with it in almost every moment.But should our youngest children be under effect of these ads?First we need to take a look on the general effect advertising has and why it exist.Advertising is the process in which a product is presented to a specific audience so they get to know of the existence of said product and are induced to buy it.As you might assume, Adverts are almost never neutral and always bias.So they seem to be something we don't want.But keeping in mind that most companies direct their adverts at a speciefic audience we can say that most ads we see are directed at us in some way, thus the chance of the product being something we are actually interested in is incrisingly high.It helps us find the stuff we need&want and maybe even on deciding quickly what exact product has which qualities and often which price.But we need to keep in mind that we (You,me and most probably any other person who reads this) are individuals who are already embetted in the economical system with a way of income and a general idea of necessities and luxus.
The children(aged two to five) are not familiar with such an ideology and thus cant be the one where these ads are directed to...or can they?
As already mentioned advertising to these children does not make any sense for the companies who pay money to these adverts so they appear in televison since they can not get money from them, so why do they do it?-They can not buy stuff themselves but they have parents who are more than willingly to make their "kids" happy if they want the new action-figure they have just seen on TV.The question being now on wether this is good or bad could be answerered by saying that, while not being particularly friendly or unshady, the parents still have their own choice to buy the advertised product or not.But not everything is about money so we still need to take a look at the effect it has on the Child.
Adverts are usualy very flashy,catchy and designed to forfill a raised exspectation on the product and are suposed to speak to region of our brain that is responsiblr for excitment without us even noticing it.
But most Adults or those becoming one have an idea of rational thinking to ask about and criticise the thing they show on the TV and eventhough the parents are still deciding for the kid, the children are left with a thought of this flahsy product and that anything they see has to forfill this excitment they had on television becouse they never came in contact with the product on another level than that.
There are TV channels which are in particular for children and surely they also have advertising.
In the following I will discuss, if television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
First of all one can say that there are already some channels which have no advertising anymore, for example the KIKA channel in Germany.
Now I will come to my first pro argument which is that the firms want to make money though.
They have to show their toys or stuff like that to the children, otherwise maybe nobody will buy it, beacuse parents do not watch children TV shows.
Secondly advertising causes no real harm, the children wont get a psychological disease, if they see advertising once in a while.
In opposition to that I want to mention some arguments against the advertising.
Firstly advertising is boring, especially for children, which is not alawys bad, because maybe consequently they switch the TV off and go playing outside.
Furthermore advertising influences the children in a certain direction, much more than adults or adolescents.
The reason for that is that children have no idea that advertising is made up by firms with actors, so that it is a "lie".
They only see happy children playing with a new toy and out of this reason they want to have it, too.
Most times theses things are unnessesary and quite expensive, so the parents do not want to buy it.
This will make both parties sad, the children as well as the parents.
If it is the case that the child gets what it wants, it wont have fun with it forever,the child will see a new advertising and desires a new item.
This could becomne a kind of circle.
To conclude I would say that even though advertisings for young children cause no real harm, it should be not allowed, because it bores the children and it causes an unhappy family situation.
Beyond this I would admit that in my opinion watching TV is not good for children at all, however playing with friends oder outside is a better alternative.
Sometimes an ad might be appropriate, but there cannot be so much of it or even hidden advertising in shows, which children are not able to discover.
The statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" is a difficult one.
Big companys are saying that the young childs often have not their own money for free use, it is usally in the hands of the parents, so they can not buy anything showing in advertisment.
But why big toy companys are producing advertisment for millions of dollars directed towards young childs , if there is not any benefit for them.
Children, espcially younger children, often have their parents in their hands, they can whishing anything and they are getting it.
So the young kids are not having the money and buying the products directly, but they often get this trough their parents.
One can say that every other age class gets advertisment, why young children, aged two to five, should not getting advertisment.
It is a simple answer: These young kids are in the middle of the development  of their own personality, favours and character, so it should not be allowed to manipulate them with the advertisment.
I am agreeing with the the statement mainly as a result of the last point, because it is not okay to interfere with the development of the young childs.
They needing these development to become a teenager with no greater problems resulting of manipulation by the advertisment of the big toy companys.
Many people are watching Television with their family or just to relax.
But there are not only the Series or the film you want to watch but advertisement, too.
It plays a major role if you have advertisement for your product or not.
So it is obvious that many underaged children are watching this ads, too.
But i think that it is not good to confront the children, this young, with the media and their powerful, like mind controlling, advertisement.
Many children are influenced by the media for the rest of their lifes.
Also the big enterprises, who are giving money to the media, who are showing the advertisements, are selling, most of the time, unhealthy or dangerous products like fast food or handys by which the children are most likely to get addicted from.
So I think all in all that parents need to watch their children and must not show their children the advertisements, who is influencing the young childrens with a bad image of their products.
Also good products  are mostly not run by big companies so you do not see often advertisement of products who are influencing the children in a good way.
So in the end parents need to watch their children when they are watching Television.
So directed advertisement should not be allowed for young children but parents can prevent its ny controlling what the children are watching.

By Erwin Smith
The sentence mentioned before inherits that televison advertising ditrected towards children aged two to five should not be allowed.
In the following i am going to discuss whether i agree or disagree with the previous statement.
First of all it is to be said that children at the mentioned age are not able to purchase something on their own meaning that they on their own do not state a purchasing-force.
This point makes it seemingly obvious that it is no good idea reffering to the specific companies sake to waste so much money in order to influence persons which are not even able to buy something on their own but do not give in such an easy way and think about it a bit more.
If you do that you are going to get to the conclusion that, yes they cannot purchase something on their own but obviously they are able to influence their parents or third persons in buying something for them.
Saying that the advertising follows the sole plan to influence the young children which should again manipulate their parents for example in buying something for them.
In my opinion this alone is sufficient to make one come up with a thought.
The thought that companies like that, which actually do something as malicious as influencing children ,who are likely not even able to state what they really want, and just come up with the first best thing to have are truly evil comes right to ones mind.
I would like to state another point: In addition to that it proved to be true that some kind od advertisements are able to truly influence and damage the children as well.
For example there has been an advertisement in the early ninetees which stated a product that was presented to the audience.
Until this it seems to be fairly normal but what what follows is truly malicious; The whole time the spot was set in motion there has been some kind of ultra-high frequency tone which was not hearable for the human ear but unfortunately it affected our brain and made us want to purchase that product.
There is probability that young children have something like that too, something that triggers something in them, probably damages them and makes them influencing their parents in order to buy something for them.
I personally believe that it is, even for the companies, not purpose fulfilling if they try to influence such young people, because they simply do not state a purchasing-force on their own and need to depend on another factor if they want to sell their products.
If the companies would just make advertisement for people who could really buy somethingthey would not need to worry about another factor.
The statement that the advertising directed toward young children is nowadays a daily thing.
In every television soap or just a film are these television advertisings.
In the afternoon, when children from a young age want to watch a film, every fifteen minutes, there are those.
A positiv aspect of the permission is, young children would not be sad after the parents say no to their imagination for example to have these toys or puppies.
Furthermore, there would be less frustration of the parents to disagree with their children.
A negativ point to the statement is, some shops can not afford to lose the generation of the age from two to five.
Moreover, it is the parent's fault when they have the mentality of buying all the wishes from television from their children.
In my opinion, I think it must be allowed, because some companies only become famous because of the commercial.
So I disagree with the statement.
Parents are not obligated to buy all these things.
I think they have not a clear mind when they have to buy dumb things like a unreal dog e.g.
The question if television advertisement for children from the age of two to five should not be allowed seems a bit irelevenat to me because first of no child from the age of two to five should be allowed to watch TV on its own.
Furthermore the advertisments usuallay is directing to the parents of those childs and these parents should have the needed competence to decide wether an advertisment is good or bad or even if they would want their children to play with the advertised toy, for example.
An argument for the statement is that children of that age are easily influenced by things like advertisments and thus someone should test the advertisments for their safety and if they give some information which are not good for a child at that age.
But if the advertisment is good and the children want the advertised product they have to ask their parents anyway and thus it is the problem of the parents because they let their kids watch television insteat of doing something useful like playing outside where they can learn something real and build their own character.
There even is a book in which the author describes dangerous things children should be allowed to do to learn about certain things like problem solving or they ccan learn about their borders of pain which to seems very important.
One example in that book was climbing a tree which teaches the childs important motoric skills.
I personally think children of that age should only watch television with their parents and also only watch programms that have no bad effect on their social behavior for example shows like ,,Baurer sucht Frau" which is a german television show.
Also in todays society televison gets mor eand more unpopular because of an internetn broadcasting website called YouTube where Advertisment often can not even be recognized as what it is because of so called YouTubers that dont mark their videos as advertisment videos.
These Youtubers have a much bigger impact on young children and thus should have harder guidelines.
So my answer to the question if television advertisment should be forbidden for young children is that it should have hard guidelines but in the end it is the parents fault if something influenced their children in the wrong way.
Also i dont watch TV so i dont know how the todyas situation with advertisments is.
Many researches have lately shown that children, who are at a young age in contact with social media will be more intelligent and succesful in life.
In the following I will discuss wethter television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not.
This leads me to the first point that children should get used to see all different sides of social media.Of course they shold not watch TV all day but sometimes.
It could also help them improve their language and not hear the style of their parents' language.
Additionally, children would be entertained the whole time because every 30 seconds or so there is something new going on.
However, it is not good for them because it could make them dumb if they only watch advertisments all day.
Children should go outside, play with friends and have fun.
Children cannot be raised watching TV because they are getting lazy of it, they probably do not want to do anything else anylonger.
Moreover, children tend to get grumpy if they do not get what they want and after watching TV they possibly do not want to do anything than watching TV.
In my opinion, I am very happy I did not grow up with watching TV and the advertsiments but going outside and seeing the nature, in order to learn something because at that age you just kind of learn by doing and not watching.
I believe it should be prohibited for children at that age and parents should not let their children watch that often TV because it is not healthy for their growing brain and decreases their intelligence.
Its a difficult topic,because people see it differently.
On the one hand, it should be not allowed,because television make the little young children stupid.
But on the other hand in the age from two to five, children dont realise what they become told by the people in the television.
For the children it is only ,,Unterhaltungsprogramm''.
They see a lot of differently pictures on the TV and a lot of different colours.
Another point is that television is not good for the eyes of the little kids.
Television can make the Sehstärke badlier so that they need classes in a young age.
Against the Argument is that Television sometimes had the influence of quieting, so the little childrens are faster müde or that they are still and relaxed.
Some Parents let their children watch Televison, because they are noises by their kids and when they need silence, they let them watsch on the tv.
Furthermore, sometimes give it serien in which they children can learn something, like :,,1,2,3 wenn du richtig stehst,siehst du wie das licht angeht.''
Out of this serien children dont will become silly or stupid.
They learn something what they could need in their later life, in their future, in the school or someone else.
So many serien are interessted by children, who they can learn something.
But sometimes, children needs serien which are silly and stupid but funny or something.
In my opinion is it okay, that people watsch in the age from two to five television,because sometimes everyone needs silence.It musst not be every day long of hours, but sometimes is it okay.Specially by children,who have older siblings, its hard to allowed them little one not to watch Television, for exsample my neighbour Lukas is seven years old and his sister Maira is three years old and when he watsch television, she will too.
But when she didnt watched television because her Parents not allowed, than is the drama big, because her older brother can watch television.
But in the End Parents musst decide that on themselves, than all parents are different and all of them sees the topic differently.
Watching Television is quite normal in our modern world.
Almost everybody does it and many love it.
But many people hate advertisements.
They destroy the whole scenerie of a good film we are watching an most likely show things we really do not need.
But especially young kids watch TV these days and they get overrun with advertisements concipated just for them.
The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
is a really controverse topic which is often discussed.
This is a very difficult question if this should be allowed or ist should not and I think there are many arguments that support this these but also some against it.
In the following text I will discuss at least a few of them.
One argument that is against the statement is that many companies would not sell any products for children they produce if they would not advertise it in the TV.
Children in this age do not go into a shopping mall and buy their stuff at it.
They tell her parents what they want to have and most likely they see it on the TV, the advertisements are one of the few ways for companies to sell their products.
An argument that supports the these is that really young children are easy to manipulate and that might happen if they watch advertisements on the TV.
They do not have an own opinion and they witch it really fast an support everything that is shown to them.
Especially ads that directly go towards the children is really dangerous in this case.
They can get manipulated so they could support things which are bad for themselves for example.
Another good example for the advertisements is that they could do the complete opposite of the argument I just mentioned.
They could inform the children or teach them some things they need for the future.
The advertising would be used for a good cause so to say.
TV advertising could cause many troubles if it is abused and it could "force" the young children to sit in front of the TV the whole day.
They would not do anything else.
Another point is that some kids would be angry if they do not get the things they wanted to get.
This could be horrible for the parents who have to deal with the children after this.
In my opinion the advertisements in TV should stop.
Especially for young children.
This power is abused too often for example with manipulating the children.
They get a totally wrong "picture" of the world and the other people and might be forced to sit in front of the TV the whole day just because of the advertisements they watched and still watch.
The arguments that count for advertisements in TV are far too small.
They could never get bigger than the arguments that support the statement.
One of the most sensitive things about young children is how easy it is to influence their personality and behaviour, which can lead to them being exploited in several occasions for numerous reasons.
This is no different with television advertisement, which is one of the biggest and easiest ways to access and influence countless children across the planet for economic reasons.
First of all, let's look at a, I have to say, rather dark, example regarding the extraordinarily low difficulty of influencing the behaviour of small children due to their susceptibility to suggestion.
One of the most well-known examples for this is found in dark humour which often makes jokes about children being lured by predators through candy, trading cards etc.
which is not something that sprung off of fiction.
These things all originate from real life cases where pedophiles and kidnappers used these things as lures to make them trust them and follow their suggestions.
Even though this example may seem disproportionate this is the exact same principle, and since those are little children we are talking about, there is no such thing as disproportionate for them since they do not have the life experience to differentiate the severity of influencing through advertisement and strangers.
I will start with the pro-arguments regarding the discontinuation of advertisement directed towards young children.
As I have made abundantly clear in my example above young children are extremely easy to influence and are very susceptible to suggestions due to their young age which makes advertisement directed towards them something immoral for some people.
What I mean by that is that it is literally like taking candy from a baby, only in this case the candy is the money of the child's parents.
They are just so easily influenced that companies do not even have to put that much effort into making successful advertisement since they can be exploited this easily and lead them into buying things that are in fact completely useless to them, for example toys which work are presented through animations in advertisements which makes the children form an unrealistic image in their minds or advertisement for candy which can then snowball into the child having too much of it.
Now I will move on to the contra-arguments.
A point that could be made in the defence of advertisements directed towards young children is that it does not strictly go against any laws and it is not necessarily damaging for the child.
The parents do not have to buy the toys their children see in the advertisements and it is also their responsibility to make sure their child has a healthy diet and dental care, since in the end those companies who produce the advertisements are not forcing anyone to do anything but rather showing them what they could do.
Apart from that, one could also argue that it is a grey area wether it is immoral or not to make those advertisements since this is a question which is to be answered individually and thus varies alot from individual to individual.
So to sum up, these advertisements can be considered highly immoral due to young children's susceptibility to suggestion and may snowball into bigger issues, these issues' severity depending on what the advertisement is actually for, however, morality is also something that is very individual and advertisements also only show what someone could do, they do not actually force anyone to do anything, it is still up the child's guardians to make the decision, not the child itself.
The number of persons watching TV have raised in the last few years.
Also children love it to watch television in the evening or in the afternoon after the school ends.
But besides the televison programme, there are many advertisings, especially for young children.
This leads me to the statement, I read in an article, that television advertising directed toward young children, aged two to five, should not be allowed.
I agree with these statement, because advertisement has a huge impact on people, but especially on young children.
They see a spot in the television and want for example the newest Nintendo DS, because it has a game you can only play on this version of Nintendo.
Or for younger kids are things like little figures they can collect an share with their firends, more important, but also dangerous.
They can brathe these little figures in and it can get stuck.
Also are these figures full of chemicals who are not healthy for children neither then for parents.
Another point is that children could try to replay what they saw in the advertisement.
The new spiderman costume is in sale and in the ad the children wearing it can fly like spiderman and after the children get these costume it would try to do it like in the advertisemnt.
There is also advertisemnt which is violent or have a positive point of view about violence and this is a message, the children learn and keep in their minds.
But not only advertising for children until five years, also all advertising should be controlled more or be forbidden.
Young Teens are very impactable in all kind of advertising or propaganda.
All in all is watching television for children, but also teenanger, not a perfect freetime acitvity.
They should go outside an play games with thier friends before they must go to upper school and have no longer time for playing games or freetime itself.
Children aged two to five have to learn very much about live.
For example about their needs and how they had to react in diffrent situations.
One of this situation is the television advertising.
They had to diside whether they resist this advertising or not.
If not they had to ask their parents whether they could buy them this things.
And than it is by the parents if their child gets this thing.
For example the child watches TV his favourit series dragons or somthing and after it comes an advertising about a figur from this film whitch one can by in the supermarket.
After that the child goes to his mom and ask her to buy this figur.
So their is a secound opinion which knows more about the world and how it works.
But when the child starts annouing his mother she maby desids against her on opinion and than the advertising has the chance to manipulat the child with more and more new figurs of this series and the child wants them all but the mother do not want to buy them.
When this happens the child maby goes to the supermarket and buys tehem by itselfs.
But the child can not do that because its to young.
An other example is if the mother says yes but buys it with the money of the child.
Than the child learns when it has enough money to buy the next figur that it can not have everything.
This child will grow up and knows how to spend its money without a helping hand.
It would not buy evrthing what the advertising says instad of bthe other child who maby would.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward children aged two to five should be allowed to teach the children how to act in this situations.
But the parents have to know how they had to react.
When a brefed mother or father is given it would work and television advetising should be allowed.
The discussion whether television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not became more and more important within the years.
One could say that it is nearly impossible to avoid advertising in the television and the only thing one could do is to quit watching TV.
But is it really necessary?
Young people get easier influenced for the reason that they are in their learning-phase which means that soak everything up that is told to them and reproduce it.
Now if they watch too much TV it could have bad effects even on their later life.
Some ads in the TV want their viewer so hard to buy their product that it sounds for a young child nearly as he or she has to do so.
This leads to the fact that they get influenced so strong that they want to consume a lot even for example as a three year-old boy.
This experience in ones childhood can make a child easy influenceable by advertising in their later life and make them spend a lot of their money to things they do not even need.
So in my opinion television advertising or advertising in general should nt be allowed towards young children because it has only bad effects on them.
THE END
Of cause there are many advertising in the television today, but there are not only positive facts the show them little children everyday because young children are not able to chose between many things and so they maybe want to have many games or something, but maybe the parents do not have that much money to buy their children all the things from the advertising.
Also there is a problem because not every advertising is for every children for every age or sex.
And in every advertising in the television are things to use inside a house or on the computer and so the children do not learn how to play with their fantasy or other kids outside in the nature.
Also the fact that in the advertising is shown with children have to play with barbies and which have to play with pirates is not good for kids.
But there is also the fact that it is easy to talk young children in to something, so they want to have something from the advertising from the television.
This is maybe negative fro the parents but positive for the industry because children are very good in talking to their parents that they want to have something from the television advertising.
So the parents maybe buy something from the advertising in stead of buying something with is not shown in the television.
In the christmas time of the year the advertising in the television show much more games for children and so the children watch television and the advertising and put the things from it on their sheat of paper for their wishes.
Of cause it is good for the industry but also for the kids bacause the kids can choose their games and presents for their birthday and for the christmas time.
So young children learn how to choose their own things.
Television advertising has a huge impact on our life, since we all get influenced by it.
The following statement says that television advertising should be forbidden in case it is directed toward young children.
So on the one side we have the parents, who want their children not to get in contact with advertising at least at this young age, since advertising has a deep impact on our minds.
On the other side we have big companies, especially those who focus on producing toys.
From the parents point of view, the only positive aspect is that the child knows better what kind of toys it wants on his/her birthday, if it watches a lot of television commercials.
But the negative points are much more important and strong than the positive ones.
So for example television advertising, focused on little children, mostly is based on saying the name of the product many times with a ''cool'' voice in order to bring it into the viewers mind.
This means that the toys, your child wants to have are complete trash in most cases.
Another point is that, as a parent, your child will get on your nerves every time you are in a mall with him/her, because he/she wants you to buy these toys.
An other aspect is that it generally is not good to let children, which are these young, watch that many television.
Otherwise it will be a normal process and the kid will not be able to live without electronic devices.
On the company's point of view advertising directed towards little children has the negative aspect that they have to produce special spots just for these group of people, which costs a lot of money in most cases.
But on the other side a positive aspect is that you can earn a lot of money because one can influence little children very easily.
This means with good advertising spots many children want to get your toys.
But actually producing advertisings for children aged two to five is rather bad than good, because it has important negative aspects for the parents.
Television advertising is ubiquitous, whether for the newest cleaning supplies or cheap technical devices.
Young kids have to experience these harmful influences aswell.
Toddlers' brains aren't yet developed to think critically.
Influencing kids to buy or wish for the toy  is harmful for this development.
Advertisements give a wrong impression to kids, which can't distinguish reality and  hoax due to the lack of experience.
This is needed to even be able to think critically.
Companies use this lack of experience of kids to generate more sells.
Toddlers are being tricked and used for the company's advantage.
Companies that use this tactic are generally also those who don't value quality as high.
This leads the kids to want bad quality products to be bought for them.
For example, I was tricked into wanting things I now regret having bought.
The harmful effects result in a misinterpretation of advertisement later in life.
When a toddler always sees wrong things on TV, this will transform not only in believing advertisements but also in believing wrong statement about reality".
Advertisement towards kids should therefore be banned to be aired on television.
When I am swipping through the channels on a rainy saturday evening an see very small kids playing with toys in the advertisement on some junior channels I demand myself if it is good to let young children aged two to five see this things.
This leads me to the current topic of if television advertising for young children should be allowed at all.
First of all I like to mention, that in my opinion children in the age from two to five should not even be allowed to watch TV at all.
They have better things to do like playing with their friends or doing other kiddie stuff.
When they watch TV they might learn about the serious of life way to early.
Second I think that television advertising for those young kids is not a good idea, because they cannot decide what they need and what not.
So there is a high risk, that they want to have a lot of material things, like the newest doll or car or whatever, but they do not have money to buy it.
Probably they do not even know what money is and why they need it.
Maybe they also get trouble with their parent, because it is hard for them to understand, why they do not get everything they wish for.
With televison advertising gets the horizon of what to wish for bigger an bigger and the desire of beeing always up to date starts to early.
I do not thik there are any proper points to mention for the opposite side, exept the point, that the idustries make much more money on this way, because most parents cannot say no to their children.
Another difficulty is that even when the advertisings are not especially directed toward young children, they might see  it as well when they are allowed to watch TV.
When the advertisement for children is forbidden it possibly goes out to the parent directly.
As a conclusure one can say that television advertising for kids from two to five should not be allowed.
When the children start going to school they start comparing each other early enough and they do not need the material pressure from the televison.
Sad but true I do not think there is any way to stop it.
Today people all around the world watch television.
It's something we do frequently.
Instead of playing in the garden todays children are watching more and more television.
They not only watch tv shows or movies, they also watch television advertising because it's a main part of tv programms.
Now there's the question : Should television advertising directed toward young childern be allowed or not?
The reason why television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed is that young children are easy to ''manipulate''.
Most of this kids believe everything what they get told.
So it's very easy for firms to let the children believe that they want this product.
Another reason against it is that children start to learn that such materialistic possessions are important, because if they always see products in television they maybe start thinking that's what life's all about.
The reason why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed is that they, even though as said in the negative arguments, learn how to handle situations where they can't always have(in this example products) what they want.
They also learn after maybe twenty times watching the tv advertise that they don't want this product anymore.
This could be positive for growing up because they learn how to deal situations in a world where products are everywhere advertised because sooner or later they need to learn that.
In general I believe that television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.
It's unfair against the children and the parents because the main reason why a firm wants to direct television advertising to young children is because they are easy to impress and that shouldn't be the case.
If the products, which a firm sells, good then they don't need to advertise it to children because the parents would buy it by themselves.
Advertising for young children can be damaging to those because they tend to listen to their "stars" on the televison but on the other hand young children do not have the rights or money to buy those products in a shop or online.These children can easy be manipulated by the televsion, therefore they need an older person to buy it for them.
Parents do want there children to be happy and might buy those products but they are very expensive and just for the moment since later on the children grows up and does not need it anymore.
Parents should decide themselfs if a young children really needs these products or if they just want if because the "televison said it".
If the advertising is inaprobiate or not desinged for the young crowd it should not be allowed anyway because they can heavily inflict the mental state of the children and manipulate them to do wrong things or buy illegal products.Good advertising is rare but effective since they can produces well desinged products which makes the children happy or maybe is good for their evolution by learing certend things by using the product.
Also the parents should not left the children to long alone on the television because they might lag the skill to interact with other children later on which got attention from there parents and learned how to interact or make friends from them a bit by watching them or listen to them.
Childrens need those social interactions to grow up normally and should not be damaged by any electronical media like advertising in their early years.
Also it could make the children addictet to certend advertising or television.
In the end i agree with this statement since the mental and social damage a Television advertising is to big and problematic for young children without their own mind since they get less attention from parents or other "real" person´s, do not interact with other children or get addicted to certend products.
In the TV there is advertising areound every 15 to 30 minutes.
The advertisment is about everyathing, elektronics, food, sport, and so much more.
But there is even advertisment for thing for children, where they directly speek to the children to give them the feeling that they need it.
Should this be allowed?
to manipulate children in this way?
One the one hand one could say, why not?
It is just advertisment and if the parents do not want the chiildren to see it, they could just stop the child the watch TV.
The parents are, in the last consequence, the person how have the responcibility for their children, so the producer of this advertisment could argue in this way.
The parenrts can decide about what to watch and what not.
But one the other hand it is not so easy, even if the parents try to watch advertisment there is so much advertisment that it is just not realistic to think that the child would not see any advertisment.
And iff this advertisment is directed to children and their wishes in can manipulate the children in a very good way, because in an age of two to five children are not able to think about what they see in such a differentiaded way than an adult.
So they are easier to manipulate, what has the consequence that they whenever the see an advertisment directed toward young children they willget the feeling to want it too.
Now one could argue that there are even channels espacially for young children, where is no advertisment, like KIKA.
What leeks us to the question where the young children should see this advertisment, what is directed for them.
All in all I think that it is diffocult to forbid advertisment directed toward young children, but I think that if children see this it can have negative consequences.
Nevertheless I ask myself where the cildren should see this advertisment, because if they watch TV which is made for their age, on channels like KIKA, than there is no advertisment.
Consequently they coan just see it when they watch "normal" TV, but when it is like this there is the question what has worse consequences, the advertisment or the televsion they watch on this channels, which is normally for higher aged personens.
So I come to the conclusion, that I just think that television advertisment for young children is not good, but the people how watch TV on channels for adults have other problems.
I think advertising towards young children which are between two to five years old should be forbidden to save all people who are over 15 years old from these annoying baby- and young children products like Pampers, Hipp, Playmobil and much more others.
Also this would prevent children from wanting useless and overprized products like Lego, Hotweels and Barbie which are bad for them (because then they annoy their parents to buy more of it, which might start an addiction), the environment (because it is nearly completely made out of plastic) and also the parents because either they buy some things for their children or their children are getting mad.
Also these things to play with are trown away after a while.
Instead they should get something like an old gameboy, which is hard to destroy, cheap and also then the children do not need anything else to play.
At commercials such as Hipp or Pampers you could say that it is made for the parents so they know which products are best for their baby/child.
But seriously, if someone wants to know what really is good for their child, he should google it instead of believing in an commercial product which is overprized.
I think that these commercials should be forbidden to save the teenagers from being annoyed by these advertisments because seriously, these advertisements are pretty annoying for example Hotweels commercials: The guy who speaks it does not really speak - he shouts his text, so that the children think that it have to be good and that they need it to be happy.
Seeing all the arguments everyone should see it now.
Almost in every Television show are pauses with a lot of advertising so it is part of our daily life.
In the following I want to discuss wether Telivision advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
The first thing one can state is that young children at the age from two to five are much more easy to influence tha older children or also of course adults.
So in addition to that the children want the things which are shown in the Telivision advertising.
On the other hand one can also say that adults also can be influenced by Telivision advertising.
For example at shopping channels.
Furthermore older people can also be easily influenced.
Like I already stated with the help of shopping channels, where they are animated to buy more things in order to buy it less expensive.
Another point is that children can also be influenced with the help of the contentr and the action in special childrenseries.
For example the children who wanted to cute his stmoach and to put a television only because it watched teh Teletabbies.
Thid is teh case because like I already said children at an age from two to five are much easier to influence then older children for example at the aged of sixteen and also of course as adults.
So all in all I would say that television advertising directed toward young children from the age of two to five should not be allowed because they can be to easily be influenced with this advertising.
But television advertising is not the only risk where young children can be influenced.
Also the content of childrenseries can influence the children in a negativee way.
On the other hand the risk to be influenced is also given for adults.
For example through shopping shows.
The sentence ''Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be not allowed'' have people who agree with and disagree with.
Maybe it is the right way for young children to grow up whithout TV because they have maybe a better childhood because they play more often in the nature and with other children as when they watched just TV.
On the other side it is totally okay when children in this age watched maybe just one hour on the day TV.
When they play with other children in the afternoon and watch maybe just an hour before they have to sleep it is okay.
I think one hour to watch TV in this age is okay because I do not see a danger for the child to see an hour maybe spongebob, barbie or other series for kids.
When they have fun to see this, they are allowed to do this.
But children have to become fresh air and they have to go outside for a bit time.
People should not to be so (streng) with their little children.
Okay I understand when parents say that their children should not to watch TV because they do not like the series they are watching or they think that they become stupid when they see this.
But then they should show their children which one they will be allowed to watch.
So in the end I can say I disagree with the sentence ''Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed to''.
Since the existing of television, video games, computer and phones, people have been discussing the amount and effects this kind of media has on especially young children.
A lot of primarly older adults think children should not be allowed to watch television and it should be reduced to a minimum.
To do that it is discussed to ban any advertising of tv shows and movies which is directed towards children.
One of the most mentioned reasons to ban this kind of advertisment is that the adults believe that children spend too much time infront of the television.
In their mind they believe that children only sit infront of the tv all day long, not being outside and playing, but in most cases that is not true andd the most important thing they forget is that the amount of tv that is watched should be, atleast from the ages from two and five be dictated by the parents, so their generation.
So even then these children are seeing these advertisments parents are or should be in control of the tv time of their children.
Also these advertisments, and in the end the movie oder televison show they are advertising towards the children, are stories just like in books, these children are going to identify themselves with the story or characters, a big part of growing up and learning certain things like empathy.
One example could be that by watching, maybe disney movies like Lion King it is not only a movie that makes them laugh but teaches them that not all children still have both parents or subconsciously teaches them about growing up and the difficulties that part of life brings.
And if you wouldtake away these advertisments and only direct them towards their partent, the children can not decided what they want to watch taking away the decission what they want to learn, because most advertisments show the gist of the lesson they trying to bring across.
Also by doing that they would take away the lesson of deciding what the child believes interests them and measuring how well they would digest certain movies and themes.
Certainly the way that movies and tv shows for children are advertised towards children should be controlled and it should be garanteed that it does not in anyway influence the children to do something dangerous or forbidden, for example an advertisment should say 'You should watch this movie no matter what your parents say'.
It should just advertise the movie

All in all I would say that, because the biggest problem of advertising movies and tv shows towards children, is that society fears young children are not in control of the amount of tv they watch.
I peronally believe that at that age parents and society should teach their children the amount they should watch and what they watch to certain degree.
Also parents need to be able to know how well their children react to certain movies and the length of their tv watching, also how well their children can do it themself already.
All over the world will be discute about if television advertising shouldn't be allowed directed toward young children, in the age of two to five years.
This wonder a lot of old people, that something like this can be asked.
Because this theme just come to speak in the 21 th century.
Befor there aren't any television and children never see an advertising in the age of two to five.
Many parents work a long time and there children are alone at home.
They have no controle about there children if they look television or not.
The parents can't influence the computere advertising, if there child is looking a film.
Pherhaps you already know that in each film or serie come all 30 minutes an adverting where somthing will show on there best side, this we can't change.
I strongly belive that the children in there young years don't have to see so much advertising, because the economic take this chance to make a lot of money.
The children see for example a sweet teddy or an tractor for play and so they will to buy this things.
With television advertising they buy a lot of things they don't need.
In my opinion the television advertising should not be allowed, also for childrens who are older than five years old.
Than also children in this age don't realise that they wouldn't need this things they see in the advertising.
Television is in our society a big topic since every human use the telescreen in the evening to relax and to get entertained.
But should children, aged two or five, also use these advertisment?
On the one hand it is easier for parents to controle there children in the public or at home when silence is needed.
The children are fascinated by the televisoin programms while the parents are able to relax and have some freetime after work without loud children noises who want attention.
Furthermore children could learn somethink from the children programm, which often try to teach the children counting or writing in an funny way.
Accordingly they are able to have fun and get entertained but also learn school stoff.
But on the other hand parents should try to have as much contact with there children as possible to reach a very deep relationship between them and there kids.
Furthermore the parents had to support social contact with other children so the kids are able to learn and get comfortable with social rules an the right behavior.
An other negative point is that children would sit too much infont of the television an consequently will play less outside.
The Movement, which children does outside, as well as the creative ,which is used to invent new games to prevent to get bored, are lost.
But the biggest and most worse Problem and consequense of television programm for children is that the risk for an bad impact, made by programm which ist only for older people coud made some deeply fearful impact on childrens behavior.
Consecently televisoin for children is not good because of the negative consequenses.
For the moment it coudl make the parents life more easier but in the future it would have an negative impact on children.
The risk television brings withit are too high as we coudl ignore them.
Accordingly I agree with the statement that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed.
This would prevent a lot of mistakes in the growing up process from children, which are mostly caused sice parents does not know such informations.
In our todays society many young children watch television and most of the parents did not see any problems or complications in the later life of the children, but is the television and in addition to that television advertising directed to young children good for their evolution and shoud it be allowed?
In my opinion the children in the age of two to five get very much influence and in particular advertising via the television they get as much influence as possible.
Futhermore the light of a television is very bad for the eyes and the brain and there could be problems in the future life of the children when they for example watch tv the whole day.
On the one hand the parents can put their childs infront of the television and they are happy because all of them are quiet.
But one the other hand is not it the job of parents to play with their kids and have fun with them.
A child should be a big dream and not a thing to get some money from the state.
You should love your child and you should love to take you time for just your child.
When the children get influenced by the advertising, they always have a wish they want to play with and maybe when there is a very good markded toy the young people oftener want to play with bit instead of watching television.
In my opinion it should not be allowed to stream advertising in television directed toward young children in the age of two to five, because so young people get influenced very fast without doing something.
But it would be much easier to turn the television off, go outside and for example climb the trees, than to discuss wheather it should be allowed to direct advertising towards young people or not.
Television is in our times normal.
But what is with the television advertising directed toward young children ?
I think that television has its good and bad sides, but for younger children television is often a problem.
Some childrens in that age are only watching television because they are used to it and their parents are not really interseted in doing something with them.
But the TV decides about how the child becomes and different shows and films make the children react differently.
Children often are shocked by some shows or films even if it is for their age, they can not understand everything about it and have in the night bad dreams about what they saw.
The parents can not understand what is up to their child and a 2 year old child could not explain what the problem is.
Some shows might be good to learn something like counting or the alphabet but some shows show a wrong world to the child.
They show something in which a little princess gets everything she wants or that monsters exist.
A children often could not make a difference between the reality and a fantasyworld.
Often the kids are afraid of what they saw or they want to do the same as the people on their TV show.
But how to explain a child that what they saw was not real and that they should not believe in something like that.
Sometimes it is impossible for the parents.
Also you could often not control what your child watches on TV because you take a nap or do cleaning or so on.
A child should go out an play with its toys or paint or meet their friends like I did when I was at their age.
They should use their own fantasy and should not only life the fantasy a producer of a film created.
Parents should look what they watch on TV and decide if it is good for their kid or not.
Parents should tell the children when they could watch something and when they should do something else.
They must show by themselves what is write and what is wrong and do not let the shows and films do things like that for them.
What the parents decide, decides about the future of the childrens.
They should do that because they decide about the future of the children and what he or she will be like.
So when you want that your child has a good childhood then control what your kid watches and decide if it is good for them or not.
And also let your child play most of the time and do not let them watch all the time television.
It is in your hands as their parents what your child will be like when it is older.
Nowadays, advertising in TV is one of the most efficient ways to generate attention towards a new product that you might want to sell.
Especially if this new product is for little children, because they are very inflenciable and you can easily convince them to buy a new toy just becuase it looks nice.
I wonder why we should abolish directed advertisements toward young children because I do not think that this is that much of a deal.
If you think about it, at the end the parents need to decide if they want to buy their child a new toy or if they do not, children cannot go out and buy it by themselves.
Advertisements on TV channels that were specificly made for two to five year old children, often use advertisement to educate our future generation and I personally think, that this is a good way to explain things to the young part of our society.
On the other hand, TV addiction at this age is a serious problem.
Young children tend to spend more and more time in front of the television in this day and age.
When I was younger I used to go outside and play football all day long but today, this just does not seem to be the case.
Children often spend the hole day watching TV and playing videogames and because advertisements promotes this new technologies I would say that it would not be a dumb idea to prohibit directed advertisement for these little children.
An other negative aspect, is that if children see something they want on TV and they like it, they will do whatever it takes to convince their parents to buy that new toy.
This is often somthing that ends badly.
In conclusion I do not think that this kind of advertising should not be allowed because it is a way of entertainig our little children as well as a form of education via TV.
I used to love advertisements, especially before christmas eve because they were very well done and I would know what I would ask Santa Claus to bring me that year.
nowadays television is a common thing, everybody has one at home and you can literaly watch everything on it from disney movies to documentations.
But is television a good thing especially for young children?
In one hand television can be very helpful when it comes to knowledge, there are many programs whitch offer you a bucket full of new thing like documentatons about certain animals or just videos about climat change.
Children at this young age learn very fast so its kinda a good thing to let them watch these things.
At the other hand its good for them to see how the world looks and acts outside his country, like what are the other personalies out there what diffrent kind of culture do we have.
So if you dont have the money or time to travel and to get to know other cultures than is television a good thing for young children, its also way easier to understand throught television.
Furthermore, there are also bilingual and learning programs would could help the children to make progress in learning and communication.
At the other side, televesion can increase your outgoing and social life because you'd rather sit infront of the TV then going out with friends and get to know knew people.You loose many friends it seems like your television is your friend.
Furthermore is the communication between the children in bad situation because children dont need to talk to others face to face anymore they can do it throught television what leads to lonelyness and can also lead  to depressions in bad cases.In fact that watching television for a too long time a day can also lead to bad manners,behaviours and agression towards the people around him.
All in all, there are some good sides but also some bad sides about television for young childre.In my opinion there should be an age limit for children and also a time limit for how long they are allowed to watch because television has influence to your behaviours.
It is difficult to answer these question.
Because these advertisings are used to buy the product.
For example the television advertising of "Kinderschokolade", which is a german chocolate, is also directed by young children.
That has a advantage for the producer from these product, because the other children see these child in the television and than they also want to have one.
So the parents have to buy some.
Or another example.
In Germany is a television advertising from "Hipp", which is a company who produce foot for babies.
So the mothers who had born a child see these advertising and when the babies in the television look good and healthy they think it is also good for their own children.
But on the other side you have to know, that the parents go with their children to a casting, because maybe they want to get famous or they need the money or what else.
So the children itselfs can not decide if they want to do these television advertising or not.
So they are too young to decide for themselfes.
Also the young children maybe can not speak so good or walk or something like that but they have to do what the producers say.
That means the children maybe not know what they have to do.
So I agree with the statement that television advertising which are directed by young people should not be allowed.
I think the children do not know what they are doing there.
I think it should be allowed in an age where the children can decide for themselfes, if they want to be an actor of it or not.
But it should be not allowed only to make money for the parents or to get them famous.
Television is a very discused topic becsause it is important for all ages in the sosiety.
In the past it was an importaned way on which the citizens could get information  about what happend in the world.
But is it important that children use this media?
In the age from two to five years children learned the basics about how they can interact in the sosiety in ower countrie.
Children in this age could get manipulated very easely and the parents can not control what they are watching in the Television.
Also in Television there are so much topics disscoused which are not good for the growing of this age like newes or crime series.
If the children learn how they can switch to another chanel they could watch news or horor movies an that is not very good for theyr growing.
But there is also the other side because if they watch seires which they can learn somthing from it is a good thig.
My opinion is more like the first arguments becuase i think it is better when the play outside or with theyr parents in the hopuse or arpartmened.
I think they should go outside in the nature and learn it with own hands and boddy.
Also if they are with the familie outside they lesrn how to interact with other children on a playground as example.
Why should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed or not?
In fact, this is not an easy question, because in the development of children, the age betwen two and five is important.
So they are influenced by everything they see in television.
Most advertising is directed toward adults and for this reason completely unuseful for little childrens development.
I personally don't think that advertising is good for children even if it's especially made for them.
At first, the effect of the advertising for the enterprise is not so clear.
Children in young age are dependent from their parents, so the children have to ask their parents for the product they have seen in advertising.
Since most stuff in children advertising are really stupid or useless things, the parents are probably not going to buy things, unless they think it's good.
So it's better to do the advertising toward adults anyway.
On the other hand, I personally think that it has no good effect on children watching television advertising.
It's more or less prooved that there are much better and more intelligent things to do for children than watching TV for hours.
If children are used to advertising, the enterprises can do even more and more advertising later, because nobody reclaims.
It got normal.
I think the advertising to young children should get forbidden.
That would not even get the enterprises in finacial debts.
They nearly don't make any advertising for children now.
Fact is, children can watch TV advertising early enough when they grew older.
Should television advertising not be allowed toward children aged two to five?
Well, it really depends.
Children in this age usally watch tv channels that are specificaly made for children in this age.
For sure these channels also have advertising breaks.
But this are advertising spots made for children.
So these children don't get offended in a sexual or violent way by the tv-spots.
If we look at the statement in this way, do I personally think, that tv advertising doesn't have a negative affect on young children.
Because of the tv advertising the have a little bit of a contrast between the series and programms tey watch.
Tey lear something about new products and learn to love and want new toys.
After they have seen the tv spots, the go to theyr parents and ask the if the get the new products.
They usually to the and in this way the tv spots have an positive affect on the economic of they country.
But what arguments support the statement?
I personaly think that tv isn't that good for children gernealy.
Children in this age shouldn't be sitting on the couch in the livingroom and wath tv.
They should be outside on the playground.
They should be explorimg the world and playing with theyr friends.
But this argument i against tv in general.
In fact you can say that tv advertising is good for the world and bad for the children.
I think it's important that the world economic works, because it's this what makes our children growing up in a good area.
And that's why i say television advertising is good for our children and shoul be allowed.
There is a rumore that young children will get stupid if they watch to much television advertising.
The question is ,,Is that true''?
Young children are heavily effected by advertisments on the Television if it comes to what kind of toy they want to have.
If they see a giant alien toy they want to have it.
So it is very important for companys to have this kind of connection to young children.
But maybe it is not that good for the childen, maybe they will get stupid.
I think this is only a rumore.
It is not official that advertisments damages your children.
I think this rumore just came up because parents think that there kids are watching far to much TV.
If it is sure that Television advertising leads to damage for our childrean I think it should not be allowed but by know I think this is no reason to not allowe advertising.
This is also because of personal reasons I have a friend who never had a TV so he could never watch any kind of advertisiment.
I had an TV so I watched advertisments all day long and I can not see any difference between use.
We both go to the same school and I even have better grades then him.
I know this is maybe mot the normal case but in my opinion advertising does not effect young childrean in any bad way.
Some advertsiments may be to brutal for young children but I think parents should have a look on what their kids are watching because only they know what is good for them in this age because every children is different.
So in my opinion advertising should be allowed also direct toward young childrean because I think it does not effect young children in any bad way.
Only if it is sure that young childrean are effected by advertisments in a bad way it should not be allowed.
Ps.
I think this topic is not that good because we never had this kind of topic in any of our lessons and never thought about it in our free time because it does not affect use in any way so I do not have that many arguments for both sides maybe a topic about school would be much better.
The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" is a statement which can everybody see different so there is never the right answer.
To be able to undersand the shows in television, the children have to know many vocabularys and their meaning, because if not, the children cannot understand the show so there is no sence to watch it.
With the help of the shows,  children can get new ideas to do with their friends and they can try new things because they saw it in the telivision.
But at the other hand, there are big dangers to let the young children watch television.
If they only sit infront of the television, they cannot be cerative anymore, because the television tells something, they belive in it and do not discover anything for themself.
The day is only to watch television and they do not want to go outside anymore because they think it is boring outside, but it isn't, they only do not have the cretivity to discover interesting things outside.
If they only watch television, they do not meet friends or other children so the relationship between other children is demaged what is a big problem for the future.
To play with other children in this young age is one of the most important things in their live because it is one part of your future.
The evolution of the children  (Entwicklung eines Kindes) could be stopped or not fulfilled, because they cannot (entwickeln) themself only  sitting infront of the television.
As conclusion my opinion is clear.
I think there are so many other possibilitys to waste the time in the childhood and not watch television.
It is very important to learn how to be social or how dicover something or to fight with other kids.
It is all a part of the evolution of children an if this evolution is damaged because of the television, the future can also be damaged because they do not know practical things in live, they only know who is the aunt of the best friend of the mainfigure in their favourite television show what is not very important to know in live.
The advertising in the television is often directed to young children,because they are manipulatable.
but many people think that especially for young children this should not be allowed.
For the companies it is a big advantage to make advertising toward young people, because they often watch television and they want to have everything they see in the television.
Although the children have not much money, the parents of them would do everything for their children to make them happy, so that means that they would buy it.
The children could also remember the things from the television, when they are in a supermarket or something like this and then they want their parents to buy it too.
However this could be callad manipulating.
The companies use the behaviour of young people to sell more of their products.
Another point is that children of that age, are not really able to think of what they see.
THey do not know anything about it and older people would say that they do not need, but young children are manipulatable and can not re think their decisions.
With that method the companies also make advertising for people, which leads to that other people buy something and spend their money, just because of the manipulating advertising toward other people.
To put it into a nutshell, I think that this kind of advertising should not be allowed, because young children do not know what is good for them and you can easy manipulate them.
In our generation even the smallest ones are looking televison in their freetime and are seeing the ads of all the nice dolls and toys and want to have them too.
But is it correct to influence the childreen which are only two to five years old with advertising directed toward them or should it be not allowed?
If you're going in a toy store you can see thousands of different dolls, games or other toys and it is impossible to choose one of those thousands for a present for your child, and if you are going with your child in a store they want to have everything and they aren't able to choose too, but if the childreen see one special toy in an ad they only want to have this one thing and it is much easier for the parents to find a present if the childreen are knowing exactly what their childreen want to have.
But especially young childreen are very easy to influence with ads and if they only see those nice things in an ad it is all what they want and they aren't having an own oppinion, so the ads in televisons are influencing the growment of the childreen in a negative point.
In this world we are living is it very important to have an opinion wich is really yours.
Another point is that young childreen aren't always able to understand the difference between reallitty and fiction and it is possible that when they are always looking tv they will use the connection to the real world and they will stop reading books, going outside and playing with friends.
They are happy when they are seeing the unicorn dancing in a tv ad and then they are asking themselves wehre to find them outside, because they aren't able to know that unicorns aren't real.
All in all I think television advertising directed toward young childreen should not be allowed because they have to build their own oppinion and it could be dangerous if their are loosing the connection to the real world.
The topic is about "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.".
That is a interesting question for parents if they allowed their kids to watch tv.
Because there are pro und contra arguments.
But more contras.
The good thing is, that the kids see something interesting maybe.
But the point against that is that they could see too much mad thinks or "rubbish".
Maybe they see a advertise and now they want to have it.
A new barbie or a car from cars.
They are young and would not understand it.
In the advertise are showing new episodes.
They want to see them but they are not allowed from the parents or the age (FSK).
It is possible that they do not understand allthing, again because they are too young.
Or the parents do not care about that and the kids are watching the whole day tv and the advertising.
That would not good for the child.
Because in this age the kids grow up and remeber that.
I think that it should be not allowed because of the arguments and the health of the kids.
Should Television advertisments for young children be allowed?
When you are watching TV with your little five year old children, silbling or cousin you probebly might have heart them say:"Can I have that?".
That is a common question in for children in this age because the advertisments on a TV channel made for children are perfectly desinged to make them want the advertised product.
Based on the fact that it is way easier to make an advertisement for childern because they are not that experienced many adults want those to be banned.
One reason for that is that the Children could get persuaded by those advertisements and by things they usually did not need or even want just because they looked so cool in the television.
When that happens they are kind of forced to buy something from their own money and do not even get happier from it.
But the advertisement industry also has a good argument, which is that the parents just should watch their children better so that they are not allowed to just simply buy everything they want but have to ask their parents first.
That would solve thee problem that Children are not expierenced enough to know what they really want or what the advertisement tells them they want.
Another good reason to let them be allowed is that Children only learn to handle advertisements when they get confronted with them.
This means that banning them for up to five year olds would make over five year old children be eán easier target.
To sum it up I would say that it is not usefull to bann those kind of advertisements because with the help of the parents they could teach a children how to handle advertisement for the rest of their lives.
Television advertising is already a big and controversial topic but advertisments for children that are two to five years old are even more controversial.
There are a lot of reasons for and against those advertisments but just some of them will be discussed in the following text.
First the advertisments help the children to get used to the media they will use when they get older.
Because of television ant its advertisments the young children will get an impression of how the technology works and what it is for.
The information they get leads to a better view on how the things they will be confronted with really are which helps them to make their decisions.
On the other hand the use of media can lead to a dependence on media and especially on television ant its advertisments.
Furthermore the young children will not be able to see the differences between true and false because of the mass of information they are confronted with.
This is also an influence on their decisions that leads to the question if their decisions really remain their own decisions.
To sum up television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because they would be influenced to much by the information they would get.
In my opinion media is no bad thing but in such a young age children should rather play outside with other children than watching television and advertisments.
They should learn about both sides but not when they are that young, they should stay independent from media as long as they can.
Now I want to write an argumented essay about the statement if televison advertising directed toward young people sdf Habe irgendwie die zu argumentierende Frage nicht verstanden
Television advertising directed toward young people can have many consequences.If the children see advertising in television they want to have this products.
The Hersteller can manipulate the children with the advertising of new products.
But televison advertising  directed toward young children can also have possitive asspects.They can think about new products
In the last decades the fast developing of technik and its masive relevance in the modern worldand influence on the personal life of every individual has lead to veryous kontrovers questions of the use and monopole of techniks and especcely when it comes to the relationship and influence of media towards children there are always many critical voices but also people who defend the nem developing.
One of these controverse aspects can be clearly seen in the television advertising toward young children.
On the one perspective it is clear and profed by studies that children from an age from two to five are very easy to influence, so that this practice can imensly lead to a change in there personal developement in a way the producers intend it through the shown stuff and also keep this in mind while producing.
In generall and again proofed by science Television is not good for very young kids and should just used limited from an age of eight because based on the braindevelopement kids younger than four can not even understand what they see in television and untill six or seven(forgot the exact number) they have problems to see the difference betwheen it and reality.
The medical effects a use of television in to young age or too big amount can reach from anything like headache, unability of concentration, underdevelopement, sleepingproblems, realitydisconection two overweight, agresivity and in extreme cases even paranoja or psychical illnis.
On the over hand it is clear that in our technological based world every child also in a young age should learn how to deal with any kind of media and while televison seams to be a less dangouress media in difference to the internet where through a personal interacting of the user much more can happen this should be the media to introduce kids with it first.
In conection to this generall aspect it is also importened to teach children a critical view on the media and the knowledge that it tries to influence them, so if this happens by the parents kids can learn how to deaL WITH IT WHILE YOU CAN NOT KEEP THEM AWAY FROM IT  
Finally i see my personal view completly in this last aspect but would like to add that this from my perspective should start in the age of primary school and not from an age of two untill five, when kids have better thinks
Advertising is a difficult topic , because sometimes it is helpful and othertimes not.
But advertising for children from two to five is really bad.
Every little child wants to have what it sees in ads.
The Problem is, that  the parents have to pay for it and out of this they will become poor and this why they maybe kill themeselves.
So the child has no parents anymore.
Annother possibility is, that the child only focus on ads , even if it is already an adult.
If the parents don´t let their children watching TV the whole day the risk of influecing ads is not so high, but children like to watch TV extremly long, so they have to find a compromiss.
Summarizing I would say, that I think ,that the risk of a death of anyone is too high.
So I agree with the statement.
Advertising has become a important thing for many companies and stores to show people, what they have to offer.
Adverts are everywere, they appear on televison, are talked about on radio and hang on all sorts of things.
But are there any limits?
Schould advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
In their young age children are very easy to influenz because they are still learning a lot.
If adverts tell them what's good and what they schould have, they can't develop a opinion on their own.
The skill of developing an opinion is very important and adverts block it.
On the other side children don't know much, so adverts can help them to learn about the world.
They get to know more and get to know the different aspects of life.
It's good to show this to them, because it's hard to find out for themselves.
Adverts lead young children in the wrong direction.
They schould learn that the real goal, isn't to own as much as possible, but that it's important to gain experiences, to have social connections and to look in the insiide.
Throug adverts they are learnig the wrong values.
To summarise, I think don't agree with the statement compleatly.
Advertising can be allowed, but if done so there should be restrictions.
They can show things, but shouldn't tell the children how these things are.
That way the people, who want to publish adverts can do that and children can still develop their own opinions.
Maybe !
Yes and No !
Hohoho
Because of reasons !

I do not think that television advertising directed toward young people should not be allowed.
The problem is not the advertising , the problem is that a lot of children are allowed to watch all programms on TV and to watch the whole day.
Today in many familys it is normal that the TV is on in the background  everyday, so the children see it everyday and learn that this is normal.
It is the parent´s duty to teach their children the right way to deal with all the advertising.
The children need TV-rules, so they are just allowed to watch specific movies and programms.
Because when advertising directed to children, aged two to five, is not allowed, there is advertising when they are older and it becomes more difficult to tell them they can not have all and buy all.
Furthermore there is not just advertising on the TV, there is advertising everywhere, so the children would not be protected against it, when it is stopped on the TV.
So the right way is not to stop the advertising, the way to solve the problem is education.
So I do not agree with the statement.
I agree with the statement Television advertisement directed toward young childreen (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Because when they get contact with the television they can easily get addicted to it.
And they do not know the danger of this media.
It can give them false illusions for the real world or they do not get out of the world of the TV show.
They can not see the wall between reality and the TV.
If they get addicted to Television the just want to watch it and do not something else, like playing with friends and create their own universe with them.
They get the universe from the TV and do not create theit own.
They also want to get rid of their friends because they want to wantch the TV show.
And they get quit their hobbies, if they have hobbies like sports in this age.
And their creativity will not be upgraded.
Also the TV sends dangerous beams into its surronding, which makes it dangerous for the childreen.
It is not necessary that they get in touch with this media in this age, they have time enough to explore it in their future years.
I did not have a TV in my childhood.
And we have it also not now.
And I live.
I had a great childhood, because I was a lot outside, playing in the sand or with my toys  in my room or with my parents.
I also think that my brother (8 years old) is addicted to the media because he always want to watch his time on the tablet or play it.
He started this when he was five or younger.
That is why I am against the statement.
To put it in a nutshell I agree with the staement and would go a step further, that the media should only be allowed for childreen at the age of eight or higher.
It has been always very controversy if direct television advertising direct toward children should be allowed.
In the following essay I will have a look on the different perspectives.
First of all young children are not the only one who can be manipulated by advertisment.
So the same issue appears with very old people.
Nevertheless I think children should not be confronted with television ads because they you can not really say what effect this has on their development.
The age from 2 to 5 is extremly important for their further life, so it would not be good, if they would be harmed by advertisment.
But also I do not think it is really up to the Tv-Channels or advertisers todo not advertise for children.
It is more up to the parents of the children to make sure their children do not watch TV-Channels with this advertisment.
So the parents have the responsibility to care of their child.
Also I do not really see the sense behind advertising to young children, because they are not the generation who buy a lot of things.
On the other hand you can not estimate the power of advertising on the life of the children.
So it is often a competition between companies to try who is the first to make the customer realize the product.
Because of this they begin with the youngest customers possible.
And this is alright because it is their right according to law.
All in all I think in commercials advertising to young people is no no-go, but the companies should not be over do it due to not enough research on the effects to the development of children.
But in my opinion children from 2-5 should not watch TV at all, especially not shows with included TV-spots.
"Television advertising is a modern concept of brainwashing young people".
Such statements might seem utterly wrong and stupid.
But they have reason.
In todays society, it is common for a child to watch TV and for a family to have one.
When they come across an advertisement, they are being influenced by the ads.
Believe it or not, watching ads affect you unconciously whether you like it or not.
If you watch an ad for a certain company producing shampoo for example, you might not realise it, but you will rather buy their product than the product of another company.
This happens especially with childern, since their brains are underdeveloped and therefore, they do not have an own opinion, they will be amazed by the ads and will ask their parents to buy them that ceratin product.
Since the child is not able to watch this ad without being influenced by it and since it happens without them knowing, it is fairly reasonable to assume that ads should not be allowed.
Now it's not like the companys are secretly planning on brainwashing the viewers, however, they are certainly thinking of ads that will influence the viewers.
However, is it even a bad thing when children are being affected?
They have parents that hopefully have a mind big enough to tell if the product their children want is actually needed.
If it is, they will buy it.
But that's not a bad thing.
If they didn't buy it from the company the ads belong to, they would by it from another company and for god's sake there are enough companys that produce shampoo.
And when they see an ad, they will buy the product introduced in the ads, after all, that is why companys produce ads, otherwhise no one would know of their product.
All in all, I think television ads directed at young children should be allowed if the parents are overlooking the whole thing and decide whether it's a good idea or not.
And if not, let the children be happy with the product they get.
I was not the one to phrase the words of wisdom: "Naivety is a fool's blessing" or " Ignorance is bliss" but I would certainly use them here.
Young children are not able to handle their own money, much less to make smart decisions.
So why should commercials directed specifically to them be allowed?
It doesn´t even seem logical.
Advertising teams know what they are doing.
They make research and tests on different age groups in order to find their weaknesses and strengths, in order to get to know how to get exactly into their minds so they can sell their products.
Does this not sound at least somewhat dangerous?
It is known by the people that work with children and advertisements, that these are very influential to the vulnerable minds of children.
They are greatly moved by a number of things that we might call simple, and these could potentially create mentally disrupted adults later on in life.
Since the main point of advertisements is usually to sell something, companies and their advertisers will stop at nothing to convince a small child to believe that they need their product.
This could potentially lead to harmful images, texts and ideas being put on screen and therefore directly into the minds of the children.
This is something that can not be easily controlled (if it could even be), and could influence in a negative way a child, or even a whole generation within a country, or perhaps, with a sufficiently big company, internationally.
Do we really believe that it is the best choice to put our children, and the future of our world, in the hands of people who only have their own interest and benefit in mind?
Is it really worth it?
In conclusion, I believe that televised advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed under any circumstances, due to the potential risks that this could bring, in contrast to the little good that it could make.
Parents, not advertising, should be the ones to have the major influence over their children, not advertising teams from companies that only want money, and will not regard the ethical lines that exist when it comes to selling something to children.
If television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not allowed is a very controvers topic, which gained more and more meaning over the last years.
There are many things children of the age of two to five are not able to understand, yet.
The most advertisments for children this young might be more for food and toys.
With this comes a problem for all the parents.
Kids, that see an advertisement do not look for the food itself, they will look for the sound and the colours of the advertisment, and the most advertisments are not about healthy food.
Also advertisments for other shows on the channel might be not a good thing.
It will happen that they want to watch one show after the other.
If they see what cool looking show will come after the show they just watched they do not want to quit, and kis should defenetly not sitting in front of the TV the whole day.
For companies this might be a good marketing strategy, even if the children can not buy anything by themselv.
Kids will see their food advertisments and if they like it, they will beg their mothers to buy it.
And everybody knows how pickheaded a little child can be.
It might also cause an unrealistic way to think about money and its meaning.
For them kids are way more easier to influence than adults or teenagers.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children is not a good thing.
I rather want my kids playing outside, where they will hurt themselve from time to time than getting this brainwashed.
Many parents underestimate the influence a TV and advertising can have for a child.
And as a parent I would not like to have always a fight with my children over what food they would like to eat.
I would want them to grow up healthy and raised by someone who knew what he is talking about and not by what they have seen at the TV.
Sadly advertising directed toward young children is already a thing, which is not regonized by too many parents.
Some parents use the television as a grandmother or somebody who looks after the children, when they want to have some free time.
Other parents do not allow their children watching TV because of bad influences and so on.
Especially in Christmas time you can see more and more Television Advertising directed torward young children.
But should that be allowed?
Television advertising might be a good way to show new great toys to children.
But the TV or actually all modern media influence the childrens life more and more.
Even children in primary school or kindergarden have an own mobile phone or a TV in their room.
Some of those children begin to live in a very different world, wanting to be like the famous singer or actor.
Children between two and five are easier to convince, so they are somehow a present for the advertising industry.
After watching those television advertising they start to ask their parents "Could I get ..." and most of all mothers are not able to say no.
Children start to be not that creative are influenced, start to compare themselves to the children in the add or to children who have this new great toy.
In my opinion there is no way to forbid television advertising toward young children.
Industry will find another way instead of television advertising.
Somehow it starts in the supermarkets with all these colourful sweets and famous Disney princesses on the food.
We are not able to close our eyes and the young children's eyes as well.
I think there are also enough channels exspecially made for young children without television advertising.
In this young age parents watching TV together with their children is a good opportunity to controll what they are looking.
When the children get older parents are not able to protect them from all these influences.
The most important thing is a good and healthy way to deal with the television advertising.
Children have to learn even when they are between two and five that the add industry wants you to buy everything.
And parents have to show their children that it is not possible to get everything but to be happy as well.
Television advertisement has always been very important for different companies, but nowadays there are a lot more people watching television, including young children.
A good advertisement can have a big influence on people and an impact on companies.
On one hand I think it is okay to direct television advertisements toward young children, because every company does its best to earn as much money through products or offers as possible.
If parents don't want their children to be influenced by television advertising, it is their job to educate them and to maybe not let them watch television as often.
To be honest, i don't think that television advertisements can have an impact or influence on a child at that age, because they probably don't understand everything the advertisements talk about.
Young children aren't able to buy something on their own, so it's not a big problem if they see products on television that they want to buy.
On the other hand not only products are shown on television.
Children should not be confronted with advertisements at a young age because I suppose it can have an impact on their thinking.
Advertisements also influence a teenager's mind by always showing skinny people or the newest trends on television.
If young children already get to see these things on television and hear about different problems, they grow up with it and they immediately think the same way if their parents don't educate them differently.
To sum it up, I don't agree with the statement because I feel like it's the parent's job to educate their children and to show them the things that are important in life.
Parents can let their children think that the advertisements  don't always tell the whole truth and that they only let us see the things they want us to see.
There are many advertising in the TV today and pretty many of these advertisments are for little kids.
Today the young kids from 2 to 5 are often allowed to look TV on kids channels where they look Spongbob or other films.
So the TV channel show more advertisments wich get more attention from young kids who are intersted in these Produkts that are presented.
The kids now want the produkt that is presentd but they do not know how expensive it is because the parents would buy it for them so they do not mind.
The kids start to ask their parents if they can buy the shown produkt and do that the whole time and maybe they would cry for it so the parents are like under pressure to buy that produkt because their kid do not stop asking them to buy it.
So the advertisments can put the Parents that much under pressure that the produkt will be bought and it does not matters what quality the produkt have or how expensive it is.
If the parents are not able to buy the produkt because the price is to high the kids would maybe do not like their parents that much or get very mad because they have nothing to play with.
On the other side watching tV for kids could be a good thing too.
They can talk about the films they watched with other kids and learn speaking.
Also the kids learn maybe new vocabularies or humor from the films they watched.
Another point is that the kids get entertaind by the TV or the Advertisments wich is pretty important these days because often the parents do not have that much time for the kid and it is alone at home.
It is good too that the channels for kids just show advertisments for them so they do not watch advertisments wich show horror scens so the kid will not be scared.
So i think that Tv is acceptabel for kids becuae they can learn thinks from watching and get entertaiend.
The only prblem is tht the parents get under prssure by their kids but i think the parents have to be strong there and do not feel with the kid and buy the produkt everytime the kid asks them.
Advertising for young children
It seems like a lot of children in families have the same problem.
The kids watch too much television and thus the spare time of the kids flys away.
One major problem besides the fact that there is too much cartoons is that there is a lot of advertisment between the diffrent episodes.
Those advertisments aren't boring for the children because they advertise either toy or the following episode.
So instead of going outside with their friends, the children stay at home and keep watching television also most of the time the children want that specific toy which they have seen in that advertising.
Thus the mother or the dad has to buy it otherwise the kid won't stop asking them to buy it.
Let's assume advertising directed toward young children would not be prohibited.
Than it would be still the same like it is now.
The children would not waste their time watching the advertisments and would rather go out and play something with their friends.
So without advertising directed toward young children, the families would save money and the children would go out more instead of watching television.
In my opinion it should be the same like it is now because it seems like we have a balance between families and children which are positive and negative influenced of advertisments from the television.
In a time periode of consuming and buying, is advertising in television and other medias a vital thing.
The more people you can reach with your advertising about your product, the bigger is the amount of money you earn.
Now the question is,if television advertising should not be allowed to young children in age between two to five?
At first, this kind of prohibition would be a nice protection for the innocent little childrens.
But in the opposite a big part of costumer would missing there.
Kids, especially in age two to five, make a huge part of the potential consumers.
Another aspect is that the children can grow up without any bad influence.
The Television is like a big irritation machine.
Too much information for this little brains.
It is like a kind of manipulation, the big companys give the direction how the kids should play and life.
But finally everyone should make his own thouts about this statement.
In my opinion this idea were a good thing for protection the new genereation but all in all a big fail for our economy.
Regarding the statement "Television advertising toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
I want to make my opinion clear in the follwing essay.
I do agree with this statement, since television advertising can be very aggressively pushing and there are real geniuses developing always new ways of manipulating the human mind.
I do not agree that it should be forbidden to advertise for for example clothes for these children addressed towards their parents, though.
Grown up people and even older children who are further developed have to deal with this, because advertising in general is not a bad thing, just not for children who are not ready to judge and order these situations.
As the children get older, with their personal development they will also learn how to deal with aggressive advertisements and there is no way of "protecting" your child of advertisements everywhere it goes, since there will be advertisements on most ways it will go, regardless whether it is the way to school or to the supermarket, we see it all the time.
But advertisements in the television are not as hard to ignore as outside the supermarket, because a jumping, colored little guy with his voice bursting of excitement is clearly more catchy than a "salad, now -50%".
Psychologists are powerful people in this society, since they can practically manipulate people with the researches they did and science being so progressing.
Opposing that, we have children of approximately three years who do not even fully know what they are doing and just want to have fun watching television while being confronted with the result a mastermind of advertisements created.
I do not really think this is fair.
Concluding, I think addressing television advertisements toward children aged from two to five years should be forbidden, to simply save them in such a helpless phase of developing.
Nowadays, it is normal that also children at a young age are confronted with diferent media, for example, telvision.
But is this really the right way to educate a child or just a way to keep it busy?
Of course, for many parents television is a great help in everyday life.
Often, parents have to work much, especially in an era where it is normal that both parents work.
But, at the same time have to watch their child.
If the child watches television, it is of course much easier to handle things, because, the child is quiet and doesn't disturb.
Nevertheless, televion can also have bad infulences: For instance, it is much harder for children to understand life in a community, if nobody talks to them or plays with them anymore.
They therefore get isolated and don't understand the rules on that a community is based on.
On the other hand, you could say that television can also help children to understand life and to get educated.
Nowadays, there are many programs that teach specific things in live on a level wich is made for children.
Still, it stays a machine and is not a human being, so that it isn't the same as if the mother explains them to her child.
Referring to this, the child might feel very alone and sees television as the only sense in life or thing that counts.
This can lead to a strong need of television which is very dangerous if it gets stronger thouought the years.
Also, on television many things are shwon that are not specificly for children.
Many programs for adults show torture and other strong actions that are exaggerated and don't show reality.
This might lead to a wrong picture of how the world works and can therefore be very dangerous.
Furthermore, it is proven that children who get in much contact with television or computers, are not as smart as children who spend their time playing outside or reading a book.
Because of the electronic waves, the brain gets infected.
So, it is proven that if you spend too much tiome being confronted by electronic media, you will get sick over time or at least won't be as competitive as you could have been without the media.
To sum up, I come to the conclusion that television in general isn't a bad thing, also not for little children.
But, you should be very careful what the child watches and how long.
Television can also lead to danger for the child, phsically and pscycologically.
If television is the only thing the child learns to know, this can influence its live in an extremely bad way.
From time to tiime, it might be helpul and also has the impact that the child learns how vto behave in a world that is leaded by eletronic media.
But mainly I would say that television has more bad influences on little children than good ones, as you can see in my argumentation.
My proposition is to focus more on the child itself, so that it feels loved and not just to keep it quiet so that you have less work, because with a child there comes the duty to educate it right.
Education depends on the parents.
Following, a freedom of advertising should be guaranted because the parents should know what their children should watch on TV or buy at the gasoline station.
Especially when they are under 5 years old they have to be watched.
The government cannot take a part of the responsibility of education from the parents away.
A law in this direction would be a statement against the liberty.
Furthermore, it would mean that the governemtn does not trust its parents, the people.
Television advertising should concern every group of consumers how they people behind want that.
Clearly, children are more affected by advertisment than adults.
They do not have the ability to evaluate as much impressions than the adults yet.
Although, the adults are not resistent against commercials too.
The opposite is the case.
Moreover, the advertisment for products which are thought to be used by children concern in almost every case the parents.
The parents buy the toys or the shampoo with the unicorn-smelling foam.
The interdiction of advertisments conercing the under five year olds would not satisfy the needs of its initiants.
They want more than that.
Whats next?
Will it be forbidden to make television advertisments for people over 65?
The children should better go out instead of watching TV.
The best weapon against television commercials for children is a playground.
We all know the feeling.
The feeling of being in charge of children and having to look after them so they're protected without us hovering over them.
Helping a person become a grown and able human being is quite the responsabilty.
It's a feeling of power and uselessness at the same time.
A lot of parents disagree on where to draw the line on situations that might change a childs perspective or behaviour.
Situations like television advertising are escpacially controversial.
Some Mothers and Fathers say that ads that are directed towards small children should not be alllowed because they create an unnatural urge to buy things that aren't necessary for life.
That this urge could cause finacial problems that follow the childrens life until they die.
The CEO of the Ellison Advertising Agency, Clayton Ellison, disagrees very strongly.
He says that children of that age were not capable of understanding these ads the way we adults do.
Children could not evolve an urge to buy things until later in life and that these ads were simply to show different toys that they could select.
A study of the University of Oxford proved the opposite of Mr. Ellisons theory.
Psychologist tested children and their behaviour befor and after watching television ads for toys.
The study also documented the later life of children that watched or didn't watch television ads.
The results state that televions ads do in fact have an influence on the later life and a persons finacial status.
Children that watch televions ads are more likely to have money problems and an excessive consum later in life.
In my opinion
In the following I am going to analyse whether televison advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
In this time televison advertising plays a big role in our community.In young ages children were confrontated with televison advertising, although they often understand nothing.A big disadvantage is that children were often manipulated with televison advertising.
When they see a product in the televison they often wanted to have these products for christmas or as a birthday present.
As a result they often get angry when they do not get these products.
Furthermore the parents have to pay a lot of money for some of these products because they wanted to make their own children happy and not sad.
On the other hand televison advertising could be an inspiration for the children.
Maybe the parents have not enouhgh money for these products but the children and the parents find together a solution to get an other product.
Instead of buying a playhouse you could biuld one yourself or you can buy a fottbal with no brand instead of a football of Adidas.
In my opinion Televison advertising should not be allowed for young children.
Children need to form their own creativity and should not be able to buy some expensive things.
Young children should not be able to watch to TV that long.Furthermore they should only watch children TV channels where advertising plays not a big role.
In my youth I was confrontated with television advertising and also wanted to have the cryziest things which often were very expensive.
Today I am glad that my parents did not buy me everything.
In the following I want to explain why television advertising is not good for lillte children.
On the one Hand children in this age are in a really important developement.
They look at their parents and copy their behavior.
The advertising at the TV is often extremly overdone.
But the children think that it is reality.
But it isn't.
They can't understand what is fiction and what is real.
I think children in this age although need no TV for a good developement.
Furthermore they need social contacts in kindergardens and the love of their parents.
The parents have to give them a way to go.
Then they get older they also could look TV.
The advertisiung is also not good because the children want their parents to buy more toys.
And they could be sad because they realise that they're poorer against the other kids.
On the other hand I can say, that the TV advertising is not important if they look TV ad.
or not.
They woun't understand anything.
They don't know what the advertising want from them.
The advertisising is also very good for the economy.
They get more money.
And the people getting more jobs.
All in all I think that young children shouldn't look more TV than 30 minutes per day.
But the advertising is the same bad as the normal TV show.
Children should play outside and go into the kindergarten.
But advertising shouldn't be forbitten.
It is important for our industrie and for our economy because the parents buy more toys for their children.
Once upon a time not long ago there was a girl.
Her name was Rose Van Wood.
She'd  just finished High School.
One day she got a letter from a special college.
The name of the college was HellDeep.
In the letter they told her that she's a special teenager and that HellDeep is made for those special Students.
She was so excited and couldn't believe that she made it.
The next day was the first schoolday in college.
Rose couldn't sleep because she was to excited for this new special school.
At 8:00 am a big yellow bus stood infront of her house.
She took her schoolbag and her jacket and went outside.The inside of the bus was quiet normal and it didn't felt special.
She sat down and waited.
After the bus picked up some other students the bus driver warned us to stay in our seats and put our seatbelts on.
Suddenly the bus started flying.
She couldn't believe what happend but it just felt right.
Then they arrived.
The school looked big and modern.
A guy appeared and made a tour with them on the campus.
He was quiet cute tall with blue eyes and she thought she could have lost herself in those eyes.
After morning lessons they finally had lunchtime.
She thought about her class and she really liked them all but there was this one girl, Raven.
She wasn't the yellow of the egg but it went.
Rose took her vegan avocado-chicken wrap and she just wanted to start eating but this other girl Rave came to her and took it away from her.
Rose was so perplex but she knew this girl should be her new best friend for life.
Advertising has always been a crucial part of marketing.
If you want to sell your product, you have to advertise it properly.
A topic that is frequently discussed when talking about advertising is to what extent it should be allowed to influence the potential buyers.
For example, publicities where you only show a delicious looking bottle of coke for a fracture of a second have been prohibited, because they influence the consumers only on a subconscious level.
A common statement is, that advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
This essay will outline, to what extent one should agree or disagree to this statement.
Young children don't know much of the world.
They haven't yet developed an ability to think critically.
This explains why it is so easy to impress them.
A child might see a toy that is looking great in a publicity on television, what immediatly causes the child to develope a desire for this product.
The imagery featured in advertising can often be misleading or even wrong, which leads to very high expectations towards the product.
These expectations are probably going to disappoint the child in the end.
On the other hand it can be argued that because these children are still very young, the influence that television advertising has on them might be much smaller than we think.
Young children will only look at the imagery instead of the content of the publicity.
Because of this, it really is not clear how big of an effect advertising has on them, and the parents should also control the television habits of their children.
They will know what's going on and can talk and explain things to their children.
In conclusion, we can say that advertising directed towards young should not be prohibited, because there is no real reason to belive that these children will be damaged by wrong expectations and influence of the subconscious.
The parents will notice it if their child is influenced in a wrong way, and then they can just take them away from the TV.
Even if childs are influenced to make their parents buy something because of advertising, they will just make another experience when they are disappointed, that might teach them something for life.
We all wait what is happening next and... "Buy the new Playmobile sandcastle..." Advertising!
My family and I watch the new Disney movie but now there is an advertising break.
While the rest of the family is just annoyed by the advertising spot and does something else, my four years old sister keeps watching TV.
Her eyes stick on TV and follow fascinated the new Playmobile advertising spot.
But should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
In my opinion television advertising toward young children should not be allowed.
Some people might say:" television advertising has no bad influence on the little children so why should there be no television advertising towards young children?"
But I do not agree.
Young children are very easiely manipulated.
In their young age they can not seperate between good our bad choices and what impact they may have.
They think the adukts are always right and when they want to be like someone they just need the same things.
The same toys.
The same clothes.
So when my little sister sees the happy pretty girl playing with the Playmobile sandcastle she wants the Playmobile sandcastle.
Not because she likes sandcastles.
My sister wants the Playmobile sandcastle to be like the girl in the advertising spot - pretty and happy.
She gets a wrong idea of happyness and beauty and can not accept who she is because she feel incomplete.
So I think television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because young children are too easiely influenced.
They get the wrong idea of happyness and beauty and can not accept themself.
We live in a world full of advertising.
But is every kind of advertising really necessary?There is a big debate about if or if not tv spots towards young children should be allowed.Television advertising is a economical methode and should have nothing to do with the education and process of growing up from children.
On the one hand children in the age between two and five are not able to understand the reasons or messages which a television advertising wants to give.
However it is a try to influence their parents.
Therefore it has nothing to do with children themselves and should be allowed.
There are surely as many parents or adults watching children channels as young children.
Watching television is nothing new for the youngest generation of today so television advertising is not eather.
On the other hand children should not watch a lot of television in that young age.
It affects their mental growth and gives them a huge amount of informations which they do not really understand.
The aim of an television advertising is to give as much informations as possible in as little time as possible.
Most advertisements are also an economical methode to get people to buy the things which were able to be seen in the advertisements.
But a lot of experts say that economy should not be everywhere.
In my opinion young children should not watch a lot of television in general.
Television advertising is an economical methode and should have nothing to do whith the education of our children.
I think that there should exist television channels for children without television advertising even if it does not afecct them in a dramatic way.
Young children aged under six are very manipulatable.
If you tell them the story of the easter bunny they probably will beleive you.
If they see a advertise  they would beleive everything what is sait and shown in that spot.
Companies which produces toy do want to catch the childrens atention in theyr advertising.
Why shouldn't it bee allowed to show children some advertising.
As it was said, toy-companies also want to get attention on theyr products.
Obviously everyone who is a teenager or older whouldn'g give any antention on such spots, so they had to show them to small children.
Thats just the since of advertising, When a little child sees such a advertise and they like the sertain product, they want to have it.
They will tell their parents how cool the product is and the parents doesn't have to search long for a christmas-present.
So why not?
There ar some peoples that want to buy and own nearly everything.
That begins almost in the childhood.
When the parents of a child buy them everything they want, i's going to bee normal for that child to get everything what it wants.
That all begins with advertising.
When a child sees something it wants.
it will stress the elders as long as it will get what it wants.
If the parents are annoyed enough, they will buy it the toy.
And if that goes on long enough the child once will be such a collector.
That all wouldn't happen if there were no advertising for children, or if the parents were strictenough and doesn't buy theyr children everything, or if the childrens woudn't whatch tv the whole day.

 Bad influence through only watching TV by young children



It is good or bad if our kidz watch TV when they are two until five?
What do you think about this issue?
There are some advantages, but more disadvantages aren´t there?
On the one hand there are some positive aspects about watching TV at a young age.
Which?
One argument is that children are able to learn something if they sit next to their parents during a news show.
Remember that children can hear a lot although you not always notice that.
For example, kidz hear some new words,other voices or they watch interesting and important pictures.
Another good aspect is the variety.
This means that children have different activities in their freetime.
They don´t only play with "old stuff", dolls.
"Stattdessen" they watch a nice and informative TV show about dolls and learn from it.
Nearly everybody should know famous Disney movies like german shows called "Barbie".
Watching TV at a young age is very good, because everyone should go with the media and digital world.
If Children often watch TV, they will maybe lear how the technology works.
There are kidz, like a realtive young child, who are able to play with a Tablet and he knows how you come from the offline modus to YouTube and starting movies.
But on the other hand the negative argumnets and facts are more than the positive ones.
If young children watch a lot of television, leeds this often to become "dumb" or lazy or beeing a passive person.
Why?
Children will sit in front of the TV and only watch on the display, without talking to other people or doing something by themself.
Furthermore children can become more and more passive in they later life if they watch too much TV.
You should also think about the fact, that it is very important, that young children communicate a lot!
They have to learn to speak and talk and laugh.
Some "Wissenschaftler" write and talk a lot of this fact, that it is important that children at a young age should improve and "ausbilden" they feelings and emotions.
Otherwise that won´t be there when they are older.
These can get problems about expressing themselfs.
Why should young children aged two to five watch TV if there are a lot of more interesting activities are?
Playing with friends or making a trip with their families is better and more interesting.
Young children should learn and become advertised from they parents at first, mostly and mainly.
All in all you can say, that television advertising directed toward young children aged two to five should not be allowed because of these and more other good reasons.
If a television advertising directed toward young children aged two to five should be allowed is a topic which is very discusted.
People say, that it should be forbidden, other people say, that it would be an advanatge.
The advantage is the possibility to learn much arlier and to get a better education in life bacause of learning much earlier.
Kids could identify thereselves in young years, so that they could grow up much better and much faster.
The reason which totally agerees to this is the television program for young kids.
If it wouldn´t makle sense to let kids aged two to five watch the TV, there wouldn´t be this television program.
On the other hand it´s not a good thing, to grow up with technical stuff like the television.
The earlier the children get to use these things, the more they use them in later life.
That´s on the one hand of course an advantage for the economy, but it´s not a good way to grow up.
Children need to learn about and with ways of natural learnung methods.
Everybody parents need to decide of their own, if he wants to let the children watch the TV, so it shouldn´t be forbidden.
But how could you control this?
That wouldn´t be possible.
That´s the reaason, why this is a totally confusing idea.
The best way is to let the parents have the freedom to dcide wether they weant their kids watching the TV or not, so that everybody can decide of his own.
All in all you can say, that watching the TV with 2 or 5 years isn´t good, but forbidding that is a bad idea, bacause it wouldn´t be even possible.
I think that children from two to five could be too much influenced by this advertising.
They are too young to realize advertisements as advertisements.
They are often trapped by the slogans or the things named by the concerns in the advertisement.
But there are also much influenced by there parents.
They could pay more attetion on what the children is watching and could maybe explain them the reasons of advertisements and why they are made this way.
So the advertisements could be explained or by the parents to make it more easy for the children.
It also would help to just talk about the things they just saw in TV.
I think that this kind of advertisemnet should be forbidden, because young children have no real mind and are influenced by too much thinks they still don´t know good enough or they don´t learn how to do with advertisemnets.
The parents also should pay more attention on what the children are watching on TV or just start to explain, how advertisment is working to give them the chance to realize what they are watching.
But I would be very hard to stop concerns produce this kind of advertisemnt, because the would lose huge amounts of money.
So maybe the best steps are to make the advertisments more understandable for young children and to slowly start to stop producing them.

_|(<<Viel Spaß beim korrigieren!>>)|_
Whether advertisements by television should be allowed to be shown to children between the age of two 2 five is an often discussed topic.
In this essay I shall explain why it should or why it should not be allowed.
Children between the age of two to five still lack the ability to differentiate between righteous and bad advertisements that advertise products.
What I mean by that is that children at that age do not know, if what is said during the advertisement is true or false, therefore lack the ability to judge if they should believe what was said or not.
On the other hand children who are still as young as two definitely shoul not be allowed to watch television all by themselves at all.
It is the parents job to help their children at deciding what to believe and what to ignore.
That could cause future adults to become too naive which would result in them believing whateve lie they are told.
Another aspect is that in today's society it is important to find customers at a young age in order to transform them into possibly future customers who would help the organizations keep up with the market, that might include using cheap tricks such as promising them things that they cannot keep.
As stated above the children are not able to recognize those cheap tricks and might really be tricked into believing that whatever is said in advertisements must be true, which certainly is not.
Another great example are toys for young children that in television look amazing and seem to work perfectly fine.
Sadly, thanks to my own experience, most toy reclams in television are so heaviliy modified that children are extremely disappointed by the fact that their toy does not work as well as previously advertised.
However, not all advertisements are bad but most of them show us what kind of new products are being developed which certainly is not bad at all.
Thanks to advertisements we are able to decide between various products of the same type for example cosmetics.
Thanks to them, you might actually find something for your health that you have been searching for for a long time, which is actually good.
As a conclusion to whether television advertising should be directed towards young children aged five to two or not, I would prohibit that for the sole reason of children not being able to judge what is the truth and what is not, as many products on the market are just a way to scam people that are too naive and belive anything you tell them.
Stopping that would certainly lower the amount of people buying products that do not keep what they promise which would filter out the bad products that circulated thoughout the market.
I wouldn´t say that advertising toward young children shouldn´t be allowed.
On the one hand it is true that young children aren´t that grown that they are easy to manipulate and advertisings are doing that.Also the  children will mostly say that they want this product and tell their parents to buy it.
These were all negative aspects,but on the other hand you can say that it doesn´t harm anyone, because the children aren´t allowed to buy something, so they are dependent on their parents to buy the products they want.
In this case the parents are less dangered to manipulation by advertising than their children and so they should know which product could come quiet in handy and which not.
In addition to that, the negative point of that children will tell their parents to buy the stuff, could also have a positive effect.
Because of that the parents could know which  kind of toys they want the most e.g they like Lego more than Playmobil.
All in all i would say that it doesn´t harm the children or the parents in a very bad way, but it should be made clear regulation for advert-campaign by not telling lies to take away possibilities of manipulating the children in a bad way.

Viel Spaß!
:) (HAVE FUN )
We live in a world that is pretty much controlled by advertising.
We get in touch with advertising everywhere.
Wether it is on the street,on the internet or while watching television.
Now the question is if it should be allowed to make these advertisings directed toward young children.
My first thought to these theme was: Yes, why not?
Because I do not remember myself watching television at this age.
So I figured that parents could just not allow their children to watch television like my parents did.
The problem would be solved.
But then I realised that nowadays children do watch television at this age.
And they get manipulated by advertising.
A good exemple for this manipulation is that advertising directed to little girls are often very pink and very "ladylike".
Advertising for little boys are often colored blue or just dark.
They show weapons and they are often filled with violance.
And that is how they get pushed into our societys gender roles.
Children at this age are easy to manipulate.
So in my opinion advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.
Of course you do not have to watch it but you cannot ignore it.
Because sooner or later you will come across advertising.
And just not watching television is not the solution.
I have to say I do not appreciate advertising towards young children but I think we need to get alongwith it.
That is how this world works.
Why do we think how we think?
If we look at our past, our childhood we get remarkabel influences in evereything that we do or watch or even not do.
The question is where the strong influences come are.
Television is today a big part of our and our childrens' lifes.
Younger children are stronger in focus then ever before.
my question is should it be forbidden to focus on younger, mostly faster influenced children?
Younger children are fast and for a long period of time influenced by movies and other things they watch in TV.
Their parents role as the "bigest" part of their life and the ones which wach for the right place they get in society is more and more endangered by the things they watch in television.
If you take at look at this point of view we probably should not allow this sort of advertising.
But if you change the spot on the pleasure the children have if they watch TV and what they can learn by watching those hidden advertisments which their could never learn them because they simply do not have so much resources financaly and of time.
My personal opinion is split up.
One way I think advertising is "parents thing" on the other side they often do not have time to learn their children everything they have to now for their futur life.
So I would not change anything.
The parents have still enough influence on their children and I think it will never change.
My generation already had television and advertising trough it and we did not become so wrong to say it would not allow the same for the following generations.
The television is a big influence in almost everybody's life.
Many of us watch television everyday included young children.
In television advertising they are many unfiltered and uncensored informations.
Television advertising directed toward young children is not good for the psychical health of the kid's.
Firstly, young children aged two to five should not watch television on a daily basis or even better, not at all.
It's not good for their creativity and there are many ways to spend the day better and healthier.
In front of a television nobody makes friends or learns new skills like jumping of a swing in a park.
There is so much that gets lost of life if they are in the same room all day long.
It is a huge hype to let the children in front of a television with some snacks and a soft drink instead of giving them something healthy and going to a playground or in a park that is not a good childhood.
The second argument is that the advertisement in TV's is often pervert or just for the eyes of an adult.
Children that see this kind of advertising may do not understand them or really get them but their brain is like a big sponge and gets all the information even if it can not deal with them.
It influences them more than many people think.
It is critical to let the children watch all this stuff and not to care about what they do understand and what they do not.
Lastly, in many television advertising they give a wrong picture of something.
If little kids see them all the time they are going to believe everything the advertiser says and preaches.They are going to want everything they see and that is stress for the parents too.
There are many grown-ups that get addicted to buying things from television advertising.
It is sad that this is the bigger problem than children that get influenced everyday by bad campaigns and bad deals between the newest episodes of Winnie the POOH.
To sum up, small children in such a young age should not be watching television advertising at all.
It is acceptable to watch television if they watch a movie or something that is made for younger people without any advertising.
It is really frustrating to see that more and more children do not go outside to play with their friends and become a television addict without even watching a good program but advertising.
It would be so easy to not watch advertisements at all bur people are so lazy and they often do not care.
However this can not be healthy and can not be good for a childrens psychical health at all to watch television advertising this young.
A lot of children spend most of their free time watching television and with that a lot of advertisement.
The companies soon realised this and started to make advertisement specifically for children.
Studies show how the mind can be subconciously influenced by advertising and to make such advertisements for children is a rather dangerous thing, because the brain of a child is yet to be fully developed.
Being less responsible than their parents, the children often go to their parents to beg for the advertised product.
Even if the product is absolutely no fun to have or play with, the children will believe it is if the advertisement makes it look like it does.
Some companies have made advertisements where the sound has a higher frequency which only the young children are able to percieve and so delivering a subconcious message to the children without the parents noticing.
The parents are the ones who buy the pruduct in the end, but it is the children who are used by the companies to sell them.
Using young children without the right judgement to evaluate the product is unethical and is a mild form of child slavery.Although the children are not forced to do anything against their will, the companies make them believe that what the children want is their will, but in reality it is just the advertisement controlling them.
Brainwashing children and taking their freedom of choice just for more profit is morally wrong and should not be allowed.
Television advertising, an industry involving a lot of money.
It makes sense to advertise products for all ages, but is it okay to direct it toward young children?
Can they distinguish between "it is only an advertisment" and "it is real" yet?
This essay will give reasons for why television advertising should be allowed to be directed toward young children and why it should not.
When watching anything on tv, about one third of the time is filled with commercials.
Lots of people of all ages watch tv, including young children.
In the age between two and five, kids are easily influenced by what they see and hear and they can not yet distinguish good from bad and real from not real very well.
If a young child is watching a tv show to learn something and all of a sudden an advertisment comes on, telling the child that it needs a new stuffed animal that can make sounds, the child will likely not know that it is just an ad and it does not really need the stuffed animal.
If the advertisment has a lot of colors and music, the effect will be even stronger.
This means that the next time the child mentioned is in a store with its parents, it will definitely want the new toy.
And because it is in the age when, with a little bit of whining, it gets everything it wants, the parents will buy the product for the son or daughter.
Taking this into consideration, the advertisement should not be allowed.
On the other hand, considering the paragraph above, it can be said that television advertising directed toward young children is the best advertisement.
It is most effective because the children are still easily influenced.
As soon as the children grow older, they start to think for themselves and they will realize that the advertisements are mostly exagerated and do not show exactly how the product will be.
So if a company wants to sell a specific product, it will have the most sucess if the product and the advertisement is directed at young children.
Considering the two points of view, I agree with the statement that tv advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I think that in addition to the argument above, with the mentality of producing commercials for kids, it is expected of them to watch tv.
This is wrong in my opinion, because kids between two and five should be playing outside with other kids and should not sit inside watching tv.
Television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed, because they're easily to be influenced, brutal images and gender stereotyping.
Especially at a young age children are extremely easily to be influenced by any possible thing.
As an example, they look up to people, they want to be like them.
They see things, they are fascinated about them and soon they'll want them.
Anything could be presented on TV with some glitter, pretty colors and some catchy music, and the younger children would get hyped about it.
And many of them are likely to use the strategy "I'll just scream until my parents get me this".
This means that one of the main reasons why it shouldn't be allowed is that younf children are very easily influenced.
Another argument against television advertising towards children is that there aren't only advertisements for good and bright things on TV, there are also the bad and dark sides.
For example, there are already pretty scary toys for young children, robots, dangerous animals, aliens.
On TV they're presented fighting against each other, going to wars and killing each other.
It might seem catchy on a short advertisement, many young boys or also girls get too hyped about it.
Fight and competition shouldn't be brought to children in this way, brutal images don't have a positive effect on them growing up.
Also a very important point, why television advertsising towards younger children shouldn't be allowed is because of the usual stereotypes.
We see young girls playing with blonde dolls and pink castles, boys building roboters made out of lego or playing soccer.
We never see a boy carefully brushing his barbie's hair, or a girl kicking the ball while playing outside.
But this is a highly important point for young children, to be and become who they really are and not who they're thaught to be.
In conclusion, television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed, because they're very easily to be influenced, brutal images and gender stereotypes.
To direct children with your advertise can be very effective.
You create a dream in their little world and they will do everything to reach it.
They beg their mother and father, they think the whole day of it.
And, in fact, there can be consequences until they are adults.They loved gelly bears when they were kids.
They loved the funny pictures in TV and they will buy for themselves even gelly bears when they're standing in front of a big big sortiment.
So in my opinion it's a big manipulation behind television advertising wanted to be seen by little kids.
It's not a fair step of the concerns and it's a way to change childrens' live only to get some more money.
When children can't get what they are introduced to want, they become very sad or even mad.
It's like all the other kids around you have this special toy and only you poor child aren't able to get it.
But in the other way around I don't think that it should be forbidden.
People who are designing advert should decide on their own if they want influence the childhood of many kids.
If it is okay to drill children to like something only to have some more profit.
And if it would be forbidden: The big firmas will find another way to get what they want.
But the parents should learn to avoid to much TV-looking of the children.
They should give them an alternative: For example go for a walk in the nature and spend time with their children.
Or they play a game with each other.
So in the end I would not want to forbid advertising toward young children, but it would be great if the social environnement is organized, that the influence is very little to this young kids.
Advertising in general is already an actual topic about which many peaople have many different opinions.
We already pay taxes to whatch television so why should we pay even more with our freetime, which is used while whatching advertisements.
Obviously it is a fact that there wouldn't be as many private programms as we have now to whatch and that's why already this is a controversal topic.
Even though it is not the question already this could easily fill a whole school lesson to talk about.
But the actual topic is if advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.
In my opinion it's not about the question if it should be allowed or not.
If I was a worker in an advertising company I would need to ask myself if it is even worth it to produce advertisements towards children at such a young age.
Because normally these children are not even allowed to whach TV and when they are, I feel pretty sure that they won't focus on the advertisments.
In fact they would just focus on other stuff in their environment during the advertisments.
But there are people who could be affected by these advertisments.
For example parents or family members of children in that age who want to make a present.
But again as a worker in such a company I'd have to ask myself if it is worth it to produce advertisments for such a small amount of people who could feel affected by these advertisments.
For conclusion I have to point out that for me it's definitively not a question about allowing or not allowing.
It's about the value for the company if it's worth it to advertise it or not.
In general I would also say, that where we are able to not use any more laws about allowing or not, we should try to avoid crating them and just leave every human being doing what he feels like.
Some people think that television advertising directed toward young childeren should not be allowed.
They say that advertising for children aged two to five leads to a more developed TV programme for kids and thus also a higher risk for television addiction.
If a child for example watches TV where there are lots of brakes with boring advertising for adults, children will be more likely to stop watching TV.
But if there are lots of advertisements which kids are interessted in, they won't get bored as fast so they'll keep on watching TV.
The opponents of television advertising for young children are concerned about more children spending their time watching TV instead of playing outside which is important for the developement for a kid.
These people also fear that children will get more unhappy through advertisment.
They think that it is very important especially for little kids to learn to be happy with what they have rather than to experience a lack of consumption goods.
Others say that television advertising improves a child's developement.
They think that it's better for  children to see TV advertisments for their age than adult advertisements.
These people also say that child advertisement will lead to a better economy because more kids beg their parents to buy them the products and toys that they had seen in TV.
In my opinion television advertisement for children should be prohibited.
I think that it is important for children to learn to be happy with what they have than to experience a lack of something.
I also encourage kids to play than watching TV and I am afraid that television advertisment for kids will lead them to get more used to watching TV.
Television advertising toward young children:

Nowadays the television programs are often interrupted by advertisments.
Young children between the age of two to five often lack of experience and do not know how to interprete them.
The advertiser takes this fact as an advantage and produces adverts just for young children.
The aim of the whole process is that the children make their parents buy something, as soon as they see the product in a supermarket.
It is quite mean to produce advertisments like this, so should it be forbiden?
Personally me, I can see the problem in spaming those children with television advertisments to make use of them.
The children are so young but they actually already get to know the preassure of manufacturers.
The television advertisments give them a feeling that they have a lack of something, beacause they don't have, what the children in the television are having.
Obviousely not everyone needs such things to be happy but an advertisment always looks so nice to young children and the people in the advert always seem to be so happy so that they want to experience this feeling themselves.
It is also kind of stressfull for the parents.
For example, when you have a child which is five years old and it comes shopping with you, it maybe starts to scream out loud in public just because it saw something that was recently in an advert.
If you can't stop your children crying you maybe ponder to buy the object, just to keep your children's mouth shut.
In conclusion, the adverts aren't good for children, neither are they for the parents.
It would be the best solution to just not allow these adverts to exist.
If they are forbidden, the children are able to go into a magazin and decide on their own, wheater they are interested in something or not.
Without the influence of television advertising.
Every day when we turn on our television there is advertising.
Famous people are promoting things so that we get almost forced to buy them.
Advertising is like manipulation and should not have an affect on children, especially not on young children.
Should television advertising directed toward children aged two to five be prohibited?
Firstly, television advertising is directed toward every group of people.
Everything is getting promoted by everyone.
This is what makes the things attractive.
Because if everyone sees the same television advertising, almost everyone gets affected by it and wants to buy it.
Secondly, television advertising has not always a good influence on people.
Supermodels and actress with a body and face with no mistakes have an influence on especially young women and they are like a role model.
This is a prove that everyone is at least getting a bit influenced.
Thirdly, small children will grow up with the perfectness of life which the television advertising shows.
And even more, childrem aged two to five are not supposed to watch TV.
Furthermore, children remember a lot and if they see toys and plays every day on TV, they will always have the feeling, which a lot of human beings have, to not posses everything what they want.
So in my opinion, they should not allow television advertising toward small children.
They do not realise the affect of television advertising yet, but when they grow up, it is going to have an influence in their thinking and behavior.
Nevertheless, it is not proven, but TV makes people stupid, so I think that we should protect our children from bad influences and do something about it like prohibiting it.
If a child is difficult to handle, the parents nowadays just put them in front of the TV and then they are quiet.
It is a absolut unstressful solution.
Because this is so well-known, the television business produces loads of advertising towards the children, which are hold quiet at the TV.
In these advertisings, the children are beeing spoken to directly: They see things for example toys and afterwards they are going to stress the hell out of there parents to get these things shown in the advertising.
So it is contra-productive if the children just get more dickheads if they watch TV.
The only reason to protect children from this huge advertising business, is to do it like the old way: Never let them watch TV at all.
Just go out with the children in the forest or to the playground.
Children have to move themselve, have all the "children-illnesses" and get really tired in the evening, otherwise they are going to be fat and become autistic or they have other disturbances.
So my personal opinion is that you should never let your child watch TV advertising and do it the normal way somwhere outdoor.
I've never watched TV when i was young.
We didn't even had one.
In my opinion, the consequences of advertising toward young children don't have to be bad in general.
If the advertising has a negative result on young children does rather depend on different conditions which I will now take a closer look at.
There are probably several reasons why advertising toward young children shouldn't be allowed: Young children dont't know as many things about probable advertising products as for example teenagers.
They can usually not decide if an advertisement can be taken totally seriously or if the advertisement isn't really realistic so that some things are for example in an idiomatic meaning and can't be taken literally.
This could be dangeours if the advertisement tells you things like "this and that will make you fly, or give wings to you", because some young children might think that they will really be able to fly which can cause accidents.
Advertisements surely have a bigger influence on young children than on adults, because they don't have an own opinion about many things in life yet, so they are easier influenced and manipulated than adults, which is actually one of the goals of advertising.
There are certainly also positive things about advertisements, like for example that you get to know lots of different products, especially for children that don't have a big knowledge about the variety of things you can purchase yet.
They will notice that there are many different things also in only one area, which will probably widen their horizon.
In my opinion, advertising toward young children should be allowed.
But it's important that their parents know what kind of advertisements their children are watching, so that they could stop their children from watching things that may have a bad influence on them.
I consider it important that parents talk about advertisements with their children to explain them the differences of the things that are communicated in the advertisements and the actual reality.
I think that advertisements can even be a good thing if you watch them from a critical point of view, which is something really important to learn for the whole life.
Avertising
There has always been a great controversy about television advertising in todays society.
Although advertising through television has declined due to the rise in the online market, Television advertising is still one of the biggest markets out there.
But should there be an age limit to when companies should be allowed to advertise their products to kids?
Sales men know that the best ways into the wallets of parents are their children.
It is such a big opportunity that some advertising companies focus on children only.
But the advertisers go as far as promoting their products to even the youngest of the young.
Television shows use the time between childrens shows to capture the attention of a kid to the newest toy and then the kids bother their parents with it.
This is especially true when the kids are still too small to actively recognise an advertisment and maybe ignore it.
Also Kids want anything that they can get as soon as they see it and it looks fun.
Although it might be an unfair tactic to show advertisments right when you know there are mostly kids watching, it still is an open market and parents have to decide when to let their kids watch TV and how to prepare their kids for the constant advertising that is going on in our world.
Also this might be an opportunity for parents to show kids that they don't always get what they want and that they can't always have what they see on TV.
For my part I would not put an age limit on Television advertising.
Mostly for the reason that a parent has to decide when their kid is old enough to watch TV and when it might be better to keep their children away from it and do something else.
Television generally can be a very dangerous subject.
Children are very likely to copy what they see on tv.
But that is the case no matter if it's normal tv or advertisement.
So now we can ask ourselves is there really a difference between publicity and normal programs.
People might argue that directing the advertisement at children will destroy their imagination and influence the capitalistic behaviour of kids.
The destruction of children's imaginations is a wide spread problem in today's world.
Thousands of small children already own a smart phone and are using it several hours a day.
They can't entertain themselves anymore, they always need this little electronic device to accompany them.
But isn't it already too late to save children from electronics.
Televisions, computers and smart phones dominate our world.
Materialistic things are everything that counts in many countries.
They helped to revolutionize the modern world so many of us would be nothing without them.
So many people depend on them, they characterize who we are today.
I personally think that forbidding advertisement towards children is useless.
Even if they're not influenced by the advertisement they will still be changed by the hundreds of shows that appear on the screen daily.
So I disagree with the statement on top, I think we should redefine what electronics mean to us and start being less materialistic.






























I obsoltly agree to that statement.
In my opinion it its absolutly bad to directed televisoin advertising to very young people.
Thay are so young and are not able to have they own opinion.
They are not able to say anything against this advertising and for the parents it is bad to.
They don not want to buy this products but can not say something against they childrens.
You hvae to keep in your minde that chirdrens are absolutly more ijnfluenct by this commercial.
Atthe ende I have to say that television advertisng for young kids shoud not be allowed.
It is toeasy to influence the young kids.
On the other hand we have to say that young kids are not allowed to buy this thingd from the commercial.
But they con influence their parents.
So, television advertising direct toward young children schud not be allowed.
I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Its not okay for the young children that they are directed by television advetising because its not good for their eyes, head, heart and body.
Its better when they are doing anything else for their age and would conzentrait on thing for their age.
In this age the children want more and more television advertising and you should not be allowed this.
Probably then they will live ther life like they see in the television advertising and that doesnt work.
When you allowed that television advertising directed toward young children they will porbably learn something for their life and would see what they should not do in their life.
They will probably know how they can help anyone when the person needs help.

I agree wih the statement.
Children at such a young age are very impressionable.
Everything they see will have a lasting impact on them and determine what kind of person they will become when they grow up.
So it is the special responsibility of every human to give a child useful and age apropriate information that will help its development.
It must be decided carefully what kind of material we want our children to look at and what will be advantageous to reaching important developmental milestones.
Giving this responsibility into the hands of corporations whose primary goal it is to make the most profit is very irresponsible.
Corporations dont care about the development of children.
For them a child is nothing more than a potential customer.
So how can we trust a Corporation to make content that is helpfull and not harmfull to the childs development?
An advertisement would not give the child new insights and information about the world but would force an idea made by a corporation onto them and could potentially distort the worldview of an impressionable child to.
A young child is used to watch TV almost around the clock.
So they are confrontated with a lot of advertisment.
Now the statement was made that showing these advertisments to young children shouldn't be allowed.
A child that is aged two to five is naive and believes almost everything.
For example a child thinks that Santa does really exist, etc.
When these childs are watching an advertisment in the TV it can have an effect on that child.
These ads we are talking about are shown on channels for kids.
So these ads are dealing with childfriendly topics.
These could be about toy, horses and mostly playing with "Barbie".
These childs who are watching these ads are willing to buy those things, except their parnets have to buy it.
I think that it's good to avoid showing these kids advertisement in young age, because they have to grow up with no nonparental influence.
These children are innocent and they should have the chance to grow up like that.
television advertising is much more comfortable for the teachers.
the young children can learn and the teachers can watch.
but i think the childs don´t agree with this because they are too young.
they don´t want to watch at the television learning films they want to watch funny and real movies.
in this age the television can also hypnotize the young kids and they agree with and watch the whole film without speaking.
in this young age they must play and play with other childs.
they must learn from humans and agree with their statments.
i think they are too young to watch tlevision in this age, they must interact with humans and each other, they can play in the nature and do some activities.
they can watch a film with breaks and a teacher how say what happens.
when they don´t understand a topic, they can´t ask the television.
they must teached by humans.
when they watch filmsthey want the same thing at home and so the perents have to buy it.
and than they play not outside they play alone at home.
Television advertising directet toward young children

Nowadays nearly every child has the opportunity to watch televison and use laptops, tablets and smartphones.
On each of this electrinical devices advertising is directed toward young children.
They show the newest toys so that the children get attractet to them.
But should this and mostly television advertising be allowed or not?
On the one hand, 10 years ago children didn't watch so much television like nowadays.
So if a child, which is a lot at home, sees television advertising with toys and it despritly wants them, it could be a possibilty for the child to go and play outdoors and do physical activity.
Children had to learn to be resistent toward television advertising because in the adulthood the situation will not change.
They should learn to see which other things exists but also to say sometimes no to them.
On the other hand, it's the responsability of the parents to look after their children and to pay attention that they don't watch too much television.
Children are influented by the television advertsing, for example if a child aged five is in the kindergarden and it sees another child with the latest toys, it could get an impression of beeing lower than the other child.
It gets a wrong impression of himself and the world.
For single parents with finanical problems, television advertising could be a problem, because their children want the newest things which are mostyl very priceful and maybe they can't afford them.
So parents are also influented by advertising and are put into pressure because they want to give their children everything they desire.
In my opinion the arguments against television advertising toward young children are more important, because children are too young to decide what they want.
They don't even know that they are influented by advertising and they have no chance to escape from them because they are everyhwhere present.
Children should be more protected!
I think, that television adverts aren't good in general.
If you just want to watch TV adverts are just a bother.
You want to watch your favourite series or a good film, but at the most exiting scene they throw lots of adverts at you.
When you're old enough you can just ignore them, but a child at the age between two and five mostly can't.
So for their sake, adverts should be banned.
But it's not that easy.
You can't just ban adverts from TV.
Most free TV programms earn their munney throug these adverts.
So in order to keep broadcasting our favourite shows thei need these adverts.
So in conclusion, I think that adverts are a bother and not particular good, but the TV programms depend on them so you can't remove them from TV.
While watching TV, we also have to watch television advertising.
These advertisments often speak to a certain target group which is most likely to buy the product.
Speaking of young children as a target group, we must think of their innocence instead of only gaining money.
Firstly, it is important to mention that young children's life experience is very small compared to adult's.
In other words: Most children aren't able to differ between real interest in a product or simple manipulatin caused by the advertisment.
Which means they could become advertising victims and get the unrealistic need to buy a product.
On the contrary, the ones who actually buy the product are adults.
And adults should have got enough life experience and responsibility to say "no" to their kids when they want to buy something completely unnecessary.
On the other hand: If parents become the "bad guys" who don't buy their children happiness - because of television advertising - this state has to be considered as highly sceptical.
However, most television channels only exist because of advertisments.
And they must advertise for the specific target group that watches them.
If we stopped allowing television advertising directed towards young children, especially children channels would fade out.
As not many grown-ups watch them, they have to direct their advertising towards children.
And if they couldn't, they would either stop existing or become pay channels.
And pay channels is surely not what we want.
As a result, it is very likely that free children channels will stop existing if advertising directed towards children becomes illegal.
However, it is morally not acceptable and we should kill it.
Burn it with fire!
And make it extinct!
(Sorry.)
The question wheter television advertising directed toward young children shoulld not be allowed is complicated.
On the one hand it would be (Zensur) when you don't allowed the television chanels to show television advertising.
But on the other hand when kids for example see a toy in the television advertising thats were discribed as very cool they believe that and want one no matter how much it cost.
There we are at an next argument.
Children in this age don't know how to handel with money.
They don't know wheter it's expenciv or not they only want to be cool with the newes stoff.
Last but not least young children don't care about the danger of the for example toys.
In the television advertising it would be shown as easy to use but mabye it isn't that easy and than the children hurt themselfes with it.
To sumerise in my opinion children aged two to five aren't in that age to dicide what's good for them and what's not.
In the following text, I discribe you my own meanig to Televison for children.
I the TV are also age attentions and when you look at this you make most right.
But children have a chance to watch things, they not good for the children.
In the TV is all day and all time any to see.
Children can watch the hole day and this is very dangerous , because the children watch TV in the time, were athoere people play handball or some other thigs.
When children look news at the Televion or documentions, it can be good for the children, because they know so more actually thing about the world and about the people.
this can be very helply at the school or annywhere.
Televions aren´t so important hwo school or sport, but it´s can be a small factor.
At last Television is very different.
There are many different programms and very different shows.
Many of the shows and of the programms aren´t important, but some like a newstime or so are important in this time.And when the children watch the right things it´s very good for school and the knolge.
I think it´s ok when children watch Tv, but the parent must controll the programs and the time.
I think that young children should not watch television too much and better not at all.
They need to go outside to get friends, do some sport or just move while playing with friends.
But if they watch television they are easily to convince by television advertising because they realy belive what it tells them.
And of course it is not realy moralic to try to convince young children who are too young and naiv to realise that not everything you got told in television is true.
This might be a problem for many parents.
The kids want to have all these things and they have to buy them.
And it is not easy for parents to convince their children that they do not need all these things.
But if parents let their kids watch TV in this age they have to deal with it and also it is about to be a good parent to tell your kid that not everything in television is true.
So I think it should be about the parents how they rule their kids and not about the law to make television advertising forbidden.
Now I have to discuss abot the statement if television advertisnment directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
First of all young children, especially children aged two to five, get easily fooled by advertisement in television.
They see something what have been shown there and want their parents to buy it for them.
But on the over side if there was no advertisement for children everybody would be upset about that too so you can´t make it right for everybody.
And to be clear I also think many children at the age of two wouldn´t really understand advertisement in television because they are just too young.
And also not all children want to play with the same type of toys so that would be a big problem too that has to be solved.
In the end I can say I have no pronblem with television advertising for young children because I don´t really care.
Not offensively but I mean I don´t have to watch it so why should I care ?
While there are many arguments against whether it should be allowed for television advertising to be directed toward young children, some arguments can be found being for it.
For example after all that's what an advert is.
Ads are supposed to convince consumers to buy stuff or to have a specific opinion about something.
While young children won't be convinced to have opinions, simply because it wouldn't matter as they are still young, there are ads trying to convince them to ask their parents to buy new toys for example.
This is not bad in any way, because as said that's what adverts do, age does not matter in this case.
Also the one paying money in order to advertise doesn't care, whether childs or adults see it, as age is not of importance and the ad should convinve anyone who sees it, regardless of age or gender.
While there may be some differences, anyone can play with remotely controllable toy cars for example.
Finally the one advertising cannot control who sees the ad.
He may change the time the ad is being shown, however in some cases this can result in less people seeing the ad.
The one advertising is not responsible for young people seeing it.
So again, it's not a matter of fact whether it's directed toward young children or adults.
On the other side from an ethical point of view it's simply wrong to convince children to ask their parents to buy something.
That way, adverts can be sure of some of the stuff they're selling being bought.
They could raise the price up to a point anyone would think the product is not worth the money.
Still, because children between two to five don't have a relation to money yet, they will ask their parents and some parents will buy the product, because their kid asked them.
Furthermore other adverts are also reviewed as ethically wrong, because of categorizing.
If there's one 'bad' ad, the other ones too must be 'bad'.
In the end it's just wrong to convince young children to ask their parents to buy something.
If the product can be afforded with the money they get from their parents regularly though, it's alright for ads to do so.
Companies like Kinder Überraschung or other little cheap candies can convince children to buy them without any doubts.
That's what the money parents give their kids regularly is for.
I agree with the statement that television adevertising directed toward young children should not be allowed..
My first argument is, that there are a lot of children which are addicted to Tv or other electronical devices.
They don´t want to meet other kids or play outside, because they only want to watch TV, because they think that the TV is their friend.
Often it´s very easy for children to change the TV shows and switch to programms, which are not made for kids.
Young children get influenced easily by thing they see in the TV, for example sterotypes and bad behavior, which is often shown in TV shows.
But there are also some shows, which are made to teach them, even if they´re not in school.
These kind of shows with good informations often teach them about friendship and how to behave, but there are a lot of shows that doesn´t.
I think the best option is to let them watch TV channels without comercial, which show the shows where kids can actually learn a lot about treating others.
Their parents should watch with them as often as possible or ban bad channels for their kids.
But in my opinion children shouldn´t watch TV a lot to make sure that they don´t get a bad influence and play more outside or with their friends, because thats the better way to learn how to behave, getting friends or treat others.
The following essay talks about television advertising to young children.
Television advertising let people feel like they need this product but they didnt.
Childrean are very easy to catch with advertisment because they are little innocents without anything bad or some bad influence.
Thats why advertisment fits perfectly to children so the product will be often sold.
Televison is paid by advertisment so you cant cut the advertisment off the screen for the children because the televison need it.
Its normal to say its bad for the children but the question is "Better advertisment and TV for the children or no advertisment and no TV?"
So in my opinion its better to have advertisment and TV, because advertising is everywhere and young children are on plattforms like youtube and something like that and this pages are full with advertising so it makes no sense to cut off advertisment from the TV-Shows for children.
There are many arguments pro and contra the telivision advertising with children.
One argument contra is that mostly the parents decide their children be in the advertising and it is not the wish of the child.
The parents, who do something it that way, are very interessted in the carier of the child, so the young person doesn't have a chance to say something against it.
Also the kids have to work as hard as a normal person and can not live like a child.
They start their life in the spotlight and that is not a good thing for young children.
On the other hand some children are interessted in this world and it is fun for them.
Some of them really want to do this and their wish is to be a star.
The way is very hard, but they wanna make it because it is their dream.
In my opinion that should not be allowed because the children can not be children.
They are too young to think about that and this life, this step is mostly too hard for them.
I think, most children, who think that they really want this, say this only because it is the wish of the parents and don't know what it is like to life like a normal kid.
Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed because they want the things shown in the advertisement.
They will cry and shout intil they get the things.
But when they get it, it will become boring after a short time and the family just lost so much money on some silly things.
But it also could be allowed.
The young children wouldn't even notice the advertisement sometimes.
And they won't be shown that much on the TV.
Also will they forget what were in the advertisement.
They are very young, so they should forget the things after a few minutes.
Followed by that, children should not watch that much TV.
They should play outside or play with teir family.
They have better things to do than watching TV.
I don't see a good reason why it should not be allowed.
The children are so young they will forget so much of the advertisements and they don't watch that much TV.
They should play with their family or friends and not watch TV.
When some families have problems with it, they just need to not allow the children to watch TV.
I agree with this Statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".
Children in the age of two to five shouldn´t watch television with advertising directed to them.
If children see that, the think it´s true.
Because they often think, that what adults and older persons say is the right.
If it is with toys, the children whats that.
And they can be manpuled.
For example is KIKA, its a Kids Channel on TV, and there are only movies und no TV advertising directed toward young children.
Kids gets influence through it.
But there are some kids channels with `werbung`.
If there are toys, the kids say that they want it and so some parrents wants that they only look ´KIKA´ because they shuldn´t see the ´werbung´.
Television advertising directed towards young children is a topic I am sure about that there are a lot of different opinions.
But should it really be banned?
What could be possibly a good argument for television advertises for young children?
Children will see the commercial and probably think "Hey that toy looks like a lot of fun, I want it!".
So they will ask their parents to buy it for them.
Television advertises for children are mostly about new innovative toys.
Getting new toys will have the child to think about how to interact with it.
Which will boost is creativity.
And for today it is important that children learn how to be creativ because once being and adult with no creativity, you will be having a hard time.
Also denying the wish from the child will show that the child can not always have what he wants.
This will teach him a good lesson.
But television advertising directet towards young children is not always that good.
Let me explain why.
First of all children from age two to five are not really good at making decisions.
They lack the knowledge and experience.
When they see an advertise for toys or other attractions they will mostly want to have or experience it, because in the advertise it always looks like much fun.
And children especially want to have fun all the time.
The children will constantly ask their parents if they could buy it for them.
When they say no, it will lead to the child being angry and sad.
Becuase some children are pretty stubborn at that age, they will make the parent buy it for them.
That attitude could possibly lead to the child staying stubborn for a longt time, maybe even until his adolescence.
The child will think that if he gets what he wants by staying stubborn, he will choose to keep that attitude.
Such small things can change a lot on the outcome of a child.
Should Television advertising directed toward young children(ranging from two to five) be forbidden?
It's important for young children to develop a personality,in order for that it's important for them to discover new things.They need to gain experience and media is one way to develop themselves.
On the other hand it is also important to let the child discover things on their own.If they were to watch a lot of comercials,they would get influenced a lot and their personality might not develop as well.
Studies have shown that the media has a huge effect on a children's development, as comercials tend to be manipulating.There are also plenty of companies that abused this type of marketing towards children.Mc Donalds is one of the best exaamples of how manipulative this concept is.They attract young children by making products that include toys and when they grow up and have their own children,they also take them with them.
The most important reason why they should ban TV advertising for kids is the content.These days everything is getting sexualised and inappropriate.There are a lot of disturbing images shown on TV and parents have a hard time looking after their children.This can lead to fatal consequences,like affecting their parenting or traumatizing the child.
All in all i think the main problem is education.TV ads towards
To start of actually small children under the age of five shouldn't even be watching tv.
So it wouldn't be raisonable to have advertising dirrected toward small children.
I also think that firms should think their concept over if they think they need to advertise to small children.
Than younger kids have a different kind of thinking, they for example have problems with knowing what's dangerous and what isn't.
Wachting tv is also a kind of taking away their fantasy because you already give them a picture of brands they sould like.
Brands want to fund a connection to their products very early, than the possibility that somesone changes the product if he's already used to a special kind of product is very small.
In my opinion it's important that our society doesn't start a hype about advertisments for children.
Those small "things" are our next generation, for me it's more important that their brain doesn't get a damage of all that crap they saw on tv.
Now if I would ask you, what would your answer be if you were a firms CIO?
Would you tell me that the brain of children wouldn't be influnced by the advertisment?
Because that would be a lie and even we grownups get influnced by advertisments.
So why already start at the age of two years old?
In what kind of society sould this be normal.
I'll tell you a fact, at the moment doctors are very worried because children at the age of one and two can't talk the way the sould, they know very little words and do you know why?
It's because the parents are on their mobile phone all the time or are wachting too much tv.
So why advertise to children?
The parents are the ones who can understand what you're trying to tell them.to conclude, advertisments get even grownups hucked to a brand, it causes the lose of the fantasy of small children and it damages their brain if they even watch tv.
My personal view on this topic is that nobody sould have the right to advertise to children that's why I agree with this statement.
Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
The productmaker needs new clients.
They are making adverting for young children because they are a big group of humans.
Little children often want new things and the parents buy them the new things.
Because the children have so many different wishes, the parants are giong to buy them the most of the things that the children want to have.
The productmaker is going to make very much money, because the children want everything that is in the advertising.
The children see new things in the television and find them nice.
They can go directly to their parents and show them the advertising.
So the parents know exactly what their children want.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
The children want everything what is new in the advertising and this can be very much.
Children are very easy to manipulate and the productmaker know this.
They know, that children are going to want everything that is new and looks cool or sweet.
The children show their parents the new things and the y buy them that.
But not everyone has enough money for buying all the things from the television.
Children should be more outside the house.
They should play outside with their friends and family.
They should not looking so much television.
This isn`t good for them.
Children need to spend more time outside away from the television.
When they are more outside, the productmaker don`t need to  make so much advertising for toys.
Children shouldn`t watch television alone.
When they are looking television with their parents, they can teach the children to not wanting everything from the advertising.
Advertisinds aren`often for the right age.
They are to loud or colorful.
I find, that advertising for young children shouldn`t be allowed.
They should be more outside and play there something with theire friends.
When they are outside they can`t listen to the advertising.
In my opinion, advertising for them is not good, because they want everything.
But not all parents have enough money for buying all the toys.
That make the children sad.
Young children can`t understand the most advertisings.
They are to colourful, loud or not really for their age.
Parents must keep an eye at their children all the time.
I think children aged two to five couldn´t really dicide what is good for them, so the television advertising is not very fair because the children are realy easy to make to like something.
On the other side they are´t able to buy something their self, which means that they could only say their parents what they want on the other side this advertising is not fair to the parent because the children have no idea what money is and they arent able to dicide if something is cheap or expensive, they would only be a pain the until they get what they want.
Another argument for the advertising is that the parents don´t have to allow their childrens in that age to watch TV, its not very good for that young childrens to watch TV.
So if the parent would´t allow their children to watch TV the advertising wouldn´t be a problem.
But of course that doesent mean that television advertising directed to young children needs to be allowed.
I think it is absolutly not fair to send advertising directed toward to young children it should be forbidden, if the producer want to make advertising he should make soeme advertising for the parents they could dicide musch better what is good for their children then themselve.
Lots of people watch everyday television.
Even really young chidren spend hours in front of the tv and companies use this for advertisements for their products directed toward the young children.
Some people critize that.
In the following I am going to dicuss wether advertisements specifically directed towards young children should be allowed or not.
Marketing is a really important part of the success of a product.
Companies can sell products a lot better if they make advertisements for their products.
If you prohibite the companies to make advertisements directed toward young children at the tv they might make less profit.
On the other hand products will also be bought even if there aren't advertisements for them.
At least if they are really good or nessesary.
If there are advertisements on TV directed toward young children these children are forced to decide if they want to have the product or not.
This is really problamatic because young children aren't able to build an own opinion based on facts and real arguments.
This is the reason for which they are different laws if they commit a crime.
How could young children really decide in a good way to buy a product?
They can be easily manipulated.
The companies can use this for their advertisements.
Personally I think that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed.
I think it isn't a good idea to let young children being manipulated.
They can't decide on their own and therefore should be protected by the law.
Instead the companies can make advertisements toward the parents of the children who can already base their opinion on real raguments and aren't manipulated as easily.
Should it be allowed to watch televison for young children?
All parents can decide themself, but what are the arguments?
Young children like to play, they are developing their creativ thinking.
To be to long at the televison is also not good for their healthy.
For me, it should not be allowed.
The hobby of little children is playing, playing everywhere they are.
With food, toys, flowers, with every thing they have.
If they are only watch television, they do not play.
It is not normal.
Also because they watch to much, they can not develop their creativ thining.
They have no exercises in makeing handcrafts.
The young children watch sometimes a creativ programm, but can they do it also?
Finaly if they do not go outside, their healty will not be very well.
Children need the sunshine, the rain or cold weather to have a better immunsystem.
But not only in this aspect is waching televions not good, also if the litte ones can not sleep because of the programm they wachted.
Expecialy in the evening is not every programm useful for children.
It is not good to have nightmars because of unrealistic or horrible things.
Waching television to long is also not good for the eyes.
Still until now, we have no television at home.
I did not miss it when I was young.
I think, all parents how decide to not allowed their littel ones to watch TV do a great decision.
If I am I' am not going to allowe my young children to watch televison.
Should television advertising direct toward young children not be allowed?
It's a controversal topic.
I think it's hard to say, because there are two sides against each other.
At the beginning you have to think about the effect advertising has on young children.
They are too young to think critical about the things in the television.
They see something new and so they want it, no matter if they need it or not.
So maybe it's hard for parents to handle this.
The other point is that maybe things in the television advertising aren't so good.
Maybe they are insecure or discriminating or something like this.
Young children can't form their own oppiniion on something new, they are easy to influence.
They orientate on older people, for example the adults of the advertising.
But on the other side the children are too young to buy these things too.
When they see something in the advertising, it's hard for them to buy it by thereselfs, maybe it's even impossible.
So parents have a controll on the things the children buy.
And they even have a controll on what the children watch in the television.
So it's there task to save their children.
And for me the most important point against the banning of the advertising is that there are concerns which need to make money.
It's the fault of our society that they need to make advertising even for young people.
They need to sell lots of things and it's easier to influence young children.
Maybe it's not totally a moralic, but it's a (notwendige) thing.
So all in all I think television advertising toward young children is okay, because our society make it (notwendig).
The question if young children should be allowed to watch TV is a discussed matter, which the parents should consider and think about early.
But the Advertisement companies clearly also do have children as their target audience.
The question wether or not this is a good thing might be heavily discussed too.
The first thing to say is that mostly those advertisements quite appropriate for children.
The often do publicity for toys or dolls.
So the danger of heaving ones child wanting inappropiate things would be small, if it was only watching those publicity.
But there are other kinds of publicities, shows and series on the TV that a four year old kid should not watch.
And that is the real problem.
While wachting the shows and publicity that are meant for children, the children might get to see other things that are not meant for its eyes.
And with those child-meant-publicities the advertisement companies lure children to the TV.
What is more children will want to possess the products which are being advertised for.
So parents will have to buy the toys and dolls.
Children can develop a weak way of a shoppaholic.
And if parents are not able to afford those toys the children might get angry or maybe even bullied when the get one or two years older.
And children are already being transfered an ideologized picture of the society.
Dolls are a good example for that.
Our society nowadays is advertising for a lot of unhealthy lifestiles and trends.
Like the trend to be really skinny.
Dolls are really skinny too (e.g.
Barbie) and with those dolls children at a very young age are already confronted with the idea that the skinnier and more beautiful a person is the better it is.
This is very unhealthy.
But on the contrary there are some useful products being merchandised for.
Products which can help kids with learning the alphabet or preschool learning or even products that simplify the daily life for children who have physical ord mental issues.
So it can turn to be a good thing if children get this product.
All in all I still think that advretisement for young children is not the best thing.
Beacause children should not watch so much TV and dangers and problematic matter can come along with the publicity, even if it wasn^t meant to be dangerous in the beginning.
The opinions concerning television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) are different.
Some people think it should be allowed to direct advertising toward them and some people don't think so.
It's important to take care of both points of view.
In television advertising things are shown positively to make people buy them.
If a child watches an advertising for example for a new game, it could ask it's parents if he or her could buy it.
But there are many different advertisings on television so the children could want more an more of these things which are shown in the advertising.
In addition children should actually don't get the chance to watch TV all day.
It's important for the children's development to go outside for example or to get a good preparation for school in the kindergarten.
The advertisings are created funny and intersting for children to influence them.
The people who sell the things of the television advertising just get advantages of them.
They get a lot of money for their products beacause many parents buy them when their child asks them to.
I'm not quite sure about my opinion concerning this topic.
On the one hand I think it's okay to allow television advertisings directed toward young children but on the other hand I think it could have a bad influence on them.
There are some things in the TV that are not nessesary for children of young age.
I think it's more important to prepare the children for their future life and a good education.
Of course they should be allowed to watch television as long as it's not too much to have a bad influence on them.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
This is a very controversial topic and there are some arguments, which support this statement and also some which attack it.
First of all in my opinion television is a bad thing for young children.
If they start early with watching TV they will also start early with playing computer games or playing on smartphones and also if they can't than they'll wanna do that.
Against that you could say that in our generaton it's very important to come very early in contact with this things, because they are used way more often than in other generations before, but I would say it's not worth to spend your youth on this things and not on going outside.
Another argument against the television advertising directed toward young children is that the parents of the children will advertise their children less, if the television does that.
Also the television doesn't advertise the children in individual ways, so the indivuduality of the children will get a crushing blow, which could be a problem, because for everyone is a specific advertising the bestand also it will be hard for this children to find themselves later on.
Also the children could misunderstand the advertising of the television and become later on very bad people, because of this.
But an argument against that is that, if the children have parents which are bad people, the television will probably advertise the children better than their parents would.
All in all I would say the advertising of  young children should just be allowed in the case of bad parents or in the case that the parents are just so rare at home that they couldn't advertise their children enough.
But in general in my opinion it's a bad thing, because the children will lose their first years on the TV and not on the world outside and will get less information about their surroundings and will also make not so many friends.
In addition to that they will become not so open minded, if they just sit always at home.
A good human can advertise a child way more better than a machine could ever do.
It is very controverse issue if children should advertising directed through the television.
There are many people which thnik children should not watch television at all because they just get manipulated.
But there are also people which find it ok or a good idea when children watch television just to keep them calm or to lern things like by Dora.
At one hand many people say that telivision manipulate children and that advertising would make the situation even worse.
How often run childre after a commercial to their parents and ask them to buy this things?
Furthermore young cildren are easy to influence and thats very bad espacilly because children should rise in a safe area without any commercial influences.
At the other hand why should companies advertising parents for staff whitch is espacilly for childeren?
And is it not the responsibillity of the parents to ,,safe´´ their children from commercial influences?
So if parents do not want that their children get directly advertising by television than keep them away from it or just let them watch non advertising channels.
In my opinion it very hard to descide.
I think it is not so bad when children were advertising for things that are useful or intelligent like a shining football but it is very bad when the commercial just advertising crep which is extreamly expensive and the main funktion of the commercial is manipulate the children.
But I know that it is hard to say which things are useful and which not which are good commercial and which are bad.
We see there are positive and negative aspects of advertising children directly through television.
And that it is nearly impossible to say which is a manipulating commercial for unusful things.
Nowerdays children cannot grow up without any sort of device or television.
In many cases when children don´t get what they want, they just watch TV because this is an easy method for the parents to calm them down.
The parents can´t force what exactly their children are watching.
In some cases the children watch ads which are not really appropriate for them.
The statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
can´t be managed but it can be forced by the parents i think with the following reasons.
The televison thinks, that showing the ad is going to make the children wanting to watch the movie or whatever it was advertised for.
The children convince their parents to go to watch the movie together because they don´t want to miss it.
In the movie-breaks there are new ads which are doing exactly the same again.
They get addicted to the television.
The children watch more and more TV as they grow up.
They learn a lot from it but still the parents can´t gurantee what exactly their children are watching and the things they see is what they wantet them to see anyway.
The parents cannot control their children.
There should be a better way for the parents to control this part of TV.
One way to sort the problem could be that for money you can buy a television-programm that doesn´t show any ads.
Then parents would have the ability to see what their children are watching.
There is already some sort of ad-free chanel.
With netflix you can set in the settings that you want to have a childrens channel.
The children can now only watch children-movies.
So if parents think it is necassary for their children to have an ad-free channel, they can buy it but if they are fine with the ads they just leave it.
It is the decision of the parents what they do with their children.
In our todays life the television is a big part of our world.
We´re always surrounded by series, movies, variety shows and of course by bright, coloured, most stupid advertisements.
Everybody reacts different to them.
But how do little children between two and five react to advertisements, which are just exactly for them?
And should it been forbidden to make advertisement for such young persons?
Of course it´s not okay, to make your money with producing irrelevant stuff for little  children and manipulate them so much, that they couldn´t think about something else.
But I think, that little children do not understand, what advertising means and I actually think, I would regulating what my child watches in TV.
And I´ve got the money.
I don´t think that my little child, which absolutely hasn´t got any idea what money is, could buy whatever it wants.
I think, I would know, If my child used to have the Super bright fluffy flying Unicorn which spies Glitter, when you squeeze it.
Maybe there are parents, who are buying their child everything it wants to have.
But that´s actually not my problem.
I think, that the television advertisements for children between two to five should be allowed, because in the end the parents decide, what they want to buy or not and the children are also much to young to understand the world of capitalism.
Is it a good idea to advertising direct toward young children ?This is the question i will manage with in the following text.
one argument against this topic is that the children gets antother point of view of one topic so it could be harder to understand them.It´s hard for them when they only see and hear them  beacause the teacher could explain it better.
Otherwise the students could learn it better when they see it and doesn´t hear it from the teacher.When you have a bad relationship with the teacher it could be better for some students when they donßt have to talk them much with this teacher.
another argument that it isn´t a good idea is that the relationship between the student and the teacher couldn´t get better so you can´t speek to them when you have a problem or something else.
On the other hand when the teacher television advertising directed towards to young children they learn the right things beacause the teacher search for them to show the right ones to teach them the students.
in my opinion it isn´t a good idea and it should not be allowed because for it would be harder to understand the main topic.i think you hear lots of things and don´t know one of them are imortant and not.I also think it´s more stressful to learn it on this way.i agree with this following statement.
We all know advertising in television.
The good ones as good as the bad ones.
But we all know what theywant us to do: They animate us to buy their things.
The most of us know this by their own experience and maybe also because our parents warned us.
More or less at the age of 12 or earlier we start to make differences between what do I really need and what they want us to need.
But as child we cant make a difference.
Mostly our parents say to us that these advertisments are dangerous.
So obviously as young children we cant take decisions especially then when they are influenced by advertisments.
Because of this and the following reasons I agree with the statement.
Also because for adults advertising is not usualy a good thig.
Clear it shows us things to buy that maybe make our lifes easier.
But we should not forget why there are so manyadvertisements.
Obviously they want to make money with them.
And if people want to make money and they see an opportunity for it they are ready to make many things to get it.
For example they also dont refuse to make advertisments for young children although they know that its kind of unfair against the child as said before.
So I think that its not worth it to support such things that poison our children.
And last but not least there already exist such laws which say that its not allowed to make advertising for alcoholic beverages, because of all the alcoholics.
They argue that an alcoholic cant really controll his addiction.
So its like with little kids who also cant really controll what they want.
Kids get too easy influenced by advertising and they can hardly do anything against it.
Small children running around on the playground in hot pants and having fun- stores like H&M use advertisement directed to children.But is that oversexualised advertisement or just advertisement okay?
Should it be allowed to manipulate our small folks?
Children want what they see, it's in their nature.
So it is a natural process to want all the things the TV provides to them- toys, clothes and candy.
But this has a big influence on the rules of their parents.
Now they are more or less forced to buy their kids things,that aren't good for their health or their behaviour in the future.
Children strive things they wouldn't if there wasn't any advertisement.
Nevertheless, kids get to know all their possibilities they have.
They get to know what's new on the toy-market or what they could do with friends and family.
If their parents don't want to let them see advertisement, they could cut out the TV of their everyday life.
For me the big question is, if advertisement affects the children so hard, so they aren't capable of deciding and knowing if this is really something they want because they like it or if it's just something they want because they see it on TV.
In my opinion advertisement is a big problem in our society.
Not only children, even adults get manipulated by it and they are older and it seems like they should know what the purpose of the stores are.
In conclusion: I am against TV-advertisement- for children and adults.
The topic of advertisements for young children aged two to five is very controversal.
Some people might find advertising directed to young children completly fine and don't see a problem in that.
The children get to see e.g.
toys which they might like, so they can wish for them.
This is very helpful for the parents because this way they know what to get their children and won't buy things they wouldn't like.
But that's not the only opinion on this topic.
Others might argue, children of that age don't know what it means to spend money on certain things yet.
Even though they got something they wished for because they saw it in an advertisement, they might want something completly different the next day, after seeing something else on television.
They don't understand why their parents won't buy it for them so it will make them very unhappy.
This way the children don't learn to appreciate the presents given to them.
For me personally a reason to be against advertisements for children is that children will eventually be confronted with so many advertisements when they grow up anyways, it's important to avoid them for as long as possible.
That's  why I think, television advertsing directed to such young children shouldn't be allowed.
In the following statement I'm going to discuss whether television advertising towards young children should be forbidden or not.
It's getting earlier and earlier that  young children are confronted with media and especially the TV.
So why shouldn't there be advertises directed to this group?
The children would surely be happy about advertises that are made for them and they could perhaps identify with the acting persons on TV.
And it is possible as well that these children could find some heroes in these advertisements who are now important persons for them and maybe an aim to be like them.
Another point is that advertises are made for each age, for adults, for seniors, for teenagers.
This could be interpreted as something which is not just in comparison to the other ages.
But in my opinion these children are much too young for this sort of media or visualisation- they just don't understand the meaning and are confused.
And my imagination of a good childhood is definitely different than amusing with TV advertising.
These children should play on the playground, go outside to grow up correctly.
It is important for becoming are normal intelligent child and for their future not to watch too much TV in this time.
Even more important for me is that these young children are not consumers yet and don't make their own decisions about what to buy or not - and I think that their parents are not that much interested in these kind of adverts.
And what you shouldn't forget it that these children are well influencable and can not build their own opinion yet- and this is definitely a risk and unfaire to use them for their product.
In the end I come to the conclusion that children shouldn't watch TV with adverts especially made for them, but this should be in the responsibility of the parents like education in general.
And although I think that these adverts are very useless for children of this age I don't support forbitting these adverts.
There are definitely more important things to forbid.
The followinf statement is ,,Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five)should not be allowed.''
In my oppinion the age two and the age five is a big difference,when you have a two year old children it's not good when you watch tv with because they're a lot too young for that.
Two years old children have better things to do than watching tv,for example exploring new things and grow up,television did not help to grow up good.
When your child is older,for example five years,my opinion is,that it is okay,when they sometimes watch tv,but just for a half or one hour per day,five year aged children have a lot of other and better things,that they can do in their life.A better option what they can do is meeting friends from the Kindergarten and play with them,but in my oppinion it is okay and also normal,when the kinds can watch tv for one hour in the eavening.
A good example is my babysitter job,the kinds are allowed to watch tv for one hour at the eavening.The kids are seven years,five years and three years old.In this situation it's okay that the three year old child watch tv,because they do it all together after that,they know that they have to go to bed.
I think that conseqeces are a good option.
Kids should learn that television is not so good for them like reading a book or play with other kids.
Another option is that,when you have for example two childs,the older one is six years old and the younger one is three years old,that you bring the younger one to bed for a little sleep for example after the lunch and in this time the older child can watch tv for a moment.
I think the consume of television in this young age can be really bad for the children,so i agree a bit with the statement.
The queastion today is wheather it should be allowed that television advertising is directed toward young children or not.
In the following the question will be answered, first I will lay all the information down and in the end I will explain my own opinion.
On the one hand it would be possible to create the advertising in a nice and friendly way, so that the children woundn't see the advertising for adult, like half naked woman.
On the ather hand kids would be more manipulated by the advertisement than they would be atherwise.
It would make it more easy for the comanys to sell their stuff, but the parents wouldn't have the same amount of sayings in what kind of products their child should use than befor.
Another aspect for the allowense is, that chidren see advertisment every day, so it wouldn't make any diference, but directed directly against it,  is the argument that children already see to much advertising every where they go, there is no need to make it worse by producing advertising especally for them.
To sum up, the positive side about advertisement just for kinds are that the shops have a better groung to sell their products and the negative side is, that the children will have to grow up around it and get manipuled it want they need and what not.
In my opinion advertising directed toward children should not be allowed.
It is an anessesary manipulation and it forces the parents to buy their children stuff they wouldn't have atherwise.
Sometimes they dont't have anough money to by all the things the kids want, so the child would be devestated, what could have benn prevented.
The wills of big concernse shouldn't be more worth than the savety of our children.
The  question is, if television adversting directet toward young children should not be allowed.
You can see this point on two different sights.
in following i will try to cover these to pages.
If you were a buisnessman you want that children see the adversting, cause you want to get money.
And that is easy with kids, because if they see the adversting in TV, the children ask their mother, if they get these toys for example.
And the mother said nearly ever yes, to make the child happy.
On the other side are the parents.
They don't want that their kids see adversting in TV.
It could be a reason that the fear of poorness is there.
Or they want to safe their childs for the industrial society.
Another point is, that I think it is really hard to turm off the screen every  time, there is adversting in television.
I understand the problem with kids and adversting in television, but i think it is really hard to realise.
Kids with five years are able to watch alone TV, and you cant safe the kids from the adversting.
And where is the difference between television advertising and advertising in the city ?
All in all i think its not able.
Specific Advertisement for Children

Everyone knows the feeling when you start your TV and and the first thing you see is advertisement.
Everybony hates it but this is how the television-programs are financed.
But is it right to advertise specific stuff for children, who are two to five years old in the brake of a childrens' show?
This should not be forbidden especialy not for children-advertisement because they dont have the economic power to the advertised things anyway.
They can't buy the advertised stuff and are therefore not influenced by the advertisement.
This is not true at all.
Firstly children are very easyly influenced by  advertisement and secondly, even if they themselves don't have the needed money to buy those things, most certainly the parents do.
So indirectly the children then influence the parents and push them into buying stuff they saw on TV.
This may sound a little unplausible but as child one has a big power to stess parents and also to make them have mercy.
Most of the advertisements contain brutal things that aren't made for childrens eyes and ears.
So in these spots the violence somtimes is even praysed.
Ant this would lead to a new generation whose priorities are set wrongly.
But if you thinke these advertisements are bad you couldn't allow your child to wacht any TV because even ost of the Series and Films that are approved for children contain violent actions.
Anyhow children dont have to watch TV at all and if you are a good parent, you would check that what your child is watching is   okey to be watched by someone his or her age.
This would elminatethe necessarity of a law against advertisments directed to children.
But those rules are there for films and series.
So why not make any for television advertisement.
One is not allowed to show any advertisement, which might be missunderstood in the cinema.
And especially for children it is very difficult to whithdraw themselves from such advertisement and to live an easy uninfluenced life.
In the end I think it is important to define this law more clearly.
Is all advertisement vorbidden or only violent ones?
This has to be cristal clear before can even start talking about the necessarity of such a low.
So in my opinion a law against advertisements whith violent contente would be important.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
In our modern world people only talk about the problem with smartphones and how children and young people are distracted by them.
People do forget about the old electronics, like tv's.
Most young kids, even babies are watching a lot on television.
With it comes the advertisment.
Is advertising, which is already adressed to the young kids, tells them to buy.
It showes happy kids with a lot of colorfull stuff to play with.
This advertisment is part of the introduction into our consumeristic world.
The kids start to ask their parents right after they just saw in the commercial, if they can go and buy the just seen toys.
An because the parents are nice, they buy it for them.
The kids are tending to want more and more.
Things to play with don't let real happieness follow, human connections bring the real happieness into our life.
Another fact about television is that, when seen over a long time, it is not good for the eys.
In the beginning kids want to watch the movie, series or a documentary.
They don't plan to watch the commercials.
But they are made to watch them.
Without the commercials children would have more time to do other activities, like going outside and playing on a playground with their friends.
Television over all is not a bad thing.
Documentaries and other shows can teach kids a lot.
And advertising is a normal part of our economy.
I can say, that when i was little I always used the advertisments as breaks.
To go upstairs and already brush my teeth, so after the documentary i can go directly to sleep.
I did so beacuse my parents tought and raised me that way.
After all I can say that advertisment should not be allowed to children at the age from two to five.
Advertisment for older kids and adults should be allowed.
Maybe advertisment should not be allowed on kids channels.
In my opinion this problem is mostly about the education kids get from their parents and about government regulations which should be there to give kids more time to play outside.
Why television advertising should'nt be directed towards any young children.
They are everywhere: Advertismenst.
On busses, billboard and at home on television.
It's almost impossible to avoid them.
They are at some point annoying and contain false information.
They make promisses to sell great things, but actually they just try to make money out of everything.
If grown ups allready do think that way about advertising, then why are there advertisments directed towards young children?
Ads are unrealistic and this could affect children by making them believe toys exist, that have abilities they sure can't have.
HOTWHEELS for example: they make it seem like their racing cars are able to drive by themselves but in real life you have to push them forward.
This leads to disapointment.If children don't get exactly what they wnat they will be pretty sad.
At some point ads are just hiddious: the products are shown as something magical that can make things you're dreaming of come true.
Marketing is a good way to plant in image of somthing in our heads that is not true.
For us grown ups it's easy to differentiate the false advertisment from the product itself.
But children, especially toddlers, have a great imagination, and for them everything is possible.
It does not seem impossible for them that a toy that claims to have the ability to make itself turn invisible, is not true.
they can't make out the diffrence between a lie and and ad.
That's the problem: kids are going to ask their parents to by them things that are not as fun as they seem on television.
Plus they are really expensive.Some parents that allready have trouble keeping the household going will have few more essues.
Having just enought money to feed your children and pay the bills is hard enought, but with the children being exposed to magical toys on TV it's hard  to turn their begging down everytime they ask for new toys.
The kids have broken hearts about toys.
That's how I felt whenever my mother told me we dind't have enought money for toys.
I think advertizing towards children should be banned.
Today I write about the statement " Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed".
One the one hand there is the fact that television advertising could change the mind of a child.
But one the other hand there is the fact that they couldnt buy anything alone even if they want to.
Everybody knows that advertising is a piece of our live.
Everywhere we go somebody wants to advert for something.
And we all know that there are good reasons for it because it is very easy to change peoples opinion about something.
And to change the mind of a young child and make them to want something very badly is just more easy than to do it with adults.
So I dont think that advertising directed to young children is fair because they are easy to manipulate.
I think it is okay to advertising toward adults because they know about advertising and the fact that it is very manipulative.
But I think that advertising toward children, especially young children, is kind of unfair.
Otherwise there is the fact that young children cant buy expensive things by themselves.
Theire parents do it for them and they arent manipulated by the advert that is directed to young children.
So they have choice to dont buy.
In the end I think that televison advertising directed toward young chidren isnt a good or fair thing beause of the manipulation fact but there are the parents who have the choice so there a more badly things than it.
Todayit is the easyest thing to let children looking TV.
You don't have to tidy a room full of stuff whitch they let laying around and where you probably can slip out on them.
The children stay in one room where you don't always have to look after them, they don't run away.
The most important thing for children to discover the word by touching everything.
They should look at things, feel the surface of diffrent things, smell how they are.
Children learn by dooing and playing with real stuff, even if you have to tidy up the room at the end of the day.
Children dont have to sit in a room the whole day.
They have to run around, even if they get hurt and get dirty.
Outside.
Discover the nature.
Learn what they are able to do, learn to do things at their own and get confidence.
I think the most importent thing for children is playing with their hands to learn.
To feel, so smell and looking.TV should not be forbidden but parents have to allow to their children in a normal way.
The childhood in this time and the years after are one of the most important times forming the personality.
The creativity, confidence and behavior.
Television advertising is an important thing to reach as many people as possible.
Every big company uses this type of marketing.
But young children are very easy to manipulate, so should it be illegal to direct television advertising toward young children?
Our society is full of products and consum, we should keep our children safe from this type of consum, which can be bad for them.
They should not define themselves over brands of clothes or some new toys.
Also kids of poorer people could be bullied in kindergarten because they haven't got the new toy or something like that.
Television advertisment shows what everbody should have and what's trend in the moment.
This could be the trigger for these children to define themselves over this trends.
There is, for example, a new Barbie on the television and thay say, that the cool kids should have this Barbie.
This could be a trigger for mean words to kids that don't have this new Barbie.
Another opinion could be, that there is nothing negetiv about television advertising.
The advertisment is just an information about new products and the parents can decide on their own what to buy.
On argument is that those young children aren't interested in toys of other kids.
They aren't this mean like older children.
In my opinion television advertising for young children isn't a really bad thing.
We all grew up with those advertisments.
It's important that the parents make a decision what to buy and what is good for their child.
In addition to that I want to say that a children shouldn't watch this much television in general that the advertisment effects the behaviour of the kid.
Many children are watching movies or other specific things for kids on television.
In television it is totally normal to put advertisings in breaks between series or movies, but should it be allowed to advertising directed toward young children?
In my opinion advertising toward young children should be allowed but in a specific way.
The advertising should be about school things or games with a background to learn something.
The advertising should not be about killing other people with swords or about pistols which shoot water for example.
Annother reason why advertising toward young children should be allowed is that the channel where the kids watch their movies or series should be a channel for kids only and if there would be some advertises for older people that would not be so good.
Especially if there are advertises about death or somethingelse.
All in all i think there is no reason that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed as long as it´s about games with some background to learn from them, books or computer games to prepare for the elementary school.
It´s better than  "normal" advertises where they show how to shoot at eachother with a pistol or fighting with a sword in the garden.
The advertises should fit in the channel genre.
So if it´s a channel about history or stuff like that there should be advertises about antique swords.
Thats totally fine.
But if that channel is for kids only they should play advertises directed toward the young children.
Today there are many advertises for toys and stuff in programms for children, but is that okay?
In the following text I will discuss if it should be allowed or not to produce television advertising direct toward young children (aged two to five).
For the economy it is a very good way to earn much money, when they produce advertises in channels for children like disney channel for example.
The reason for this is that the cildren if they see well looking toys in the advert, they really want to have that and ask their parents so long after that until they will buy it for them.
So you can say that the big concerns programmed something in the head of the children and they are a part of our economysystem.
But I think children should just be children they should play outside and should start living their lives without being part of a system where everyone just want to earn money.
Another reason for this point of view is, that children should learn to be happy with the things they have and they should not always want to have new stuff just because it is in the television adverts.
This is also bad for people with less money than others, becaus they can´t efford to buy their children all the new things from the adverts and than the children become unhappy.
To avoid this  it´s a very good idea to don´t allow television advertising directed toward young children I think.
Sould television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
With this statement the advertisement for things, especially very young children would wan`t, is questioned.
First of all I wan`t to refer to a core value of our swiss constitution: freedom.
Freedom is a very important core value of our society and by prohibiting television advertisement directed to young children this value would be severly affected.
Erverybody should be able to advertise for any products he thinks are worth advertising for, be that a product for very young or very old consumers.
Secondly especially young children like advertisement and they are often very fascinated by the colorful and often funny ads.
Advertisement also doesn`t force the children to do anything.
Therefore it doesn`t really make sense to forbid something that simply brings joy to some people.
Furthermore young children like to get their ideas for their birthday and christmas wishes from magazines, so why not from television?
On the other hand side one has to consider that young children are very easy to manipulate.
With a less experienced and educated mind they are a easy target for advertising and can more easily fall for subjective and incorrect advertisement.
Also the children who saw those ads can afterwards be so obsessed with the presented article that the could try and force their parents into buying that product for them.
Finally by allowing television advertising directed toward young children on secretly supports young children in watching TV.
It is scientifically proven that TV is not good for young children and can really hinder their development.
Is a thing so bad for the childs development really to be supported?
To sum up there are pros and cons for both sides.
One carefully has to evaluate those arguments to make a decision.
In my opinion freedom as a core value of the swiss constitution is to be promoted as much as possible.
Also advertisement musn`t just be a bad thing, it can amuse and bring joy.
with regard to these arguments I am definetly for allowing television advertisement directed toward young children.
Today i would like to discuss the statement ,,Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.''
I think its a statement with different opinions about.
In the german television is a channel especially for children named ''KiKa''.
When i was a child i watched this channel, when i'm watching TV.
It's great for children to learn new words or see new things.
So on the one hand its a good way for kids to learn new things without to much konzentration, because they learned it in a funny way and i dsagree with this statement.
On the other hand i agree with the statement, because today there are so many channels or series for kids without a good backround and children can't learned from this.
There is a difference between series, where kids can learn from and series, where they can be dumb from.
When we are talking about these series or channels, i agree with the stamement.
I can't agree with the statement, because when i was a child i sometimes watched TV and the channel and the series was very good and i can't say, that Television have a negativ influence to me.
But i can't say if this is different today, because i doesnt watch there channel anymore.
But i believe, that we live in a world with so much new things and changes, so maybe now there are some bad series on the kids channel and i think these series should not be there anymore.
Should televison advertising be allowed for young children?
First of all we have to speak about the different types of advertises and that i am talking just from TV channels for children.
There are three categories i would say.
The first one is the type of advertises, that shows "trailers" of new series or when a specific show comes in TV.
This type of advertise is in my opinion okay for children, because they can see which show comes when and is thought for information.
The children can see which show they want to see and which not, but in special the parents can see wich show is good for their children.
The second type of advertises is the one that shows new toys and games for the children, its the "typical" advertise.
In this adds the children get manipulated so they want to have this one new toy.
The problem is that there are infinite new Toys wich means infinite new advertises.
The children get manipulated by loud voices that say how good this toy is, blinking lights that gets them focused on the add and in the advertise are other children that seem happy and look "cool" with that toy.
This type of Advertises should not be allowed for children because they can`t realize that they get manipulated, they are just too young for that.
The third type of advertises on TV channels for children is the one that advertises for websites or apps.
The websites are filled with a lot of simple videogames "for children" that aren´t good for them and can make them addicted.
The apps that are shown in the TV are often so called "pay-to-win" games, where you can pay real money to get bonuses or other things.
It is often very expensive and when the parents logged in their children with their accounts, the children can accidently pay a lot of money from the parents without even knowing that.
This is a terrible type of advertise and is just existing to get money from people that do not even know what they are doing.
To summarize my text, i would say that in my opinion advertises are bad for young children, they get manipulated without even knowing it.
So if someone can decide for children to not look advertises in TV then it is on the parents.
They have to be informed what theyr children are watching and decide what is good for them and what is not.
I'm disagree with this statement.
That statement isn't in my interesting.
For Students is that fun and  
Students has so more chance in english but teachers are inkompetent to make the leason intesting.
We learn poem and to writing a sonnet and not to the gramm.
Statement is for Schools very intersting

So I'm disagree
Should television advertising not be allowed to young children?
I agree with this statement, because the young children should not watch all the day television.
The children need the television, when they watch it every day.
I think that young children need real friends and not the television, where they doesn´t learn something.
When the television make advertising directly to the children, they can´t make a social structure and be alone.
The television want to make more shows, where the children can learn math or german, but this doesn´t help to learn it at a television show.
Better is it, when the family and friends learn together with the children.
I don´t know good things what a television is doing to humans.
The television make it young children hard to live in the real world, when they watch all the day dump shows, only to become so more money.
I think television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Beause the children which are looking television became the feeling, that they must have everything what they see in the televison.
Later, if they are older, it could be, that they order things which they can't pay.
That could be very dangerous!
Also it`s more difficult for adults to satisfite their childrens.
A big playmobil tower chatch the eyes of the young children, now they think every tower should be so big an high as the tower in the televison advertising.
If they wish a tower for birthday, they will be sad if the tower isn't that big.
But on the other side, i think television advertising can have positive affects.
The children learn in young age how it is to have wishes and how they have to handle this wishes.
Maybe they can wish the things that catched their eyes for birthday.
Or they have to save money.
They learn the use of money.
Also they learn how to react, if the wishes don't come true.
I agree with this statement because the show often pictures or spots withes arent for children and those advertisments often spells for children a big trouble because they in their first years of life and if they learn bad things from advertisment then their character will build on the bad things and the childrens will have in their late life a bad and hard life.A Child in this young ages often will everything buy the things wich he saw in the advertisments and goes crazy if his or her parents wouldnt buy it for them.In advertisments they often show dangerous scenes from famous movies and the childrens often imitade the fight fight scenes wiches often spell big danger and big trouble for the childrens.
The statement where I want to show my opinion is "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed".
In general I agree with this statement.
The children who watch this advertising in TV probably get wrong information because they believe in everything which is showed to them.
If you can buy a thing for which is advertising made on TV which one child wants to have you can manipulate them when you say to them that this thing is very cheap but in real it is very expensive.
When you do Television advertising for young children also they can get more information about the other parts of the world.
So they become a better world view in their younger years not like the others who dind't watch these or don't have a TV.
An another fact which agree with this statement is that the young children don't know what they have to think about that advertising.
These children who looked the advertising probably have a thought which makes them angry or something.
The children also sit a lot more time before the TV because of these advertisings who make them watching the series or something which the advertising shows.
In general I am against the Television advertising direct toward young children because the negative consequences are too big to ignore them.
In the following I´m gone creat an "Essay" about the statement " Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed".
First of all it´s important to meantion that the television could be used in many different ways.
You can use it to have some fun with your children and the children can learn many thinks from watching but you can spend to much time on it so it could be negative.
Of couse there´re many thinks in the television a child haven´t to see but it´s emeasing how much a child could learn the language only by wathing television.
I would say that it´s right to allow children to use the television because of the learn effect but I´am not agree by let a child do what he/she want to, because just like I meantioned at the beginning in the television you´ve got so many options by switching form one channel to another that you can lose the feeling of the time and start to spend to much time by watching it.
My opinion is that it´s from familiy to familiy different because you can´t tell your children to stop whatching television if you spend the whole time by doing it and in this point it isn´t important how old these children are.I would meantion too, that the television is a medium which have a big might at which is able to form the way a human think and if a child start with young age whatching television it will be have more effect od the children
The topic whether telivsion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed can be considered as very contreverse.
In our society is capitalism the leading cause to advertisment in television, newspaper or elsewhere.
The big companies do not look at the negative effects they cause especially on young children.
As a young child it is very easy to manipulate you because you do not own the ability to reflect yet.
This leads for example to problems in later childhood and also teenage-time.
Girls are shown perfect dolls with a unrealistic bodyproportion.
Maybe they get trouble with their body in a higher age because of that.
Also the advertisments show that dolls are for girls and for example cars are for boys.
This causes misunderstanding later in the years.
Our progressed society has no gender rols, so advertisment for children ought to stop teaching gender rols or stop showing at all.
Another problem is that the children learn in the youngest age of their life that consumption is important, because that is what advertisment shows.
And if this person thinks its whole life that consumption is needed to be happy, this person will never have a fullfilled life.
Otherwise the parents can decide wheter their child is allowed to watch television or not.
So they can regulate the impact advertisment does.
In our society it is pretty normal to use media as a child, but there exsist so many options to watch movies and series on the television without be forced to watch advertisment, for example the payed movieplatform Netflix.
Television and other modern media is more and more popular in our culture.
If it is "Tartort" for adults, dubbed american series for teenagers or animated learning shows for children.
And something that goes hand in hand with the produces TV-Shows are advertisements.
Most commonly used during a film and just rarely betwen two of them.
As allready mentioned there are also shows produced only for children and most of these use the same concept of advertisements during series or films.
The problem is, that children in the age of two to five cant see the difference between something they like and something they really want, because they want bassicly anything they like.
So they are pretty easy to manipulate and with them there parents are so too.
Especially for young parent the pressure of a crying child, that wants a specific thing it saw on TV can be to much.
So they need to buy it and thats exactly what the creators of such advertisements want.
Children in this age shouldnt also be directly confronted with the main thought of capitalism in our culture.
If they grow up with advertisements as part of threre culture, there is no way of teaching them the right way consuming later in there life, or this will become at least harder.
But when asking about if this kind of advertisements should not be allowed there are some problems and arguments against it asswell.
First of all you cant really define which advertisements is for children in this age because of the diffrent nivous they are on.
Some of them learn to speak faster and some of the wouldnt even understand what the advertisement is about.
When advertisements for children in the age of two to five would be forbidden the companys would send the same clips and say they are for children in the age of six.
There ist just no possible way to provide a "save" way of watching TV without advertisements because you cant controll which programm the chikdren are going to see.
Also it is part of the responsibility of the parents to teach there children about consuming and they cant get everything they see on TV and the choice of the channel and the time they spend of watching them is something the parents are resposible for aswell.
So in my oppinion these kind of advertisements should not be forbidden because it would change anything.
You cant controll who watches them because its the responsibility of the childrenn parents.
So instead of trying to provide advertisements seen by the children you should use the neccessary recources you need for such kind a "projekt" to make watching TV self saver for them.
Maybe in making more channels complitly without advertisements such as "KIKA", but stopping creators of making advertisements directly for young children is wasting time.
The discussion about television advertisment directed towards two to five year old children was already held multiple times, but it's still a hot topic.
One the on hand is the fact that – especially young – childern are easier to manipulate than adults.
If children get in touch with advertisment in young years their personality development will be strongly influenced by the values shown in the television advertisments.
The problem here is that those values are selected to sell as much as possible, not to secure a well personality development in most people's eyes.
One the other hand there is the right for every one to advertise his products.
If this right is not granted for sellers of e.g.
kids toys it will put them into a disadvantage.
And young children are not the only group wich is easy to manipulate.
The question if such advertisment should be forbidden is worth asking, but if such a restriction is made other questions have to be ask as well.
The advertising in media, for example television, does appear every now and then watching tv.
Nearly every child does watch tv, by the age of two to five years.
It is obvious that they will collide with the advertising.
At a young age, children do imitate and do things they get caught.
Advertising is trying to convince the watcher.
Young children have no experience to differ, what is good and whats not.
So, they get taught about something, and grab this knowledge in a time where getting an opinion and make yourself an image of this world, is pretty necessary.
Not ot forget advertisment is manipulating, not a positive word.
But otherwise, advertising wants you to buy something, like products or services and kids from two to five years, probably wont have the financial force to execute these purchases.
In that way advertising maybe ould not affect the situation negative in this way.
And also a positive effect is, that the child does get an idea of the technical and engineering situation of the moment.
How do products look like?
What are you able to do with them?
For example, how does the new iPhone look, what can you do with it?
Well, thats not central in this case, because it is not directed towards young children, but it goes in this way.
Children then also learn to differ what would I buy and what is not necessary.
Concluding, I do not agree.
Advertising is everywhere, where you can probably look.
Seriously, what can you do about it?
I think that the negative effect is not that important and society should just ignore this issue, because it is not worth to think about it.
When your children are not supposed to see advertising, then give them something else to do!
Today many children are influenced by some modern technology like the television.
The adults can decide what shows the children whatch.
There are some points, that have to be mentioned, if we talk about this problem.
First, many children can be manipulatet from tv-shows.
A lot of the movies espacially the movies that are recommended for the age 16 or higher have a big influence to the children.
In this context the adults have the responsiblity to advise the children and tell them, whether they are allowed to watch the movies or not.
But in this context they are many children who know how to get this movies whithout the look of the adults.
Second, they are many series or tv shows that are representing the sociaty in a wrong way and implicate wrong thoughts into the mind of an innocent children.
In the most vincible paragraph of a human living they get influencend and that could cause for ever an can not be changed anymore.
Of cause tv-shows are not evil at all but the point should be clear.
In another perspective, a lot of children like and love what thy watch in the television.
Also when they like tv shows that exactly fit to this problem and are good for the children and do not influence them like other shows, there is no actual problem with it.
So when they look the right tv shows and do not get influenced badly then they can do what they want and look it of cause.
Too many hours a day is of cause not recommended because they are much other things to experience.
Moreover a children is a children to experience and technological anvancements is a part of the experience.
The most significant problem is with the adults.
No one knows how they think an whter a tv shows is good or not.
But in my opinion they should have the possibilaty to decide in future too.
The adults have to grow up there children and show them a path, where they can go and it should not be a law in book who decides what is good or bad for children.
But maybe adults have to see that tv shows can have a great inflouence to children because when not it could go in a very wrong disortioning way and that should be avoided.
To conclude: They are many bad influences, the children can take from tv shows and the adults are obviusly the greatest problem.
But I think that they should decide for the children and not a law.
They should be telled what influence tw shows can make.
Children at the age of two to five usually have started becoming young people.
They have got a mind of their own.
They understand what you are telling them or at least they think they do.
But they can not differ between good and bad.
They obviously are not old enough yet  to think rationally, which is a crutial thing for decinding to go withthe advertisment or to ignore it.
Advertisments are used to manipulate people into doing stuff or going out and buying the product you were just informed about in the television.
Children at that age are old enough to understand what the advertisments are offering and they are at the age where they would also already go and ask their parents if they are allowed to have something.
Usually their questions or demans are more like if they are allowed to eat an ice cream or if they could play with mommy`s make-up.
But of course if the advertisments are directed towards children alone and not towards the parents of children, the results would be most efficient for the company adevertising the product.
You sow the kids what there is and they go and do the job for you, in begging their parents to go and buy the product for them.
On the other hand it is morally incorrect to manipulate children into wanting something which they wold be toatally fine without.
The do not know that it is probably not a good idea to buy all the things shown in advertisments.
Because children always see things as good and not as bad.
Bad is not something they are capable of understanding.
Furthermore I do not think it is really effective either to actually direct the advertisments toward children, seeing how they actually do not sit in front of the television at that age.
So companies investing in making advertisments for children directed to children would lose a lot of money.
Personally I do not believe it is morally correct to manipulate innocent children into buying new things and furthermore there is no use in it.
Cause in the end it is the parents that decide what to buy and what not to buy.
It is neither profitable nor effective or even useful to go to such lengths to sell a product.
In my eyes television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
There is a very big influence from the world around young children to their mind.
Advertising often uses an incorrect speaking or bad words, so that the kids learn things they should not do.
For example my brother, he is four years old, watches tv and uses the same words, the speaker of the advertising text does.
Sometimes there are words he does not know what they mean and uses them in a strange context.
Also I think young children are not able to decide what is real or what is wrong.
There are lots of toys in the advertising, which are presented in a fantastic way, so that every child wants to play with it, but the most of them are different, when you have it in your hands.
There are funny and exciting movies to show the newest Lego toys.
The figures can speak and there are supporting soundeffects.
Young kids, who are watching this, always think thats the way you can play with it.
Maybe the parents have problems to buy the correct present by reason that the kind do exactly what the want to have - the pretty dollhouse from the advertising and not another one!
Most of the advertising toys cost to much money for normal families with more than one child.
Twohundred euros for the newest model of Lego Technic ist a lot for a christmas present, but the kids are angry whan it is not the same they want.
In their age they do not know that twohundred euros are a lot of money.
Television advertising directed towards children aged two to five?
Can there really be any success for the companies?
I will have a closer look at the arguments and then come to a final statement.
First there is the question to be asked whether children of the age of two are really watching TV.
And if they do, can they realize that they are the target-group of the company?
At least their parents watch it too, they could buy their kids the things they see on TV.
But then you could also direct the advertisement towards adults.
If it would be allowed, what will happen with our society?
Three year old kids hanging around in front of the TV to see whether there is a new product they would like to have.
If it would not be allowed to send such advcertising(anyway, where would it be for?
)maybe there would be a chance to prevent the following generations from being couch potatoes.
In any case, the parents are the ones who buy the things, so they should be adressed directly to get their attention.
On the other hand, such advertising would be better for the children to watch than the one for alcohol or cigaretts.
But when should it be sent?
Naturally not in the evening fot then the elder generation is watching TV.
That leaves the morning were they are probably attending the kindergarten or the afternoon where they should rather play with friends or go outside.
In general, I see no real possibility in reaching the children through this kind of advertisement.
It bears huge problems as to when to send it and if they are old enough to understand what they see.
In my opinion, televion advertisement for kids of this age should not be allowed.
They will get in touch with the whole TV and marketing business soon enough, and then they can decide on their own where to spend their money.
The statement says that television advertising directed toward young children from age two to five should not be allowed.
I think that the author of the statement is mostly correct with his opinion, because these children don´t know what is good for them in their age.
Their parents should know whether they should get a new toy or not.
In my opionion television advertisings are nothing a child should deal with, because they don´t know how advertisings can build up the extreme will to buy the advertised product.
On the other hand it is good for companies to advertise their products toward little children because they often get presents from, for example, their grandparents.
If they see a new toy they want in a television advertising, then they probably beg for it in front of them.
To not allow these advertisings could cause big financial problems for the companies.
But I think that the mental health of a child is much more important than the financial crisis of a company, so I agree with the statement.
Children from two to five should not be directed in television advertisings, because of the spreading will in their little minds to get these advertised products.
Whether the parents should care more about their children and don´t let them sit in front of the hypnotisating televison so often, is an other problem.
I think parents should watch more carefully over the programms their sons and daughters spend their time with and maybe just turn the TV of while the television advertisings.
In the following text I am going to state my opinion on the statement: Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
On the one hand the advertising directed toward young children is not good because it somehow influences the kids and making them want to have some specific things for example toys.
So they start to beg the parents if they could get it.
It also changes the view the kids are having on, sticking to the example, toys.
They start to compare the toys they are having to what they are seeing on television and questioning the parents why they don't have such things.
But on the other hand when parents are letting the kids watch television, they know what the consequences could be.
Also a two year old will probably not notice that much from televison because it is too young.
Personally I think that television advertising toward young children should be allowed because if parents think that it's good to let, for example, a two year old watch television then why would the advertisement a problem?
I think that a two year old shouldn't be even watching television because it is too young.
If parents don't see a problem by letting them watch television, which influences them just as the advertising, they shouldn't see a problem with the advertisement.
Advertisements got more popular and have grown a lot of importancy in our society.
In particular television advertising is influencing us every day and developed ubiquitous.
In this development one way of advertising evolved and has been selected, the advertising toward young children.
The question is: "Is television advertising directed toward young children problematic?"
Young children haven't developed their own opinion yet and act very naiv.
Their opinion is depended on their parents and other people surrounding them.
Because of that advertisements have a very big influence and is more effective.
Not only products for these children can be sold easier, also other things can be advertised toward them.
For example an advertisement of a shampoo can show a little teddybear using it, so young children develop a sympathy to this shampoo and tell thei parents to buy it.
This principe can be used to sell neary everything to young children, eventhough they don't need it.
For example they don't need a shampoo because they already have one, but because they like the teddybear they have to will of getting it anyways.
With this methode it isn't difficult to sell products and it is still efficient.
But it also has negative sides, this children for example do not have developed an own opinioni and started to believe what the television or other media told them.
All in all I think there are some problems in advertising products towards children.
But it is also nearly impossible to fix this problem and they will grow even more.
In the following I will discuss the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed: An argument for this statement is that a young child wants everything they see or everything that is hyped.
So they can get easily manipulated by firms.
Because they can´t know what they really need they are wanting their parents to buy all the nice stuff from the ads.
An argument against this statement is that big concerns just want to sell their products.
And if they are selling things for children they should be allowed to show it to them.
But my main argument against this statement is that young children have to learn that they can´t get everthing they want.They must know their parents aren´t aible to buy all of the things from the ads.
So they are learning how to handle with money and that you have to do something to get little presents, e.g.
cleaning your room.
To put it in an nutshell I think that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed.
At first you may not see it but there is a huge learning effect.
Nowadays lots of young children are watching television.
In our society it is normal because of the media.
In addition to that there is lots of advertising in the television for small children.
I think there are positive and negative arguments for this statement.
Firstly I would say that it is not good that the people in the media are speaking directly to the children.
For example, the small children would see a toy that they want because they see it in the television.
The parents would have a problem, Maybe the toy is too expensive or the the parents say that the children not need this toy.
Besides the children would spend more time to watching television.
The consequences would be that the children would be lately dump.
They would still believe that all the advertisements are saying the truth.
Furthermore I would say that the children do not meet other friends.
The children would be isolated of the environment.
Now I say someting about the positive sides of this topic.
Televisoin and also media are inportant things in the future.
I think that is good that the media directors talking directly to the children because they included the children directly in the media and also about the lately future.
Besides the parents should protect that children so that the parents decide when the children are watching television.
That would not bring so many problems when the parents would choose the series that should see the children.
In addition that there are lots of series withoot advertisements.
All in all I would say that are posive and negative sides to this topic.
I thinks its good for the children because of the future and also bad because the children would not spend lots of time with otther things, for example with their friends.
I think that the parents should care about the children and should choose wheather their children should see advertisements or not.
Personallly i would not show my children advertisements or mainly television because it is dump and they would not learn something in this advertisements.
But it is also the disicion of the parents.
Nowadays everyone watches TV.
It became normal that even young children watch TV and grow up with it.
But there appears the question what does the TV show.
It is not just about showing movies and series.
There is also lots of advertising and some ads are directed toward young children.
Now we have to think about whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or should not be allowed.
Allowing television ads that are directed toward young children would mean allowing companies manipulating young children for making them buy their products.
The companies show their products in a way that gets the attention of children and makes them want to have their product.
So the companies put their product in the head of young children for making the young kids ask their parents to buy it causing another argument against advertising directed toward young children: The parents lose much money.
By making young kids want to have something the parents are going to be asked to buy these certain things and often the children convince their parents to buy them the things they want and parents also want to make their kids happy.
Another appearing problem is that if the kids have this product they often play for maybe a week with it and then see another ad and want another product which leads t
To put it in a nutshell in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it has a big impact to the children and also makes lots of people lose much money.
In the following I am going to show you arguments for and against the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
An argument for this statement includes the fact that for those children advertising could be an oportunity to get to know things they have not known yet.
They can get the impression of things they have not seen yet which can be an intresting experience for them.
On the other hand I want to give arguments against that statement.
Advertising directed toward young children may have a bad influence on them because they get manipulated to buy things.
It is a manipulation in fact that they are shown things like toys which are also very expensive.
It could lead to problemes like getting addicted to things like that and wanting more and more toys which could also lead to problemes with money.
Furthermore it is a process of stealing 
the free choice of childreen.
They should have the right to choose whatever they want by themselves and not by the manipulation of advertisings.
To put it in a nutshell I prefer the opinion that advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because they should have the right to choose their own intrests and get to be independent in very early ages.
Television advertising is very known to young children because they often enjoy watching it regularly.
On TV shows especially made for children, there are lots of ads which show new toys that seem often very appealing to them.
I remember that back in my childhood days, i would love to watch tv and seeing these adverts made me want to have that new toy immediatly.
I would run to my mother and ask her to buy it for me without giving much thought about it since i am just a child who wants everything nice it sees.
Because of this many children fight with their parents because they do not get what they want.
This leads to both parties geting angry and sad.
Moments like these, when a child does not get the toy it wants and in the  worst case get his or her heart broken over this, are very critic situations for a family.
Additionally, parents can`t always afford the expensive toys their children want and start to feel bad about themselves because they cannot fullfill their childrens wishes.
Furthermore, children are so quick to decide what they want and what they do not want which leads to them often wanting unnessecary toys.
Because of all these arguments listed above, I come to the conclusion that advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.
They do not have the ability to decide in terms of buying and get influenced very easily.
Watching TV from a young age on is normal today.
Everybody has a favourite TV-show, even the youngest ones.
But there is always advertisment between the TV-shows.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because the advertisments make false promises that small children can not distinguish from reality, also the advertised product is mostly unhealthy for children and lastly a child is far more disceptable to advertisment then an adult.
For example Kinder Country, you have an advertisment that shows a picture of a perfectly healthy nature landscape and you think that this company produces a healthy product that is good for your child.
But the reality is very different than the advertisment.
The nature from advertisment never made it into the Kinder Country.
It contains mostly sugars and fats and is therefore unhealthy.
But if you get fooled by advertisment how should a child distinguish advertisment from reality.
Another example would be Red Bull.
In the advertisment of Red Bull it is said that if you drink it then you will grow wings.
An adult should know that this is probabably not going to happen.
But a child is going to think that it will really happen.
And that is a false promise that a small child can not distinguish from reality.
We all know that we are quite disceptable to advertisment but small children are even more disceptable to it.
Also studies have shown that children want to buy a product because they recognize it.
And we all no the situation where a child in a store wants an unhealthy product and the parents will not buy it.
With advertisment that is not directed to children we would have less of these situations.
With a ban of television advertising directed toward young children we would have less discepted children that want to buy an unhealthy product that is advertised under false promises.
That could lead to an reduction of the obesity rate in small children.
And of course we would have less enerved parents in stores because children want to buy unhealthy products.
In this essay I'm going to explain, why television ads for children between the age of two to five should not be allowed to be directed.
An argument, which is against my point of view, is the fact, that if children see some toy in the TV, that they want, parents get a thought for a  present for christmas or for their birthday.
But this argument you can also see from a diferent point of view.
Maybe the toy, they really want, which they would cry for, is too expensive for the parents.
And maybe the children are very sad about not getting this toy, the parents get very sad about the fact, that they made their children sad because they are too poor to give their children the toys they want to have.
And maybe if the parents are very rich, they buy their children everything they see on television.
But the problem with that is, that the children may get used to it and in their adult life they want to also everything they see on TV so they get bills and bills and bills they cannot pay, because they are not so rich as their parents.
Another argument for not directing television adverts for young children is the fact, that maybe some parents don't let their kids see television, but if the parents see an ad for a big toy, they just buy it without asking their kid if they want it.
And after that the kids just play 2 minutes with it and then they put it in corner and never give it look back.
Watching all arguments, my result is that television adverts should not be directed for children between the age of two to five years old.
The television is in our community an important topic.
Everybody get informed about the news in the world and also everybody get entertaind.
But the television has also negativ aspects.
Thats the reason why the topic of my essay deals with the pros and cons of the television.
The statemet is if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
First I will name the pros of television advertising directed toward young children.
In the Tv are many Tv shows and movies where kids learn something, for example counting ore reading.
They learn this important things indirect so they don´t realise it.
Another pro argument is that watching Tv could be an relaxing part of the day for the kids.
On the other side, there are also negativ aspects.
On the Tv are also many shows and movies that aren´t good for young children.
Sometimes they use words that children don´t have to say.
Another contra argument of tlevision advertising directed toward young children is that some kids sit a long part of the day in front of the Tv and don´t go out of the house and play with other kids.
In my point of view children have to be allowed watching Tv, but there have to be some rules.
One rule has to be that the childrens only watch special TV shows and movies, that are only for children.
Another rule has to be that they only watch Tv in the evening before they go to bed, so they go outside with friends in the other part of the day.
In the following I'll give my opinion on the statement that television advertising directed toward young children at the age of two to five should not be allowed.
First of, I can't tell any positive thing about advertising directed toward young children.
The only positive is the firms earn more money with it and that's why it is a genius idea.
As soon as young children see any toy or something like that, they immediately fancy and want to have it.
They will ask their parents to buy it about everyday.
It'll be getting on their nerves and so the parents will probably go for it.
The other thing about it is that I don't understand why there even is an advertising while watching a kids show.
Children mostly watch TV shows running on a platform made for their age so why isn't it forbidden to let the show break for advertising children who can't even buy the shown things themselves because there are not even earning money by their own?!
Another negative thing is that advertising does make stupid und unhappy.
First, they build up random things to make their advert more interesting and children get even convinced about what they say because they're still naive.
Also, you'll get unhappy while seeing all those fabulous stuff you would really like to have.
Their "old" toys won't be enough anymore and they'll alsways crave for more.
They won't recognize the worth of their old toys.
Summed up, I think it should be forbidden.
We live in a world full of electronic devices and one of them happened to be the television.
Nowadays children start watching TV at a really young age and are also influenced by it.
Because with their favourite kids series they also watch advertisements.
So if advertisements really do influence children at a young age, should it be forbidden for companies to direct their advertisements towards these children?
One one hand it could be that kids aged two to five don't even comprehend what they are seeing on television and do not react to it.
So there would be no reason to forbid advertising towards young children.
You could also say that it is the job of the parents to keep their children away from danger such as these advertisements.
On the other hand you could say that it is morally not correct to try to influence audience at such a young age.
Consequently the government should lawfully forbid it because it should not be allowed to act legally in an unmoral way and especially if it concernces helpless kids.
In my opinion there should exist some sort of law that does not allow advertising directed towards young children but to me it seems really hard to draw the line between what is directed towards kids and what is wanted to influence an older audience.
For example if you have a look at the Evian advertisement with babies dancing and driving rollerblades in it you could assume that the advertisement is directed towards babies or children too.
But when you think about it, an advertisement about water would originally not be directed towards them.
Weather advertising toward children should be allowed is a controversial topic.
The major argument of critics is that children are inexperianced and cannot interprete and understand the tricks used by advertising agencies.
False advertising and imagry is commonly used in TV-ads but are expected by adult viewers.
Young viewers on the other hand don't know what to expect.
One argument for the use of targeted ads is that in the developed world children, through their parents, make up a huge part of the buying power of countless markets.
Children are exposed to so many new things to interprete, what difference does it make if it's an ad.
Parents of young children would probably argue that they don't want their kids exposed to media that they can't control.
Targeted ads would allow marketing departments to tap into living rooms the world over and affect the behavour of children in an uncontrollable fashion.
But children are already exposed to so much media that influences them hughmongusly.
Some movies and TV-shows made for children are littered with product placemen, corrupting kids minds, impossible for them to interprete.
Law makers would argue that parents let their kids watch all kinds of movies and shows, how would TV-ads make a difference.
Another argument against ads for kids is that even when the ads are not hard to understand for children they still advertise negative things.
Many children in the developed world suffer from obesity because they eat to much junk food.
They see doritos on tv and just have to have them.
In my opinion, some regulation is definitely needed.
Children cannot be exposed to physically damaging envirionments.
Why should they be allowed to be harmed mentally.
But a strict no-ads-for-children policy would be over the top.
The regulation should limit and define what products can be advertised and in which fashion that happens.
I partly agree with the statement because I think television advertising has a big influence especially on very young children.
The advertisings on channel for children often advertise for quite expensive products like Lego.
It's very easy to manipulate children of this age and it`s very difficult for the parents to decline something their children.
Also, the childrens brain develop very fast at this age and this process is very complex.
It's important that there's no negative influence on the children created by the advertising.
On the other hand the television channels somehow have to earn their money and advertising is the best and easiest way to do this beside product placement, which has an even bigger influence on the viewer.
We live in a capitalistic worlf and without the money earned from the advertising television channels won`t be able to produce any new childrenthemed shows.
The channels wiich aren't founded by the goverment are normal companies and have to bring up money to pay their bills.
I don't agree with statement because I believe there`s no necessity for a law against televison advertising.
The channels somehow have to refinance themselves.
In general, young children shouldn't spend too much time in front ov the tv what could have a bad influence on their development.
I personally think, it's the parents duty to watch out for their children and decrease the time spent in front of the tv if they recognise a change in the character of the child after watching television.
Television advertising toward young children is an often discussed topic these days.In the following text i am goingt to state my opinion if television advertising toward young children aged two to five should be allowed or not.
First of all it has become a normal thing that most of the children are allowed to wacht TV.
A few years ago like back when i was a kid we only had one Tv in our house so i couldnt watch Tv whenever i wantedt to.
When i see little children nowdays they watch TV like everyday.That means companies know it is a good idea to put advertising in between Tv-shows to reach many viewers.
They see so much advertising or hear it from friends so in my opinion it is okay to show some of it on TV.
But there should also be a limit.
In general i think children with the age of two to five should not sit in front of a TV that often.
They are so young and parents should definitly control theitr children TV consume.
Children are easily to influcene so TV companies know how to produce smart advertising.
They mostly believe everything they see or hear.
I think if we all look back the world when we where young looked pretty different in our eyes.
So in conclusion television advertising for young children should have a limit because children are easy to influence with that the advertising can change their behavior and mind.
In this essay I will write about television advertising directed toward young childer.
Is it okay to advertis young childern?
Should that be allowed?
Very often young childern, aged two to five, watching television, because the parents doesn't want to playwith them or aren't at home.
In the pauses is every time advertising.
There is a advertisment about the sale in the Migros and Coop or about the new Ford.
Young childern doesn't understand this stuff.
But there is also advertising about a new toy, the best Bobbycar or about a better babyborn, which can eat and cry.
On one hand it is good, because the young childern sees what they can put on their christmas-wishlist.
On the other hand is in the internet and the television often stupid and bad stuff.
So the childern put stupid stuff on their wishlist and are cry when it isn't under the christmas tree.
Advertising isn't that good for young childern, because more often is advertings sexualised.
Children shouldn't be confront with that so early in their life.
They should enjoy the childhood outside with their friends and not alone at home with watching televison.
When a little girl sees the newest babyborn in the television she runs to her mother and says: "Mummy, mumm I want to have this babyborn!
It only costs 69£."
The mother answers: "Hmmmm...
I don't know sewatheart.
I have to think about it."
One or two weeks later she says to her daughter that she will buy the babyborn.
She went to the store and sees that the babyborn costs now 100£.
She must buy the babyborn if it costs 69£ or 100£.
As we see  the factory or the store makes profit because of a young girl and in my view it is not okay!
As you maybe saw I'm not that happy with television advertising directed young children.
For the parents it isn't that good and also for the children.
Television advertising is totally okay but not directed to young childern!
They shouldn't even watch televison but that is an other question.
In the following essay I am going to discuss the question if television advertisment for young children should be allowed or not.
In many families even very young children are placed in front of the tv so that they do not molest their parents.
Of course they see their favourite new toys in the advertisment so they go to their parents and nearly force them to buy new toys.
This sometimes ends in a difficult situation for the adults: Should I buy every new toy from the advertisment to make my child happy?
What to do with tv advertisment for kids?
Firstly, there are multiple arguments against tv advertisment for kids.
For example, one could say that tv advertisment is bad for the childs development.
If you buy new toys for your kid every time they see something in the tv, they will end up with the attitude of getting everything they want right away.
So tv adverts should not be allowed to save the childrens education and behaviour.
On the other hand, tv advertisment for kids can also be very useful and absolutly great for their development.
If you control the tv-consum of a child and explain them why they cannot have every toy they want, Children can learn that one cannot have everything by watching tv!
So they can accept a "no" when asking for a new toy from the advertisment.
In my opinion it all comes down to the question how children are raised by their parents.
If they have a good education and understand how advertisments can manipulate ones mind I think advertisment directed towards kids is absolutley fine.
In the following essay I will dicuss the controversial question if television advertising directed toward young children shoud be allowed or not.
In the last centuries media usage like television has risen especially in the younger generation.
A part of television is advertising and many people have the opinion that young children should not be allowed to see adverts directed toward them.
I only agree partly on this opinion due to several reasons.
The most important argument to note first why advertisment toward children should be forbidden is because the younger a person is the more likely it is able to be influenced.
An average adult who sees an advert is able to seperate things they want from things they actually need and understands that advertisment uses certain marketing methods to make the product look better.
With this knowledge that they developed over the years they think about if they actually should buy the product when they see it in an advert.
Most children usually do not have these abilities yet so when they see a product in a television advert that they like they do not think about important aspects such as the prize or the quality of it.
If they want to have it then they will only think about that.
Another aspect is that it is morally not right to take advantage of a young mind to get their money.
Compared to an adult a child does not have much money, at the age between two to five usually none, but if they do it is not okay to make a child spend this small amount of money especially because they cannot understand the concept of earning money and spending it yet.
On the opposite there are a lot of arguments against this statement as well.
Firstly we, as citizens of western countries, have rights in our laws that allow us to say whatever we want in public and on the media such as newspapers but also on television as long as it does not go against the law.
In my opinion if one forbids certain television adverts it is a cut in free press speech which is not right.
Also important to note is that a child should stand under the surveillance of its parents.
It is their job to watch out which channels the child sees on television.
On German television their is a kids channel called "KIKA" where there are not any adverts.
If parents do not want their child to see advertisments they should let their child only watch channels like this or turn the television off in the advert breaks.
Even if it is influencing children it is still every parents own choice on how they raise their kids and as long as they explain to their children the concept behind television marketing and do not buy them everything they see it is okay if they let their kids see advertisments.
Because of these last reasons I think that television advertising toward young children should be allowed to a certain level.
Influencing children is not right but more important is the issue of freedom and everyone should be allowed to raise their children the way they want.
Therefore I believe that there will not be any problems if television advertising stays the way it is now.
The technology develops very much in the past.
Everyone has TV in his house or flat.
Young and old people spent much time on watching television instead of going outside and meeting friends.
Especially young children spend much time infornt the TV.
A statement is "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" But is this true?
In the following text I am going to talk about young childrens, which are watching TV very often.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed because they see so much stuff in the TV and doesnt lern anythink.
For example if they whatch ... they dont learn anythink while watching it.
If they watch for example .. it wouldn't be so good but is has also a positive effect on spending their time infront the TV instead of going outside  or to someting without technology.
But in my opinion Television advertising directed toward young children hould not be allowed.
A reason for that is that the childrens sit alone infront the TV instead of meeting their friends.
The reason for that is that there are so many "sendungen" for childrens which they wanted to see.
For example .. is a "sendung" for young children.
The childrens woult like to see it and instead of meeting their friends they sit infront the TV and just watch it for a long time.
But often after one "sendung" for children comes the next one so the kids spend much time on watching television.
Another reason that televion advertising directed toward young children ) should not be allowed is that the childrens sit in the house and watch TV no matter if the sun is shining or if its a rainy day.
The reason for that is that the kids want to watch their "sendungen and don't want to go outside and go on the playground or do something else outside.
For expample the weather is great at 12 o'clock but at 12.30 comes the favorite "Sendung" of a child.
The child wouldn't go outside instead of watching his favorite "Sendung".
All in all I would agree to the statement that Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed because there are many thinks which would be much better for the young childrens.
Should we allow televison ads to be directed at younger kids?
This is a very controversial question, with no definite answer and a lot of different point of views.
The main problem with advertisement to very young kids is the fact, that they are extremely susceptible to it, and that their brains are not yet fully developed.
Should we let our kids be controlled by television ads, or is the whole discussion unnecessary, as older people are influenced on the same level?
The question we must ask ourself, is are these kids really so much more susceptible than we are?
On the one hand, kids at this stage in life have still a lot of things to learn,and are more susceptible to influence, but on the other hand the ad is not making them buy it, it is just showing them a product that they want to sell, and the kid can then decide if he wants to buy it.
We know that we can influence kids very easily, and we can steer them in a direction.
You can tell a kid how cool a soccer club is, and he might just start supporting that soccer club.
At their age, kids might not know what they want, and bombarding them with  ads will only confuse them, and they will want something new everyday.
But we always influence our kids, no matter what we do.
No matter what you tell a kid, you are influencing him.
One can argue that if it's not a televison ad, it will be a poster, or a toy that you see in a store, and that it is just a different way of advertising.
In my opinion television ads to under five year olds should be banned, as these companies are just trying to make a profit.
If a child sees so many ads a day, it will influence him, especially at such a young age.
It will have an influence on him, and I cannot see, how this influence could be positive.
The only positive is that companies make a lot of money, and I think that is not a good reason to negatively influence our children.
Should it not be allowed to direct television advitising towards small children?
Some people think it has bad influence on  children when they see television advertising.
Some people think that it can have a bad effect on young children.
I totally agree that television can have an  effect on the way people think  especially on the way younger ones think.
But at the same time I don't think it should be forbidden to direct advertising towards children.
The children today need to learn how to live with social media and the advertising on it, also on  TV.
It is part of life nowadays and by forbidding advertising directed towards children, one takes away time when they, the children could actually learn how to not believe everything they see.
If television advirtising is forbidden the problem won't be fixed.
The problem is that so many people fall for everything they see, hear or read and the solution to that problem is learning them how to check facts and be critical.
This can be achieved if one starts talking about it to younger children.
Then of course one can't just place their children in front of the TV and leave, but this should not be done anyway.
One has to prepare the younger children for the future and part of their future is fake news and advirtising so they need to learn how to react to that at a young age.
That is the reason I am against  not alowing television advertising directed towards young children.
In he following I am going to tell you if children in the age of two to five should not watch Television.
Children in this age should not watch Tv because it is not good for them.
All of these children programms on nickelodeon are pretty uselles and that stuff they should learn by watching this Tv-show they can learn in a book for children.
In this age the children should not waste their time by watching Tv-shows, they can go in a park with their parents or just meet with other friends.
There are enough options they can do.
But if the children at the age of for example three start to watch Tv there is higher chance that they will get dumb and if the parents will not say anything against that the children are watching so much Tv the children want to watch more and more.
And later on they will not learn that much for school because they are too interested in watching Tv so they will worse grades.
The parents should simply just put them in a childhood while they are at work and after they finished their work they can bring the children back at home.
When they are back at home the parents should play with the children so it doesn´t need to get bored.
If the parents are exhausted by their work they can ask the grandparents of the children or the parents from a good friend of the it if they can for example play together.
It is important to show that what the parents are saying has to be done and the parents need to demonstrate this power.
The first step should be to not allow Television advertising for young children.
It is the best thing for the kids.
There is no possibility to flee them - the advertisings in the TV.
For almost every product,for hotels or even animals commercials exist with only one aim - to increase the requests for it.
But should it be really allowed in all areas?
First of all, I think we have to look at this theme with a split view.
Advertisings are nothing more than clever business models, which try to influence the a large number of community members.
As followed, it is not surprising, that the commercials are even created for minors and young children.
Children are those persons in a family, who probably have the greatest influence.
What they want, theire parents try to get.
Furthermore, the parents should decide on theire own wether it is okay, that theire 4 aged children look television or go out into the nature.
Althoug advertisings in TV, even for young children, are very important for the companies, we should also take the other site into consideration.
Children are not only the persons who influence the most, they are also the most influencable members in a familiy.
With advertisings in the television, they always get an idea, with what they could enlarge for example theire collection of toys.
Unhappy and sad faces, if theire parents could not afford everything, and a consumation community even in the first years of a childrens  life is the conclusion.
All in all, television advertisings for minors and young children should not be prohibited, but restricted in a certain mass.
Because a consumation community with 4 aged children, is absolute nonsense.
People of all ages are interesting for advertising agencies.
But especially young people are easy to influence.
A very popular way to advertise today is the television.
And already young children watch regularly tv so they are also victims of manipulative advertising.
Advertisement is produced for specific groups.
For children they use for example a lot of colours, pets and children as actors.
All things that children like.
They are instantly fascinated of the advertised product.
An exhausting thing for the parents who have to handle the whishes and annoying insists of their kids.
They obviously can't fulfill all those wishes and buy all the mostly unnecessary products.
In my eyes it's cruel to manipulate young children who are so influenceable.
Television advertising is common in today's society.
Nobody is enjoying them and nobody actually watch them, but young children can be influenced strongly by the loud music in the background, the many colours and the speaker.
They simply cannot ignore television advertising and get influenced by it.
Television advertising should not be allowed.
Young children are very easy to manipulate and therefor it should be illegal to produce television adverts directed towards them.
Some parents tend to buy their children everything they want and if there's a new advert in the television every week, they'll either have to say no to a child that's used to get everything it wants or face financial issues.
Eventhough children will cry like they are dying, as soon as they have their new toy they're happybut after a week it's already boring again and it gathers dust in the wardrobe.
On the other hand, if the children don't see the adverts, visiting a friend has almost the same effect.
Everybody has something different and it seems to have an even stronger effect on the influenced child.
A child can be as easily influenced by friends as by television, but actually making television advertising for young children should be against the law.
I can remember playing with a friend of mine and he had black and white lego blocks.
Nobody I knew in that time had those.
Till today we're best friends just because of a toy.
Then again, I also had alot of toys I simply watched on television, I didn't even know that they existed until I saw them.
In the end I can only repeat what I've already said.
Television advertising should not be allowed for young children, because they can be influenced easily and it's just immoral.
Advertising in children`s television has always been a heated topic.
The banning of advertising targeted at young children has been proposed by numerous parents.
I think that a ban like this is a very bad idea and i will explain why.
First of all, the only people complaining about tv advertising targeted at young children are parents.
Parents that allow a child to pester them into buying a new toy need to learn how to say no.
Even if advertising was banned, the child would only have to see another child playing with a toy.
Another important point is that childrens tv shows are funded with advertising money.
Many well-made childrens shows would suffer a mayor loss in quality or disappear entirely.
The shows that would remain in case of this ban would be filled with hidden advertising in form of product placement or other ways.
But there is always another side to controversial things which I will write about in the following paragraph.
Children between 2 and 5 are very impressionable and thus vulnerable to advertising.
They do not really know what they want yet which means an ad that tells them what they want is very succesful.
The companies making these advertisments know this and fully use this vulnerability to their advantage, which is considered quite immoral.
The children pester their parents incessantly until they buy them a toy they do not really want.
Even though there are many moral problems with advertising targeted at young children, I still think that banning it would not make anything better.
The childrens shows would become absolutely terrible.I think that parents that cannot say no to their child sh just pay for a pay-per-view channel.
These channels have no advertising at all!
Nowadays, television advertising is a very common way for companys to bring their products straight to the consumers.
While it may seem to be a good idea to show off products to a lot of people at the same time instead of talking to them on the street or whatever way they would chose besides that, it also contains hidden threat for the consumers, which many do not really know about.
The companys manage to influence the TV watchers to the point, of where they feel like they really need something although they've never felt the need before, until watching a certain advertisement.
When it comes to children, it seems to be even more severe.
Young children have wish after wish and those may change from one minute to the other.
If they really urge to have banana you can almost bet if you ask them 5 minutes later, what they want rightnow, that their answer probably won't be "a banana" anymore.
So in my eyes it's quite unrealistic to even consider advertising stuff for young children as they want everything at once and can't really decide wheter or not they really need something.
Apart from that, are the parents the one who decide what to, or not to buy.
As we're talking about the role of parents; children between two and five years shouldn't be allowed to regularly watch TV on their own as TV programmes can contain a lot of violence younger children may not understand jet.
To finish, I have to say I definitely agree with prohibiting television advertising toward young children.
Nowadays children get influenced by television advertsiing very early.
This is because of the habit that already  children of a young age could watch TV.
But does this advertising influence them too much and should it be forbidden?
First of all young children are really easy to influence.
This is also why such a lot of advertising is faced towards young children.
Because they believe everything.
And if small children see something they want ist is hard to tell them that they're not going to get it.
So there are some arguments in favour of not allowing advertsing towards children from two to five.
But it is the resposnibilty of the parents to decide wether their child can watch TV or not.
And they have also to inform them how to react to this advertsing.
In the end the parents buy an advertised product for their child and they're old enough to decide if it is a good thing or not.
So the child can be influenced by advertising but it doesn't harm them straight away.
Last but not least it would be difficult to decide what advertising is for children between two and five years and what not.
Because it's different from child to child what they like and what not.
In my eyes it isn't a good idea to forbid television advertsing for children between two and five because it would be hard to regulate.
And I think the parents are able to inform their children and take responsibilty of them.
Nowadays, observing young children watching television is nothing astonishing anymore.
There are a lot of kids who are not older than five years old, spending several hours a day and doing noting but staring into television, although there would be such a enormous amount of energy in those low-aged children.
This is very sad and must be changed.
Television advertising directed to young chidren should be forbidden.
First of all, it is clear that the development of a child is the most important thing.
This development is influenced by different parts.
One of those parts is the movement.
Sports and movement are enourmously important, because they have positive effects on body and health of a human, especially of a child because, as explained, they are in the state of developing.
In the ideal case, children play or move outside, because like this they learn to know their environment and the nature.
In their following lives they are ready and able to use, protect and respect.
Another point is the social one.
Playing is not just playing, it is more dealing with other social individums.
When children play with each other, they have to respect their partner(s) and learn a lot of skills by doing that.
The earlier they learn to share things, for example, the better they are able to do in their following lives.
To sum up, chilren are made for moving in the free nature, to play with other children and to learn how to act in their following lives.
Watcing television does the opposite with these children.
It iaolates them.
A lot of very important experiences get lost.
The advertisings are often doing it on purpose to impress children, so that they want to have the product and are annoying their parents until they get it.
But on the other hand it is good to desensibilize the young generation with the diversity of all the products.
And also the children need to learn to get on with this situation, that they can not always get what they want.
And if they will never see an advertisement on the television and then suddenly when they are adult are confronted with this, it could be that they can not handle the situation.
Sometimes the spots are not amed for children and show them things that could disturb their developement.
A solution for this conflict could be that those advertisements are not allowed to be showen during a film for children.
But sooner or later they will be in contact with all those kind of things so why should they not learn it as long as they have a parent or an adult they listen to.
Many parents who complain about this are often just too lazy to invest their energy into argue with their children.
I think we should not totally ban the television advertising, but we should also not use the naivness of kids.
Most parents advocate the fact that their children often watch TV and sometimes also see advertising.
Is it possible that a strange television advertising can have bad influence on children aged two to five and have to be forbidden?
Or is this only a claim made by some advertising-haters?
Nowadays, in every house or flat exists at least one electronical item on wich you can watch tv.
Therefore it's difficult to bring up children without to let them see television.
But for childre it is very important for their futur life to play outside, experience the world and have fun.
Research shown, that almost all parents don't know that very young chrildren shouldn`t watch too much television because of the advertisings.
Therefore, informational days for parents with young children would help a lot.
They would also learn, that there exist some channels with no advertising wich are especially made for children.
Advertising is mostly made in tv programmes who aren't made for children such as blockbusters or other films.
In my opinion it depends on how the parents educate their children.
I agree with the following statement; "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed", because first of all I think that young children this age should not even watch television.
To give children the opportunity to have a childhood without television and other electronic devises involved in it,  would vanish this statement.
I for example wasn't allowed to watch television untill I was eight years old and I never had the need to buy something I just saw in the television at the age span of two to five.
The main reason why television advertising directed toward children this young should not be allowed is, that the TV industry takes advantage of children!
I mean, if young kids watch television already, they should have a programme where they could watch kids movies like the Disney movies or stuff like that.
They should be happy with what they have already and not be led in to a world where greediness and capitalism are ruleing!
They should not be jealous of their kindergarden friends because they have a toy more.
Kids do have a big impact on their parents, because if they'renot happy, their parents aren't either.
So if your daughe
Nowadays almost every familiy owns a TV that can be used by the every member sometimes even by young children.
These affect them in different ways depending on what kind of programs are shown on TV.
Sometimes even advertisement can affect them.
Big companies sometimes produce commercials that are directed toward young children.
In this essay i want to explain if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
One argument against this kind of advertisment is the manipulation that commercials can do.
Young kids can not decide maturely so it can be dangerous to them.
Another argument against television advertising towards young children is that after seeing such a commercial kids want such products though parents rarely would buy or can't afford it what makes kids very sad.
An argument in favour could be that it teaches kids a lesson because they can't and won't have eveything in life.
Another pro argument is that kids could be influenced by commecials with good purpose as for example anti-racism campaigns.
In my opinion television advertising toward young children should be allowed but only if they have a good purpose.
A lot of parents put their children in front of the television, to have some time for themselves.
But what do the children see?
And how does it influence them?
Children learn a lot by seeing and hearing.
They want to do the same thing like they see.
If there is an advertising, in that you can see a child playing and beeing happy, the child in front of the televison wants to play the same game.
It influences children heavily.
They ask their parents for that game.
But an enterprise wants to be successful and uses every possibility to be more successful.
It's just naturally that they produce advertising for children.
A teenager is also influencable and it's allowed to produce advertising directed to them.
Every generation is influencable, where is the diffrence between young children, teenagers and adults?
Children cannot decide between reality and fiction.
An adult knows that he is watching publicity, but a child doesn't know.
An other fact is that children believe everything you tell them.
If they watch advertsing it's possible that they believe in something that's not true.
This can cause harm.
Children don't have any money, they cannot buy anything.
If they want something, they have to convince their parents first.
I think television advertsing directed toward young children can be allowed.
The parents have to decide if they want to put thier children in front of the TV or not.
They know that there is advertising.
If their child wants something, they will know that and then they can decide, if they want to buy that or not.
Because of that I think televison advertsing shouldn't be not allwoed.
Advertisement is omnipresent in the world of today.
There is advertisement for every age group and every category of life.
But is it appropriat to make advertisements directed towards young children?
Young children are much easier to influence than adults.
Advertising is often presented in a way to make the product look good no matter what, even if the product isn't as told in the advertisement.
If you put an advertisement for something on tv and kids see it , tey'll believe anything it says.
So if it distorts the reality or only tells the half truth the children would believe it and it could have very bad consequences.
There is a lot of different advertising for children on television at the moment.
Normally this advertising is about toys.
Making an advertisement for toys and putting it on tv isn't really problematic.
It may be annoying for the parents as they'd then have to deal with theyr kids wanting even more toys then they want anyway.
But there is no harm done to the kid.
On the other hand there aren't only toy advertisements for kids.
There are also companies that produce sweets advertising their products espescially for kids.
Sweets are very problematic as kids can't understand that they are bad for our health.
If they see sweet treats in an advertisement they are going to want to eat one.
Ofter parents don't like to argue with their kids so they just give it to them or the children get it themselves.
Advertising sweets very often could lead to a more obese youth.
Nowerdays it is nearly impossible to escape from television advertising.
forteen minutes out of a forty-five minutes fil is just adverising.
It begins early in the morning and ends late in the night.
Not only adultes are influenced by advertissements, but also little children under school age.
It is very easy to influence children with little cute  advertising films for toys.
The parents hardly can do anything against this.
Their kids just want to have everything, what they see on tv and it is nor easy to explain, why it is not possible.
So some people say that television advertissement directed toward young childredn sholud be ilegal.
First of all it is hard for children to understand, why they can not have the cute doll or the little toy warrior, when it is showed in a film on tv.
They start to terorrise their parents because of that.
And this situation is the goal of those advertisers.
They just use sad you children to earn money.
The advertisers state, that they must promote their toys somewhrere, whrere the children can see those and than want to buy those.
The television ist one of the easiest way, because many children watch tv daily.
And for the parents ist is nearly impossible to avoid their kids watching the advertissements.
Further more children under school age mostly can not know what they really need.
They are to easy to manipulate by stupid but welldone advertissements.
In the advertissements every toy looks interesting and funny, eventought it is not in reallity.
When the child finally gets the toy it is not that much fun, as expected.
All things considered my opinion ist, televison advertising directed toward childeren, especially very young children should be forbidden, because it influences the children in a bad way.
It causes many arguments in the fammilies about buying unnecessary stuff.
Childern can not understand, why its familly can not afford the toy warrior, while the child in the advertising film can have one.
They just think, they have mean parents and that the parents just do not want to buy it.
The advertising industry is well known for many years now.
We are all used to it and accept it while watching tv.
But we all know that they can trick you have a big influence on your decisions during shopping.
Is advertising directed towards young children now more dangerous?
Should it even be disallowed?
For me, advertising in general is well known by all of us.
It already got normal and to disallow something that is already normal for people is a very difficult move.
On the other hand, advertising directed towards young children aged between two and five is not really fair.
The products in advertisements do not look the same in reality as they do on tv.
And most of the time the product is not able to do the things it does on tv.
And very young children are not old enough to see that.
They can be tricked very easily and that is the point wehre you have to say that it is just not correct.
Furthermore, young children watching advertisements just want the product.
They don't even care about whether they are going to play with it or not.
During that age, you just want anything and don't say no to nothing.
But the biggest point for me is that children between two and five are not able to buy the stuff they see on tv by themself.
The product shown on tv still has to get bought by the parents.
To summarize, i think that you can't just disallow advertisement directed towards young children.
You would always have to debate about whether for example the toy is made for children aged five or aged ten.
In addition to that,the toys and other stuff still need to get bought by the parents and with them agreeing that the product is good for the kid, there's nothing wrong with it.
I think, that some television series can be very educational for the children to learn more about the world or to learn for exaple English.
But in the age of two to five, the children maybe don't understand the educational television series.
So it is difficult to find the right serie, that you can let your children in front of the television.
The problem which I can see is, that in the television are so many different series, which are making your chose for the best serie more difficult.
I disagree also with the fact, that it can be very usefull, when the mother is in the kitchen and the father is at work.
So you can switch the TV on and you can let the children in front of the TV so that they have something to do.
In such a situation it is ok, when your children watch TV, so that you can cook in calm and you don't have to worry about what to do with the children.
But I think, that when your children wating TV the whole time, it is not good.
You, as a mother or as a fahter, have to go outside with the children or play a puzzle or something like that with them.
It can be very good for your soul and for the children imagination to go outside with them.
They learn how to play alone in the nature.
The fresh air also helps the children to be or to stay fit, not to get sick.
When your children still stay in the house and sitting in front of the TV, they don't run around and keep fit.
I think, that the TV stop the imagination of the children.
When they draw, they use the imagination so the children learn something while doing something with the hands.
I think it is ok, when the children in the age of two to five watch television, but it should not be the whole time.
Maybe on Sunday afternoon watiching a movie together is a good idea.
But the rest of the week you can go outside or play cards with the children.
Television advertising is certainly one of the most effective ways of advertising.
But children don't know how to deal with them and they can't really estimate what the advertisement says.
In this essay I will try to answer the question if it should be allowed to advertise towards young children.
Many young children wath television and if they watch  television they automaticaly watch television advertisememnts.
Television advertisements are often presented like the product is the best thing that exists.
If you don't know that tricky way of presentig a product, you think I must have that thing and if you have this attitude once you won't ever see the negative things of it again.
You can't really teach a child that advertisements exagerate a lot when they present a product, they won't really believe you if they've once seen the advertisements.
Young children also often can persuade their parents very well.
For the company this must be a good way of advertising products, because they can make a lot of money with it.
If you watch it from the parents perspective it isn't very nice because you have to tell your kids again and again that they can't have that toy and the child thinks that the parents don't like him anymore.
I think a child of the age two to five shouldn't be wathcing a lot of television anyways.
If he does nevertheless it should be also a part of the teaching of the child to show him how to deal with advertisements.
They should learn that advertisements don't really show the real things and they can't just have anything they want.
I think this problem is also  because of our luxury standards.
If we wouldn'thave televisions we wouldn't have this problem.
All in all I think you can't just forbid it because fr the companies it's a way of making money.
We know the television is a real problem when it comes to manipulation.
Even adults struggle with it.
We see new iPhones, new tablets, new furniture and everytime we see it we want to have it more and more.
It is enough that adults are confronted with this problem.
Why should we then let television manipulate our children?
Advertising is a huge business in today's society and it makes some brands get extremely popular and rich.
A lot of money would get lost for brands like Playmobil, Barbie and Lego.
These brands want to do something good for our children but technically they are just stealing our money because they manipulate our children to realy wish they had these toys they see on television.
Most of the time parents can't resist but buy their children what they want because of course they want to make them happy.
In extremely bad cases the children can't stop to wish themselves new toys.
We have bad issues with the unbelievable high consum in our world, which is not going to get better if we let television manipulate our children to even buy more stuff.
If we stopped television advertising directed toward young children it would have consequences for the brands, like a lower sum of income, but finally with or without advertising, when the children see toys in a shop they want it anyways so it won't make them exremely less money.
It would just prevent the fact that children should not be manipulated.
At the end it would be a huge improvement for the respect towards children because they won't get used for their naivness,this iswhyI think it should be forbitten to do advertising towards children on television.
There are a lot of reasons which speak for television advertising directed toward young children and also against:
So beginning with the cons: 
- First we have to mention that there are maybe some parents who hate it that her child have the desire to have a product because the child saw it on television.
- Then we have to say that it should be the last thing to make advertising because which parents want to break the desire of the child.
Continuing with the pros:
- Why should we forbide things like that?
There are so much limitations in our daily life, I speak about laws.
- I think the parents should be enough strict with their parents so that they can also say "no" to a personally desire from their child.
Then the parents can play another film for the chidren so they have time for taking heroin and go to the toilet because of their rectal disfunction.
- Bolassi would say it should be legitim to show advertising directed toward young children.
The television as we know it is a significant invention and has taken the globe by storm.
In his beginnings there was not this unbelievable selection of channels from all around the world.
The opportunities are endless and it is by now not just where to ... us.
There are endless functions, so for example the app Netflix you can download without problems and enjoy the latest TV shows and much more.
But it is not just fun: If you decide to watch a movie on a saturday night, have you ever count how much time you waste by watching the whole advertising?
Oh dear!
It is way too much.
So which arguments to prevail now?
Television advertising has become a real problem it is not just about the amount but also about the contents.
Throughout the years they reached a whole new image.
But the biggest problem are the young children, who grow up with the myths transfered by marketers.
Little kids are easy to manipulate and develope because of fake information and input a false state of mind about things like success, money and fame directed toward the advertise.
Marketers want them to believe everything they say.
Children at the age of two to five are until then not able to build their own opinion about things, so they think the perspective of the marketers and elders is the way they have to look at things and that they ahve to support the same point of view.
It not just about the superficial things they show us on TV screen, in life it is about the little things.
But they never even looked behinde the masquerade, why would they, they are kids!
There is television advertising for everything: toys, food, games, cars, everything you could imagine.
In my eyes it has become a real problem and the negative arguments dominate for sure!
Television advertising directed toward yound children should not be allowed!
Watching Television today isn't possible without seeing lots of adverts, which are trying to convince us to buy or do something.
People seeing said adverts can either resist them or not.
This goes for people of all ages.
My question is, shouldn't we teach young children to resist their wishes to buy something they saw on television?
First off, I want to list some arguments which might be bad about television advertising directed towards toddlers.
Children are said to be more gullible, we all know it; someone told us a fantastic story and we instantly believed it because we couldn't know why this shouldn't be true, why this person would lie to us.
It's the same with television advertising.
If someone tells toddlers to buy something for example a game, because it's funny and super cool they would want it, because why not, but then they can't have it because their parents might say no and they are sad.
But I mean, why shouldn't they see those adverts about this game they like, the parents still take contol over their child and it's not like a five year old could even grab his purse and go buy his beloved game.
No.
The parents can still say no and teach their kid to not listen to the adverts.
Worst case scenario would be, the toddler throws a tantrum, but in most situations like this, he will calm down and forget about this game.
And the parents could even profit from television advertising directed toward their toddler.
They might see the reaction this game got out of the kid, and they know what to buy him for christmas.
In my opinion, we should educate our children and let them watch those adverts, teach them how to resist their urges.
And, it's maybe even easier for the parents to know what to give their little one for his birthday or christmas.
I'm watching a nice show on TV and suddenly advertising.
I don't like it but whatever.
I just switch to another channel but again advertising.
Everywhere those adverts.
Since some years there are even adverts for young children.
In these following lines I'll talk if those adverts toward young children should be allowed or not.
Some arguments, from the side that think why it shouldn't be allowed, are for the sakes of the parents.
Young children can be very greedy when it comes to stuff they want.
So if they see an advert and a toy, they then really want, in it they're going to ask the parents to buy it for them and if not they will cry until they get what they want.
I often did that when I was young but there were no such adverts.
But now we live in 2016 and everything is obtainable in the internet which means that it's a three step process to buy something and the young children of this generation know that.
If I'm honest, I don't think it shouldn't be allowed.
What bad influence can it have for the young children?
They don't even have to watch these adverts if they don't want to.
I don't really mind what kind of adverts they are.
It just gets on my nerves when they interrupt a good series again and again.
My personal opinion is that they should remove all adverts in general because nobody likes them.
As a child I used to watch a lot of televison.
While watching my favourite series like spongebob or Bob the Builder every 10 minutes there were television advertisings.
They were annoying but I still watched all of them.
Usually the advertisings were about the newest playmobile or the babrie, which didn't interest me though.
Suddenly there was an advertisment about a spongebob figure which can talk.
I wanted it.
I told my paraents about it but they never bought it...It was frustrating.
Should television advertising directed young childrean be allowed?
Well the advertors know that childrean are very influencible.
If they just show a simple barbie figure a lot of young girls are going to want it.
Or if they produce little cars all the boys are gonna tell their parents to buy it for them.
And here we have a critical point.
The childrean don't think much about the money which their parents are spending for them.
The producers of the advertisments could just crave an amount of money for a simple products which should'nt cost more than 3-5 dollars.
But advertors and producers need to get their money from somewhere.
I think televison advertising should be allowed because of the fact that others alao need a way to get their money.
It's not the job of the advertors and producers to take care of childrean
Advertisement is a very present phenomenon.
It is all over social media, everywhere you go there are billboards so big you can not possibly oversee them, it is on television, in books, etc.
and in this essay I will talk about why it is not fine to direct advertimsement directly towards young children.
The goal of most spots on TV, most billboards and all the other ways you can advertise a product is to make us feel like the product is all we have been looking for, the thing we desperately need in our life.
Most of us are so used to advertisement that we do not even notice it anymore but if something catches our attention it is very had to resist the temptation of buying the product.
At a certain age we should be able to rationally think about our actual need of the product and weather we should buy it or not.
Young children on the other hand are not able to do that yet.
All they can think about is that they really want that toy or whatever is being advertised.
That does not just put the child under a lot of stress but also the parents because they might have to deny their child what it wants.
Of course that is a lesson we all have to learn at a certain point in our lives but it is still stressful for the parties involved.
Another point is that by making children want something through advertisement the companies the childs vulnerability and naivity to make a profit from it.
They push senseless consumorism to fill their own pockets and they use impressionable children for it.
Advertisement is a side effect of capitalism that we have to live with.
Of course not every way of advertisement is bad.
There is certainly no harm in simply talking about a product especially if it is actually useful.
But sadly most advertisements are very manipulative and in conclusion should not be directed towards people who are not able to decide for themselves or think rationally about what their
A lot of children like to look TV but is this good for young children or should that not be allowed?
One argument that is should not be allowed is that the parents can not controll what the children watch and that on the TV ist has also a lot of serie that are not good for children.
But on the other side we can say that it has very good and helpful series and that children also can learn something.
For example a serie in french helps learnig french.
I know a lot of children how learned a lamguage with series on the television.
But the problem is that when children start looking television they can not stop with them.
They are to young to unterstand that a person can not look the whole day TV and that this isn't good for a person.
A third problem is that on the televsion it has a lot of publicity and that the children are perfect victims for that.
So my opinion is that televison is cool for children and that they can also learn something but that it is very important to controll the children durant their televison advertising.
Television advertising is more or less a new thing.
In the past we did not have any television or computer, We only bought what we needed.
But nowadays we live in a comercial world.
You can buy and sell everything all over the world.
Thats the 21th century.
So I think advertising should be allowed.
First of all, young children have no money to spend.
So the parents buy all important things for them.
The children have no problem with the advertising, because they can not buy anything.
They also too young to understand what they really see on TV.
My second point is, that I think young children should not watch TV.
And in this case we have not any problem with television advertising.
They just do not see it.
And I think that is also right so.
They have other things to learn.
Children should play outside and explore the nature and the life.
Sitting infront of the television is not healthy for their growth  and their education.
And my last point in this essay is that if children do not see the advertise, nobody will pay for this advertising service.
Because it would be useless.
And that creates no money for a company.
So this hole debate about the permission or not is for nothing.
Big Companies can advertise with other things.
To put it in a nutshell, I think we do not need this prohibition.
Companies can do it if they want but in the end it is useless.
I want heathy children with experience, not stupid TV people.
Go outside, explore the world and its secrets, but do not raise a new TV generation.
We live in a democracy and we have a lot of rights.
For example to advertise.
So I do not think we need to interrupt this.
So leave this televison with away and be free.
Television advertising is definitely something that has annoyed everyone of us at some point.
Especially disturbing are they when you are watching a movie and suddenly there is a five to ten minute break filled with those advertisings.
The question now is if those television spots should be restricted for young children because they are not appropriate for them.
Young children aged between two and five are still in the state of growing up.
The whole day long they learn and discover new things in their surroundings.
So, we can say, they are highly influencable.
Of course, nowaday there are so many brilliant TV shows for young children from which they can learn so many things.
For instance they can learn how to count to ten or what the different colours are called.
But obviously in between there are commercial breaks.
For the newest shoes or a movie that is going to come out soon or even for another new show on TV.
The children who sit in front of the TV and wait until their show goes on, they watch those advertisings and probably going to be influenced by that.
So if there is a incredible new toy out in stores, they run to their parents and beg them to go and buy them that exact toy.
Nevertheless, even if the advertising is going to be restricted to youg children, there is still a high possibility that they will see advertising for example when their parents are watching some TV shows.
I do agree with the statement, because television advertising has a really bad influence on young children.
So, in my opinion, it should definitely be banned from television.
In this essay I am writing wheter I agree or disagree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Television for young children offers many different shows.
From Bob the constructor to Shaun the sheep a child can find anything it desires to watch on television.
This does not only help a child to widen its knowledge about the world it is now living in but also helps it decide what it build his or her own oppinion and lets it decide what it likes or dislikes in the wide range of shows on television.
On the other hand a child can also experience all these things showed on television by itself in real life, whish has many advantages.
One for example is that it is outside in fresh air and has a way more realistic view on the world than it would have in a living room.
All in all I think television advertising directed toward children (aged two to five) should be allowed just to help a child grow.
I mean it did not hurt me.
When you watch tv there are allways breaks where they show advertising.
On programs for Children like "Super RTL" or "Nikeloden"  the advertising is often directed toward young children.
They show plays and toys and young children thing that they absolutly want that toy the saw on tv.
Often the children woudn't want that toy if they just seen it in a store but the advertising has a psychologly effect on the children.
An that's a big problem the children are manipulatet by the advertising.
In order to do something agantst that manipulation some People say that advertisind directed toward young children should not be allowed.
The Problem with this sentenc is that you often can't see to witch age of children is the advertising.
A LEGO advertising is for children from 4-8 years so it's difficult to make it just for children from 5-8 years.
Also every child is diffrent some children may be more attractet to the advertising for older children.
A solution for this problem would be that the tv programs for children don't show advertising.
An exemple for this would be "KIKA", they know that often young children watch their shows and don't want children to be manipulatat by advertising directet to these cildren so they don't show advertising at all.
I think it's an good idee and more Tv programs should make it like "KIKA" because we have to protekt oure Children  when they are so young.
I disagree that television advertising has influence on all the viewers.
However, I agree that television advertising has an impact on children from the age two to five.
The main reason that forms my opinion is that children at this age start to see the good and the bad.
I this stage they are very likely to develop the consciousness about their own senses and desires.
In this age they also learn how to speak in order to state their level of comfort.
They start being picky about the food they get served because they are aware that spinach has a less plesant taste than candies which are sweet.
They whine about toys they don't have but is shown on television.
Children at this age these days tend to spend more and more time in watching television.
That is because the parents of our modern society are having difficulties to balance family and work.
In order to entertain their children it is easy to just switch on their television at home.
And like I mentioned before these children are absorbing what one told them since they're at an age where they start to pick up behaviours from the adults and start to develop a consciousness.
And still I believe that there are strict regulations concerning the contents of those advertisements.
Advertisment nowadays should only influence your sense about the commercial matter.
I believe that advertising has
In this world, in which we live today, we are influenced by many things.
Other people influence us, our work has an influence on us and all the little things like television can have a bigger influence, than we think they have.
But through our experience, we mostly can know when something has a bad influence on us.
Normally, we don't believe erverything and everyone.
Young children can't have the konwledge, which adults have .They believe always everything you tell them.
Young children don't have the experience to know what is wrong and what is true when they see things, for exmaple in the televiosn advertising.
The children are influenced by adults, the environement and things like televison.
They don't see when something is not a good thing, they always try to act like that, what they see.
So when children see a pretty princess in television, they want to be a pretty princess too.
When they see a man with a gun, they want to have a gun too.
It's a pretty dangerous thing.
Young children are too naive to know the differnce between the real life and televison or fantasy.
I think televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
But on the other hand it's pretty difficult to stop that.
Things like these are everywhere and we can't stop all of these.
I think the parents of the children have to take care what their children see and of what kind of things they should be influenced.
In my opinion, there shouldn`t be any restrictions in this regard.
Parents should decide themselves what they expose their children to.
Besides, which child at the age of two is gonna be influenced by a commercial?
It doesn`t even understand it.
Therefore, the person that is being targeted is the parent.
So i don`t see the difference between this and advertising directed towards adults.
The child isn`t going to be the person that buys the product anyway.
Furthermore, young children are as easily manipulated as teenagers.
It would be consistent to ban adverts in general.
Let people think what they want to think.
Don`t over-commercialize every piece of media that gets in your hands.
Television was only the beginning.
To summarize my points, i think that there is no difference between adverts directed to young children and ones who are directed towards older people.
Allow nothing or allow everything.


To the question, if television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed, we need to disguss their efficiency just as well as reasons they should be strictly forbidden.
Advertising on television directed to young children are a questionable topic, since we don't know how much little children actually understand about the product you're trying to advertise.
You could spend thousands of dollars on creating a good advertisment for a toy, without being sure if the audience is listening to what you're trying to tell them.
On the other hand, you could direct your advertising towards children with the goal to make their parents like your product, because after all, it willl be them spending the money and buying something for their children.
You'd have to make sure that adults are enjoying your advertisment just as much as young children are, to make them want to get your product for their children.
An important consequence of all that advertising might be, that little children enjoy watching TV more because they see things they like all the time.
So if now we would ban any advertising towards young children, this problem could be solved.
In our generation it's very important for us to make sure children, starting at a young age, get outside often enough.
Creating a new law that bans that kind of advertising wouldn't be exactly fair towards all the labels that are producing things for young children.
Without advertisment on TV, there aren't many other possibilities for them to sell their products.
Summarizing this all together, I don't think it's necessary to ban advertising directed towards young children.
As longs as there are nice pictures and music in the backround, even children  at a very young age like something or don't like something.
Also children wouldn't watch less TV, unless they stop showing their favourite show and their parents need to find out somehow what they would like to get their children for christmas.
The Children nowadays get more in touch with electronic machines at a very young age, most of the adults say it makes the youth dumb.
Children should more go out and do things instead of laying around and consuming.
The youth is getting lazier and they getting more obsessed by these little machines.
Parents say the television is good because you can learn a lot from it.
But it's not that what the kids do, they watching cartoons.
The Children learn more of going out and see the world.
The television also sends out some stuff that probably is not good for a kids body.
And when the children are young they can learn the most, their brain is fresh and they have it easier.
An adult has more problems with learning spanish then a child.
With the Television you also make the time rush.
Have of your lifetime rushes with the television away.
In hard words it's for the children an addicition in later life they can't without the television.
More and more time they will sit in front of the television.
I have no television at home and I think my mother was right.
For me it makes me angry if I see children with the newest I-Phone.
I think a child should go out and learn.
The television is bad and makes people dumb and lazy.
I'm also sometimes but most of the time i want to go out.
Every child should have that feeling.
In this essay I am going to look at the question if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
First of all, why should it be forbidden.
There is television advertising for children in every age.
There is no point that makes the advertising for the young children in any kind different from the one for older once.
For example when there is shown fashion advertising on television older children want as well,what they see.
This is not about the age of the children.
Further how should little boys and girls know what they want when they don't see it on the television?
There might be parents that go shopping without their babies.
So the little girl would never see the dolly she wants!
Then the advertising is also really important for chirstmas.
The grand parents that don't know the child really well maybe don't know what to offer him.
So by watching television advertising the child might tell its relatives its wishes.
But on the other hand we all know that little children are fascinated by nearly everything.
So when they see a zoo in the television, they want to go to the zoo.
When they see a little train, they want to play with this train.
Also there is a problem when the parents don't have much money and so can't afford to buy many toys.
Children in this age can't understand what it means to have money or no money.
They just see something they want to have, and when they don't get it, they get sad and start to cry.
Further little boys and girls don't get any poket money.
Older people can buy things themselves by getting poketmoney or even having a little job for example babysitting.
But for little children in every case the parents or any other relative has to pay for whatever a child wants.
Another problem is, that advertising doens't tell the truth.
Mature people know that, they can handle with it.
But when little children see something so exiting they want to have it immediatly because they can't understand that is is just a lie.
Also because the advertisement is moving and there is maybe music and many colours children might find something interesting just because of the advertising not because they like the actual object.
For example when I was small I totally wanted to have such a thing with different symbols on it and when you turn it you'll never know which symbol is coming.
But when my parents bought it for me, I didn't want to play with it because then I found it boring.
Over all I can say that I am against television advertising directed toward young children.
But I also think that the advertising directed to children that don't have own money should not be allowed because I think that in the end this is just a trick to get parents to buy something for their babies that they actually would never have bought if their children wouldn't have seen the advertisiment and so wanted to have it.
Everyone knows how little children are, they change their minds every few seconds.
This is totally normal and allowed because they are children, but for that point it is not fair to direct advertising to children.
In this essay I will discuss the statement if television advertising to children aged to to five should be forbidden.
Adevertises are here to make us buy something.
They try to stimulate our feelings so we might feel in need of the product being advertised and tend to buy it.
Many parents and child protection organisations say such adds should be forbidden in order to avoid the creation of consum and desire in our children.
I understand their position since young children get very easily convinced by something and they might feel ultra dependent on the product being promoted.
But I simply don`t se the function of forbidding such advertises.
In my opinion, it is a parent`s responsibility to teach his child what he/she is allowed to have and at what time.
That is also a good way to educate the child that he won`t get everything he wants when he wants.
My other point is, if we ban adevertises for children aged from 0-5 they will get to se them at 6 and older.
The older a person gets, the better arguments it has, so it will be more difficult to teach him that he wont get the productuct on the advertise.
Older children do also bear more money what could lead to them just going to the mall and get that product by themselves.
Therefore I firmly state that advertises for children aged 0-5 shouldn`t be banned.
It is a good and effective way for parents to teach their children that they wont get anything they se and get them used to se such advertises and don`t feel attracted to them.
Since television has become the number one electronical media for children companies have discovered a new way of advertising.
Chanels like Nikelodeon, KIKA and many more are interuptet frequently by advertising breaks.
Should television really be allowed to advertisise young children directly, since they have such an big impact on them?
Many industries profit from the advertising.
How would two to five year olds be reached if not over the thelevision?
Many new products have to sell and if people aren't interested in them it will cause harm to the economy.
Many adults are glad to know what to gift their children for christmas, for their birthday or for other ocasions.
The fact that because of television advertising many children already know what they wish for can be helpful in such situation.
An other reason why advertising might be a good thing is that the companies pay taxes to the chanels to be able to stream the cemmercials of their products.
If chanels wouldn't have that source of income some chanels for children would transform into "Pay-TV".
Even thought there might be some positive aspects of television advertising direct toward young children there are also many disadwantages.
Many companies
have commercial tactics that help them to sell more products.
Children will always wan't the newest toy and the coolest game.
Such behavior can distress the parents.
It is not only stressful but also very exepnsive.
Many families simply haven't got the money to buy always new toys for their children just to make them confident or make them stop crying.
In my opinion there shouldn't be that much advertising on thelevision.
Not only on chanels for young children but also general in TV.
Generly speaking advertising is common thing in our society and necessary for companys to sell theire products, however in the lates time advertising has got an negative tone.
People are more and more annoyed by the many posters and spots they see during the day and the idea behind it that they should buy the shown products.
When it comes to children in gereral people mostly parents are very concerned about what theire children are confronted with.
By dircting advertisement toward children the companys use tricks to influence the childrens wishes and change theire buying behaviour, so they spend more money or in other words they get theire parents and family to spend more.
In terms of law specific advertising towards children in young age is completly legal like it is for every other age group.
Speaking about economy it is only fair that companys are alowed to make television advertising directed towards children if they could not do this they would lose much income and were left behind compared to other companys which is not what our modern economy stands for.
Speaking about the influence of this advertisement on children there are no evidences that it has an negative influence on children and even if it had it is the responsibility of the parents to not let theire children see this form of advertisement.
As a young kid at age two to five you are maybe watching TV your first time.
Mostly these kids are watching special channels made for children at that age like "Disney Channel" or else.
Like other normal channels they show cartoons, shows and other programs.
And after or between those programs they show some advertising, mostly about five to ten minutes.
But because they show advertising on a children's channel, they have to adjust those advertisings and show something that fits the viewers age.
They advertise dolls, little toy cars and other things that kids normally like.
But should these advertising programs be allowed to advertise young children at age two to five?
Many children look up to their parents and mostly want to bejust like them.
They want to develope and become independent just like their parents.
Children like to act as if they are older than they actually are.
So they also want to watch TV programs with advertising like their parents so they can show how "cool" they are.
For that to happen, kids also need advertising on their cartoon channels to grow up and develope to a person, that can decide alone, if they want to buy something or not.
But many kids just want to watch their cartoon series and don't care about advertising.
They get annoyed by these advertisings and maybe go do something else, or even go to their parents because they are bored.
The parents are also under pressure because when their children always watch advertising, and see something they want, these parents have to buy these toys to make the kids happy.
So also the parents get annoyed spending even more money because of advertising.
Personally I think that the arguments about the parents who have to buy more toys arevery accurate.
When I was little and I saw some toy on TV taht looked cool because of the special effects I wanted to have it very badly.
And my parents got annoyed because I wanted every single one.
Truly kids can be manipulated with these special effects and cool new toys to go to their parents who then have to buy them.
But I also got annoyed about these advertisings myself because I just wanted to watch Spongebob and not advertising about Barbie dolls.
Television advertisement has always been a controverse issue and especially when it is about their own kids, people now a days are very protective.
Advertisement over tv has a big effect on our society, there are many studies that can proove that.
However when you have reached at a certain age you can build your own opinion on something and you can see more clearly what is right and what is wrong for you.That is something that is very different for children between two and five.
They are still so young and don't understand a lot of things in life.
It is in their natural instinct to automatically believe what they see and hear.
They usually don't second guess what they are told.
I can see how this is very helpful for the advertisment market.
If you think about it, they can literally manipulate a whole generation to like something just by showing them positive things about that product on tv during their childhood years.
I am sure that there are many companies who made a fortune with that stragety.
However I think if I would be a parent that would make me really mad.
That is almost propaganda and I would not want to have my kid being exposed to that.
I am realizing just now that that must have been one of the reasons why my mother never let me watch tv when I was young.
She was protecting me.
I also think that it is kind of sad that some companies are specifically reaching out to young children because they know how fast they can make them like their products.
I wish they would give the kids the freedom to make their own experiences and build their own opinions without trying so hard to influence their desicions.
On the other hand I get it, all they are trying to do is to have a sucessful company and to make enough money to pay all their workers so they can feed their families, which then makes their children happy.
When you think about it, it is a cycle.
I think this is one of those issues in life that are way more complex then we think and it is very hard to find a solution that is beneficial for both sides.
Once my sister was four years old she saw an advertising of some barbie stuff.
All she wanted since then was to play with barbie.
She did not want to go ouside playing with her parents and after a while my parents just bought this barbie for her.
Firstly I have to say that money making is a major pro argument.
Like the example at the beginning much parents act like that.
These advertisings are a big part of the money making system of the concerns because the child has only to cry a little or mock around and voila, they have their barbie or superman action figure.
Secondly, these advertisings don't actually hurt someone.
If you are against them or don't want your child watch it just turn off the television.
There is no need in watching these advertisings.
Lastly for the pro arguments i think that at the end the child has fun with the toy that is shown in the advertising.
Even though the child don't have to buy it, it is not that big of a deal for parents who can afford a television.
On the other hand, children might be to much into the product shown in the advertising.
For instance, if you don't buy the toy to your child they might cry as loud as they can or just mocking around.
So it is better to remove such advertisins from the Tv.
Now the second contra argument is, there is no need in having always the newest and mot expensive toys.
Not even  long time ago , children used to play outside and didn't care if they have the best toys.
They made their toys by themselves.
Finally my main contra argument is that these advertisins show only the good part of their products.
How many times have I wanted something so badly and when I had it, it was just a big disapointement.
This is the same with these advertising stuff.
They present it like it is the worlds best toy but the truth is, it just isn't.
Lay and large, advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
It is much better to go and play outside and get used with friends rather than playing home allone with a toy that isn't even that good.
Advertising 

The new medias has changed a lot.
So also the advertising methods of the companys but is this okay that we do not have the controle over this think and we can not decide if we want to see this stuff or not?
The compays use the televison to make their new products famous.
Also a lot of small children see these thinks but this ist not acceptable.
The parents can not control what their children see in televison.
There is some advertising you do not want that your kinds see this.
But you can not all the time look what your children are doing.they become a ba influence from the televison.
the kids also do dot know what they see and they do not know what they want.
But if the kids  see everyday a new toy and the want to play with this the parents have to drive every day to the toysRus this is realy anoing and not useful.
The stess wich the parents than have.
Nobody want this.
But we also have to say, that advertising is a part of our community and is a fixpoint in our lives.
It is difficult to not allow it.
And it`s  a part of being a Mother or a Father to look what the kids see and what they do not see.
But what makes a smal kid in front of a televison?
Is it realy necessary that the children have to took into this stupid thing.
The advertising comanys have to use they halthy smartnes and the know what they can show the kids and what not.
Advertising 

Imagine your child comes walking up to you just to ask you if you can buy him this really cool toy he saw in the TV.
At the moment it is allowed to make advertisment towards any kind of age.
But if we prohibit TV advertising towards young children (aged two to five), this situation won't happen to you too.
First it must be said that children younger tahn six shoudlnt be watching TV anyways.
Moreover, that more advertisment boosts our economy, butyou have to keep in mind that it only brings more money to the toy companies and to be honest do we really wanna help them even more?
In addition the advertisments help the children to learn to misstrust, but there youhave to think if this really is what we want, a world lead by misstrust and lies.
However, i think that children are to young to decide for themselves if the things they see in the TV are true or false.
Furthermore it indeed is very easy to influence a children i mean if you teach them a new word they will constantly repeat it and share it with their friends.
Exactly the same happens if children see something in the TV.
They will go to their friends and tell them about the great toys they saw in the TV  therefore they also make advertisment towards their young friends and the advertisment will even influence more young children to the worse.
Children also want to buy whatever they see and alot of parents struggle with the earlier described situation which in my opinion is not necessairy to happen to them in there allday life.
In conclusion there are alot of strong arguments but some where better than otherrs.
For example that the children annoy their paretns with unimportnt things.
Therefore I think you shoudln't show advertisment towards young children.
There are a few reasons why advertising companies aim their adverts at children as a marketing trick.
Firstly, a child is easily influented and is more likely to believe what it sees and what it is told than an adult might be.
In its naive beliefs, a child can get easily attracted by an advertising and that is all an advert is used for.
If, for example, morning cereals are advertised by a friendly cat and somehow shows that whoever eats them gains supernatural powers, what a lot of cereal adverts do in a way, a child sees the advert and instantly wants to have them.
Mostly it a subconcious feeling which leads to screaming children in supermarket because they do not get what they desire.
Parents want to calm down their child and buy it.
Secondly, children have a great influence on their parents too.
If they want something, they often do not accept a "No!"
instantly.
And like it is said above, a great amount of parents are too annoyed by there screaming kid and fail at calming it down, so they do it the easy way and get the child what it wants.
I think that adverts aminig at children should not be allowed, because they misuse the children for marketing reasons.
Not to mention that it makes bringing up children a lot more difficult for parents, because they have to decide between the two optoins; saying no to their beloved child or spending money to calm down their child, which brings up extra pressure.
I have to add that the first option is the harder way, but leads to a child that knows what a "no" means.
The second option is, in my opinion, a lack of good parenthood and is just a lazy escape from bringing their child up properly.
From my experience I can say that the second option is not the minority case.
Television advertising directed toward young children

As we all know children start watching televiosn at a very young age, becasue of that there are also a ton of advertising directed toward young children, for exapmle for a brand new toy, or a new flavour of their favorite sweets.
Now the question is, if those advertisings directed toward yooung children should not be allowed.
At my point of view there is only one argument that is against this statement.
With those advertisings the children get to know all the new stuff, that is new  on the market, they get an idea of what they could wish themselves for christmas and the advertising companys can make a lot of money with that, because who can't resist the big, shiny eyes of a cute little child .
I know this isn't a good arguement but right now a better one doesn't come to my mind, because I totally agree with this statement.
That those adervtising should not be allowed is from my opinion a really good idea, because as Î already said at the beginnig, children start watching televison at a very young age and they shouldn't get overwhelmed with all those new toys etc.
that they are suppost to need.
Advertising in general makes you feel, that something is missing in your life and, that you can't live without this new anti aging creme presented by a women with a perfect matt, younglooking skin.
Children shouldn't feel that way at this very young age.
It's definetly not healthy to always want and mostly also get everything, children should learn, that you can't always get what you want in life.
And these
So for the future I hope that those advertisings directed toward young children are not allowed.
The porupose pf this essay is to have a brief look at the above mentioned statment talk about my own oppinion on this subject.
Television advertinsing has become a big part of watching different episodes on telvesion.
Not only can it be very annoying and stupid, but also can it be harming for small children.
As a first point I would like to mention that television advertising has no point of learining new things, or understanding something better.
There is no aspect of gaining new knowledge, at leat not to small children.
It is said that television advertising can make small children become impatient and loud, since their brains are uncapable of storing so much information at once, so much information that they don't need.
Small children have no chance in understanding the language that is being used in different advertisements.
They are lacking of vovocabulary and they can't find a cotext between the advertisements and daily life.
Although there are many negative aspects, I would like to talk about some positive ones.
Advertising is the marketing of real life products, which small children will use someday.
So,why not showing and teaching them as early as possible about products they might need someday.
As a last point  I would like to mention that television advertising will be a point of life someday, since small children will grow up and get older, they will be face to face with advertisments, so why not start showing advertinsments as soon as possible?
By lookimg at the above mentioned arguments, it is clearly to be seen that for me television advertising directing to small chiildren is no good idea.
There is simply no aspect of learing and understanding, but more of annoyance and stupidity.
So, I my oppinion television advertings should be forbidden to small children.
Well in my opinion Television advertising dierected toward young children should be be prohibited, because they are not mature enough to know what they see and they can't really understand it.
Also if they already get inducted witch advertisment at such a young age they're going to be alot easier to manipulate through the media because they are so used to advertisment and media presence.
It's especially dangerous since the advertisment was created to especially influence those young children.
On the other side you could say that because they are so young they won't understand it and so it won't become a problem later and the only thing that would happen is that those children would ask their parents more frequently for a gift and so some may also argue that this could only boost the economy.
Also advertisment is something so common today that it would be really hard to draw a line where it is advertisment especialy designed for young children and when it is ust advertisment for children.
Alot of people probably also don't care because I mean how could advertisment be harmful in any way?
In my opinion that's exactly the point why it's important to prohibit this kind of specialized advertisment.
Even though it isn't harmful, it's not good to exploit your young child to so much media.
Children need to be able to grow up without already being influenced in such a young age by advertisment or the media in general.
So there for I think it would be a good idea to ban advertisment designed for children of such a young age and maybe even ban advertisment that is specaly designed for specific groups in general.
We as a society should try to raise our children as independent as possible so they have abilites like critical thinking when they become adult's and that's why we can't let them get exploit to advertisment in such a young age because if they ust watch tv all the time they won't think themself and they also won't question anything,.
They will become mere puppets of the media and we have to prevent that at all cost.
In the current day and age the usage of advertisments is becoming more and more obnoxious.
This includes not only direct and obvious marketing such as television commercials but also much more subtle ones.
One question which often arrises in the discussions surrounding the topic of ads is, whether one should be allowed to directly target children with these marketing campaigns.
While proponents argue for free speech and the right for companies which target children to be equally represented in the media, opponents claim that children can be too easily influenced and are therefore not suitable for direct advertising purposes.
The main reason why I do not see a ban on commercials targeted at younger audiences as a suitable measure is due to the fact that companies which produce children's products would be shut out of a market they desperately need to stay profitable.
A company which is not legally allowed to advertise suffers heavy losses, because it is in direct competition not only with other "children companies" but also many other companies which aim to offer toys and other entertainment goods, which are not banned from advertising their products.
Also, children's inability to decide to buy something on their own means that the ads cannot directly lead to a purchase.
On the other hand, although they cannot directly buy it, they are still able to be influenced by commercials, and much more so than adults.
While they will not buy the goods themselves the pressure exerted on to parents, if their child sees a toy he wants to have but the parents cannot afford it, is immense.
Banning commercials aimed at children would therefore reduce that pressure and allow parents, especially of lower income, to surprise their children more and make more decisions regarding the toys their child should play with.
From my personal experience, the pressure of a young kid who wants to get a toy is not that big of a problem because children that age usually lack the memoric ability to hold on to a wish for a long time and can easily be distracted by another toy.
Therefore, I do not think that the opponent's argument holds as much weight as the proponents, leading me to the conclusion that television advertising directed towards young children should remain legal.
Children are very easy to influence.
By showing them food, toys and other things that they like but do not already have, the chance is high that they try to persuade their parents of buying it for them.
Furthermore, television for children is made to show them different stories and characters with which they can identify.
Television advertising interrupts these stories and movies children are watching and with that, their concentration towards the story or storyboard.
Showing the children more and more of toys that they do not even need, makes them addicted to it and has brainwash potential.
On the other hand, advertising is always on television, wether it is directed to children or not.
In this case it would not be wrong to direct advertising especially to children instead of adults, it is even more interesting for them.
Advertising can not only be found on television but all over the place.
In many cases it is important to have the skills of reading to understand the meaning, which children of five years do not already have.
With television advertising that includes the written and spoken words as well as pictures of the product, let's say of a barbie, children start to compare the letters and the voice and try to understand it.
Through that, reading and auditive understanding are improved.
The other advantage is clearly made for the toy and movie industry, which produces the products treated in the advertising spots.
The consume-behaviour of children is totally different than the one of their parents.
Children at an age of five can not really consider wether they need something very bad or not.
If they have success with convincing their parents of buying the things they want, the industry can make a big success out of it.
To sum all the arguments up, I agree to the statement that it should not be allowed for the reason of influencing children and trimming them to consume more and more.
Of course it depends on the point of view and especially on the interest but  children should learn on their own to decide if they need something or not and not be brainwashed through funny TV-spots with their favourite songs and colours in it.
Nowdays the tv is one of the most important way to spreat advertisations.
Many people talk about the bad affection of the television advertising on young children.
First of all children can be very easily be manipulated.
Whatever comes out of the television children take a example of it.
If a advertisation for toys comes up, children mostly go and begging the parents for it till they buy it.
Thats how the producer sell their expensive toys.
Secondly the advertisation disturbs the children during watching their favorite serie or a film.
A children should be able to watch tv without any unnecessary breakes.
On the other side it can have positive afffection to the children.
There are also advertisations on tv for good things like futher schools etc.
which can educate the children.
This essay is about television advertising directed toward young children that are aged between two to five and if such advertising should be allowed or not.
There are many controversial arguments which makes people think about the new type of situation we are confronted with at the moment.
Nowadays technology is used and found everywhere and also getting more modern every time something new is released but does this allow industries to influence our children on buying or more precisely on wanting new stuff through a new method of adevertising?
Parents believe not so!
For loving parents that are not extremely wealthy and are not able to buy their children everything they wish for makes it just more difficult with this new type of advertising because they know they cannot afford a lot of things that are shown on television.
They also do not want to tell their children no everytime even though they would love to say yes and buy all they desire.
That is a disappointement for the children that can be prevented.
On the other hand there are people that think otherwise and claim that it is not that bad.
Children are mostly playing outside and do not watch television all the time so they do not even see the advertising that is shown therefore will not get influenced in their opinion.
Still are parents frightened.
Not just because of the financial situation but the types of advertising there will exist.
Children are actually really easy to read and influence, which most of the adults know.
Which is a problem!
We do not know or are not certain which products or what they actually advertise for.
Surely it will be about toys most of the time but what if not?
What if it is something dangerous they advertise for that the kids should not even think of?
This is what worries a lot.
However do most people not care about this allowance at all.
This generation is our future and it is not a serious issue that we have to work on right now.
If they are able to have a good education and the possibility to study and afford things they would like to buy, the rest does simply not matter.
No one will know about that in a few years anymore.
People should focus on things are important and depending on right now not later.
Therefore we see there are many different arguments which show the different sites about advertising toward young children.
In my opinion it can be allowed but not used that much so we do not influence their behaviour in any way possible.
Children nowadys should still be able to experience a wonderful and carefree childhood like we did.
In my opinion this statement doesn`t make any sence.
Why should television advertising be bad for young children and why should they even watch it?
There are hundreds of channels nowadays so they or their parents can easily zap through the channels if they don`t want to watch something.
The television advertising with erotic or brutal components aren`t streamed during the young children are awake, so they can`t see them.
And why should those children want to buy anything showed in the television advertising?
I think they wouldn`t even be interested.
If they are watching their favorite series and don`t want to switch the channel, they have the possibility to make something else during the advertising.
Since they are children, they can play with their siblings or their toys until their series will continue.
Actually it doesn`t even take a long time.
The longest advertisings are around 10 minutes.
Another point is, that the television channels can`t control who is watching their program.
So they couldn`t stream any advertising no more just because a young child may be watching it.
If they would have to stop showing advertising, they wouldn`t get the money of the advertising-producers.
I`m sure some channels need this money to keep them existing.
Otherwise there could be a channel less.
This would make those people mad, who watched it and liked it.
Of course the parents can control what their children are watching, but they have the full right to decide by themselves, what they want to show them and what not.
To forbid television advertising wouldn`t make any sence to me then.
It would create more problems, than it would solve.
The best option for the channels, the advertising-producers and the people who are watching television, is to keep it up how it is at the moment.
Advertising

A lot of liitle children grow up with a televison and with televsion you also have advertisement.
Some Advertisement is good some is bad.
Some People like avdvertisment some not.It all depends on the person himself and so you can choose if you want advertisement for your child or not.
And now the question comes up : Is advertising for young children good or not?
You have Advertisement all over the world.
For Food, for clothes, for parfumes etc., so it's impossible that you can grow up without advertisement.
Young Children are addicted to advertisement cause if they see something they like in tv, they want to have it.
And you know how little child are, they won't stop crying and be bad with you aslong they got it.
And so companies can manipulate parents with their own childs.
On the side of the companies it's a good tool to sell their products, because adults won't buy ( normaly) stuff they don't need.
And with their childs they have a weak point.
It's sounds really bad but that's the reality.
And with that weak point, companies can sell a lot more products.
On the other side parents want to buy something for their child and with avdvertisement they see what their childs could like.
But you have so much advertisement for anything that you have problems to check out if this product is even good.
On my opinion i would let the companies made some advertisement for young childs just for some companies.
Like Toys a Rus or Franz Carl Weber or some Free time parks like europa park.But for all other companies it shouldn't be aloud.
Cause these companies won't sell good products for childs, they want to sell cheap products for adults and they use the weak point child.
In my opinion, it should not be allowed.
we live in a time where eveything is advertiesed, not deciding wether it is good or bad for humanity.
At that age not a single child has the conciousness and knowledge about themselves as much as we do at our age.
So if it would be allowed, we would be brainwashing them by trying to make them want things without them even realizing what it is or what it is used for.
We know that advertising is a small for of brainwashing.
For us (say, adults, adolecents) it is easy to relativate wether something is good or bad, if the things we see on ads are things we need or do not need.
Because we know what we need and what we do not need.
a young child may not even need that thing and only want it because it sees happy children their age on TV.
Ads for youg children tho would be sad in my opinion.
I think that children that age should be used to playing outside, playing with friends, playing with their parents, they should be learing to talk well and not to sit infront of some kind of computer looking at something they do not need (if they did need it they would already have it at that age) and not socializing.
These days a whole bunch of things are online and digital and it is believed that every generation is used to more technology than the last one.
This is good i think.
But only if they learn by it.
Brainwashing children by adverts however, is not considered very educational.
And therefore should not be allowed.
This raises the questions; if it were allowed?
would that generation be completely different from ours?
a counterargument for this is that young children like that, do not even have the competence to really understand it, and "they just see some pretty things on TV".
True, but a child between the ages of 2 and 5 really does not understand what they are watching, but we underestimate what stays in a young  subconcious without us realizing.
These things are so much more delicate than we might think.
On the other hand it is fascinating to see hoe fast they catch up and understand connections between different things.
in conclusion i think i would be acceptable to show them cartoons (as all shown cartoons on TV are tested and proven to be fine to show young children) but not try to talk them into talking their parents into buying them stuff at that age.
In the modern world advertising becomes more and more important.
You cant step out of your house and not be bombared by dozends of advertisments.
Even the children are nowadays a target because of their influence on their parents.
I think that somewhere there have to be limitations regarding the age.
Of course there are some realy good reasons for the advertisments for children.
These days the content on television is suffering because fewer people watch television than before.
Many people have even refused to own a tv because of the poor content.
The children channles are also forced to alter their programe.
Somebody has to pay for their cartoons.
This problem would be solved if companies could make money with them.
The economy would also grow because the consumation of goods would grow.
The society would profit from that.
Of course the parenting would be a bit more complicated because of the many wisches their children would have.
On the other side though children would become conditioned from an early age on and woulg probably think twice before buying stuff when they reach their teenage years.
This on the oter hand has a negative effect on the economy and would destroy our financial system because a psychologcal responce to adverisments is crutial these days.
My biggest problem is that the companies manipulate children who are not able to take dessisions yet.
That is a very dangerous development.
To conclude there are a lot of arguments against and some good reasonst for the advertisment allowing.
I think that our society is used to the order and rules of our world and to change such vital things would mean to make dangerous experiments.
Are we really ready to do such things?
Todays television is full with adertising.
Mostly they are about toys or food for kids.
They affect them in positive and negative ways and scientists now claim that this advertising should not be allowed.
As soon as kids see a new toy in television tehy want to have it.
As consequence their parents have to buy it because else their child will not stop crying.
Most of the parents do not want to buy their kids so many things and want that this advertising stops.
One positive aspect of advertising for young children is that the brands which are selling those toys gain a lot of money because every kid wants this new toy.
And also the televison companys are gaining a lot of money because lots of brands want to make their advertising there.
I think that this advertising should be allowed but maybe their should be less of it.
I think parents should learn how to say no to their kids and children should learn how to accept that "no".
That is an important thing to learn in live and if all this advertising is not there anymore those children will not learn it.
Everyone at the age of two to five watched television.
We looked cartoons, sports etc.
Our parents did not allwoed us to watch televison when the programm is +18.
But after every serie there is an televison advertising which is allwoed to person over 10 for example.
Now the question is, schould televison advertising directed toward young children aged two to five be allwoed or not?
On a televison people advertising a couple of items.
The aim is to sell these products.
If an young child watch these products and they like it, they claim on parents to buy this.
So the parents get nervoused by their children.
A nother Point is that young children follow everything what in televison is shown.
For example it shows an drink advertisting for sports and you can do life danger things, the child would try this danger things.
The last adventages is that an child can change his attitude with worng televison advertising.
The child is on an age to be grwon up with good attitudes.
So televesion advertising can change the childs mind.
On the other side there is a one plus point.
There are also advertisment which is usefull for the child.
For example there is an advertisment for the drink Evian.
It is showed when people drink water they look younger.
Children want to be young.
To drink water is also good for health.
In my opinion televison advertising should not be allowed.
I think a child should be grown up with parents and not with the telvesion advertisung.
A parent should give the child the future and good opinions and not the televison advertisments.
I think there are more disadvantages than advantages.
In our modern society the media is ganing a lot of attention and power.
With it, advertisemtent is also growing and catches our attention through our daily lifes.
Conflicting children with advertisement isn't a new idea or strategy, it has made now for decades and still is very effective.
Children who see a new toy on television will be given that toy for their next birthday if requested enough.
By the high determination of children in their families today make the advertisment directed toward children even more efficent.
But this is a controversy.
Should parents just buy things that their children like to have or should the parents decide, with their grown up mind, what's good or bad for their own child.
Many believe that advertisement directed toward children is manupulting and stops the developement of the own identity.
I personally think this is not the fault of the advertiser, I believe the fault is on the parents side.
Parents should clearly point out to their children that they should be critic about television especially advertisment.
By holding a good distance with a critical view, advertisement surely won't stop a personal development of a kid and also let's him keep his personal freedom.
Its not good because children are very easy to manipulate.
So they're going to ask theyre parents if they could have the thing, that has been advertised.
When the parents don't buy the stuff, the children will be angry and it results into an argue.
In a few situations, it could be, that the parents just agree, so that the children stop crying.
This means it's good for the company, that sells the stuff, because they make more money, but it's not for the parents.
But this argument can also turned into an argument that's against this statement, because the children could learn, that they can't always have what they want if the parents persist and don't buy them the toys.
So this would be good for them, because they learn a lesson for life.
But it could also be a good thing, because, for example, when it's christmas time and the parents don't know what they should buy for theyre kids.
The kids will see something that they like on Television and they will say to their parents, that they like to have this thing for christmas.
So the parents know now what to buy.
I would disagree with this statement, because, in my opinion, sometimes it could be hard for the parents and the advertising can manipulate children easy, but it depends on the kind of advertising.
Most of the advertised things for kids are just toys, so its not a bad thing.
And the children could learn something from it.
I don't remember any kind of bad advertising for kids, that manipulates them really.
So my conclusion is that Television advertising toward young children schould be allowed.
Television is media which has been used for many decades.
It had some bad times and some better times.
Television programes do not have to be bad or deceiving for the audience.
But it is well known that the media was used for many bad acts which caused  a lot of pain and made the times worse than they should have been.
Do I think that the television should not advertise?
No, I do not think that advertising is always bad for me and other people but the people should be aware that the media is controled by the state or by large companies.
In my opinion advertising towards children is not always bad.
But perhaps the parents of the children have to surveile their children more often and better.
If the parents do their job properly and interfere when the programm is not save for children the advertising should not be of any problem.
But even if that works it does not have to be save or any good for the children because the parents make the decisions if the programm is any good or not and that might be a problem but it does not have to be one.
Personaly I do not think that I should be asked such a question because I have not watch TV for almost 7 years so I do not know if the advertising got any better or worse in the sense of beeing deceiving towards children without care.
In my opinion the only down side of not wathcig TV is that I do not realise new trends at the same time as the other people do.
Telvision advertising which is directed a young group like chlidren from two to five has to be handled withe care.
Children in that age can be influenced very easily.
When a product ist shown to them through TV-advertisment it's often done in quite a manipulative way.
What I mean is the way, a product is presented to them.
All the children in the advertisments are super happy while for example playing with a new doll.
They are smiling and giggling, playing with there friends and it's always great weather.
Everyone wants to have such a life rights?
For children that's a reality they maybe don't have, but they want it to be like that.
It seems like only with those products one can be happy and have such great fun.
When they now go to their parents and insist on getting that knew doll or the new lego set young children can be very complicating.
They often don't let go of their idea and and hardly insist on it with crying, shouting and other actions.
Without such comercials, one would relive parents from alot of trouble and stress.
On the other hand, if someone has a problem with TV-advertisment just don't let your kids watch TV.
Nowadays kids are spoiled with tech and otherthings anyway which manipulated them the same way, so why blame it one the TV.
Furthermore, how should a business producing products for children otherwise show theit product to their targeted client group.
Children that age don't go to town that often or use the internet ore listen to the radio.
The only thing where they get in contact with the big world of advertisment is television.
And since we live in a market economy why should such a business not be allowed to place such advertisment.
If they couldn't revenue might go down people lose their jobs, an industry would be destroyes.
But how about my own opinion.
Well, i don't support the manipulative way some commercials are made, but that's how it is.
If parents can't stand the way their children annoy them in the shops when seeing the products they saw on TV and now lay on the floor and shout that they want that doll, maybe one should think about his or her's parenting and the way they raise their kids.
Maybe TV-advertising directed towards that group should be changed and oprimised, but not allowing it seems like an overly harsh consequence.
Television is a good way to advertise new things.
But the problem is that a lot of young children watch Telvesion and are influenced by those who are directed to them.
So should this be forbidden in the future?
I think that it does not have to be forbidden.
In the age form two to five you do not have a lot of knowledge and you do not understand everything you see in the television.
So I think that young children don't even realize what they are seeing or hearing in an advertisment.
They only want to see their show and don't care if an advertisement shows up.
They maybe only realize something when there comes an advertisement for a toy that seems funny and interesting.
Then they ask their parents if they could have this toy but the child does not have a say in that decision.
The parent decides if they go buy it or not.
So even if they are influenced by the advertisement they can not go buy it themselves and probably forget about it a week later.
So the question should rather be if it is worth making an advertisement that is specifically directed to young children or if it is just a waste of money and time.
Because I don't think that the children get influenced by advertising in a bad way.
Maybe they even get used to it for later and don't get annoyed that easy when they see an advertisement later in life.
Television advertising should not be allowed toward young children.
In the age two to five it is not that complicated to manipulate the children.
They just see a picture of a new toy and they can not say no to them and cry all the time to have this toy untli the parents can't say no and the children get it.
Maybe this is not the same way when the child is two years old.
I think in this age the child can not say specific which toy they want to buy.
If the toy is there and the child likes this it will play with it.
I think in the age of five it is more complicate.
But I think young children in the age two to five should not be allowed to watch television on their own.
The mother or father of the child should be there or should define which movie the child can watch.
So I think the parents can protect their children of television advertising but my opinion is in general that television advertising should not be allowed toward yound children.
Because they can not do something against it.
I think they are to young that they could not believe what people say.
It is to simple to manipulate such young children that television advertising should be allowed.
It is simple enough to manipulate us or adults and ways to simple to manipuate the children.
So I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Television advertising toward young children

Advertisment is in our society follows us everywhere and we see it in television, placards, the internet and magazins.
They affect us in various ways.
Most of them are for advertising clothes or parfumes for adults but some exist which concern small children between kindergarden and preschool.
We do not exactly know how it can affect them.
So the question we must ask ourselves is if it should be allowed to create advertisment directed towards children at such a young age?
Small children are very naive and they tend to believe everything an adult tells them without any doubts.
If a grown up man or woman tells them in television something about how great a product is the kids will most certainly believe them.
They can be influenced much easier than adults in a way their own parents cannot do much against.
For example when a small boy sees in television between two episodes of his favorite cartoon movie that the newest toy race car can now even climb stairs and he sees how other boys in his age have fun with it he will urgently want this toy and quarrel with his parents and try to force them to buy it for him without regards to the price.
Perhaps for that nowadays advertisment is such an everyday accompagnant it is important that also children face it in an early stage of their lifes so they can deal with it later in life.
The parent's task is that they inform their kids about commercials and they should show them that you should not everything you see in television take for granted and believe what you see.
It can be a good thing for young children to learn about such things from an early age.
I personally think that it should be allowed to create commercials for young children and they do not have to face adult's advertisment which they do not understand in their young age and they often contain sexual pictures which is disturbing for young children.
I also think that it is a good opportunity for children to learn about deciding what is fake and what is real which they can do well in children's commercials.
In these days, almost every family has a TV at home and use it regurarly.
The most children come in contact with Television in a realy young age.
The grow up with the TV and are influenced by it.
Television advertising toward young children is a normal thing today.
But should they be allowed to do advertising toward young children ?
One argument against the advertising is the bad influence they can have one children.
They can give a worng perspective of the real world.
They can lead children to think, that the things shown in advertising are things they need to be a "real" girl or boy.
An argument that is for the advertising is, that the advertising shows things the children maybe need.
An add for children is almost everytime in a "childish" way and it can learn them something about the right way to treat other children or persons.
the last argument witch is against advertising directed to young children is, that it can lead them to buy everthing they see in a add and like.
They beg to there parents that they want something and start to cry if they dont get it.
Most of the things in the adds they dont need but if they look cool they want it.
I think that television advertising directed toward young children should not be forbidden, but it should be controlled by a organisation of the
Advertising for children aged two to five

First of all I do not believe that advertisings for children are really useful for both sides for the children and the companies.
I think that television advertisings are not good for the development of the children because the influence of the advertisings affects the thinking of the child permanently.
These advertisings could affect the thinking of a baby for a lifetime.
On the other side I do not believe that children aged two to five will get much out of these advertisings.
Children aged two to five should not watch television the hole day anyway, they should go outside and explore their enviroment.
On the other hand I do not believe that this advertisings are worth the money because children between two and five do not watch that much television and they can not go and buy these products from the advertising so their parents will make the choice to buy it or not.
So the advertising for toys or something else should be adressed to the parents.
In the end I think the parents are responsible for their child and they should know whats the best for their child so they could decide how often their child watch television.
So the parents could decide how often the child is confronted with advertisings for children.
So my opinion is that the advertising for children between two and five should not be forbidden because it would be a unnessecary law beecause in the end the parents can decide if it is good or not for their child.
So the parents are responsible for the mental health of the child.
A child is watching his favourite Television programme, Spongebob.
During the time he's watching this entertainment programme, there's always a lot of advertisement.
Because it's during the day, the advertisments are explicit produced to reach the interest of the kids.
For example there's always this nice advertisment for the new edition of the Lego's.
But is this acceptable?
Doesn't the kids get manipulated and brung to the point where they want to buy it?
In the following essay I'm going to introduce you into my opinion...

Advertisment is a huge business today and it has become very essencial.
The ones who aren't good at advertising are going to fall soon.
Advertising has become so important today, that it controls a big part of beeing succesful or not.
But do they have to advertise at kids from two to five?
I'dont believe that it's a good thing to advertise infront of young children, because they are still so easy to manipulate.
It's clear that many businessmen take an advantage of that.
It's like fishing, you just have to present your bait good, and you will catch one.
Another point is, that you got almost controlled by the advertisments.
If a child sees the new advertisment of Nivea it might think automatically it has to be like the beautiful women in the advertisment.
In the worst case you get so much controlled of the media, that you start questionning yourself and think you have to be like the women in the advertisment.
I don't believe it's good to give the young kids such a feeling.
It just would be a lost of individuality.
So because of the different arguments I'm going to say that I'm supporting a censorship of avertisments for children in the young years.

Engllish Essay

I think the question about advertising directet toward young children is an interesting quesion today, because many children watch a lot of television today.
The adverts are sometimes very stupid and not good for the children.
But I think every company can make some adverts.
Probably it's better when you put the adverts who aren't good for children so like with love, sex and alcohol not between the films or series the children will watch.
It also doesn't make sense, because they won't buy it now.
You should put some adverts for toys or something like that there, that the children want this.
But in general the parents can say if they think the children should watch this.
I think in this age it isn't good to watch to much television, they should go out and play on the playground.
I can't say it's bad when they watch television because you can also learn many thing like the language from some kind of films.
But the problem is that when they watch to much television, they don't know the real life.
The most of this films aren't from the same country, so they also see the wrong cultures.
they lose also he contact to real person and espacally to the family and friends.
But in general I thik the adverts aren't the problem, the problem is that to many young people watch TV or also use the interent all the time and they don't have a reason to use it.
They see so many stupid things all the time don't realise the real life.
In this essay I will write about television advertising, and if it should be prohibited to diect it towards children aged two to five.
With pro and cons I will explain my point of view and how I experienced it as I was a child.
Advertisment is part of our every day life.
Werever we go, we see it on TV, hear it on the radio or pass them on the highway.
But why is television advertising differently?
Probably because we don't have to have a big imagination and the feelings which they want to connect with the product are more real and more easily to transmit to the audience.
Especially for products made for children, it's one of the easiest way to show it during a break on TV.
Children can be highly influenced by television advertisment, as they aren't yet able to completly  disinguish between real and fake.
Reality and fiction are close together and with their  fantasy and the shown product they want to make it to a part of their own life.
In my opinion it's not a necessitiy to prohibit advertisment towards children.
It's part of our society and every one is influenced by it.
It's nearly impossible not to come in contact with any kind of advertisment.
The only thing parents can do to keep their children partly away, is to control what they are watching and to explain the goal of the advertisment.
Television advertising is a thing many of us hate.
Nowadays advertising is to be found everywhere, no matter if you are in a Cinema or if you read the daily newspaper.
television advertising is a very extrem topic.
Because of the time most of us spend in front of a television every day and the amound of people possesing televisions, television advertising is a very attractiv way to prmote products.
Therefore a lot of companies invest in television advertising, promoting their new or old product directed towards their aimed consumers.
Since young children (between 2-5) are not old enough to understand the sense of advertisment, many believe this should be illegal.
Allthough there is deffinitely a point to it, this shouldn't affect children in a negative way because thats where the parents have their part to play.
It is the parents duty to tell a child what it can or should whatch and whats not sensible and therefore don't allow them to whatch certain thing.
Another point of the opposition to this topic is that the advertising doesn't mean children are forced to buy these things and can therefore siply not be restricted.
My personal vew is also against
No television advertising for young children

Sadly also young children aged two to five already watch a lot of TV.
But should advertisments which address this group of people be allowed?
I think no, because there is no need  to address any products at people aged this young.
Young children should not even be watching television at this age.
They should go play outside in real life, not in front of the TV.
If there are advertisments addressing them they want to watch TV even more.
They may see the commercial on a "grown up" channel and then after that a show which is not supposed to be for them.
Sure you can argue that they could only bring these commercials between programs for children in that age but it would still not be good.
One point is also that children in that age are not active consumers.
When you advertise something to them they can not just go in a store and buy it.
They have to ask their parents to get it for them.
So it indirectly would also have to address parents.
And parents usually will not just get it for their childrens.
In addition to that I believe that children will become more of materialists which is not good at any age but especially not that young.
Television commercials are  usually for something materialistic so they would learn to only want to own more and more things.
Children should learn to also have fun without or with few toys.
If you show them advertisments at this age they would learn that they need all these things.
In opposition you can say that some advertisments could help them learn some things, how to use language or learn about specific products.
But there are surer other ways they can learn that.
Some companies use advertisements specially directet toward young children.
They may do this for a lot of even understandable reasons.
But still, some poeple don't think this is a good thing to do.
It's a very discussed topic, and especially parents are against it.
But why?
Television advertising allows you to do a lot with the thing you want to sell that would not be possible in real life.
Using this type of advertising, one can basically lie to the people with saying, for example, that a tv or a computer has this or that function, while in reality, it's actually not true.
This is something you learn while growing up; every advertisement is totally exagerated and you should not believe all of it.
Small children don't get this, they believe in the things they see.
So, on one hand, tv advertisements can kind of manipulate children very easy.
On the other hand, these kinds of advertising, the ones that manipulate the children, can also be used in a positive way.
The children can be made to do something good.
For example, if their favourite movie character tells them on tv to clean up their room, they will more likely do it than if their parents told them.
Even if the whole thing is an advertisement for some kind of trash can, it leads the young ones to do something that is good for them.
As for my opinion, the first point seems to have more importance, since I don't think that small children should be manipulated in any way.
Very little or even never are advertisements meant to do somethiing for the children, they are all made to do the same; to make people buy the product.
I can also understand why parents are against it.
It must be very stressful when their kids beg them to buy something every time they watched tv.
In this essay I will show you arguments for and against television wich advertising direct toward young children.
First of all it's important to make sure that the children actually learn something by watching television.
Young children can learn extremely fast in compare when they get older.
They save many things in there brain without actually know it.
If a TV-program is just telling bullshit to the children, they will also learn bullshit because as a child you will take and use all the information you get from everywhere.
If a TV-program shows senseful stuff where children can improve their english knowledge for example, then it's good for the learning but there is always the danger of getting addicted to TV.
If a child is addicted to something like TV, it's really difficult to take that away from it.
I remember when I was about five years old, I woke up in the middle of the night, maybe 3:00, walked in the televisionroom and watched some TV-programs that we recorded during the day.
Sometimes I just went to a friend watching TV when I told my mum we would play soccer.
Futhermore we don't know that much about what is TV actually doing with us.
Television is existing for about 100 years I think.
Humans are existing for more than 10'000 years.
What I want to say is, that our brain and eyes are not made for something like television.
There is actually a risk to get physicly damaged in different ways by watching too mutch TV or watching TV in general.
If you do this as a young child the damage will be more fatal.
At the end I think adversting television directed toward young children is ok, aslong the content is senseful and makes children learn something that they can need for their future live and aslong it's not too much.
But I think parents have to decide on their own how to handle the risks of getting addicted or physicly damaged by TV.
Nowadays, ads are everywhere.
Whether it is on the internet, in television or in real life in form of posters, etc., everyday we are exposed to brands telling us what to do.
Although no one forces us to buy anything, there is no way to escape these advertisements and even if we might not notice, they are constantly influencing us.
We all are victims of advertisement.
However, we still have the ability to stop that up to a certain degree, because (almost) every adult is able to see things critically and have an own opinion.
But what about children, that have not yet learned what is right and what wrong?
Children tend to believe most things they see or hear.
So when they are watching tv, they will probably also believe the advertisements.
Especially at the age of two to five, children are influenced by everything surounding them, and it is important that parents think about what environment their children are growing up in.
So they should ask themselves whom they want their children to be influenced by.
Is it really brands that should teach children what is important in life?
Do we want children to learn that kinder bueno bars are the only thing that will make them happy, that they need barbie dolls for complete satisfaction?
Do we want them to be opressed by capitalism and fitted into norms, created by a profit orientated, unfair and sick society?
No.
Hence, we should defenitely prohibit ads for children under the age of (at least!!)
five, and much rather teach them real values.
Despite, I personally think that children under the age of five shouldn't watch tv at all, as it can cause harm to their brains, stops their creativity and diminishes their ability to have human relationships.
I believe that there are different methodes how to raise children, so they have a good knowledge about how to behave.
But I really do have a clear opinion about the above mentioned question.
Of course there are a lot of young children who do not know how to order in their thougts after watching a more or less scarry movie on the television.
So I agree with parents which do not let their sons and daughters near the televison while movies are played for adults.
Easy scared children should not have full control about  the remote control.
It's still the parent's decision whether they want their children in front of the television, or not.
There are also a lot of channels which shouldn't be shown to young children, because their really just made for the older ones.
The younger ones wouldn't understand the topic and couldn't learn something about what they have seen.
The news are not really the best show you could show your children, because they would be shocked what is going on in the world, because I do assume that they would definetely not understand one single word.
They would just recognize some terrible pictures.
It's also really important that they do not sit in front of the television all day.
They should play more outside because that's how they envelope appropriately.
The thing is that technology envelopes every day a little more.
Children which are used to tablets, computers and television will have it easier in the future.
They could also learn a lot in tlevision.
I believe there are some cannels for kids where they can learn another language than their mother tongue.
Or they learn how to count, how to spell and also the alphabet.
This can be really usefull and they wouldn't be overwhelmed when they start school.
For me it would have been disturbing if my mother would have forbidden me to watch TV because I knew that she liked to watch a movie when I used to sleep.
I would like to look for a solution: If I ad a daughter I would never forbid her to watch television interely.
I believe they need some rules so they do not get stucked with the shows.
There is need of a time limit.
But they have the same right to watch series as I have.
Advertisments are often an issue which is concerning nearly everyone.
There was a toy you always wanted but never got.
That toy that was in the advertisment after the episode of Whinnie the Poh.
Commercals often tend to give false needs.
But behind the commercials there are companies.
Companies which often exploit yong children to increase their income whith shotrt clips to manipulate the buying behavior of families.
Those companies always use the same china imported products and give them other brand names and colors to make a ilusion that their product is the most satasfaction giving product.
If the children do not get the products they want they are just disapointed and unhappy.
On the other hand advertisments fo young children are not so effective like advertismens for children aged five to ten.
There are two reasons why they can not create a craving that is consistent.
The first one is  that the kid the gets at the moment of watching the advertisment a strong need but is forfeited until the next one comes.
the second reason is that infants are not steong enough whith the communication to tell what they want.
Advertising nevertheless

First of all I think that advertising for small children should be prohibited because they can get tricked very easily.
Also the advertises have a great influence on the children because they do want the things that are in the tv spot and if their parents will not buy it they will be disappointed.
On the other hand children aged two to five should not watch television at all because the are too young to really get whats going on on the screen and they are overwhelmed very fast.
So if every parent would know that watching tv at that age is not very healthy for their children and that they should rather go out and play with them advertising directet toward toddlers wouln't be a problem because they would never see the adverts.
But also the children will not be able to tell whats good for them and what they shoul not like.
So if there is an advert about plastic guns they can not see that this is a very violent thing and thet they should better let it be.
The children will be loving the guns displayed on tv because the ads are made to attrackt them.
Nevertheless adverts towards toddlers are not only seen on television but also on the street, in shops and in magazines.
So why should television spots that are made for small children be forbidden?
Even if there will not be any televison ads for children they will still see these ads only that they are printet and no longer on television.
In conclusion I strongly disagree with advertising directet toward toddlers because as I said they can get tricked very easily and the ads do have a great influence on them.
Even if they don't watch television very often they will come across spots that are directet to them so we should prevent that they are going to love gunviolence only because they saw several advertises about plastic guns.
I think I disagree with this statement because first off, the advertisting can't have a big impact on the children since they are far more interested in the show they are watching anyway.
Even though young children are more easily influenced, the only thing they can do afterwards is annoy their parents with what they want.
Maybe the early TV advertising even is a good thing, as it teaches them that they can't always get everthing and they get used to adverts at a young age.
This is especially important nowadays, when the whole world is full of adverts and things you could possibly need as well.
You can't protect your child from every sort of adverts,because if it is banned from TV, there will always be other forms of manipulation in everyday life.
Also, children can't go and buy stuff on their own.
They first have to convince their parents that they really need and want it that they can get it.
This assures that the parents approve of it and that the adverted product can't harm their child.
I think especially as a new parent you have to learn how to deal with a child's wishes.
So television advertising might even be good in some kind of way.
It helps to teach children how to deal with overwhelming impressions of things that are made more important than they actually are, and they teach parents how to  talk their children out of something they don't even need.
But, as to everything, there sure are bad sides to this.
Especially children with rich parents could get anything advertised in TV, which would lead to many spoiled kids.
Later in their lifes they could have a problem balancing their finances.
The discussions about whether the kid should get the advertised thing or not could escalate into arguments between parents or parents and kids quickly.
In extreme cases, this could lead to an unhealthy family relationship.
But in my opinion, those kind of things are only exeptional.
So overall I think television advertising doesn't harm children and hasn't got a strong influence on their lives.
And because of that, I disagree with the statement above.
Should television advertising directed toward young childer, aged two to five?
Or should it be prohibited?
A reason why it is okay that childerns look advertising is, that they live in a world where the televison and the media has a very important part in our lives ( especially if you live in europa or USA)  and you everywhere see televisons.
You have to be confronted with the tecnology and learn how the deal with it.
An other reason is that childs get influid really easy, the believe everything they see.
So if the things that they got showed aren't good or the only want to manipulate and convice the childs of buying these things, it is a really bad infulence.
On one Hand the advertising can help to find out what you like or doesn't like.
For example if they see a horse in the televsion it's possible that they start liking horses.
Its away to find outwhat you like and what not.
On the other hand in the advertising are many stereotypes.
Like the girls like playing with barbies and boys lke playing with strong soldieres, castels etc..
Its in this moment were the childrens get introduced in the society.It's a bit like they couldn't choose what they like.
They see young boys playing with a dragon, so they also want to play with a dragon.
The same happens with the girls.
But with barbies instead of dragons.
i personally think it okay that advertising is directed toward childerns, but in a controled way.
There has to be  always someone who tells the childerns that what they see is not everything in live and that a boy also can play with barbies if he want to.
There are very much more reasons and argument in favor and not in favor.
But i think advertising should be prohibited if the goal of theclip is to manipulate and convice the childs, because that is really iresponsible.
It's a way to abuse of the childs.
I dare say that it nowadays it is quite normal to watch TV.
It indeed is a source of entertainment, but the frequent advertisement can be extremely annoying.
But event worse: It has been claimed that viewers can be unconsciously influencned by this and that it can be harmful for children.
Thus, discussions are led to find out whether children should be allowed to watch television or not.
Recent studies have revealed that people who watch advertisements tend to buy the products which they have seen before rather than other products.
By streaming the advertisement on television over and over again, viewers might build up an unattended relationship with the product, even though they would not have done this if they didn't watch these advertisements.
Especially younger children are not able to resist that temptation.
On the other hand, people still should receive information about newer products.
It is the parents who are responsible for their children, and they should not give them everything that they want, or that they have seen on TV.
Also, it is claimed that children are more risked to become addicted than grown ups.
As they watch more TV, they will therefore be more confronted with advertisement that is directed towards them.
On the other hand, children sometimes adore to watch the advertisements, as they also want to know what's on the market.
So actually they do want to watch the advertisement, they aren't forced to watch it.
My concluding view is that children indeed can be influenced quicker than older peopole.
Therefore, advertisment directed towards them should be regulated, without being totally forbidden.
Even more important is that the parents are aware of that their kids can be influenced.
They should not allow their children to watch TV literally all the time, they are responsible to dose the duration healthily.
Children at the age of two to five can be impressed and influenced very easy.
Companies want to reach the individual person to buy their product.
And companies that direct their advertisements towards the children use them to reach the parents because parents are the ones with the money, not the children.
But parents would never see a toy on tv and say I have to buy that so these companies need a stream to reach their customers.
A child is influenced by an advertisement and the parents are influenced by their child and so the parents buy the product.
The idea of this would be good but it might damage social aspects of the children.
They cannot seperate advertisements and normal tv shows from reality.
For example a child sees an advertisement of a sad person that gets happy with chocolate and when the child is sad at the moment it tries out that chocolate and gets happy again.
In the time the kid is eating its chocolate it`s getting happy again but maybe only because it forgot why it was sad not caused by the chocolate.
The only thing the child will remember is that it was unhappy until it ate chocolate and from now on the child will always eat chocolate when its sad or angry or depressed.
That was just an example who knows if it has serious consequences and the child will be extremly overweight in the future, but it can really influence what the child thinks and can have higher damages in the future.
I think that the companies should wait until the child really understands the meaning of advertisements.
First of all television advertising means all the adds during the break of a film.
Now the question is, is it legal to direct one of those adds toward children?
Now I think that the young children are much more easy to influence them so I think it's a clever marketing strategy of those big concerns for example LEGO or other things like that.
And which parent wouldn't love to buy to their child the newest action figure or comic or whatever.
It's also the charg of the TV channel which adds they bring at wich time but for me it's their right to place those add spots at the right moment so that as many children as possible are watching TV.
It's as well a question of money.
It's obviously that the channel gets more money when they put the adds at the time the concerns wants.
On the other side I think it's not correct to use young children as a moneysource and so maybe to make the family poor or less rich.
It also depends on what they are selling.
Many concerns sell stuff that is getting better and better every month and so every child wants to have always the newest one.
So for me it's manipulation and is's a really dirty strategy.
All in all my opinion is not clearly on one side.
Well I a critical point are the parents.
It's their "challenge" to don't let their children watch to often TV.
I think it's llegal to direct advertising toward young children as long as it is children stuff so it can't contain erotic stuff or something like that.
In this day and age advertisments are all around us.Everywhere we go, we can either see them or hear them.
With the use of hoardings, banners, internet, media, radio or television it is almost impossible to avoid them.
Advertisments can play a big part in our lives, hence, they can influence one in a negative or positive way.
But is it really a good idea to let young children be influenced by it, especially through televison advertising?
Young children haven't developed fully and aren't really educated yet.
Televison advertising has a bigger influence on youngsters then on adults.
Children tend to believe everything one says on televison.
There are many children who spend a lot of time infront of the TV and parents do not really pay attention to what their children are watching.
It can be quiet dangerous and it could also have a long lasting impact on the childrens future life.
Advertisments can be alluring and come over as really good, but sometimes they are just a trap, a sham to make the companies rich.
Advertising child toys is probably one of the most succesfull ways to make loads of money.
When children see a new cool toy or game on TV, they automatically want it.
They could start to beg their parents for money and it   could put families who are financially unstable in a corner, because they want their children to be happy.
Televison advertising or any kind of advertising could be dangerous for small children, so I suggest that they ban it or at least make less advertisments for children.
Today it is normal that also very young children watch television.
It is just a simple way that the children are calm and parents have time for other things.
In the TV, there are advertising directed toward young children.
But is it a good thing to put little children on the couch and let them learn something in the television and then they were influenced from special advertising?
To sell toys it is a good way to show them in the tv.
An argument for the advertising is that it is the opinion of the parents to let the children watch tv.
If they don't like the advertising, they should use the time with the children without watching television, then the companys need commercials to sell the products.
An argument against is that in the tv children could learn a lot with special series.
But there are breaks and a lot of influencig of the children with commercials.
They have to watch it and it isn't fair that so young children are already influecend from the television advertising.
They can't have an own opinion and this is bad for our society.
In my opinion, tv advertising directed toward young children is not a good thing but the companys need it to sell their products.
I wouldn't support it, but when you don't want the influence of it for your children they shouldn't watch television.
But the parents should think abour it and make how they want.
In the end it is just an opinion of the parents, because the children are to little.
I agree with this statement, because I think when television advertising directed toward young children, it's very bad for them.
For example there is a clip about playmobil and a young child sees it, they want to have it so much.
They go to their parents and ask them again and again until they have this toy.
But when the don't get it, they will be mad and angry.
So when they wouldn't have shown this clip on the television, the child wouldn't even wanted to have it.
So actually it's bad for kids because they think they need something they don't really need, and their parents have to buy it, to don't make their children mad.
And there are also adverts which aren't really good for kids to see them.
There are often nearly naked people, which isn't nice too see at the age of two to five.
But when you are the seller of this toy or of something else kids would love to have, it's a good way, for you, to show advert in teleevision.
Because young kids believe or admire the things in the TV and they're so easy to influence.
Maybe not all, but most of them.
So it's a good way to sell your things.
In my opinion, there shouldn't be so much advert in TV.
A little bit, maybe at the evening or in the night, when the kids are in their beds already, would be okay or even better for me.
But I think, it's also in the parents hands, if they don't want their children to see all the adverts, that they don't let their children watch so much TV.
It is widely maintained that TV advertisements are seen every day on the TV program.
More and more brand are getting used to know that advertisments who are directed toward young children are more efficent than advertisements who are directed to elder children.
Studies have proven that young children aged to two and five years will insist on buying the things they see on TV than elder children who are more elevaged.
Due to this reason the advertisements are economical more efficient.
On the one hand most of the parents will agree that the adverts should be forbidden.
These are mind tricks to get the children with the parent to the shop and buy all the things they saw in the advert.
Even if the parents deny on buying all these toys and foods the children will insist and even cry.
So the parent has no chance and he must buy the things his child wishes.
The argument of the parents are understandable the adverts are really mean, these young children don't have an understanding about money or other possesions if they want something they'll get it.
In the other hand these adverts are very efficient they are directed to the young children.
Most of the money from adverts come from whom who are directed to young children.
They are the one you can easily influence.
They will
instist on everything and the parent will buy them everything to make their child happy.
Until now there aren't any laws opposing to that, the brands can make a lot of money until there will be made a law from the government.
All in all it is to say that these adverts are really good on the economical side.
The brands can make a lot of profit since they are advertising directly to the children.
The parents and other activists aren't keen on that.
These adverts are really mean because they are directed to children.
The parents can't say no the hole time they can't deny to their young child who insists the hole time.
These adverts should be forbidden.
During our childhood we all saw some kind of advertising, more often than not very flashy and brightly coloured.
They came in between parts of our favourite cartoons and wanted us to buy some new toy.
I'm here today to discuss wether or not television advertising directer towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
I personnally agree with this statement because firstly most of the time it doesn't interest them.
On the second hand they don't have any money.
Third they could be easily influenced in their lifechoices.
First thing is children usually don't care about advertisements because they watch TV to see other things.
I concede that the doubtful choices of colour can attract the eyes of the children but after a while it doesn't hold their interest anymore.
For example when I was a kid I watched cartoons on TV and I was always annoyed when suddenly some kind of advertising popped up and cut my emission in two if not more parts.
On conclusion advertisements aren't useful when the target doesn't want them here.
Secondly kids can't buy anything without their parents.
Thus the advertising doesn't make any sense if the decision to buy doesn't depend on the target of it.
To exemplify I'll take a four-year-old who saw something on TV about how cool the new Gameboy is.
The child goes up to her parents and beg them to go get one.
They say no and the little girl can't do anything about it.
This proves that this way of acquiering new buyers isn't effective because even if the will to buy is here the targeted audience doesn't always have the possibility to get the product.
Last but not least if a child is overwhelmed by pictures of what he/she has to buy as a boy or as a girl, it sends the wrong message to them.
It conditions them to think that a woman has to do the chores and take care of the house (and loves pink by the way) and that a man has to be strong, to love building things and to play war.
I know some kids that once into teenagehood discovered that they could do what they wanted.
TV advertising is wrong because it perpetuates the stereotypes of our society.
In conclusion I'll say that it isn't useful be
Television advertising is just a method of many to get people in the store.
I think it should be allowed to make televison advertising directed twoard young children if there are companies which want to spend money for that.
There is no reason against it in my opinion because I believe that childrens aged two to five should not be in front of a televison.
So no childrens that young would see such comemrcials.
I suppose that the impact of those commercials are not huge, because it is not the childrens who decide to buy it or not.
Parents should be responsible that their kids cannot get affected by such stupid commercials.
Companies should think about what commercial they will do and who gets directed.
I would say it is wrong to do televison advertising directed toward young children because the childrens should not be in front of a television or at least not completly alone.
Children that age cannot decide from what they get affectet but teir parents can and should avoid stupid things.
It is alright if childrens watch a episode from their favourite serie but it is absolutly not okey if childrens watch four houres.
In my opinion it is better to do advertising for such young children then do advertising for adults on a channel that is manly watched from childrens.
"Television advertising"

"Television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
this is a clear statement but should we really forbid this kind of advertisement?
On one hand it is easy to say: "You shouldn't advertise your products to a target audience that is aged between two to five years old."
Simply because they are easy to influence and it would be unfair and not right to tell them what they should like and should want.
But on the other hand TV advertising clearly works on grown up humans.
We still let ourselves be convinced by advertisements on what we should like and what not, what we should want and what not.
So shouldn't we ban all advertisements?
A second argument would be that if we really banned ads for children between two and five years old a lot of people would lose their job.
First of all, all these people engaged in these ads would lose their jobs.
Camera men, directors, people who write jingles, advertising companies even the TV station who would show these ads would have to find something new to fill this spot.
And let's not forget about the people who are advertising this product.
Companies who produce games or barbies etc.
for small children would have to close because if they are not allowed to advertise their product, they aren't going to sell it well enough to survive.
A lot of these companies would have to close and with that thousands of people would lose their job.
A third argument would be that children aged between two and five years old should not be let watching TV a lot.
Especially because of medical reasons.
If the parents don't want them to be exposed to TV ads they can also show them movies without any advertisment in them.
To conclude I have to say that I'm not a big fan of TV advertisements.
I didn't like them as a child and I don't like them now as an adult.
Yes you are easy to influence when you are a kid but so are we as adults.
The big problem I see is that advertising has grown into a huge industry.
You can't just tell them they should stop targeting little children with their ads.
They will simply switch target to the mothers or fathers.
I myself think that it is good to be exposed to advertising as a child.
You'll learn quicker that you don't always get what is promised to you in ads and I think it will help you later on in your life to not always believe evrything that is being told to you is true.
It's better to get used to it early on than just being isolated from the world we live in and once you are an adult, away from home, you fall for advertisements and have to learn it the hard way late in your life.
Why not?
Companies need to sell their products somehow and who should they show their products to if not to the one who will eventually use them?
A child who sees a advertisment for a toy does often want to have it.
Of course they won't get every single toy the see on TV but on christmas or their birthday they will probably have many know what to wish for.
Also the fact that the child won't have all the shown toys will make it learn that in life you wont be able to have everything you want immediately or at all and they will appreciate the gifts given to them even more.
Depending on what the advertisement is for, it can give the children some inspiration of what to do.
The generation of children is growing up with so many technological advices like cellphones, tablets, etc.
that they don't know anything else than playing a game on their mothers phone.
In advertisement children are often shown playing outdoor with each other which is in my opinion very important for their social development.
Are children to naive to have their own advertising?
Kinderschokolade , McDonalds and many other companies are doing television advertising manly directed toward young children.
Now some people question the society if it shoul be allowed to exist or maybe it would be better if Happy Meal and co. is banished from the televisions.
It's certainly true that children , especialy of the age of two to five, are easly manipulated to various parts.
But gives this us the right to stop commercials only because our child is to naive to understand it ?
Let us take the example of McDonald's and the Happy Meal.
Every view months McDonalds is brining a new toy for the Happy Meal on the market.
For sure it is a way to sell more because everyones knows that children like to collect.
Surely now in some parents heads an alarm in rining and saying it is not good to eat with the children often in McDonald's and that it maybe is even evil.
But we should be faire with each other.
If an super healthy foord concern would be able to pack our child's interesst as much as McDonald's do we all would be super happy and noone would be against it.
The same goes with Kinderschokolade.
If they were not chocolate but for example tomatoes or carrot-sticks would be still be against it too?
Imagine a super healthy and happy child on the package and insidesome yummy carrots.
Certainly it would be a huge succes.
France as an example in television advertising had brought this theme to a whole new level.
they must write at the bottom of every commercial a sentence like : " try to not eat during meals " or " Try to advoide eating to salty or to fatty food " and so on.
That's a way too so solve the problem and to still not forbidding a comercial.
In my opinion it should be absolutly allowed to direct commercials  towards young children.
It is way of bussines and marceting and it should be the responsibility of the parents to watch over a childs behavior or like in my examples "eating habbits".
But if we should be chaning something i think France is doing it quite good with the sentences at the bottom even if not every child can read them.
I think television advertising is the only way to influence a child to eat healty and to have a stable life.
Nowadays television advertising is a very important marketing tool.
They are made carefully and it is supposed to convince the audience to have a desire for the product they are advertising for.
Ads can influence a person emotionally and inspire them easily.
It's something visual and that's why people can fall for the ads even easier because we like to believe in what we see.
Children like to spend time in front of the TV and watch cartoon all day.
Certainly they are not going to switch the programs because they are way too excited for the following one.
And while the kids are waiting for the next cartoon, advertisements will show up.
Which is actually not a bad thing because they are sometimes quite entertaining in my opinion.
But of course all those ads give the young people a desire to get those products next time when they are going grocery shopping with their parents.
Depending on the child's personality it can react dramatically if the parents refuse to get them a toy they have seen on the TV.
But there are also parents who want to make their kid as happy as possible and keep getting them whatever they want which will make the young children spoiled without them realizing at that young age from two to five.
Although at the end it depends on how parents are taking actions towards different types of ads and how they are going to deal with the desire which their child got from television advertising.
Now that I mentioned different types of ads I want to say a few things about it.
Myself I've never experienced any bad influence from a TV advertisement and I believe that people make sure that most children program are safe to watch.
However there are also very inspirational ads I've seen in my life such as an insurance advertisement which can be very touching.
I remember crying because of an advertisement from an Asian insurance company.
If people will support the company is our decision.
But at the end I still learnt something out of that advertisement.
What I am trying to say is, with ads you can basically talk to people all over the world over the TV screen or any other types of screens.
That's why I don't think it should be forbidden for kids to watch television advertisements.
To sum up, television advertising can influence people's mind easily but how we are going to act after watching it is our decision and the parent's responsibility.
Television advertising is a good method to convince customers about certain products to buy them.
Children do also watch television and there are advertisments directed towards them.
In my opinion, advertisements like that should be allowed, because advertisments are usually positive and do not scare children.
The only problem would be if the advertisment scares the children.
If it doesn't, I don't see any negative point about the advertisments.
I have to admit that it is quite difficult to point out something positive, but especially in their younger years humans want to play something and with advertiments children might be able to discover something new (e.g.
Playmobil, Lego).
Furthermore, with new technologies like Swisscom TV it is possible to skip advertisments, so children usually won't watch advertisments.
By the way, I would never ever make an advertisment for children aged two to five, because these children are normally not able to convince their parents to buy a product.
I think, children who are so young are the wrong target group.
To sum it up, advertisments for young children should be allowed if they aren't scary, because that might have a negative effect on them.
But otherwise I think it is absolutely fine to make advertisment for children aged two to five, because there is no other negative point in my opinion.
Nevertheless, as mentioned, I would never make television advertising for this target group, because usually these children aren't able to convince their parents about a product.
Since the drastical change of the industrial revolution and the beginning of the modern era mankind started to consume more and more.
Not only products, which are essential for the survival like food and drinks but also luxuries started to become everyday consumables.
With this drastic change a whole new science got the spotlight of univerities and scientists, the economical sciences.
Today we are used to being confronted by flashy and intriguing advertisments with every step we take and people of all ages, from toddlers to pensioneers, are targeted by a vast variety of companies.
In this essay I want to discuss the moral behind advertisment aimed towards children between two and five and if there are any risks that need to be taken into consideration.
On one hand it seems perfectly logical to aim advertisments towards the need of little children.
Reproduction has been essential for the survival of every living being and by adapting and adding this special stage of our life to the laws of economic we not only create a bigger benefit for the market as whole but we also support families and toddlers where there is a need for knowledge or help, for example if the kid suffers from minor medical issues and the parents are not capable of finding a solution.
The parents also are guardians and protectors of the kid and as grown-up individuals are capable of saving their children from dangerous influences and deciding what is best for their well-being.
On the other hand does the age not tell you anything about the maturity and knowledge of a person.
Even parents can be tricked by sly companies with good-looking advertisments.
Nobody but the little child himself would have to bear the consequences of such a fraud and as a fragile being the worst possible outcome is certainly the death of the infant.
Another argument agains advertisment for toddlers is that advertisment create a false image of society.
During 18 years kids and teenagers are tought moral standards but the deepest rooted ones are the ones created in the early childhood.
It's not possible to let companies control and educate the consumers of the next century and therefore it brings a high risk to destabilize the whole market.
In consideration of everything I have to say that it is delusional to think one could exclude toddlersand their consumables from the market.
But there certainly is a need for various people and institutions such as parents or the state itself to control this advertisment and make sure it does not cross a line or starts acting out of pure greed for benefit.
As always it's a fragile equilibrium that needs to be supported by everyone.
There are different points about allowing and not allowing television advertising directed toward young children.
The question is which are more  important than the others.
In case that children at that age should not be watching television I would say that there is not a reason to forbid television advertising directed towards them.
The parents themselves are responsive for their children and when they do not want that their children are influenced by advertising they should not let them watch television.
But considering that nowadays television and mobile devices in general are getting more and more important there maybe is the wish of having some laws to protect the children.
They are very fast greatly influenced by almost everything.
But it is obvious that a child of two years can not even realise what it is watching there.
So this argument is not that strong as it seems.
Another point to let this advertising allowed is that buying things supports the local economy.
Of course children at that age are not having as much influence at this as other generations, like teenagers for example.
But in some degrees they maybe could help with their wish to have everything they see.
So in conclusion there are wether more good nor more bad points about television advertising directed toward young children.
But in my opinion the most important thing should be that children at that age should be playing and not watching televison.
Because then the advertising does not matter.
Nowadays television is a very important topic.
Especially when it comes to small children watching TV.
Along with the TV program there comes a huge amount of adverstising.
Many people say that watching television in young age should be forbidden anyways.
Some parents let their kids watch TV too early nevertheless and the kids are confronted with adult advertisement, especially late at night.
Few may have the opinion that a regulated amount of TV a day does not harm their child while watching TV with their children.
Like that, parents can control unwanted advertisig and channels and turn of or change the progam if the content is inapropriate.
Todays advertising is full of things that might let kids get in touch with social media too early.
Dating websites, computer game advertising can often be dagerous ang kids can get wrong ideas of social life.
Talking about problems with advertising, i personally think that kids should not even watch television with five or six years old, except for child programs.
Those do not show any inapropriate content that might scare or disturb kids of young age.
I would not let my four year old child watch TV unattendedly.
Just because i know how weird advertising can be sometimes.
I think everyone of us knows this funny, creative and inspiring advertising videos in the television.
Usually ,we have a advertissment in mind, while thinking of a particular product.
We get to know new stuff through television and it feels like, advertising is a powerful weapon.
When I was a kid, I saw all these beautiful must-haves and I was thinking, why can't I have to have this.
And that is how probably every kid thinks.
But what influence does it have through the day, does it change our way of living in a positive or negative direction, or do we do not change at all?
Is it bad, letting kids seeing such things, or is it okay?
A positiv aspect is that kids get to learn to handle things they could have,but should not have.
That is education, because when they see so  many things, they have to realise and to learn that they have enough and that they do not need more.
You can not hide everything from your kids.
In specific space, they have the oportunity to grow.
A disatvantage is that, if they do not have any parents looking after them, who actively decide what their daughter or son is allowed to do or have, it would be highly possible, that they get badly influenced by what they see.
Especially their social activities would get disturbed.
All in all I believe kids being so young should not sit in front of the screen.
They should first learn to enjoy what they have around them and not focuse on non-realistic, virtuell entertainment.
In my opinion, if there is a kid, watching television with this age, no one has to pay attention or has to change anything, because in the end, you do not know which series this child is skipping through, so you will never have a hundert per-cent control over the different kids ad the lessons and experiences they learn and make through the television.
As you may already heard of, the television companies earn their money through advertisment.
If it would be forbidden to show such short videos, television would not exist anymore or we would have to pay a lot of money.
Summing up, there is totally no reason to do anything differently, this should not be the thing, we should fix our eyes on.
Already between the age of two and five years we have a huge problem with the children.
They are sitting in front of the television watching their favorite series without communicating to other young poeple.
At all there would be a lot of postitive points putting a sign and say that`s not allowed to watch TV for children between two and five.
They would automatically prefer playing oustide and making friends.
Not only that.
If we know what`s happening in the TV show sometimes, we should really change the rules.
But on the other side I think the series of small children on "Super-RTL" or something like that is a good point for the imaganition and the phantasy.
They even learn something by watching TV and that`s the positive point of it.
Not only this, it`s a kind of living into the aged person.
They already know how to use it.
On my opinion it shouldn`t be changed a lot but it should be controlled strictly by the parents.
The children may watch maybe only a half an hour per day or something like that.
Bacause the most impotant thing in life is communicating to other pepole.
You cannot afford poeple to watch TV, they should realize themselfe, where they should stop.
That`s just a kind of human intelligence.
And because of this it shouldn`t be changed anything.
We have a number of questions to ask ourselves, when examining this statement.
Is the child being psychologically harmed?
And, is it moral to indoctrinate and influence a child of such a young age?
I don't think it is moral to indoctrinate people through television advertising at any age.
Why?
Because  since who we are and what we think is always a result of our surroundings.
Even talking to someone is a form of indoctrination.
It is basically impossible to forbid indoctrination.
If you take a look at how many children are forced to go to church on Sundays, where they are taught to believe, rather than to think.
Or at school, where you are taught to obey and be disciplined.
Fox News for example: This form of indoctrination, to me, is simply disgusting.
A political agenda covered up as news and facts.
We are constantly being bombarded by other peoples beliefs and what they think.
So I think the most important thing is to learn to think for ourselves.
That is the only way to resist indoctrination.
Anyway, at the age of two to five, when you can't really think for yourself and when you rely on good people to take care of you, I don't think it is harmful to watch an advertisement.
Because at that age you couldn't care less what the telly tells you.
It is far more important what your parents say and how you are treated at home.
The advertising to young children in television

It is clear, that nowadays where more and more children are alone at home while their parents are working.
They often spend this time with the television running in the background or even actively.
While they are doing this, it is early evening or even afternoon.
The channels realised that and send advertisments suitable for a childs eyes.
They love to see the brandnew Lego or Playmobil sets and spend hours imaging how it would be to have such a set.
As soon as their parents arrive at home, they try to convince them to buy such a thing for their child.
Many people claim now, that it is mean and rude from the televison channels that they bring such a problem to the homes of young families.
But I have to say, that these channels make it exactly correct, what should they advertise if not playing things for children?
It is the time of the day where mostly young human beings watch tv and the advertisments for typical adult things like razor blades or new films would make absolutely no sense, as young children would be scared of the trailers.
The objectivity of an advertisment is, thath the product will be bought more often and this can only be generated, if the people who can and will buy the product will watch the advertisement.
To the people who say that it should not be allowed to make typical children advertisements I can only recommend to visit such a channel headquarter where they decide what, how and when they advertise their products.
On the other hand I can understand the problem the parents face, because it is really mean for them if their children come everyday with a ney tow they want to buy.
Another factor is, that these advertisements often show things like special effects which the actual product will never be able to do.
So therefore the children get frustrated and angry and this is not what a parent wants.
My final conclusion is, that it should not be forbidden, because then it would even get worse.
In the current time, it is normal if there is much advertising on TV, and there are also not many rules about how the companies have to do their advertisings.
The television advertising should not be allowed to be directed toward young children because influencing them with advertising is not ethical acceptable.
In the following, I will show my point of view.
Firstly I will show the positive side of allowing television advertising directed toward young children.
The most important point is that the companies want to influence young people for getting profit of them or their parents.
This is the selling-tactic of the most companies of the world, but especially showing kids television advertising is much more effective than showing the same television advertising older people.
Secondly, it is also well for the economics.
The more younger people watching television advertising and are buying the products, the more jobs are getting created.
And these jobs prevent the people of getting poor.
The positive side of television advertising is strong, but the arguements are not ethical acceptable.
However, there are many negative arguements.
First, television advertising directed toward young children should not be supported by any estate, because it is in any way incorrect that companies are allowed to influence younger people.
Furthermore, it is not ethical acceptable that a company influence young children because every person should have the freedom to think how they want.
Another point could be the cost for beeing allowed to watch television.
Espacially in the estates like Germany or in Swizerland they could get troumendous.
At the end, television advertising directed toward young people should not be allowed because the negative side is much heavier than the positiv side.
So many parts of the today's television is the advertising, when we watch it in the evening there is an advertising break about all 15 minutes.
What about the young children?
Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
We could say that it is difficult to forbid it.
When the parents of the child watch television and there are advertisings for the new Barbie and the child sees it and wants to have it, it is still the parents decision if they buy it or not.
It is also the question, which advertisings are for young children, because they could see an advertising of a chair and would like to have it.
Mostly the advertising for a product for a child is not for the child, it is for the parents.
So the parents can see what toys there are for little children and in the end it is their decision to buy it.
Also how could the companies which sell stuff for children get the attention of the parents without television advertising?
If the advertising directed toward young children was forbidden, the companies would not be able to sell as much as they do when the advertising is allowed.
On the other side we could say that it should be forbidden, because the companies manipulate the little children who can not question the products or the things the advertising says.
If the advertising was good they could sell everything to the children.
As little children are, if they want someting, they want it really much.
So they could get into trouble with the parents.
I disagree with the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed", because the parents of the child still have the last word, so the manipulation would not work.
Also because I think that the advertising is not made for the children only, it is made for the parents.
For me either the television advertising is allowed for all generations or it is completely forbidden.
Of course it is necessairy to put the adult advertising in the adult channels, but I think it is clear that there should not be a banking advertising on KIKA.
There are many ways of advertising.
You can make a television spot, a radio spot or you can hand out papers.
How you advertise depends on what you want to advertise.
If you want people to go to the casino, you wount advertise directly towards children.
So this is an important point.
If you have a doll or a new lego-house you want to sell, you have to advertise directly towards the children.
You have to use a lot of colours and make your product lool like it's the best thing on earth.
You are able to influent young children very easily.
They don't think so much about money and how usefull something is, as adults.
When they like something, they want to have it.
Even if in a few months there will be a new, better doll.
Television advertising is one of the easiest ways.
People who watch televison have to look at the spots during the breaks.
Especially when it's a nice spot, they will start to think about your product.
And as this is your goal, it's the perfect way.
It's not easy to advertise something directly to children.
They don't often listen to the radio and they don't go the the city.
So televison advertising is one of the only ways you can make them wanting your product.
But is it okay to abuse the fact that these children are so easy to influent?
Everyone is influentable.
The advertisin-industry works with influenting the people.
They know what you have to do, to influent a person.
It's their job.
Television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed, because of the fact, that there aren't any other ways to advertise a product.
Even if it's moraly incorrect.
Advertising 

The advertising, especially on television, is always in the news.
Is it good for us or should it not be there?
Many studies at universities in the United States have searched an answer, but none of them ever had a well solution.
With advertising many people make really much money.
So they and also others, maybe us, can not live without it.
But should television advertising directes toward young children (aged two tho five) not be allowed?
Firstly, the advertising should deffinitly be allowed.
The children schould live in the same world like the other people -the adults.
Why should you forbit the advertising there.
Then other questions come like: With wich age should the advertising be allowed?
Can you control that younger children do not see such thigns?
Moreover the whole cities are full of posters and televisions, wich want to sell something.
Secondly, this young people are just to young to get overflushed with so much advertising, that we see every day.
Now they just sit more on the television, instead of being outside and play with peers.
Furthermore they see so many toys and things they want to have.
One one hand side it is great for all the shops.
They have then much more income.
but what about the parents?
It is difficult to tell a child, that they do not get this toy or this game.
Finally, is to say, that television advertising directed toward such young children should not be allowed.
They are just too young to can get on with this whole material.
It is best they can just watch their one or two favourite series a day without this breaks.
Should one prohibit advertising toward children?
This is a question that must come from different groups in society.
There are the parents and also the advertising companies.
The parents are most probably against is.
Firstly, advertising uses manipulative methods to gain the attention of their aim group.
The message "buy this product immediately" is commonly used, even though the advertisers do not directly indicate this in their commercials or advertisements.
However, advertising is also a billion dollar industry, and can make the advertisers extremely rich.
The more people see it, the more people are going to buy the product.
Children's attention is easy to get, so it's even easier to make them or their parents buy products and so it's easier to make money with them.
Advertisements also have bad aspects, especially for children.
They feel the urgent need to buy the product, and if they see someone else buy it, they get under pressure because they want to be like them.
My opinion on this is that one should not start advertising towards young children.
Sitting in front of a tv in your childhood is one thing, but then being encouraged to be materialistic and greedy by ads is even worse.
Kids should not want to buy things that they actually don't need.
Wanting to have a toy, for example, is different from wanting to buy a toy that someone said is all fun and games.
I think that kids should express their real needs, and not those a company made them think they have.
The television adversiting directed toward young children is, as it says, made for children aged 2 to 4.
So I won`t discuss in my essay the content of this advertising, because I never watched TV at this age, but the consumers.
In my opinion it`s no good to let children watch TV.
At home, we don`t have a television and I don`t and didn`t miss it.
Like this I could, when I was a child, always go out with friends and play in the garden we have.
I`ve learned so many things with just going out, which I think, can`t be learned better or at all.
Also I think that we are only one time in our life children.
So it`s really sad if we miss this time because of a television.
I always say:,, You can watch television all your life long, why do you have to begin as a child?``
A very important example in this theme for me is my exchange, which I made in France.
Last six months I spent there and learned a new style of life.
In the two families I was, there was a child.
In the first one a 8-year old boy.
In the morning he stood up very early, at six-o-clock I think.
Because his parents didn`t want to get up this early, he sat in front of the TV.
When he got home from school, he watched TV until we had dinner.
Then he went to sleep, but before sleeping he played on his Play Station.
In the other family, there was a girl at my age.
During the schooltime, she didn`t watched much TV, because she had to do much homework.
But as the schoolholidays began, she sat in front of the TV from 9-o-clock in the morning until the mother came home at 5-o-clock in the evening.
That`s what she did the whole holiday long.
I know, the two examples aren`t really connected to the age of 2 or 4, but in my opinion it`s the ending of children, which began watching TV in this age.
I really think it`s sad if children or teenager have to spend all their time in front of a television.
I also hope that in the further time, we will change something on that.
It`s a problem, which in my opinion the adults have to solve, because te children are to young to get rid of this adicction.
Television advertising direct toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed

Nearly every family posseds a television and in most cases it`s a everyday use to watch television.Young and Old, all of them like to spent their time with watching films and series.
But shuld young children should be comfrontated with this virtual world?
Thirst it must been said that the Tv has becomes an important role in our life.
In the job, at school at home we can`t think about a life without a television.
So why shouldn`t learn little childs to handel with this gadget in her early years?
Then they haven`t to learn it when they`re older and they`re prepared.
Secondly, Television can be a kind of education.
When childs watchts some interresting documentarys or learn to count that way, I thin Television makes a great job.
Also an important argument when the parents want to do something in the houshold like cooking, cleanig, etc.
they can`t play with their kids.
In that moment the kids get on the  parents nevers because they will cry and scream beauce of boringness.
The it is an easy option to switch the Tv on, so the child has something to do and the parents can do their work.
On the other hand we have the danger of the Television.
There`s a lot of rubish whitch young childs can watch there like dangerous horror films, pornografie or so on.
In the worst case childs become psychical problem from this and can`t sleep at night.
Another argument is that the TV coveres the real world.
For childs it is better to invent the word not on Tv.
They should go outside and play there with other kids to become friends.
Also they have to play in the wood or in the mud to come in contact with the natur.
My conclusion is that childs should be confrontated with the Television but controlled.
It should be an mixture
Young children often can not understand things like adults.
They do not know that television advertisings can sometimes pretend to be something that they are not.
Children aged two to five can not handle this kind of advertising because they believe everything someone says.
In my opinion, I do not think that this is fair and because of this, I agree with this statement.
If a young child is watching television and an advertising for a toy for example appears all the time, they start to like it and then they want to own it.
This is the problem in that case.
Young children are very naive so they believe everything that was mentioned in television.
Maybe the parents should not let theit children watch television on their own.
But that would be way too complicated and because of this, in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
On the other hand, the companys earn their money like this.
It is their job to make people interested in their products.
And children are the best age-group because, like I said, they want to have everything a person talks about that is appealing to them.
The company just has to make it appealing to the young children.
But as soon as the advertising has toys in it or something like that, the television advertising has earned the attention of the child.
Nevertheless, I think that there has to be an alternative to this problem.
Maybe television advertising should only be allowed on channels for adult people and not on a kids channel.
Because adults are old enough to interpret the product and also to judge it.
They can decide on their own if they want to have it or not.
In my opinion, this would be a very good solution to this issue.
To conclude, I think that it is not right to influence young children by advertising in television.
They want to have everything someone talks about and they believe everything that they hear in television.
Because of that, in my opinion it should be prohibited to show television advertising directed toward young children.
There is a discussion on whether or not commercials should be legal when directed to young children.
Kids do not understand what advertisement is, so the offspring tends to fall for many marketing methods.
For example; "Buy one little stuffed bear and get one free", the innocence of not understanding that buying a product and getting one free does not exist, and the price for both products is being paid; make children immensely vunerable.
Capitalism is oversmarting children, and not many individuals seem to care.
On the other hand, commercials and product placements are nowadays as common as water is.
So, it does make much sense to prepare the offspring for reality.
The parents are responsable for teaching kids on how to overlook or detect false advertisement.
Therefore, the future adults know how to make educated choices, when it comes to their consuming activity.
Balancing out what the commercials promise and what is real, such behaviour is a part of common sense.
After examinating both points of view, my opinion is that there are no reliable reasons for children not being exposed to advertisement.
Even though kids might be easy victims for selling strategies, it is important that such experiences can be made.
Parents have the obligation of teaching and preapairing offspring  for the world, so the addition of common sense should not be destracted by fooling protection policies.
A controversal subject nowerdays is television advertising directed toward young children.
It is often seen as a problem because the young children get very fast fascinated from the advertisment and then force the parents to buy certain things.
Television advertising should be allowed because thats the reason how they get their money but for the kids that don't really understand how the advertising influenc them its a bad thing.
One aspect why television advertising is allowed is because thats the way how the producer get their money.
With that money they make new shows or series and pay their worker.
We and our kids whatch it later.
This is the good part about television advertising.
The problem is how they make their advertising.
The producer of the TV shows know exactly how advertising for kids work.
It must have a lot of bright colours and has to be very loud.
The children get a feeling of "WoW, thats awesome" then they want to buy it.
They don't understand that they got influenced by the advertising and thats the problem.
The kids have a lack of knowledge and are not experienced with such things.
And the advertising producer use that for their profit.
The idea of the advertising for getting money for producing and other things is good.
The problem is that the producer use the lack of knowledge and experience from the kids for their profit.
This is very mean and nasty and should not be allowed for kids aged two to five.
Should television advertising toward children between two and five be allowed?
Here in Switzerland you are allowed to make advertisments towards people at all ages.
So in that case also to young children between the age two to five.
As far as I concern, these adds mostly contain toys or fun activities.
Toy companies or companies who sell products for children wouldn't be to happy if their kind of adverts would be forbidden, because they live off their products and it would influence their selling-quotes a lot.
They also find that it's a good idea to start influencing the kids at a young age, so they get used to it and continue buying stuff from TV adds.
These adds are also good for our economie, because more gets sold and therefor more money's around.
I think these young children aren't old enough to decide what they want or need to buy, so the adverts influence the a lot more as you would think.
Parents with young kids often have the problem that their kid want's to buy the newest and coolest stuff from TV.
That will mostly end in tears and nobody likes situatuion like that.
In my opinion parents who have a problem with their children wanting to buy stuff shouldn't let them watch TV all day.
I think advertisments should be allowed for
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
In our time, the media, including television, radio and social networks, make a great impact on our lives.
If we have a question and can not seem to find any answer, we look for it in the internet.
We believe most of the things, we are shown from the media.
But to be fair, I do not think that some advertisings should be forbidden because of the age, that advertising is directed toward.
Television advertising is for companies to be more popular, because most of the time, many people are watching it.
If they are more popular, more people are convinced, that that product is right for them and there is a higher chance that they are going to buy it.
Therefore, the companies can make more money with advertising.
All this does not make sense to children at the age of two to five.
I do not think that they are watching a lot of television and even if they did, they would not realise what they are actually watching.
Adults, on the other hand, are watching those advertisings and are old enough to decide, if the product shown is useful for them or their children or not.
This results in companies trying to achieve the ability to convince parents and not children.
If they are trying to convince children, they want to manipulate them so that they will convince their parents themselves but at that young age, it does not seem very efficient to me.
To conclude, I do not think that television advertising toward such young children makes sense but in my opinion, if they want to do this, they can.
It should not be disallowed because I do not think that it has a bad impact on those children or their parents.
In a time where different types of media are dominating our thinking and the way we view things, it is only logical to think about expanding the influence of media on us.
It is said, that when something is done earlier, it will be better for you in the future.
Showing little kids television advertising and making them familiar with it, is an advance for them.
They learn early to cope with ads in the television and to form their point of view of a product, that is being advertised.
They learn to see what tricks advertising uses, to draw the attention on a particular product.
Later in life, they can use this knowledge and can detect better, if they are in need of that product or not.
It also helps them, not spending much money on things, so they learn the way how to treat money.
Television advertising for children is okay, as long as the product that is being advertised is not something bad and contraproductive for the growth and development of little kids.
If the product for example is a tablet app for painting on the tablet, or a game that you can play on the computer, it stops the kids of going outside and experiencing new things, of learning about the world they live in.
Another argument against television ads for young children would be that companies should not try to get the attention of little children and thus taking alot of money from the parents, especially when it is a poor family.
Children tend to get enthusiastic about something pretty quickly, so a better option than for example an electronic device, would be a walk outside or something different, that helps in the developping of the childs brain.
If the television is full of advertising products for children, they are sitting a lot more in front of it, than in the situation, when ads would not be there.
I agree with the statement, as long as advertising directed to children is getting out of hand.
If a food item is being advertised or a normal toy like a stuffed animal, it is acceptable, but when products are being advertised that are clearly not helping a child, then I think these ads must not be allowed.
The advertisement is an important factor for every company around the planet.
It has the power to influence the shopping behavior of people.
There are advertisements just directed toward children at young age because these innocent children are easier to influence and direct than a grown adult.
The question, if these commercials should be allowed, stays unanswered.
First of all it is important that we visualize the impact on a child such a advertisement could produce.
Small children are believing everything and tend to be mad if they don't get what they want.
This fact makes such a advetisement a problem for the whole family of the child.
It could lead to arguments between family members especially when the commercial is directed to the child but advertised a product for the parents for example a car with good seats for the children.
Secondly, is the personality of a child easily changed by subconcious messages which lead to problems with te education thought by the parents.
An advertisement convincing a child subconciously to buy something or ask a parent to buy something could end with an agressive young child having problems with its all day behaiviour.
Another reason not to publish such advertisements is an economical one.
Companys with products which have nothing to do with children get a huge disadvantage by such advertisements because they have to make commercials directed to adults, who are more difficult to influence.
To sum up, today there are 2468 advertisements directed just to children.
It is time to act and minimize these commercials for the well being of our children.
It should only be allowed to make such commercials about products which are only beneficial for young children, like lego and that kind of stuff.
Let our children have a uninfluenced childhood because they are going to see enough advertisements when they are fully grown.
On television there's a lot of advertising, espacially for young children, because the don't have to go to school or to work so the have the time to watch television the whole day.
Now we discuss if it should be forbidden to produce advertising directed toward children aged two to five.
If the advertising directed toward young children is forbidden the companies who produce toys will have problems to bring the product to the consumer.
The children wont know what they want for christmas.
So the parents will buy some toys and the children will be sad because there parents bought the false toys.
Young children will also go more outside and play with there friends games like hide and seek or football.
So they get away from the srceens and do something usefull.
But if the advertising directed to young kids is allowed the producer of the toys could sell some cheap produced toys for high price to the kids because they don't know what a fair price for a toy is.
Also the children will annoy there parents because they want a lot of things that the don't need.
The kids will also be a lot of time in front of the screens to watch their favorite TV-show and so watch more advertising.
In my opinion the advertising directet to young kids should be forbissen because if the children watch advertising they will annoy there parents until the parents buy them a toy and after two weeks they wont play with this toy and the want the next one.
In this essay the statement "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed" will be discussed.
Nowadays more kids watch television than ever, therefore it makes sence to direct the advertising towards them.
They want to get the things the advertisement is showing and the market would increase, because a lot of parents spoil their children.
This would speak for allowing the advertisements.
But on the other hand there are much more older children, teenagers and adults watching television than kids between two and five wich means that the advertisement should rather be directed towards them.
Advertisement for young children is very boring for older people.
The number of people watching television could decrease which would be more of a loss than an increase.
Also often the things that are advertised towards young children are useless and more of a waste of material and energy than a contribution towards the better living of people.
It takes time to develope the advertisements and the advertised things and often little kids can not understand what the advertisements are saying.
Television advertising towards young children should therefore be forbidden.
Another argument for this is, that little kids should not be watching television.
They should experience the nature and the live outside the house.
They should craft and draw and increase their ability to make fine, little things.
In the future that will help them more than sitting in front of the TV all the time.
I think television advertising should be forbidden, because of the arguments listed above.
I think the advertising company would not benefit from the young children as much as they would by investing the time, money and energy in advertisements for older people.
On one hand, I do not really see a problem with advertisements for children.
I mean, if it should be really banned, the companies then will surely find other ways to advertise their products to children.
For example they could make product placements in TV-Shows for children, so in the end, it does not matter if you ban it, because they will find other ways to advertise their products for young children.
Also when a child sees an advertisement, it can not just go and buy it.
It has parents who decide if they get it or not.
The Child just can say it wants the product but in the end the parents make the decision if it gets it or not.
So banning Television advertising for young children will not help a lot.
But on the other hand I think it is important that our children are not manipulated when they are young.
Maybe today it's just a advertisement for a soft drink, but in maybe ten years companies might use the advertisements to brain-wash children.
So I think this will be in the future an advantages when you banof banning advertisements ditected towards children.
So in the end I think the disadvantages outweight the advanteges of banning television advertising directed to hidlren.
It is not a big deal that there are advertisements for young children, as long as they are not too manipulative.
And in the end, it is still the decision of the parents of wether buying something or not for their child.
So it is not necessaire to ban television advertising directed toward young children.
"Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed."
I'm not sure whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
On the one hand you can say it isn't really fair to do television advertisting directed to young children, because they aren't old enough to decide whether it's a good or a bad thing, which they are seeing in TV.
They still need their parents to help them through their life.
They need their parents to show them problems, dangers and difficulties, but when there are like TV spots directed especially to young children, children will be very influenced by it.
So when you go shopping with your child they want everything they have seen in television and maybe you can't afford it, so it's not easy to say no to your child.
On the other hand you can say that's life.
Honestly in our world, it's all about money.
And in a world, full of captalism it's clear that even young children are important clients, so why shouldn't television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
And maybe you could even go that far that you can say that children learn from TV.
They are going to  improve their language skills, but most important they are going to get more mature, because they are going to compare the TV spots and the products they're about.
So they become more independent and mature in early age.
After looking through the arguments I can say that I don't really have an opinion to this statement.
Honestly I do not care.
There are some arguments that support the statement but there are arguments which are against it as well.I think everybody should decide for himself whether he does support the statement or not.
If you support the statement, you need to live with the consequences because we live in a capitalistic world and this isn't going to change.
In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed because children are inocent and emotional, they believe, what they are being told and what they see.
They take everything literally, so if someone in the televison says for exemple the world is a plain, they are going to believe that because they don't know it better.Even if they do know that the world is actually round they will start to question it because that is just what children do.
An other reason why i'm against it, is that young children don't even understand what they are being told and that is exactelly the reason why they could understand or interpretaed something wrong that was ment to be something totally else.
Unfortunately it is likely for a child that it believes what it is being told.
Young children can easely be manipulated and producers, politiciens or other people could take advantage of that.
They could brain-wash childrens and manipulate them as they please, just to get what they want.
Anyway I think that in general you shouldn't direct something towards little children as I said for the reason that they would take everything serious and would listen to what they are being told

Sorry that you have to read this but I had really no clue and not the slightest idea what advertising means, so I just guessed.
Advertisement is something we are surrounded with all the time.
Most of the time we don't even realize it but we remember a lot of it unwillingly.
Advertisement influences us and particularly our decisions what and how much we buy.
Should it be allowed to influence young children from age two to five through television advertising to such a degree?
First of all, the directing of television advertisemnet towards young children would make sense from a economic point of view.
Children of that age can be influenced easily by a happy jingle, a speaking animal and vibrant colours.
They could try to get their parents to buy the advertised product.
But secondly there is the ethical point of view: is it okay to use children of a very young age to get people to buy your products?
Are the children getting instrumentalised for an extremely selfish cause of making as much money as possible?
The question is on the other hand, how many children of that age even watch television on a regular basis.
I would guess a lot of them are allowed to watch a kids program or a movie from time to time and don't get to see a lot of advertisement on television.
Therefore the advertisement could not do a lot of harm and there would be no need to have any restrictions.
All of the above considered, I think that children of a young age should not be seen as a way of selling your product.
They are too young to assess things objectively and to make up their own minds.
And even if they don't watch television and don't see the advertisement, they could still hear it or be influenced through other media.
There is no need to direct the advertisement directly towards them they will come across it anyway.
It is not a secret that advertisement can be manipulativ.People who are the most confronted with this manipulation are teenagers and adults.
But it may be also possible that childrens are manipulated by the television.
But is it so bad if young children see some advertising?
First of all we have to make clear that only a few young children are allowed to watching television.
Most of the two to five aged children are outside to play and their parents keeps an eye on them.
So not many children are confronted by advertising.
Secondly we need to consider that children not are able to buy anything.
So if they see something on television for example a toy which they want, they can not just buy it like an adult.
So what can be the consequence if the see some toys on television?
Of course they desire to get this toy, they want the parents to buy this toy.
But is this such a worse thing?
It is fact that children need some toys to play and learn thing with playing.
Furthermore they learn to appreciate things.
One toy they get but the other not, the parents not just buy every toy their children wants.
So the children have to learn how to choose and what is important.
Besides the parents also can show their children that the television is not right everytime.
There are toys which are not as great as it seemed at the advertisement.
In conclusion adversitsing is not as worse as we thing if we use it the right way.
The children can learn much about the television, advertisement and the world outside.
They learn to choose only the one thing they want and not to desire useless things.
Should television advertising directed toward children (2 to 5) be forbidden?
This isn't a hard question for me to answer, because I only see arguments for this statement.
On the one hand there is the problem with children and television in general.
Nowadays almost every child grows up infront of a television, whereas twenty years ago they only knew advertising from the newspapers.
On the other hand there is the fact that children are in comparison to adults more affected by advertising, because they don't realise that it is advertising at all.
They see something and then they want it.
But what they do not see is the manipulative advertising company and their goal to earn money, behind it, it's just a simple toy and they want to have it.
All they see are the material things and it takes them only one second to decide wether they want it or not.
So companies like to produce advertising directed to children, because it is so effective.
Considering that nowadays children are confronted with advertising in a younger age then twenty years ago, I think that there should be a discussion on wether we allow this or not.
With social media and media in general, like radio and television, children get in contact with advertising in a younger age, because although they can not read yet, every child understands a short clip about a new product on TV.
I actually can't think about a reason for advertising directed at children, because I think that it is just a simple and very manipulative way of companies to earn money.
Children are very naive and they don't see the problem behind advertising, they simply believe everything, especially in the age from 2 to 5.
I want to forbid this kind of advertising in order to protect children and also the money of their parents, because in the end the parents are the ones that have to buy it for their children.
We see it everywhere: the advertisement for the newest car, praises for the tooth paste that makes your teeth the brightest or a huge poster that claims that this is the drink that you need in order to become happy.
Advertising plays quite an important role in our society.
The more interesting gets the question whether televison advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not.
On the one hand one could claim that advertisement doesn't do any harm - at least not if no violence and sexual language is used.
Advertising might be an option to show adults as well as young children what kind of possibilies they have.
It can be an inspiration and give us a clearer view of our desires and needs that we have.
But here comes a big but.
Showing us all the kind of options that we have might create needs and wishes that we wouldn't have had if we didn't watch the television advertising, which can be negative as it leads us to desire things that we don't need in the first place.
Especially young children should not be contronted with opinion influencing advertising for they shouldn't be determined by pictures and clips that brings them to a demand of products where there is no actual need.
Another reason why I am against television advertising towards young chilren is that I believe that advertisement impresses the viewer with false standarts as it tells you want you need for a great, successful or famous life, it makes you believe that you need this certain product in order to have a certain status in your life.
Children, especially ages two to five are very easily influenced.
Presenting them these standarts gives them a wrong view of the real life and might even be the reason for the lack of self confidence later in life.
This is why I agree with the statement that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed.
It depends on the time they took for watching TV, watching to long could cause you heatache or eyesache but the TV could also be a good way to learn a particular language.
So the parents should have the choice what their children watch.
A serial in a diffrent languages as the motherlanguage could help children later in their school days.
I'ts also important that the children have social contacts with other children by playing outside because the TV can be like a drug.
Children don't know when they should finish with watching.
The TV can isolate you in your room and you forgot to do other things like doing homework or other stuff.
I think that bringing the children in a kita would be more hopefully, so they could also have social contacts in a diffrent language, so they can also speek the language they are going to learn.
When I was young at the age of five, I went out playing with other kids football and other kind of plays.
But I also actually watched television.
And I remember that many friends of my didn`t watched television, because their parents forbidden it.
For me it didn`t make any sense.
Clearly every parents told us children, watchig to much television is bad for us.
My parents also thaught this, but for them it wasn`t such a danger.
They thaught it is okay watching children shows for example like Spongebob, Tom and Jerry or all the Disney shows.
I loved it to watch this shows.
Especially at weekends, every morning at seven o`clock when all the childern programms started.
And it was also nice to talk about these shows with other children in the kindergarden and after in the primary school.
And while talking about all the shows, many children told me it is very bad, watching so young so much TV.
They said to me, that their parents have told them it isn`t healthy for people watching to long television, actually for young children.
The eyes will become more weak, also the brain.
Their parents alouded them to watch television only for one hour in the week.
Some families I know, don`t use television still today.
In my opinion, it is okay to let children watch television, but not to much.
Childeren also have to learn other things, to go out have fun with other kids.
But I find it almost brutaly to don`t let a children watch TV.
Some things you also learn thigns by watchin TV
When you watch a movie with your child, the worst thing that could happen for you is, that your little son or girl stresses you all the time, because he or she has just seen a new advertisment of a huge and expensive Lego-castle.
The children always want to have it.
So should it be allowed to show television advertising directed towards your young children?
For the companys the best thing to sell there toys is it to show them to the children.
If a little boy watches the advertisment of for example a Lego-castel, the chance that he wants to have it imediately is very big.
And after he has seen it, he would go to there parants and stress them with the new Lego toy, up to the moment, wherethey go together to the next shop and buy that castel.
Another point for the advertisment is the TV-sponsoring.
Every child likes it to watch TV.
But who acctualy pays the TV?
A big part pays the sponsors.
They pay money for that they can put there advertisment into the breaks of the movie.
And without that TV-sponsoring, we couldn't watch movies on TV.
On the other hand children become manipulated by the advertisments on television which is not good for there development.
In addition to that, a child should not see disturbing advertisments like them of a shootergame or stuff like that.
So the advertisment should be at least filtered.
Another point is, that the children like it more to watch there movies, then the advertismentof a f.e.
cupcake store.
Although there are some positive aspects to the television advertisment, I am against the television advertising directed toward children, because it might desturb the childhood and it manipulates the children.
In the summer holiday I visited my family in Germany and they watch TV quite a lot there.
So one evening I had to watch Super RTL with my little cousin Fanziska and there was a horrible advertsing about "BabyBorn" and of course, the second she laid her eyes on that doll, she wanted to have it.
A few weeks later she got a present from her grandfather, a "BabyBorn", what a surpise!
So in this essay I am going to write about a common problem, should televison advertising directet toward young children be allowed or not?
We got televison advertsing about everything, so why should it not be allowed towards young children.
The children aren't old enough to decide wheter they need something or not.
So when they see a nice toy on televsion they want to have it.
The people who make the advertsing use exactly that.
Furthermore if a little child wants something, it's really hard to get it out of their mind.
It's easier to just go to the store and buy it.
The advertising did his purpose.
My personal opinion is that you can't stop the advertising towards children because we are surrounded by advertsing.
But you shouldn't let your two years old child watch Television anyway.
So it is
Young children nowadays are watching more and more television.
It is a big problem, that marketing gets even bigger and the companies tries to sell everything and uses advertisemen for those reasons.
But is it ok to direct advertisements towards children?
First of all it isn't good to use children for economic purposes.
Children have a blank mind and they got influenced quite strong by those advertisements.
For example if the children see something they want they will ask their parents again and agian till they will recieve it.
Another big point is that children children don't earn their own money.
The parents have to pay for them and all parents wants to see the child happy.They are quite likely to buy whatever they want to make the child happy and to use this fact to sell products is not right.
On the other hand if the parents wants to buy what the child want and it is good for the economics if things are bought.
So it is good for the economics if advertisements are directed towards children.
The cashflow won't get stopped and there won't be any bad incidents for the econimic.
Last but not least every singel child have theire own opinion of what they just saw and if they want this product or not.
They can't think about the use of the thing.
So if they like what the advertisement is about why shouldn't parents buy it to them?
To sum up in my opinion it is ok to direct advertisements towards children.
It is a part of marketing like social media markenting.
And if the parents are willing to buy the products to make the child happy it is a good way to sell products.
Many parents don't like it but in fact the parents could provide the children from watching so much television.
Nowadays,every child aged two to five, watches Television.
There are so many channels for children in our time, but as we know, a channel can't stay alive without showing advertisments on TV.
But does this affect the children to buy something?
Firstly, children grow up with their parents, and the parents always teach their son or daughter what they should do or believe and what not.
So now when they see an advertisment on TV they should know, if it is something essential or not.
Secondly, the owners of the TV-Channels are very smart and they know what kind of advertisment they have to show to children.
They show them advertisment of new toys coming out soon, or trailers from disney films.
They try to force them to ask their parents to buy this or to go to the cinema to watch this movie.
Finally, showing these advertisements on TV is rightly correct.
Theres nothing like a law against these advertisements, they should only content stuff for the variety of people who are watching.
For example, it would be a crime to show on a channel for children an advertisment with sexual content.
In conclusion, my point of view is that advertisment toward young children should be allowed.
I think children are smart enough to know that they shouldn't believe everything or let themselves misslead by an advertisment for buying something they don't really need in reality.
The Channel Owners just should know, what type of advertisment they show to the children.
In the 21. century it is normal every household to have a TV.
If young or old, both classes like to watch it.
But should television advertising directed toward young children from two to five be allowed or not?
In the followimg Essay I'm going to point out some arguments for and against television advertising directed to young children.
Firstly it is unhealthy that young children watch TV a lot.
So the television shouldn't get too much refered to the children, especially not to the very young.
Children should play with their toys, instead of hanging on the TV and get more attached to it because of the television advertising.
But in the other way, nowadays it's pretty normal, that everyone has access to the television and that little kids are also affected of it.
It is just the revolution and nobody can do anything about it.
Secondly television advertising that is only directed to a specific class of age, leads to less viewers.
If there's only advertising directed to children aged two to five, the older people or teenagers will instantly turn off the TV.
Whereas for the little children it is exciting to watch.
But in the other way it shouldn't be a problem, because it has also many other advertising that isn't only directed to children aged two to five, but also older juniors or even seniors.
The last but not the least reason is that constantly watching TV and being attracted to it through advertising, influences the physical actions, which means that it is really unhealthy.
In the other way it is still exciting to watch and for the moment, you forget all the other things and just enjoy watching tv.
In conclusion, in my opinion the arguments are pretty equal.
But one day, when I grow up and have children, my children won't be allowed to pass much time in front of the TV.
Thats why I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should strictly not be allowed.
It influences not only their minds, but also their physical action.
The average person is confronted with advertisement of many kinds on a daily basis.
Oftentimes we do not even take notice of the advertisement itself and the message it enforces on us, yet we are all subconciously influenced by it in our choices.
The average adult person in most cases posesses the ability to distinguish between genuine information and advertising slogans.
Therefore most people tolerate the poster in the bus station or the spots on televison between programmes.
However, if advertisement is specifically directed toward very young children controversy is much higher.
And there are quite a lot of people who even think that such a thing should be forbidden.
One of the main reasons why advertising aimed at children is viewed so negatively is that it can be harmful to their development.
Advertisement in many cases teaches children certain values.
As they have not fixed their own vlues  and are not yet able to distinguish the message of the advertisement from their own opinion, it can influence their behavoiur and how they percieve the world.
Because for example TV spots are aimed at selling those children their product rather than educating them, these values are oftentimes not the best ones.
A huge problem is also, that such advertisements are often either directed toward boys or girls, creating the problem that sexism is directly learnt bythe young audience.
Boys are taught early on that cars are super fun and that they should go on adventures outside while girls are taught to love dolls and puppets and oftentimes also very unhealthy body immages are imposed on them.
In defence of advertisement for children one must say that in a free market economy, everyone should have the possibility to invest his or her mney as he or she pleases.
Many companies direct their product directly toward a very young audiene and would lose a lot of revenue.
I
Technology is advancing and so does the opportunity to influence people by advertisements.
However the subjects are changing, since companies realised that they have a bigger impact on younger subjects, they use this opportunity.
Televisions give us, the society, pictures, stories and show us ways of communication.
Televisions kill the time in a fascinating way.Many people watch television to come down, to relax, to stop thinking.
But what kind of influence brings the television along?
Is this influence a good one or a bad?
In what way does it change us?
An influence brings always along, that it can manipulate and change you.Meanwhile, televisions always work, you can always watch it.
Children are easy to manipulate, they take everything that you show them with pleasure in their heads.Influencing, manipulating humans is easy when they are young.So we have to discuss, if the influence is good or bad, and it also depends on what you are watching.
The positive side of televisions, for me, are that you can come down, you forget the world and youre life for a moment, you only have to watch and nothing else.
If you have time, and you don't know what you should do, it is a way of killing time.You also can inform yourself about what is going on in the world, you have the possibility to watch classic movies, to see how human relationships can be, to have a view on other cultures and see their problems.
This is a an immense advantage, which the people before us didn't have.
Television can connect us with other people and countries.
The negative side of televions are that you become an influence which you often can't realy controll, because televisions in my eyes, influence you in a very passive way,  where a lot of people have difficulties to controll it,because they show you images which you can't 'delete' so easily.
Most people watch series or other things , which are very stupid and gives us a image of the world which, if we live that life that they show us, is to easy and would make the world in a sad an stupid place.
Televisions can bring us information, but you also could read a book , where you don't are so passive.
Finally, for me, televisions are in generel bad for the human beeing, this brings me to the conclusion that in an age between two and five televisions shouldn't be part of life for children.
They can do so many others things where they have to think and be creative, communicate themself and not the televisions, use time in beeing outside in nature and not in front of the television.
Should young children aged two to five be exposed to television advertising or not?
While some think it should not be allowed, I believe that living in a free and economic based country has its cost: Children are confronted with commercial designed in paticularly for them.
I belong to the generation which has seen TV commercials between the kids programm on the TV how it's still nowadays.
And I wouldn't think it damaged me in a certain way nor made me want to buy a lot of things for my own pleasure.
Yes some time you'd wish you had that "water canon 5000", but you'd already forgot about it before sleeping.
In the end it depends on how you were educated by your parents and how you find happiness in things you already have.
In addition our country is based on free thougts and economic liberty.
This leads us to the point where it's difficult to tell, how much of something is still good.
Making people buy more things is healthy for the economics and if the economics of a country is well-off so is the population.
Today's system is based on the need to buy more and more.
If not sustained with buying products, it collapses.
So if children see an TV advertising and pressure their parents to buy something, they are supporting this system and helping the economics grow.
Considering both points mentioned above I also want to leave you with a thought.
Someone can only learn how to react to attractive and manipulative advertising, when he or she is confronted with it.
I hope I have given some food for thought and I'd like to leave with the last thought about this topic.
See ya later alligator.
Alors je pense que ce n'est pas une bonne chose.
Selon moi ces petits enfants sont très faible et facile à convaincre pour des jeux ou n'importe quoi ils s'intéressent.
Les gens qui font un advertissement pour des enfants comme ça utilise leur fiablesse pour leur avenatges.
Je trouve c'est presque criminelles.
On doit aussi dire que les parents souvent peuvent rien faire quand leur enfants ont vu un advertsissement comme ça parce il pense c'est bien quand ils achètent des choses pour eux.
Aussi les advertissement d'aujourd'hui pour exemple un bikini montre toujours des femmes peu habiller et ça donne un mal image sur les femmes.Je suis convainqu qu'on doit protecter les enfants de ces advertissement là.
Je pense que en français ça vous donne un peu plus de temps de corriger là chose, à cette point là je remercie Monsieur Leuenberger pour tous ces lessons trops ennuyeux et fatiguants.

Television advertising directed toward children should not be allowed.
Last weekend I was babysitting two little girls.
The younger girl just had her birthday in the week before and is now 5 years old.
I asked her about the gifts she got.
And she showed me her new Barby.
She told me that she will soon get the pink car for her Barby but she have to wait because the car was'nt avaible in the shop.
So it's relatively clear that she had the informations about the Barby from the televisionadvertising.
I think especially in the Sender like Nikelodeon or other television for children in the breaks between the series are advertisings like this.
They moestly advertise for things that the children can wish themselfs for birthday or christmasgifts.
It's difficult for the parents to controll if their children see advertises like this when they are allowed to see Tv in the time the parents have to cook or something.
So the children see the advertise and then the parents have two possibilities.
One possibility is to pay for the things the children want.
And the other possibiltiy is to stand when the children cry and shout  please, please, please.
So it wouldnb idea to permit the advertise for little children.
Especially in the age from two to five.
But on the other hand we live in a world that advertising is a part of.
I think when the advertising in the TV would be permited they would find other ways to give the little children informations about all the wonderfull things they had.
And in general I think the parents should decide how much time their children are allowed to spend next to the televison.
So I think it isn't possible to permit the advertising for little children at all but maybe to start with a permitition in the Television wouldn't be a bad Idea.
Advertisments for young childrens are very controversial, should they be allowed or not?
I will explain the pro and contras in the following paragraphs.
Young children can be manipulated very easy, when they see something that looks nice, or toys which other children play with they want to have it.
They believe everything which is showed in television.
Such young children should't be influenced by advertisments.
It is bad for the children if they are faced with all the advertisment, it can influence their learning and growing up process badly.
Young children can't buy things themself so the adverisment shouldn't be directed towards them.
The advertising should influence the parents through their kids.
It tells young children to ask their parents to buy them things, this can influence the children-parent connection.
Companies which produce children toys also need to make advertising to sell their product.
It is not fair to prohibit them to make any advertisments.
The advertisment has to be directed to the people who use the product and if the poduct is for children the adverisment has to be directed towards children.
It doesn't influence them to buy things because they are to young to buy so the adverisments can't make people to buy things.
At the end the parents decide if they want to buy it.
I don't tink it should be prohibited to adverise towards young children but it should be controlled.
Those advertisments should have special restrictions for young children.
For me the bigger problem ist that the young children watch to much television and programes which aren't for their age.
Advertising is really popular in our civilisation but is it useful to make television advertising directed toward young children?
In our life we get confronted with a lot of advertising in all regions of our life.
So much that we sometimes don't know what we should belive or which product we should buy.
With a lot of things it is useful to start with when children are still young because they learn faster and can learn better than older people but advertising isn't learning so maybe it is to early to confront children with tis topic.
Maybe they get confused because of that.
And young children don't buy their stuff on their own, so they tell teir parents what they want but the parents are the ones who finally buy it.
If children get a big choice they can quickly get confused of it and don't now what they really like.
Children don't need thousands of toys and stuff but they need some less that they really like and don't want to give away.
To have the most and best things is not everything in the life of a child.
Another point is that children get inflooded of their friends, if one of them gets for example a new t-shirt the others alo want one.
That is a reason why they sometimes bull each other.
I think with advertising this topic won't get better.
Also for parents I think it is a disadvantage if their child watches TV and always sees things he or she really wants.
Another negative aspect is that children in general shouldn't sit too long in front of the TV and so it is contraproductive to make advertising, what means that they just sit even longer in front of the TV.
In my opinion it is useless and not really positive to make advertising towards young children even if it is for great things.
what is television today?
Tv has a lot of crime or horror series, but of course there is also a lot of television for children.
For children it is very important that they do not grow up with only smartphones and i pads and co. For them it is also very important to play outside or with playmobil or lego.
For example, a child that plays alot with a smartphone is unhappier than a child that plays with barbies.
And that is the same topic as television.
A lot of parents let their childrens watching tv for the whole day, like this they do not have to look for the childrens.
The question is not if watching television is dangerous for children, the question is how much television is okay for a child.
Like this, i guess, you can not say that watching tv is dangerous for a child.
It is very important that a kid does not watch television in a way too often.
But watching tv could also have some positive effects.
For example, today are there alot of prorams where the children could learn english or something else.
The programms are full with child kindly animations and children are very happy when they can watch their favorite tv programm.
And now to the part that it should not be allowed: How should someone controll , that children are not watching tv, i guess that this is the choice of the parents.
There are a lot more things that should not be allowed, for example parents should not be allowed to smoke when their children are arround.
Like this I am going to say that the state should be concentrated for more imortant toppics than watching television for children.
Young children are exposed to influences by advertising (in the case that they already watch TV).
Now of course, people have been discussing about this theme as humanity always likes to make a huge drama about things.
On one side we have of course how easily kids can be influenced to like something by showing them colourful pictures, happy melodies or jingles and by the tone the person who is talking for the advertisement.
It even does not depend if it is a product for playing, eating and so on.
On the other side we can also say that it does not matter what the children think about a product, in the end it is still the parents' decision whether they will buy it or whether they will not.
And there are different kinds of parents: the ones who buy their children everything they want and those ones who still think about what would be the best for their children.
In a world of fast food and obesity, the latter is the better.
Enterprises like McDonald's, Burger King and Coca Cola are making more and more comercials, now do not say this does not influence your kid in any way because it clearly does.They do not see what could be the consequences, they do not even hear the tip (which, actually, is not radiated in every country) to eat or live healthily in the Fast Food comercials, that "only health is beautiful" in the perfume and make up advertisements.
My opinion is that in the end it is the parents' choice if they want to buy their kids the newest iPhone or whatever they just saw on TV.
But they should go more for education like reading books to them, listening Music with them and not letting them watch to much television; when I was a kid I was not allowed to watch TV, it was even until the age of about ten years that I had to ask whenever I wanted to turn on the television, so I was not exposed to as much comercials' influence as other kids have been.
You're on the couch with your three year old.
The soundtrack of the movie "Madagascar" in your ears and the soft light of your television on your face.
Both of you are laughing histerically, they because of the funny animals and you thanks to them.
Then the break comes on.
You know your child doesn't really understand any of it but you still wonder if they are in any way influenced by this advertisement of "HASBRO" about that new toy, from a movie which isn't even in their range of age.
Not a second in your thought, you see your child fidgeting around and they ask you with glowing eyes if they could get it for their birthday.
Should that way of advertising really be allowed?
Young people believe a lot.
They're at a larger risk of believing things advertisement want to make us believe than adults.
Kids are learning all the time and if they're not taught the right things, they make easy targets for advertisers.
When children are watching TV, most of the time they're absent minded.
Their visual sense takes up most of their brains available capacity.
These kids are in some kind of learning mode.
If, in that time, they're exposed to some television-advertisement, what happens to them would be like some kind of brainwashing.
Also, with the repeating of the same ads it gets worse and worse.
Three year olds should not be influenced about brands and what kind of drink they like best.
Because children should be allowed to just be children, my opinion is that television advertising should not be directed towards young children.
If you do television advertising d toward young children, they know what televisons are.
But children aged two to five schuold go out to play or should play with their parents or brother and sisters.
But if young children know how to watch tv and they know what TV is exactlly, they always want to watch TV instead of playing with others.
I think it would be very special if somebody adverts children something.
I think this isn't a very good idea because if children see a publicity which isn't for children in the age of two to five, then they asked what it was and sometimes it isn't the best that they know that.
It's really bad beacuse little children  mostly don't understand what the publicity want to say to them.
Television advertising can manipulat or distroyed little children.
For the costumer sometimes it's really good to speak to lillte children because they say to their parents that it is a good thing which they schould buy immediatly.
Some parents would do that because they want to do everything for their children.
Little children want everything when it's now oder wehn it's something specail.
I think it isn't a good idea because i think it's manipulation.
Children should not watch tv often.
When a children is watching tv they want to watch the serie oder the film and not the publicity.
Sometimes the publicity isn't for little children and then they are very confused about that what they saw.
I agree with the statment, it shouldn't be allowed to do television advertising directed toward young children
People's behaviour of what they buy and what don't is influences by advertising.
In a world embossed by technology, the way of advertising changed horrificly.
Companies introduced television advertising many years ago and since then it never went down once.
With the influence on somenone's life, companies gathered power and now they even start to influence the children.
So is such a beahviour acceptable at all and should television advertising toward young people be allowed?
First of all, companies are allowed to put almost everything they want into their advertisment.
The only border set is one which prevents companies to make a racist statement.
I think, that this is really important and I'm glad that this one exists.
Secondly, if a company focuses itself on the "kids market", why shouldn't they be allowed to produce and screen advertising that can influence a childrens behaviuour.
I mean just because they're screening it, nobody has to buy the things, do they?
Another aspect which has to be looked at is the time spent infront of television.
If the children nowadays wouldn't spend hours watching TV, then they probably wouldn't be as influenced as everybody says and there wouldn't be such a discussion at all.
In my opinion, not companies but parents are to blame.
Television advertising towards young children wouldn't be a problem at all if parents would prevent their children from watching TV that often.
Children should play with their friends outside instead of making a "movie afternoon" or whatever you want to call it.
I personally think that countries should be allowed to influence our behaviour even of the small one's.
Have you ever wondered what is going on in a child's mind?
Whether you did or not, you certainly noticed how susceptible kids are to temptations these days.
Such temptations may include toys, candy, video games, ice cream and countless other things.
All of these are mostly materialistic goods and are usually strongly promoted on TV.
Now, is it ethically wrong to tempt children into things they do not necessarily need?
First of all, whether a child actually gets the adverted good or not is mainly decided by its parents.
It's really the parents that are the aim of the commercials.
Thus, it is the parents' task to raise the kids in a way that prevents them from becoming too susceptible to temptations.
Secondly, it gives the children a chance to deal with temptations in early years.
Later in life they are going to have to resist to thousands of other temptations.
TV commercials featuring toys and candy already give them a chance to handle such situations.
On the other hand, the companies that produce the TV commercials clearly aim at vulnurable children in order to promote their product.
In reality, their goal is that the adressed children will later tell their parents about the new amazing thing they saw on TV, and often, the parents have a hard time turning their child down.
Turning down young children on a thing they really want inevitably leads to conflict.
Unfortunately, many parents act too weak in those conflicts and eventually give in.
Therefore, it is not the commercial companies that are the problem.
It is the parents task to teach their children to resist temptations.
Ultimately, TV commercials can in fact act as a life lesson for children.
As a result, the facts arguing pro TV commercials directed to young children clearly outweigh the arguments against TV commercials directed towards young children.
I think that it could be a problem when childrens spend to much time in front of the television.
But like always it is not that easy when you wanne give a new law.
Because many parents do not like it when somebody tell them how they should treat their childrens.
So it is a difficult statement.
Like already say, I see definatly problems when childrens spend to much time watching television.
One argument is that children who watch already ended stories don't have to imaginate their own stories.
That means that their ability to build their own world maybe with an friend who isn't there in reality, or where they can be a princess or a pilot won't be used.
And that given stories are'nt just in their favorite TV show.
It's also in television advertising.
A second point is the watching just before going to bed.
Many childrens are very excited when they watching the last hour befour bedtime.
There are also parents who care to less what exactly is in the TV right now.
Because we all know that some films and also sometimes some too sexual television advertising aren't good for that age.
You see: I am agree that young childrens shouldn't watch television advertising.
When I am honest I don't agree that childrens under the age of five should watch televions in general.
But on the other hans my opinion is also that every parents should have the right to what they think is best for their own family.
Television advertising

Today's advertising isoften directed towards young children.
In those commercials you can see beautifull toys and smiling children.
But why are there so many commercials for children?
And wouldn't it be better if there was no advertising for children?
One of the reasons why these advertisments shouldn't be allowed is that it is way to easy to influence children.
If a child sees a funny commercial with nice new toys in it and children having fun, it will often ask its parents to buy this new toy.
The child will ask and beg until it gets the toy.
But if the toy is bought the child will see another advertising on another toy and the whole process will beginn again.
The child always wants another toy and won't appriciate the ones it already has.
On the other side its easier for the parentsit the child already has a wish list.
They can go trough the list and choose the one thing, they think is appropriate for a child at this age.
Anyway I think these advertisements shouldn't be allowed.
Because if there is less commercial for children they maybe won't sit infront of the TV all the time and go outsiden and play something.
Television Advertising And Children

First of all, advertising isn't any good at all, but for the advertisers.
But how much can advertising harm little children?
It is known, that it is easy to manipulate little kids.
This is because they don't know as much as older people, therefore, they only have one choice: Believe or not know anything at all.
An easy question for most.
For example, if you tell your little brother, that a lion is about three meters high, he probably will believe you.
But what does it have to do with television advertising?
Often, even adult people get manipulated by television, because modern psychology and technic are much better and also much more dangerous today.
Today, people just know better how to manipulate humans and in advertiseing, it is all allowed that isn't not allowed.
But when even adult people can't defeat themselves sometimes, then little children can't at all.
Also, children are learning the most in their first years, so when they learn that advertising is something good, and that they should by more, than they grow up as big consumers, and it's known, that humans already consume more than the earth could ever give in time.
The world doesn't need more consumers.
But on the other hand, if they watched the advertising with their parent, then probably the could learn how to react and think of it, so it wouldn't do any harm.
It's just bad luck, that parents don't have enough time to observe children's television the whole day long.
In conclusion, advertising isn't that dangerous for children if they watched it with their parents, but as long as the don't have enough time, it could harm them and transform the children to little consumer, wich of course nobody need.
Because it is more harm than good, I'm definately against directing television advertising toward young children.
Now a days there are so many commercials everywhere!
Many of those advertismens are trying to convince the younger population to buy or do something.
For example an advertisment in the televison for a toy car.
This commercial is obviously directed to young children.
Especially around christams there are so many commercials like that  in the TV that try to convince children to believe that they need this toy.
The Problem is that the children that are watching this advertisment are not able to make up their minde about the toy.
Questions like do I really want this toy or is the toy too expansive are not important for the child, the only thing the child cares about is, that the toy looks like fun in the commercial so it would be great to have it.
So what is going to happen is, that they will put it on their wish list for christmas and hope that Santa ( their parents) will give it to them.
The positive aspect of this whole situation is , that the economy can make huge porfits.
The negative aspect is that most children are not going to use the toy, that they got for christmas, more that one or two times.
The reason for this is, that the child didn't really know what to expect from the toy or how it would be to play with  in reallity.
So the child has huge espectations of the toy because the producer of the advertisment used a bunch of special effects to make it look more fun but than when the child acctually plays with the toy it sees that it isn't as cool to play with as they thought and so they go and play with something else that they enjoy more.
My conclusion is that i do support television advertisments that are directed toward young children, because it is important for the industry so that they can sell more and make bigger profits on the other hand is it a waist of money for the parents who have to buy the toy for their child.
An other positive aspect for me is that the child may learn something out of this situation and won't put as much trust in the commercial next time and my even think about it a second time before they want something.
RedBull had to pay nearly two million dollars because of their advertising.
A women in the USA went to the court because the advertising couldn't give her what they promised - wings.
So she tried to fly, fell, got hurt and got 2 million dollars.
It was clear that just by drinking RedBull you couldn't fly.
But by seeing the advertise it caused people to imitate what they saw in TV.
So I'm asking myself, should television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) not be allowed?
As read in the introduction part imitation seems to be a huge problem.
Children who see boys and girls running through the streets, which are full of cars and traffic, just to get their favorite drink looks like a fun thing to do in television but in reality they would've got hurt.
Since children can't think as far as adults it is hard to protect them from such dangerous actions and as shown in the example above there are also adults who don't seem understand that advertising and reality are two different things.
On the other hand kids could get manipulated through television advertising.
There could be shown racist aspects or violence maybe inequality they don't quite understand yet.
So as they're in the process of growing up television could influence them in both ways the good and the bad.
Television advertising also is a method to show them that school is important and teach them important moral values that are necessary in our community.
As I already wrote chlidren in the age from two to five are growing up, they explore the world and are very interested in learning new things.
Through television and their advertising it is possible for them to see things, they otherwise couldn't.
It can as well help their creativity and fantasy to exposure, cause where else would they ever have had the possiblity to see dinosaurs which - let's be realistic - are very cool.
Finally I can say there are a lot cons about this topic but I don't think the problem is television advertising as a whole it's more the kind of advertising shown to the little ones.
In my opinion we have to set up some rules about what can and can't be shown in these advertises, so it could just have a positive influence and they could also enjoy some television.
Nowadays, nearly every child watches TV in the evening and even it is only for 30 minutes watching TV without television advertising is not possible, not only on channels for adults, but also on channels for children you find advertisements for several products or services.
Firstly, you have to think back when you were a child.
At an age of about four years you only concentrated on the film you really wanted to see.
At the beginning, advertisement might had been funny for you to see how a family is at the supermarket or how people are at a place where you had never been to.
But as soon as the advertisement had finished you forgot about it and you concentrated again on the movie, or the advertisement was so boring that you went shortly to the toilet.
Secondly, when the child is only about two years old it does not really know what advertisement is at all.
The child might even think that it is a second movie!
However, we should not forget that the advertisement can influence young children.
As soon as the family goes to the supermarket and the child sees a product which had recently been advertised the child wants this product and is extremely angry with the partents if they do not want to buy it as it can be unhealthy for the child.
To sum up, even though children might have an emotional outbreak at a supermarket it is not as bad as some scientists think.
Young children do not really recognise why there is advertisement at all they concentrate more on the moving pictures and the colours they can see on the screen.
To my mind, it is not a bad thing that there is advertisement on channels for children.
Advertisement is more a boring thing and people rather do something else than watching advertisement or the younger ones do not even understand what the advertisement is about.
Who doesn't know this?
One is watching a fascinating, very exciting movie and suddenly in the most ineresting moment the film is stopped and an anoying classified ad pops up.
This bothers each time every adult, because this ad tries to catch the attention, but actually only annoying them in that moment.
Why should advertisement also be directed towards children?
On the one hand it is a disgrace to try to manipulate the children's behaviour, let alone children aged two to five!
By directing an ad towards children, their behaviour is played with and one uses their naive mindset to sell products.
Advertising companies aim to grab the child's attention so that their parents are ordered to buy this 'fascinating gadget'.
Besides manipulating human beings in such a young age, it is also not allowed in law to tear them into the economic market because they are clearly under-aged.
On the other hand, directing classified ads towards young children can be a great marketing strategy for advertising companies.
Children will then be egor to have this specific product and the parents will be forced to buy it.
What is also to mention is that this includes children already in the manipulation of the modern new market nowadays.
Children will then learn in a much younger age to co-operate with manipulation of the human brain.
In my opinion, advertisement towards children aged two to five shouldn't be allowed because it is morally not just to try to use the children's naive behaviour to sell as much products as possible.
Children in such a age shouldn't be set the objective for the companies marketing strategy.
Manipulation of children should strictly be prohibited.
A lot of children start watching television at a young age.
But should it be forbiden to let them watch TV?
Depending on what children watch in the television it can influence their life and behaveour in a bad way.
For example if the watch series or films, wich aren't made for their age.
On the other hand, children can also learn a lot by watching TV.
It can help them in school and in their education, if they watch television for example in an other language, as they'd normally speak.
Another argument against letting young chlidren watch TV is, that they may spend a lot of their sparetime in front of the television, than playing with their friends.
But it also has to been said, that a lot of children haven't a lot of friends.
And if their parents are always working and don't have any time for their children, it isn't that bad, to let these children watch TV.
Otherwise they'd maybe do things wich are worse than watching TV.
TV can also teach children good kind of morals and what their rights are.
And if a child is very selfcountious, the televison can teach him/her to love himself/herself and become more confident about themselves.
In conclusion I think that it isn't a bad thing, to let kids watch TV sometimes, not the hole day, but, as an example, some minutes per day or some hours each week, or somting like that.
In my opinion, if the children watch the right kind of series and films, it teaches them more positive things than negative.
So I personaly don't think there's a need to forbid children to watch television at a young age.
Children between two and five years haven't learned to judge.
They are dependant on their parents and don't really think about what's true or wrong.
The consequence is that it is easy to manipulate them and of course, companies take advantage of this.
The children are too young to understand that maybe, the thing the commercial advertises for, doesn't have only advantages or is actually unnecessary.
But manipulated by the advertise, they want to have it, as soon as possible, because it looked so cool in television.
So the commercial taught at a young age that shopping makes you happier, more popular, more content.
The society of consume gets stronger.
A child doesn't spend a thought on the children who had to produce their toys, who got poisened by the chemics which are necessary for the production.
Neither, they think on the contamination of the environment.
And with manipulating children in such a young age, the problems in our world always get bigger and bigger.
The prohibtion is easily said, but hard to umsetzen.
Who says where those children are?
Which TV shows they watch, which posters they see, to which people they talk?
It is impossible.
Also, without advetising, companies can't sell their products.
And the parents of the children are responsible for them.
They have to teach them what's necessary and what they shouldn't buy.
So all in all, I disagree with this statement.
We see advertising nearby everywhere and all the time.
In the newspaper, on big walls in the city, in the bus and also in television.
Companies invest a huge amount of money to present their new products in television advertising  to us, but should it be allowed to make advertising directed toward young children?
Firstly I want to consider, that not many children aged two to five are watching television.
Children are often playing with there new toys or with their brothers and sisters.
Therefore they will not even see the adverts in the television.
Secondly children are confronted with advertising the whole day.
They can see adverts in magazines, hear it in the radio and there are many other examples.
So why should it be not allowed to make advertising in television?
It would make more sense to either forbid any advertising for young children or just allow advertising in any form.
On the other hand, advertising can influence young children.
If they see stunning products in television they want them too, instead of playing with their old toys or with their brothers and sisters.
All things considered, I think it should be allowed to make television advertising for young children.
There are adverts nearby anywhere, therefore it woud make no sense to forbid television advertising for young children.
Should television advertising which is for young childern be allowed?
Why should be this not allowed.
Advertising isn't something bad.
Everywhere you can she advertisings.
When you are on the street or in public transport there are everywhere some placats with advertise also for young childern.
As you can see there is nobody thinking about forbid this so why shouldn't it be allowed in the television.
With televison advertising for young childern you can make them happier.
Because they see something in the advertise what they would like to have which they wouln't have seen without television advertising.
But we talk here about young children between two and five and most of them even don't understand what the saw in an advertising so it doesn't even matter.
So on the one hand you can say the don't realise what they saw and on the other hand you have to look from another side.
You also have to look for those who produce those product and make those television advertising.
Because where else should they place their product so that they can reach their possible customers.
So our opinion is that telvision advertising should be allowed.
Imagine you're a young kid and you're watching your favorite TV programm and then there's a break because of a television advertising.
Is there something more awful than that.
First those childrens probably even won't understand what they see so why should you do some advertising when nobody understands or watch it.
Second those advertisings are sometimes really confusing.
So there are chances that those young childrens coud be influenced by those advertises.
Young childrens could miss understand the meaning of the advertising and get influenced by them.
And also the young childrens don't often watch TV so when they watch TV they should be able to watch what they want to and not some stupid televison advertises.
In my view television advertising for young children souldn't be allowed because first i think they're to young to even understand those advertisings.
Second i also think they can get influenced or want something because of this which they actually aren't mean to have beacuse the producer placed their product wrong.
So i have to say we should look that the childrens aren't watching all the time and if they wa
Fun, colourful and loud those adjectives especially apply to the advertisement aimed at a young target group, the children.
Just like the toys and sweets that are being sold to children the advertisement is just as bright and shiny in order to trigger the young consumers's demand.
But is advertisement towars such a young target group fair, should it even be allowed?
Children are not yet able to properly asess the meaning of advertising.
They are too young to realize that all the things that are claimed in those spots might not be true since they do not understand economy and therefore neither they understand marketing.
Children are very influencable due to their lack of knowlege and are an easy target.
By aiming advertisement at a group of two to five year olds the industry is playing an unfair game, by taking advantage of the children so young they are barely able to make up their own mind.
Since children, especially aged two to five don't have any buying force on their own it's their parents decision whether a purchase is made or not.
Advertisement directed at a very young target group therefore does not have an impact on childrens prosperity.
They aren't able to amass any debt and therefore the only thing the industry is taking advantage of is the parents soft spot.
The children will automatically run up to their parents and beg them to buy the advertised product which only be bad for the parents nerves.
After asessing the pros and cons of the topic advertisement aimed at young children, I have come to the conclusion that advertisement for children might not be a very fair game but I think the children aren't suffering any damage from it since the buying decision does not lie on their side.
There shouldn't be advertisment for young children in the television because then kids tend to watch television and that's not good.
Children in this age should be in the garden or somewhere else playing.
It isn't good for them.
My mom always told me that if I am watching television all day I get squared eyes and we don't want that our children have squared eyes.
And that leads us to the opposite, the parents of the children should decide if their children are allowed to watch television.
The state shouldn't have a word to say when it is about raising a child.
On the other side kids don't even have money at least not very much.
When a kid see something in an advertisement and wants it but isn't able to get it it's very frustrating.
Maybe it's even motivating children to steal.
You can also say that for the community of television watchers it has to be illegal.
Because most of them aren't young children and then it's very unpleasent to see advertisement for childrens all the time.
I am clearly against advertising directed toward young children at the age of two to five, because when I have to watch advertisement, and Ihave to there's no other possibility, I at least want to see something that is for me and not for young children.
Also I think that kids at that age shouldn't watch television, there is so much more stuff to do as a child then watching television.
But I also have the feeling that in sight of a company it wouldn't really be successfull advertising rather not well spent money.
Now a days everybody has some televisions at home and they pass much time with it.
On Tv there are many movies, series and a lot of advertising.
There are also Television advertisings for children which try to direct them toward, but it should not be allowed.
Children often wake up early in the Morning and until their parents wake up they go watching Tv.
Mostly they watch Children Tv with many animated series and movies.
Between those series are breaks and in these breaks there are advertisings.
Some of them are advertising for toys.
So the Problem is that the children see these adorable Toys and like every other child they want to have them.
So they ask their parents and when they do not get it they can be very naughty.
Among specialists, the topic wether or not young children should be exposed to television advertising, is highly debated.
Assessing the Pros and Cons of this argument, I believe that it can be harmful for children to see commercials, which are directed towards them.
I think that one can say without a doubt, that the exposure of young children to television has increased enormously over the course of the last decade.
Since I am not a specialist on this topic I can hardly speak of facts, yet I do believe, that children under the age of five can be influenced by commercials, since they hardly developped an understanding of what is true and what is a lie.
So if they hear a certain statement in an advertisement, they probably are going to believe it.
On the other hand, one can also see the lack of development in a child's brain as an argument against the one mentioned before.
If a child will see or hear a commercial, they would not even understand it.
Although this sounds plausible to me, why would a company make an advertisement directed towards those young children then?
A second argument could be, that such advertisements have a teaching effect on the children.
For example they would learn to differentiate between a fact and an exaggeration as they are broadly found in commercials.
Now all things considered, I think one can believe whatever he wants.
From my point of view, a child should not be directly addressed in a commercial.
They do not have any chance of knowing what is right and what is not and therefore I feel like it should not be allowed to direct advertisements towards young children.
Today nearly all houses in switzerland have a working televison access.
Televisons are very useful.
They can show us interesting documenteries, the news or other interesting things.
But there is one thing that many watchers do not like.
Right, it is the advertising between the programms.
This short spots are composed for the right group off people and tries to manipulate them.
The whole day we can see such things, which want to manipulate us.
When we see one of this spam pictures we can decide, do we really need this things or shoul we ignore them.
That is sometimes may a bit birecte but sometimes we can finde very god things and we will buy them and use them for years.
It is an other situation if children can see this kind of advertising.
The short video clips in the televison are special made that they manipulate the mind of the childrens, and they want to have this toys.
After the program the children search the parents and ask them to buy this stuff.
Imagine your own young child have those wishes, would you ignore them?
Exactly that is the reason why the advertising for children is a such bad buisness.
The people who works in the television get richer and the parents get poor.
To make a point under this subject, I think advertising is not only bad thing it can help you, to find new products.
But I think advertising is not on the right place if you try to manipulate young children, because they are very easy to manipulate and the consequence is, that the parents have to spent their money in usless toys.
I think we should ban the advertising out of the children chanels in the television.
Television advertising for young children doesn't seem like a bad thing to me since it can be easily influenced by the parents.
However, when young children watch over exagerated toy commercials, for example the latest "Littlest Pet Shop" or "Playmobil", they can get easily excited and develop the wish to have these toys.
This can be tough for the parents who have to deal with telling their kids "no".
As we all know, most of the young kids don't take "no" as an answer just like that.
They will start to cry and/or scream, which can be very hard on the parents' nerves.
On the other side, as I shortly mentionned above, parents can decide whether they want their children to see these advertisements or not.
If they just don't let their kids watch TV they won't have arguments about the commercials.
Plus: children aged two to five shouldn't be watching a whole lot of TV (if any TV at all) anyway in my opinion.
It also depends on what kind of advertising it is but since young children don't do a whole lot yet it is rather rare that we see anything different than toy advertisements.
I think there are commercials for products that would only be of temporary enjoyment but I also believe that there are advertiesments that can encourage us to do better.
If there is a commercial for different types of sports for example it could develop an early interest in young kids to be active and play a sport, which would definitely be a more "longterm" joy than some toy.
Another type of commercial that would encourage us to to better is from charity organisations like WWF, Red Cross, ProNatura, etc.
I don't think television advertising toward young children shouldn't be allowed, especially toward children aged two to five.
I don't think I even knew what TV really was when I was that young.
I wouldn't have been able to turn on the TV, that's for sure.
The only thing people/parents should be careful about is WHAT they let their children watch.
I think it is all in their hands.
I think the televison has a big influence to us and specially to young children, because they can't know that a lot of this isn't true.
I think it isn't fair for the children if they watch tv advertising.
But I think it's also a part wich the parents have to control.
Parents shouldn't let their children alone in front of the televison.
And if the child want something after he watched something in the tv the parents have to explain their child, that there is a lot fake and that he doesn't use it.
A great idea is also to give the child early the possibility to say what it want.
So if the child becomes some money for birthday or for christmas the child should have the possibility to buy what it wants.
Also if it isn't a good idea.
If the child hasn't some money it can make an other descision.
Maybe it can wish it as the next christmas present.
The parents have just to look, that the presents have a reason and they don't buy everything for their child just because it wants it.
I think it isn't a big problem, because a lot of the children series are in the internet and you can stream it for free or make an abo.
So if the parents won't sit next to their child, when it is watching tv this is a simple solution.
From the side of the producer I understand, that it is easy to make an advertising for young children.
Because many parents can't say no to their child.
And the producer is just intrested, that the advertising works.
And some adults are sometimes glad about advertising with children things, because they can find easily a nice present.
I think televison advertising directed toward young children isn't nice, but you can't make a rule contre this.
So I think the parents have to look that their child doesn't watch it.
And if advertising directed toward young children scholdn't be allowed, a lot of other advertising sholdn't be allowed too.
Young children television advertising- right or wrong?
Everybody knows this situation your child or little sisters are watching a child television channel like Nikelodeon or Cartoon Network and afterwards they beg to you or to your parents if they can go to the toy-store to buy this new amazing lego-castle, which they have seen in the TV.
This kind of publicity has become a new trend these days.
The question is if the companies are taking advantage of the phantasie of our little beloved?
Should it be banned and if yes what would be law?
Firstly it is very difficult to answer this question, because on the one hand we can clearly see that these advertisings almost brainwashes the heads of our little ones.
But on the other hand, without these commercialbreaks, the channel wouldn't survive and this would be by far more sad if there would be no channels anymore for children.
Secondly we need to ask ourself if there is any differences between the advertsing for children or adults.
In my opinion there are no differences, because everytime we watch our favorite serie or sportsteam in the TV, deep down in our brain we let us influence by companies, which are much more harmful then the toys-companies on Cartoon Network.
I think, it depends on the advertising.
There are advertisings which are not good for children because they are sometimes too young to understand the backround of the advertising.
It could be that they are overwhelmed about an advertising because there are things they don't understand because it is too diffucult for them.
Every child has his own level of understanding things and so it is very difficult to produce an advertising which should be understand by a child who is two years old and a child who is five years old.
Because a child who is two years old has other abilitys than a child who is five years old.
I also think that advertisings for children can be a good thing but they must be handled in a good way.
It also can be that advertisingsfvor children can get understand wrong because the children can get a wrong view of the world.
For espessialy when they see an other child in the advertising which is playing with very much of things from LEGO.
They can get the feeling of not having enough or it could also be that the little children don't have the feeling that they have already enough of things and so they want to have more and more stuff.
They can have the feeling of  never have enough.
This could also be a difficult theme for the parents because not every mother or father can buy all the tings on the television for their child and so they could have a bad feeling about that because they want just the best for their children.
I think it is okay when advertisings for children exist but they should be easy to understand and they should not be all the time about things you can play with but about pets or things you can do with your parents.
Should television adverstising directed toward young children be allowed?
Our generation will be confronted with questions like these more and more with the technical improvement we succes nowadays.
Nearly everybody's got a television at home and use it regularly.
So questions about the themes and adverts which are shown in the TV have to be critically analysed.
Could it be dangerous for children if they get influenced by advertises?
Or are there other reasons beside the developement of the child why this could be dangerous or just inacceptable?
At first, it is hard to define which adverts are directed to children an which not.
How do you really want to define this?
A child in the age of two to five is in his full developement.
At this time it is able to learn much and consume informations on mass without the ability to question everything.
Big concerns can use this weakness by manipulating children with specific techniques.
On the other hand it would be great for the economy.
Making children run to their parents and screaming with the wish of getting this unbelievable great softdrink from the advertise will certainly get some parents weak.
Using childrens dumbness to make as much money as you can is inhuman, isn't it?
Television advertising directed to children should be strictly forbidden, but how do you want do define which adverts are directed to children an which aren't?
Many people nowadays think that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed.
Some of them think that it is just sensless and others see it as a real problem.
So let's just look at the pros and cons of this subject and come to a conclusion.
Waht is definetly a negative point about advertising to kids is that they want everything that they see and stop being happy with the things they already have.
Because kids are so naiv they belive everything said in the advertisement.
They are to young to understad that the companies want to manipulate your brain in a way that you buy their product.
When parents let their kids watch television they want the kids to look a serie for kids or animated movies.
But with the advertisment the kids are not willing to watch televieson anymore but they want that thing that they just saw in the advertisement and start bothering their parents.
So i definetly understand the parents who wants to ban any kind of advertisement toward their young children.
On the other hand it is a good way for companies selling toys and things for kids to sell their products.
Like every other company they have the right to advertise their product.
Often the publicities are directed to the parents so they know what to gift to their kids.
Maybe the parents are thinking about what to buy for their kids.
In that case that kind of advertisement is a good thing.
In the end I think we should let the companies make publicity but we should definetly reduce it.
Because the amount of advertisement on television is enormous.
I think it would also be a good thing to make the publicity directed to young children easier and simpler so we do not manipulate the childe
Television Advertising today is often directed to young children especially in Christmas time.
In the follow sentences i give my statement to this subject.
First of all we must see that the factories and companies want to sell their product, so it's essentially for them to produce television advertising.
Especially the Children aged two to five are a goal of this advertisings because they haven't the expierence what they want.
On the other point of view the advertising directed toward them influences the children to much, so that they want this product, and maybe get some anger with the parents, if they don't want that the children get this product.
Secondly they didn't know if this product is something good for them or not because they're not able to judge the product and believe everything which is said in this product.
In my point of view it should be allowed to direct advertising toward young children, but with some borders.
Only advertising for product which support the childrens learn process should be allowed.
Because this product maybe didn't get enough recognicement so they should place the advertisement in the television.
Other products like toys with no learn function shouldn't get the possibility to place advertisement toward young childrens
Today I will write an essay about the statement if "television advertising directed toward yound children should not be allowed".
Or in other words, in my words, if television publication toward young children has some negatives or positives influences to children's life.
In my opinion, I think it plays an important role, about which theme this television advertising directed toward young children is.
When they cansee some advertising about a movie or serie with sexual backround, then it would be a negative influence.
Because they can not understand the problematic about this sort of film.
But when the publication is about a documentary, which can influence the children in a positive meaning, than I think it would be great, when the children are informed about this documentary.
Also a point, the children have to understand about which thematic this serie/film is.
When they can not understand, what this type of film/serie would say to them.
An exemple, if the publication is about an unreal theme, they get a false picture of the world.
A positive aspect is, the children can watch films and series in which they could be interested.
And when the publication is about a documentary, the children can learn a lot of things, in which they are interested and had not known before.
Another positive point about the television publication is, that the children learn the handle with our digital world.
They have to find out, what they like or do not like about our digital world.
They can learn how they have to handle with this storm of publication.
My opinion about this statement is: Children aged two to five are too young to understand the "television world".
It is too difficult to understand the "world from the olders".
My wish for the future is, that my children would have grown up in a world full of magic moments in reallife.
I think it plays an important role, that children grow up in a natural world.
They have to observe the world with all the advantages and disadvantages.
And when they would see a television advertising, they would be just influenced in the digital world.
I'm very happy about my childhood, in which I grew up in a natural and realistic world.
I had made my own observes and I'm thankful for that.
The aim of this essay is to agree or disagreee with the statement if advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I disagree with the statement because there is no shown dammage of advertising toward young children.
It affects nor their brain nor their character in a bad way.
Another reasons why I disagree is that young children should get accustomed to advertising in young age.
They have to learn how to deal with tempting adverts.
So it's actually good for their learning process.
I agree with the statement because young children are overwhelmed more easily and hesitate less to buy a product shown in a advert.
Even worse if they don't have any money, they are tempted to steal the goods presented in TV.
Adverts are often surreal videos about the affect a product can have.
For example "Red Bull" shows that that the actor is able to fly after drinking a red bull.
Such adverts could influence the behaviour of a young child.
So if they believe in the advert of red bull, they might even jump off a cliff after drinking a red bull because they think they can fly.
I conclude that I agree with the statement based on the reason that advertising could really harm young children and has an influence on their behaviour.
Therefore television advertising toward young children should be banned.
Does TV advertising directed toward young children influence the job market or will they turn them into mindless slaves of the companies?
A lot of people think, that television advertising towards young children should be prohibited.
But why?
Well, this will be shown in the following essay.
If we let our children watch such advertising, they don't really understand what they are watching.
The brain of a two to five year old childisn't able to make a difference between reality and fantasy.
So if it per example watches an advertising for a new toy and it says, that it will turn them happy for the rest of their life, they will believe it.
So we could say, that this advertising brainwashes the young generation and urges them to buy or make their parents buy the products of certain companies.
On the other hand, there is also the chance, that the children don't understand what they are watching or they just forget it, because children at this age aren't really able to remember all the things they witness.
Especially, when they are watching TV, because there they have a real flood of informations and impressions incoming.
Furthermore, the companies which produce the products in the advertising, will sell more of their products, because childrencould be able to urge their parents to buy them.
This could be positive for the companies and even produce more work places in the factories.
Also people could start working as producers, whih only concentrate on child advertisment and how they are the most efficient.
This would also create more jobs.
But letting children wach TV at the age of two to five is really  dangerous and could lead to the fact, that they later won't be able to play by themselve or interact with other cildren, because they never learnt it due to the fact, that they were just watching television the whole day instead of going outside and play.
In the end I'd have to say, that it doesn't matter if there is television advertising toward young children, because children shouldn't stay at home and watch television all day long.
It really isn't healthy and won't help them for their future life.
Also children aren't able to know what is reality and what is fantasy during those commercials, which could lead to dangerous incidents.
They will soon or later be more and more influenced by the companies and this crates a weak personality, if you are getting influenced and brainwashed day by day.
So if I have to say yes or no to TV advertising towards children I would say no.
This hypothesis is very difficult to answer, because in my opinion young children should not watch free TV at this age.
But if they had the possibility and see a advertising there, the possibility that they run after their parents and moan that they want to have this car or something too, is really high.
So the strategy isn't bad.
But I do agree with this statement totally.
I think it is not too good, when the children see some advertising of the companies which is not meant for them.
The children shouldn't watch TV too much and when they want to watch a little story before going to sleep, the parents have to think about it, what theire children are allowed to watch and what not.
So they childs can not raise up to the publicity.
And during the day the should go out and play with friends.
Maybe it is a little old-fashioned, but they have only once their childhood and they can't repeat this time.
So it is in the force of the parents to look after theire children and to look that they do not watch television without the agreement of them.
It isn't good for the children when they watch have to watch programms where are many publicity and which are directed to them, because if the companie reach theire end and brings the parents to the shop and buy the toys, the children know that this works and want to have more and more toys of this company, the parents are disagree and then there are arguments in this family and this isn't the cause of the companies I think.
Should the television advertising directed toward young children ( aged two to five ) be allowed or not allowed ?
Personnaly I think that the telivision advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I think at the age of two to five years the children are to young and it will be better waiting more years with it or you can make a limit of watching television and only 1 hour at one day or something in this way.
I think that it is not a good way to grow up your child if it can watch television because then he wants it more and more and it will be more difficult to not allowed them watching televison so long or all day.
I think it has to have a limit how long and when young children ( aged two to five ) can watch television because it has also more think to learn for them and it has very much better things to do.
The children has to learn things also outside and do something and they have to be activ when they are so young, they don't have to sit at home infront of the television and doing and learning nothing.
It can be one hour ore more like a limit how I sayd because to watch television isn't a bad thing for young children but it has to have a limit.
It has so much things to do with young children, they have to see something and be activ at their young age that's important for them.
At the end I can say that I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children ( aged two to five ) should not be allowed.
But I can also say that I agree not totally with the statement because it isn't a bad thing and if it has a limit and it is controlled it can be allowed.
The golden age after the second world war was the beginning of the biggest economic growth wonder in human history.
New inventions like television helped us to improve our luxury standart and the financial power of some parts of the industrie.
Companies learnt really fast how to use this new media for their advantage.
Televison made it posibble to show millions of people puplicity in a really effective way.
Publicity is for everyone, also for children.
But are young childre able to realise what they see or are they controlled by the big consortiums which want to sell the greatest amount of products or should it be disallowd?
First of all I think that the parents have the responibility for their children.
In my case I was also effected by the advertisings but I think parents kept it cool.
They listen to my and wanted to know why I really need this product.
After my arguments they decided.
Often they gave my good reasons and arguments why I do not need want sounded good in television.
This way of handling helped me to get a sensitivity to seperate usefull things from rubbish.
My second reason why I am totally against disallowments is that we live in a liberal world.
This spirit of free thinking should not be destroyed by people who want to make everything forbidden.
We have to use our brain to think about what we need.
In my opinion it would be bad for the economy as well.
There are so many regulations in our society.
I don't think it would be better if we make good buissines impossible.
It's a fact that publicity is essential for companies to make money and pay their employed people.
Finally I would say its
Advertising is one of the key concept of a free-market economy.There are many different kind of advertising, adressing different age-, and social groups.
Even young children, with the age of two to five, are exposed to advertising.
We live in a free-market economy.
That capitalism can function well, we need to limit the restrictions, made by the government.
Our economy shall be as liberal as possible and a restriction, which permits advertising to very young people is not necessary at all.
Additionally, we must not forget the importance of gaining a young customer base.
All those very young children will be potential customers one day and you as an enterprise want to reach out for them as early as possible.
Nevertheless, we need to consider the possible damage, children can suffer from, being so exposed to advertisment from young age on.
Advertisment aims on stimulating a very special part of our brain.
It stimulates our unconcious mind.
It is likely, that young children`s developtment is hindered by this kind of intended manipulation.
Summarized it can be said it is a conflict between capitalistic and health values.
Either we harm our free-market economy even more or we just accept that our children are exposed to a potential disruption of the developtment process.
Today many children are sitting in front of the TV most of their freetime.
Even in the morning before the parents are awake.
In this essay I explain the arguments why television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
First of all if children watch TV they mostly like to watch cartoons which aren't very intelligent and from which they not really can learn something.
But most parents let their children watch TV, so they can do other things, for example working, or they can sleep longer and the children are happy and quiet and dont't distract them.
An other reason is, that when children watch to much TV they become less creative.
In Tv the stories are given and you only have to watch and listen.
This children loose the ability to imagine a own story.
Children which play with toys do that every time thay play.
Lastly you can also say that children which watch to much TV don't know what to do in their freetime if they can't watch TV.
They are addicted of watching TV.
Most of this children aren't sportif and have problems with their body.
Watching Tv is not very healthy.
The television is a good thing, when you are bored and when you have nothing to do.
Unfortunalety parents give childreen the permission to watch TV, mostly when they have not very much time for them.
So the childrens have soemthing to do and the parents won`t be disturb by their childrens.
With the time young children came much earlier in contact with the TV or also with computers or smartphones.
But what are the consequences of the children, if they look to early TV or thing like that?
If the partens are stressed they can say to the childrens that they have to look TV, so most of the childrens are quiet calm and they are very focused on the TV.
It depends of cours, which program they watch.
Sometimes there are really good programms for kids which be very informativ.
The kids can learn things from docus about animals or just thing which are important for the world.
But there is also a bad site.
In the TV programm are many thing which childrens should not watch.
If young childreen watch very often TV they know only this and maybe their social behaviour will be not very good after.
My oppinion is that young children can watch Tv but not very often, maybe one or two times a week for one hour.
But the parents should be there and they have to controll what the childrens watch.
Kids should play with their games and with their friens, this is much importer than watching TV.
But I think that kids which are younger than four should not watch TV often or weekly because they don`t realise really what is happening there.
Finally I say they should not be allowed or not.
It`s a thing which the parents should say and they can make a desicon how often they want that their childrens watch TV.
But I think they are also interessted that their childrens play with the games and their friends and not only watching TV.
It depends on the given information, the intent by the advertisement.
Publicity is economically the biggest and one of the most important things money is spend on.
Forbidding the publicity would have a great impact on the economical marketing as consequence.
It would mean a extrem loss for companies but also in politics.
It is often not dangerous.
It does not affect the childrens minds.
For them it is more a nuisance than an important information.
They simply ignore it and so it has not the brainwash effect that is mostly feared.
More problamatic are the youngsters with 6 to 12 years.
Because then they are in a easier way to influece and advertisements have a bigger effect on them.
Children are very interesting, because they have the ability to suck up all and every information they are given, like a sponge.
So they are always in danger to learn things they should not.
But that is a common fact that is mostly forgotten.
Publicity does not harm kids.
What really harms them is the television itself.
This is more a parental point of view: kids should not spend too much time in front of the TV.
They should learn things by experience and by watching in the reality.
Do you know what really grinds my gears?
The amount of money spend on publicity.
It is so ernormous.
With that money we could have saved and still could save millions of people who are in a very difficult situation.
we are obligated to help them
Advertising is one sort of earning money nowadays.
After every TV programmes will be time for a five minute break and this break will be filled with advertising.
Adertising are made to cover the watchers eyes and to buy a product.
But since the Television streams cartoons for childern, the advertisement agencis use the attenion of the childern to sell even more products.
The unknown child will fall in to this trap and annoys the parents to getthe toyor whatever.
This strategy of the agencis are very quetionable and leads to dicussions nowadays.
Here are some argument which will show you why the advertising should not be allowed.
Firstly the children do not know anything about money or the even the world and how it is working.
It will see the advertisement and will not stop crying until it gets the toy.
At first it will probably forgetit but a advertisement will come a serveral time during a day on TV.
So the children sees the toy and can not stop thinking about it.
And this can happen with plenty of other advertisements.The parents have no choice and they will buy the product for the baby so it can stop asking and can be happy.
Another point is that children are in their growth process.
If it gets confronted with advertising daily after every TV programe thechildrenwants then everything and if the parents are not strict it will do that in its teenager years too and then probably for thewhole live.
Children have to be educated thatif they want somethingtheyhave to dothings before they can even imagine of getting something.
The last point is that advertising for children is unnecessary and it is just a psychological way to earn money which is really childish.
A child watches TV to learn the language or to understand the situation in the TV programs,not to get attracted bya toy.
In myopinion advertisingon childrens TV channel should be prohibited.
Some programes have already shut down the advertising on childrens programme.
Plan:

introduction: what about?, why ?
paragraph 1: why not good?
paragraph 2: why not disallow?
conclusion: pissible solution (controld consum)

Introduction:
We all know this discussion about the consumerism of the medias by children.
Some people think that children under 5 years should not be able to watch something on the television.
Others think, that it is good for the children so that they can achieve a higher level in life because they learned by watching the television.
First I want to look at the position of people who are against the television.
Their probably biggest argument is, that the TV is not good for our eyes.
But another very big argument, I want to write about is the neglection of their social ¨lives.
Children who watch too much TV do not care anymore about their real lifewith their true friends and prefer to watch Tv than to go out.These people may have a big disadvantage in their lives.
It is not good if a child is watching TV because it is bad for social lifes in the future and maybe they will get bullied later in their lifes because others who did not watch TV have friends and they have not.
That is a true sign that the TV and other mediasare not good for children and they should better go out and play football or other games like we did when we were children.
Secondly I want to talk about this out of the view of people who do not want to disallow children to watch television.
One of their arguments I want to look at abit more exactly.
It is the argument that if children do nt watch Tv until they are five yars old they will try to watch much more when they are over five years old and they can watch Tv by these people it is as well possible that they sop having a social live and they will get bullied.
In conclusion we have to say, that both sides have good arguments and we should take a middle solution.This middle solution would be, that parents allow their children to use these medias before they are five years old but they should control their consum.
So that it is something like half an hour per day.
Thanks for your attention.
Television advertising directet toward young children should not be allowed.
Children under five years don`t have an idea if a product is good or not for them.
They aren`t able to think critically about something and so they think everything they like is good.
The general problem is that television advertising can have an influence on a childs way of thinking.
For example if there is a young boy with play-gun in an advertisement, another young boy would also like to have such a gun.
But often these guns look very simmilar to real guns.
So the young boy wants to have a gun.
With this gun he points at human beeings while playing with it.
In the end it`s possible that he doesn`t see a difference between real life and his game.
Another example is young girls playing with barbies.
They think the barbie is very beautiful and they want to be like her.
Later in their life they won`t look like a barbie and they fall into a depression.
And if they hadn`t seen the television advertising, they wouldn`t have had a barbie and now a depression.
I think the real problem is that television advertising directed toward young children is seen.
Children shouln`t watch TV all the time, they should go out and play with their friends.
If they don`t watch TV a lot, they don`t see a lot of advertisement and the problem wouldn`t even exist.
If they see the advertisement only a few times I don`t think that this has a bad influence on them because they will not remember the product.
So a few advertisings for good stuff are totally OK but it shouldn`t be too much.
Television adverts directed to young children are no problem.
The children can see what is new on the market and maybe they find their new birthday present by watching the adverts.
If there is an advert for a my little pony in television that does not mean every little girl does want to own it.
If they see the pony in tv or in walmarts is no difference, so they will find out anyway.
Another good point about children advertising is that you can make a good influence on the boys and girls.
You could bring a television spot about WWF and that they could join the 'panda club' to help the nature and animals.
Last but not least parents can be thankful for the adverts because they make a break between their childs favourite show.
If the series on nickelodeon would play non-stop, parents would not be able to take their child away from the television.
But while some people think adverstising for children is harmless, you can argue with some points that show the contrary.
When children spot their favourite toy in television they immediately want to have it.
You can not argue with them and by watching television they really get confronted with new toys.
While you are able to avoid these parts in supermarkets.
Additionaly, adverts can make a big influence and there are not many 'good adverts' around.
While your five year old son would like to have a lego star wars battleship, your two year old daughter is not that happy about seeing little lego figures shooting at each others heads.
To sum up advertising directed to young children should  not be allowed.
A child aged two to five is defenitely too young for adverts and could be influenced badly.
I understand that most of the television channels do not function without adverts, so if there is no possibility to prohibit advertising on kids channels, you should not let your child watch television in this young age.
As a child I always used to watch KIKA.
My parents tought its the only channel which should be alowed to children because there is no advertising and they don't try to convince and manipulate the children to buy something.
The other TV channel was Superertel.
Superertel had a lot of advertising in between a film and I liked that.
It was for a child like me very intresting to see what the most common trends are and what I could wish for my birthay or christmas.
But should it be allowed to direct TV advertising towards children?
TV advertising is directed towards every goup of age so why should it not be derectet towards children.
If you watch TV you also need to accept that there is advertising.
The Parents of children need to decide if they want their children to watch TV.
Nobody gets forced to watch TV so if you don't want your child to watch advertising you can skip the breaks or your child just dosen't watchs TV.
There are also some channels for children with less arvertisement (e.g.
KIKA).
Every advertisement company knows that children are very easy to manipulate so they take the opportunity espacialy in chistmestime to influence the children.
So on one had you can say that they use the maturity of children and on the other hand you can say that it is just a business and it's just a logic strategy of the companys.
But the argument with the use of maturity imediately loses its power if you keep in mind that watching TV is voluntary.
In conclusion I think that it should be allowed to direct TV advertising towards children because nobody gets forced to watch TV and there are ways to overcome the advertising for example in a filmbreak.
For companys its very important that they can show advertising and manipulate children because there is no better way to reach them then through advertising.
We're confronted everyday and everywhere with ads.
The goal of this ads is to influence us to buy the product.
But where isn't it good anymore to influence people?
First, children aged two to five shouldn't watch TV.
They are too young to sit in front of a television and too young to understand what they see.
When they see an ad with Barbie for example they want a Barbie because they are fascinated from this toy and want it.
These ads shouldn't exist because they influence young children who normally want everything what makes sound, moves or is sparkling.
Another reason why televison advertising for young children should not be allowed is because they can't handle all those different ads with thousands of toys.
These children can't buy the toys by themself because they don't earn money.
It isn't effective to make ads for young children because the parents control what toys they have.
To summarize, ads should only exist to adults because they earn there one money and are able to control how they spend there money.
Otherwise the parents have to buy toys for the children because they want it so bad.
All in all I can say that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because they are too young to understand that they want to sell products.
I will explain you the reasons why I am against this Statement.
I think when they can't do television advertising they find other ways who are as well as succesfull as the Television advertising to sell there products.I mean just when you go in a  shopping mal you get everywhere influenced and you don't even remark it .Also it is hard to forbid it because you have to make rules , and its hard to decide when an television advertising is for five years old children and when not, they could easily say no our toy is for six years old children.
So they could put it on Television.
And I don' agree with the age, in my opinion you can't understand and memorise a Television advertising with two years.
More efficient it would be from the age six to ten.Becaus in this age you understand the advertising completely and you remember the wonderful pink dog toy( for example).
And when I was a little kid i didn't watch that much Television I nearly never watched it.Hoever our society has changed during the last ten years the families with young children that I know don't let the chidren watch often television as well.So i come to the conclusion that it isn' the write age because they didn' alway understand an memorise it and they don't watch as much Television as older childrens do.
It is a really big act who in my opinion wouldn' t be really succesfull because you get nowadays nearly everyday and everywher influenced to buy something.
Thats why I am against the Statement: Television advertising directed toward young children ( aged two to five ) should not be allowed:
Television advertising is important for young children for learning not to believe everything what is showed in television.
They have to learn that they can't have everything they want and television advertising is a good way to improve that.
Children also get a feeling for what is possible in this world and could already make a mind about what they are going to buy in the future.
But now to the con arguments.
In my view children shouldn't see all that nonsense, which is often mentioned in adverts.
Children are to young to make a diffrence between the reality and the informations in adverts.
Adults know what's the truth behinde  them in opposite of the kids.
Futhermore children shouldn't
see some of those adverts, because for example there are somtimes online games presented,which are cruel and show violent.
Or what's with the adverts of online cambling websites?
Most the of them are very colourful and seem very interresting.
And if a child visit such a website, it will become very dangerous for it.
The adverts of social media is also not very good for young children.
They come in contact with things for those they are not old enough.
To sum it up I continue with my own oppinion.
I totally agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
In my view children, who are aged two to five, are not old enough for even watching television or seeing adverts.
Children couldn't really make their own opinion about a advert, because they don't have any experience with them.
Kids are kids and on should let them their lifes without any lyings about  products.
They are too young for understanding what's behind the adverts
In the days of television and social media advertising is an improtant subject which has to be discussed and even more the advertising directed toward young children, because often even such kids have a free access to such plattforms filled with advertisnig.
The main argument for abandonig this advertising would probably be that young children are more likely to believe what they see and hear from partents, teachers and even television.
Due to theire young age they can easily be persuaded by an advertisning for a product.
It often is mentioned in these television advertisings that the advertised product - often a toy - is everything that you need.
These words or phrases like that can have a big impact on such young humans and they often even begin to believe them.
The consumation of the product develops to a need.
On the other hand side you may say that even young children have the possibilty to have a free will and to at last decide wether they like a product or not.
The fact that the action of buying the product of interest in the end is made by adults is very improtant as well.
Without parents, other family members or other related not minor persons paying for an object the kids can't even consumate it or without people allowing them to watch television they will not get in contact with television advertising.
Kids are depending on these older persons.
An argument which is not directly talking about free will of children but is improtant for the pro-side of not allowing these adverts anymore is that the children very early get in contact with a society that mostly consumates and that is filled with advertising.
Children should have the possibility to increase theire creativity in this world.
They should have the possibility to change the place that they are living in and this can not happen that easy if they are affected by all these advertisings and can't develope theire own wishes and dreams.
But are then not even adults products of an advertised world and not as creativ as they could be?
For my part I am not to sure what I think about the statement.
The line between a free will and persuation is very thin.
I would like to have a world without such a lot of advertising affecting me, adults and young children.
Some weeks ago my five year old nephew saw an advertisement about a car toy on television.
I remember how he immediately called his mother and asked her to buy him that toy.
My sister didn't buy it, but it was okay because my nephew already had a big car toy.
As young children tend to believe everything they get told, they are very likely to be influenced.
This is used by many companies through television advertising to make them want something.
The pressure of needing something in order to have fun or to be cool already confronts these young children.
And if a child doesn't get what it wants, it fastly gets frustrated and sad.
This might be caused by the famous phenomenon, which says that children never can get enough toys.
On the other hand some might say that it's the fault of the parents as well, who didn't teach their children enough to be happy with a couple of toys.
The fact that children aged two to five normally didn't develop that much yet.
So they do not realise that something isn't necessary to have even though they are interested in it.
Another argument for these television advertisement could be the money these television channels need.
During childs programm on television there is always some advertisement.
When a child watches a childs series it it understandable that it is normal to show advertisements which are appropriate for children and not to show adults advertisements.
Some television channels need these advertising companies to support their channel and to make sure they are still able to show their content in the future.
To bring it on point: Young children are very easy to get influenced and companies know that.
It is the parents challenge to talk to their children about that.
In my opinion this still doesn't justify the companies advertising.
I think it should not be allowed because these children already get to see many toys in the stores and it just brings more pressure for the parents.
Television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Todays world is overgrown by incessant advertising.
Many ads are unfortunately directed at children that barely learned to talk, many people think this should be banned.
In the United Kingdom fast food companies are not allowed to air their advertisements during children tv, this was done to lower child obesity rates, but many people argue that this is a step in the wrong direction.
This law does not help the children but rather the parents that do not have control over their children, or are not strong enough, to say "no" to their kin.
The same group of persons think that children should get used to advertising as soon as possible and learn to ignore, or judge it as this is very important later in their lives.
On the other hand side young two to five year-olds are very easy to manipulate and should be safeguarded until they are ready to evaluate advertising.
In my opinion are children exposed to adverisements all the time and should therefore be taught to ignore, or evaluate it, at young age, advertising should not be regulated by the sate but rather by the parents.
Advertising
A lot of people of two until hundert years old people watch televsison.
Watch TV is a important thing in our world.
Because with watch TV we learn a lot of things par example with the news on TV, whats going on with the word or the document films, the life of an animal.
But should watch TV be allowed to the two until five years old childern also?
With this question I will be going on.
It is not good for the very young childern to watch television because it is not good for the healthy for par example for the eyes.
And when the children will be older they look enough televison.
That is the reason why I think televison advertising directed toward the two until five years old children should not be allowed.
Because when the televison advertising should be allowed to the children then they watch televison.
But in this young ages we can do a lot of other things.
Probably the childern don't want go out for playing whith their friends.They are only sitting in theirs room an focused on watch TV.
But sometimes the television advertisting brings a lot of good things.
So that the childern can learn a lot of things in this young ages.
That is an avantage for the children later.
They can learn things in an other way and that could be funny.
In the end I want say that television advertisting could be an avantage but also a desavantage.
When the parents look that the children don't watch televison a lot then I think television advertisting should be allowed.
It is said that television avertising toward yound children is unhealthy and should be forbidden.
In this essay I want to find out if this statement makes sens and emphasize some arguments for and against advertising.
to begin with, advertising is normal in our society and it`s not possible to ban it beause of young children.
I don`t know what your children watch but I was addicted to Superrtl or Nickeloden.
These are typical channels for children and don`t include advertising bad things so there is no reason to ban televison advertising because this only happens on channels which your son or girl shouldn`t watch.
I want to mention that there isn`t just one type of advertising.
When you hear this word you think about something bad or unimportant.
But there are few types of useful advertising for example sofatutor.
This is a useful online platform to help your children learn in funny ways.
Finally, it's not that every child who sees advertising buys that instantly.
They have not the knowlege to use moms credit card so it's not dangerous that they buy some incorrect things.
You must be very stupid as a mom when you buy these thingsvso the children don't even realise that this products can be bought.
In conclusion, there is absolutly no way to ban televison advertising for young children because there is simply no reason to do that because most of the time children don't even realise that it`s advertising.
We all know these kinds of advertising.
When you ar sitting on the sofa, watching TV, maybe even a good film, there is of course a block of ads.
For example one of Toys R Us.
They show happy children at the age of four with little cars, figures or other kinds of toys.
But is it okay to influence young children already at this age?
If you show a young boy a picture of a toy, maybe a car, he of course wants one.
But is he able to buy one?
No, he`s not, so the influence of the television advertising is zero.
Due to this, the advertisment is just for the parents, who maybe want to buy their kids these kinds of toys.
Because of this, it should be allowed to show advertising directed toward young children, because they aren`t affected.
Well, on the one hand it`s true that the parents are influenced by these TV ads.
But on the other hand, the child also sees these ads, so it is also affected.
Of course a three year old girl can`t buy barbies, but she can talk to her mother, who hasn`t saw the advertising.
Maybe she has to ask more times her mother to buy her a barbie, but after a few weeks, the mother will eventually give up and buys her daughter a barbie.
Then, the toystore has reached their goal, the selling of a barbie.
In this example, the mother is only indirect affected by the advertising, but the little girl is the direct victim of the toystore.
If she hadn`t watched the advertising, which is directed toward her, she hadn`t asked her mother, and she hadn`t bought the barbie.
Because of these arguments, I think it is better to prohibit the advertising toward young children, at least until the age of five.
It is not okay, that the big toy concernes use the young children to make even more money.
we should safeguard the next generation against the bad influence of the toy industry, where only the profit, and not the children is important.
We all are influenced by televison.
But nothing is as influencable as little children.
But anyways, alot of television advertising is directed towards the youngest of our society.
In the following text it is written about why nevertheless advertising directed to little children shouldn't be prohibitted.
While an adult person mostly can tell truth and false appart, a child can't.
And while watching TV, they absorb alot of information witch can have a very negative influence to the child's mind and their future consumption habbits.
On the other hand if Television advertising directed to children should not be allowed, then the children shouldn't be allowed watching TV at all.
Children don't only notice spots and shows directed to them, they notice everything.
And back to the future consumption habbits.
In my opinion, the consumption habbits is mostly a question of how the consumption habbit of the parents look like, and how they teach their children handling their money.
If parents don't want the possible negative influence of advertising for children, they shouldn't let them watch TV at all.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
On television theres allways something for everyone.
The dads who love car races or the mums who love teleshopping and the teenanger who loves horror and psycho movies and in the end also cute episodes for small kids who like watch spongebob squarepants.
But what happens when the small two to five year old children klick to another side and see these disturbing things which they don't understand in this age?
They are scared and can't sleep anymore because they are just too young for these kind of things.
Its dangerous to let a young child watch television alone.
There are so many other things they could do instead of always watching television.
Television takes the kreativity and the motivation to expolre the world.
Only watch television is so easy but its bad.
It's bad for the eyes, for the concentration and for the power of a child.
These small humans should first of all learn how to do things by themselfs that they don't get bored.
In life theres much more than just a dumb television where you only have to klick one thing and it's working.
But it's also important to say that television also has some good things on it.
With television you can just put the littleones in front of and you can do the things you have to do.
There are so many diffrent channels for children which are funny and interessting they actually can learn something while watching television.
they can nget in touch with the whole world and all different cultures.
But is this that you want for you child ?
My opinion is that it's bad to put theire children allways in front of the tv.
tThey have to learn and meet so many things and have to get kreative.
It's not all about television.
It's important to know what you like and have to get used to the whole life outside the house.
It's more important to know how to life than to know where the hat of dorie is.
It's a fact, that there's a lot of television advertisments that are designed to appeal children, even young toddlers between the age of two and five years.
They are usually aired on television channels that aim toward such a young public.
But is it okay to influence people with the power of media from such a young age?
There are positive aspects, especially in economical terms.
Children will see a product while watching TV, and feel the desire to own it because the promoters on the screen told them that the just-shown product was something they needed.
Children who beg their parents to purchase the wanted item (usually some sort of toy) will eventually get it.
That means workers are needed to produce and sell the toy which leads to more income amongst workers and in the end to a higher GDP.
On the other hand, there are also negative points, that may affect the child's mental health.
For example, the child will be exposed to our societal standards and all their issues.
A black child may ask himself why all the 'cool kids' with the amazing toys are white.
That could lead to decreasing self-confidence, because that black child doesn't see role models that apply to their appereance and heritage.
Gendered toys could also bewilder all the young viewers because they feel more drawn the the object that is identified with a boy or a girl when they're the opposite sex.
In my opinion, there shouldn't be any advertising of any kind aimed to reach children that age because there is more damage than good done.
Also, children in that age shouldn't waste their time sitting in front of the TV watching all those advertisments but much more, go outside and live in a world where they aren't influenced by money-seeking people, as long as they can.
The television advertising directed toward young children is a critical point.
Young children can be influenced easily.
If you show them an advertising of a toy with many special effects and stuff that children usually like, the children will run to their parents and tell them to buy the toy.
But in my opinion this argument is the only one which is negativ.
The advertises for young children aren't anything bad.
And I think it doesn't have a bad influence to them.
Well, it is an advantage for the industry of toys and children stuff, but it is nothing bad for the parents or the children.
Because if a child goes to his parents and wants them to buy something, it is in their own responsibility to decide yes or no.
Another argument that speaks for the advertising for young children is, that children in this age have to learn not to buy everything they see in the television.
I don't see any other reasons why advertising for young children should not be allowed.
I remeber when I was young and I saw those advertisings.
I always ran to my parents and asked them to buy those things for me.
But they often say no but told me to put it on the llist for my christmaswishes.
So there was hope that I maybe would receive what I saw in the television.
So with the all those arguments I totally disagree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
First of all, in our days there aren't many advertisements directed towards young children aged two to five.
Some advertisements though illustrate toys or objects to play with, which are for young kids.
But now is the question, should television advertising be allowed for this young audience?
Are there more advantages or disadvantages?
Let's analyse this phenomen.
Generally, technology develops from time to time and becomes better and we can see that there's a big progress everytime we take a look at the technology development.
Seeing kids in a young age holding a mobile phone and texting messages or surfing on the internet, becomes more commun than ever before.
And the same situation is present in the tv-audience.
We all know that all around the world, there is a huge amount of tv-watchers.
And to present new products or new devices there's nothing more clever than for a firm to advertise its product on the tv, where a lot of people could get interested to it and buy it.
This is the market world, it's the way it works, with a good advertisement u can convince people to buy the product which is presented.
Lots of children stare at the tv-screen for hours and fill their day watching tv programes.
And during the breaks, advertisements are showed.
For example some are more directed to women, some more for men,and of course some more for our beloved children.
And all people know, that if a new product on the tv is ready to get selled, and it looks cool, children get convinced and become so stubborn, because they want their parents to buy it.
It has always been like this till now.
And regarding our critical question, if also advertisements directed to really young children aged two to five should also be made to convinced this kind of audience, is probably a realy critical question.
How can toys shop (shops for young children) sell their new products if their advertisements aren't allowed directed to their personal audience on the tv?
The tv is most of the time especially in families on.
The chance that a young child sees the new product illustrated ond on the tv is much higher than in a shop behind the vetrine.
Generally the parents shouldn't allow their young children to sit in front of the tv and stare on the screen for hours, this has its health reasons, but if the children see suddenly an advertisement directed for them, and they like how the toy  looks like or whatever it could be, why not buy it?
I'm convinced that advertisements directed toward young children shouldn't be banned, every firm or shop has the right to advertise its product,if at the end they don't gain a lot, it's their problem, but they still have to have the right to present them on the tv, even if it's especially directed to young kids.
I do not agree with this statement at all.
Nowadays there are a lot of companies that produce toys for kids.
There are also big stores, for example "Toys'r'us", that only sell kids toys.
The most common way to advertise such toys and stores is by making adds in a way that kids feel the need to buy that toy.
This is the way every advertising works.
Not just toy advertising.
Also adult specific companies make there advertising in a way that they want to buy there product.
The only difference is, that adults can buy there products immediately.
On the other hand young children can't buy toys.
They have to get the permission of their parents first.
Moreover the way how our economy works is by advertising.
You can not watch TV and expect to not see adds at all.
Or you can not read a newspaper without seeing adds.
That is just the normal way how TV stations get their money.
And through the adds the audience will decide wether to buy this product or not.
It doesn't matter if the add is directed to old or young people.
If toy companies are not allowed to advertise their products, how are they supposed to make money?
So I don't see why advertising directly toward young children should not be allowed.
The technical revolution cannot be stopped.
This revolution has dark sides and has a bih influence of the developement and education of the childern, teenagers and even for the alduts.
In the culture of switzerland, is it difficult to find a household without technical influence.
The most common is, besides the home phone , Television.
Because of the high number of persons watching television , not even in switzerland but in the majority of the first world countrys, brings a wide market for very different Firmen to show their newest product and to build a connection to the people watching their advertising.
There are uncounable advertisings, showing around the world.
Some of them are International shown, some of them just in one ore two nations.
Most of the Advertisings are with Persons who have a different gender and physical look.
There are also used childes in the age of two.
Mostly the parent want their children to become a famous model and want to promote them as early as possible.
This big pressure destroys the childrens fantasy and gives them- even if they are so little- the feeling (later) that they have to be dressed nice and have to have a beautifull face and body.
The children go to the mask wehre they get mascara on their eyelashes and skin products on their skin to make the cheeks moor red .
And the parents have no problem with it.
And that is the reason ehy I
As a child, I loved watching TV.
The colourfull pictures and impressions would just flash across my vision.
I was fascinated by the persuading images and was proud of having an activity in common that so many adults also enjoyed.
After watching the commercials during the breaks of my favorite TV shows, I would run to my mother and try to persuade her into buying me all those cool toys.
But is it correct of the advertisers to make commercials directed towards yound children between the age of two to five or should it be forbidden?
From my point of view, a young child is not able to think rationally and decide if an advertisment is accurate or not.
It just sees the pretty colours and the nice women talking directly to them to try to sell a product.
They are influenced by many small factors, like the specture of colours, the different animated characters and so on.
For example a commercial for cereals that has a monkey who is acting funny and being silly makes the children watching the commercial feel happy and confident.
It is not the cereal itself that looks appealing to them.
So how could they even be able to tell that that chocolate in there isn't healthy for them.
In addition to that, many parents aren't able to tell their children no.
They get that a child is into something and just want to make their child happy.
Because of that, it can happen that the chocolate cereal, to further explain my previous example, has a bad influence on the kids health and many parents wouldn't even want to prevent it.
Besides that, these commercials usually use other younger aged children, to persuade the child in front of the monitor.
They may seem cool while they consume a good or service and that then makes the child, which has an impact on their customer, the parent, think it is cool to use it.
In this case, the kid's trust to other children is cruelly used.
If the child then has a bad experience with the good or service, it can only remember how it's trust into the kid from the advertisment was used against it, they may even feel betrayed and feel the same way a lot faster, when it comes to other children in their school for example.
To conclude, I do not think, it is morally correct to use the innocent children in such a way, because at such a young age they are not able to judge in the same way, we as adults are.
If there are commercials for children, they should first be checked by a third party, and then be shown on television.
The fact, that the things that are being showed on TV affect our lifes cannot be denied.
Adevrtising, movies, political discussions,- even the weather report- has an impact on our daily actions, what clothes we wear, to whom we give our votes, which juice we buy in the stores.
Everybody watches TV, so nearly everyone can be reached by its messages.
If parents were being asked, wether they approved advertisment specifically designed for their young kids, probably none of them would be too pleased.
But still, commercial companies do try to reach adnd influence little childern.
Wether it's healthy or not for kids to spend a lot of time in front of the TV is another question that cannot be discussed in this essay,- i shall take it as a fact.
But when parents allow their kids to watch TV, they need to keep in mind, that commercials and ads will pop up and have an impact on the childs behaviour.
Of course, one could ask that they can't just walk in a store and buy stuff themselves anyways, so what's the bad thing about it?
But not only do parents influence their children, it's also that the children have a huge impact on their parents!
It's very likely, that when a kid really wants to have a specific product, the parents will eventually buy it for them.
So indirectly, commercials and ads are actually made to get parents or other grown ups to buy certain products for their kids.
So in fact, there is not much of a difference between the advertisment for grown ups and the one for children,- in the end, it's the same person buying the product.
If a parent allows the kid to watch TV, it also allows advertisment companies to do their work, so it's the parents choice what he wants the kid to influence.
On the other hand, it could also be said that children often watch shows or programmes simply for entertainement, like as an alternative to being read a book or good night story by their parents.
Is this really the right occasion to place in commercials?
TV for children is not some kind of sale-show, children don't have their own money to spend, they won't question the things showed on TV.
Like that, they of course present easy 'victims' for advertising companies.
Maybe the parents only want the children to watch the show, and not see commercials.
So is this fair, or some kind of mean tricking?
I think, that in this age, everything the kids see, all their actions, their comportement is the work of their parents.
If parents are against children-commercials, they should simply not allow their kids to watch TV at all.
TV lives from commercials, be it for grown ups, the elderly or kids.
Everyone should have the right to decide what he wants to see, but TV and ads cannot be separated.
Of course, commercials can be annoying or have bad influences, but there is a possibility to escape that: Just switch of the TV!
There are far worse things being showed than children advertisemnet- violence, death, catastrophes- so why forbid something that each and everyone can avoid seeing,- it's all about choice and willpower, to raise kids without their daily dose of TV-
I don't agree with this statement.
Television advertisments, that are directed towards children can be allowed.
An argument against the advertising for small chlidren is, that children are easy to manipulise.
But that isn't a problem, because parents are here care for their child.
If a child sees a commercial for a toy he wants he will ask his parents to buy that toy for him.
Which isn't a bad thing, because there is nothing wrong with, liking something and wanting it.
But it becomes a problem when it repeats itself and at that point the parents should come into role.
The child doesn't have any money, so he has to ask his mother or father for money and even if the kid sees hundreds of commercials for stuff he wants, he can ask his parents as much as he wishes but they will never buy it for him.
Even if television advertising directed toward young children will be banished, it would not change a thing.
I never saw or heard of a kid, that came to me and said that saw a commercial of a toy and now ownes the toy.
Kids want toys that their friends have or that their brothers have and not what they see on television.
A spoiled child is spoiled, because of his parents and not bacause of commercials.
And anyway children should not watch so much television.
It's not the commercials that are bad for the children it's the television shows that ruin them.
The commercials make them want stuff, but the shows change the way they think.
Should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed?
Im my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
Because television advertising can be informative for something the children wants, and the parents shouldn't allow everything when his children wants something.
Not every television advertising is bad for young children.
If there is a advertising about a special toy, why should that be forbitten for children?
It is clear that the parents aren't happy when their child wants everything what they see in the television advertising.
But they can learn something about it and the parents know what is fancy and what not.
Another point is that the parents should decide what the children are watching in the TV.
And if there is something what the children want, the parents shouldn't allow everything.
They should say no and must be consequent.
So I think that television advertising directed toward young children shoul be allowed.
Because you cant permit every television advertising.
Not every television advertising is good for young children but they have to learn what's right and what's wrong.
In the end I think the parents have to decide what the children shoul watch and what not.
If  young children are watching TV and seeing the newest Lego or Playmobile stuff they are fascinated and are running immediatly to their parents to ask them to buy it.
So towards who is TV advertising directed?
A good thing about TV advertising directed toward children is that parents get new ideas what they could buy their children as a present if they ask for.
But then the advertising is automatically directed to the parents because they owned the money to buy their children something if they are as young.
So in the end it is not something parents are happy about because they have to spent much more money they wanted to spent because in the TV advertising only the best and most of the time the most expensive things are presented.
You can say that a child is calmed down if they sees so many things they wanted to own and got new ideas what to play or what they should talk about with their freinds.
But it is like the opposite because if children want to have something they started crying as long as they get what they wanted.
So for parents it is not a free time when their children are watching TV because they are always intterupted if a new cool game is shown in the TV advertising and their children are asking to got it.
It is a good thing to show your things you wanted people to buy in TV but if you show childrens stuff it is not very efficient because they can also go with their parents in a shop like Toys`R`us and buy it on their own with the knowledge what you wanted to buy your children.
So in the end TV advertising directed towards young children is absolutely not necessary because parents are getting poor by buying too much stuff which their children not needed.
It is also not directed towards children but towards their parents so you can not talk about TV advertising directed towards children.
Whenever you turn on the TV, whether it is because you want to watch a movie or because you watch the news every day, you see all the things you never realized you needed.
But suddenly you feel a longing to have that special shampoo that makes your hair look like that from the advert you just saw , or you realize you definitely need that new car, because the one you have now just isn't as great.
But is it really important to have these things?
You are an adult; you can make a difference between things you really need and things you want.
In the end the advert may have woken a longing in you, but you can set yourself free from it.
But can small kids make that difference aswell?
In this essay, I'm going to answer the question whether television advertising directed towards young children should be forbidden.
Well, first of all I have to state that children of the age two to five are very easy to impress and to influence.
When they see an advert they like, they feel like they really need this thing right now and probably don't understand why they can't have it.
They are too young to even understand what an advert is, so they won't understand when their parents tell them why they can't have that doll right now.
Another problem could be the money.
When children start going to school, they usually get a little amount of money every week.
So when they see something they want in an advert, they could save up and buy the item themselves.
This way they learn that money isn't something people have unconditionally.
But little kids don't get money, I'm not sure if they even understand the concept of money.
When their parents buy them what they wanted so badly from an advert, they think they can now have everything they see on television.
On the other hand ther's the fact that children see advertising everywhere.
When they walk through town, when they play games on tablets or phones,... We all know that today kids get their first phone or tablet very early, so there they are faced with a lot of advertising aswell.
Also, who says that children can get influenced by an advert that isn't directed towards them?
Because we are only talking about advertising directed toward these children, not about any advert.
Where is the difference between what a 5-year-old wants and what a 6-year-old wants?
Coming to the end of this essay, although there are valid arguments against the prohibation, I have to say that I thing television advertising toward children aged two to five should be forbidden.
I don't think it is right to influence such young people with adverts directed specifially towards them .
They will get used to these things soon enough.
The question, if television advertising is good or should be allowed for young children, is an old question.
In a lot of countries are reglements that control how much advertising is allowed and how good you have to erkennen, that this is an advertising.
But the companies have tricks how they can "confuse" children, without having problems with the law, an example ist the brandmark in the upper left corner, where in the most cases is alos the logo of the channel.
The companies do this, because when children are this young, you can manipulate and control them easy.
This is a big problem, because children cannot see the differents between an advertising and the normal program on the channel, so they want the merchandise or the products when the see something they like.
And even if they have no money, their parents have it and they will buy it if their child is crying for it.
Because of this facts, I think on channels for young children or between the series for young children, advertisings shouldn't be allowed, and i would go further: there ar series made by brands, for example in Germany the series from Leo the adventurer from the icecream brand Langnese, where children want to play with the merchandise from Leo and you can get this merchandise only with the icecream, so the parents are forced to buy the icecream.
This kind of advertising shouldn't be allowedt to.
But when you look from thee other side at this problem, the side of the companies, you can see, that their are, "forced" to do this, because a lot of money they get is from this children, and if they cannot sell anymore their products they cannot earn  anymore the money they need to make new products.
And even if this is a capitalistic way to look at this, it is bad for the children too, because they cannot play anymore with the toys they want, even if they wouldn't want them if there wouldn't be advertising.
So I think, that those advertisings shouldn't be allowed exspecialy not for young children, because they are getting manipulated extremly and when they're older, they didn't learnd how to see the differents between advertising and normal program.
Television advertising toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.
This advertising attracts the very young children to watch television, because they are interested in the channels they are showing on television.
The children spend more time in front of the tv and we don't know if it is good for the development of the child, when they start watching tv at that young age.
Another argument against television advertising directing toward young children, is that we need to know for what reason they do that.
What is it exactly, they show them on television?
When there are specific programs helping the children to develop some abilities from which they could profit later, then maybe they could be allowed.
Then they are also helpful for families and the child himself.
But what do they learn on television, they can't learn in school, or everyday life with friends, family members, teachers or srangers?
I can't imagine something, that could be shown to children aged two to five, that can really improve their development.
It is also possible, that they show the children specific programs which work like indoctrination of certain ideas, philosophies or opinions.
Children can be manipulated so easily and they are perfect victims for manipulation, because they don't realize it.
It is dangerous to show them pictures that have an influence on them.
For example, when adults wait in front of a pedestrian crossing until every car has stopped and young children see what they do, it is more likely that they copy the observed behavior of the adults, than doing exactly the opposite.
If we take this example to explain what could happen on television, it is clear that the programs will have a huge influence.
It is either good or bad, but the opportunity the tv channel producers have to influence and manipulate already the children, is scary and dangerous.
As a parent you have to be very attentive when you chose a tv program.
So, it depends on what is shown on tv toward the children.
If it is helpful for their development or their way of learning it could maybe be allowed or its using at least be discussed.
But for me the argument against it are more important.
Being manipulated is something very dangerous.
Nowadays, it`s quiet common that little children are contacted with electronical devices at an early age.
Parents give their children their smartphones, so the pupil stops crying.
At an early stage of childhood parents just give the smartphone to the child and play a little video.
Apparently, not every parent out there plays their pupil some videos on their phone.
There are also parents who are very protective and don`t want their children to be contacted with devices like smartphones or tv at and early stage.
Children are believing what the are seeing, it doesn`t matter if it`s in nature or on tv.
This advertisements on tv are giving the pupils the false impression of the world.
Futhermore, young children are influenced with advertisements on their true meaning of wrong and right.
Everybody can imagine a child which has just seen an advertisemnts for sweets, the next time the child goes shopping with his parents the pupil is bagging for those sweets it has just seen in the advertisement.
To sum up, television advertising shouldn`t be allowed for young children, because they are influenced too much by them.
As a liitle child can`t differnt good or bad, true or false, it just interprates what he sees as right and that is in advertisements not very wisely.
If advertisements would be banned for youngsters, parents wouldn`t have to handle bagging children, who are wanting to buy something just because they`ve seen it on tv.
Is it dangerous to watch television as a child?
In our civilisation, it is nothing special that young children spend their whole time on television and watch diffrent programms like rtl or Pro7.
But it was not always like that.
10 years ago a television was something special and it was used to watch specific films on it.
In the last ten years, television became much more important for us.
But is it dangerous to watch television as a child?
Of course there are many Cautions by watching television.
Especially as a child it could be dangerous to watch to much television because it could change their way of thinking.
Because a child is very easy to manipulate.
If the television is giving us informations it is important to be cautious and to ask your self if those informations are the truth.
As a child it is difficult to seperate the truth and lies.
It`s also dangerous to spent to much time by watching television because of the social life.
If you watch to much television you could forget other important things like play football or meet friends.
But on the other hand there are many advantages by watching television as a child.
You can learn a lot about different things like language which makes it easyier to start with school (it depends on what you watch on television).
It can also possible that children who watch television have it easyier to deal with the technic in our civilisation because they use it every day.
An other advantage of television advertising directed toward young children are the many different programmes which can be used by the children which can help the children to find diffrent things which are intresting for them.
As a result i can say that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because there are not so many bad aspects on it.
There are advantages and cautions but all at all it is not necessary to
Personally, I don't like the idea involving young children to our "buissness-world", a child should act like a child, he or she should be able to laugh with others or to play with toys, or even start argueing about small things with his or her fellow classmates.
A child should learn how to become someone reliable and trustworthy.
Plus advertisment was the most annoying thing on television.
Children are not watching tv for the sake of advertisment, they are watching it because they love a certain movie or they want to watch their beloved series.
On the other hand if these advertisments include informations like, when the next spongebob squarepants movie comes out it's a good opportunity for children to get hyped.
And if they are looking forward to it, they are easily to bait out.
Then it's just a matter of time, when these children want their new spongebob action-figure.
So that means: adultes, who only cares about money for them its an easy way to make money, because the parents of these children are paying for their toys.
Somehing against the idea is that it's going to take so much effort, just think about the advertisment which are perfect for children.
They don't want advertisment about trash or online banking or stuff like that.
They want something to laugh at.
And the most important questions are: Are they even able to understand that?
Does it matter to them?
Is it all about the money?
and do we really want to encourage them to sit more next to the television?
Should they not rather play outside?
I think it's improtant for Children to play outside and enjoy their childhood, because they are not always going to be children.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed

Don`t we all hate it when we`re watching our favourite programm on TV and all of a sudden the show gets interrupted by a loud noise and some strange guys talking about the newest razor as if it was something very very VERY important?
I do.
and also think we all agree that some channels have way to many of these annoying advertising breaks.
I know by now that you shouldn`t believe half of the things they tell you when they try to sell their stuff, but what about little chilren?
should they be confronted with all these scenes of children of their age playing with the newest toys?
I remember seeing those girls on TV, wanting to have as much fun as they seemed to have and then begging my parents to get me those same dolls.
At that time I didn`t think for one moment that it might be wrong to show me all those advertisments because I kind of liked seeing them (don`t ask me why but I did).
Now I think it could be kind of mean to manipulatelittle kids into thinking they need another barbie doll or the newest playmobil-set, when they probably have more than enough barbies and playmobil ships laying around in their rooms without ever being used.
I think we shouldn`t be told to buy more and more stuff from the day we`re born, I would rather see children going out and crafting their own ships and cashiers (which is what i loved to play) and using their imagination because they will never be as satisfied with a piece of wood for a computer as they are at that age.
So no, advertisement towards small children sho
In the modern age, children grow up watching TV.
It's seen as a normality that children watch TV Series from a young age.But even Channels that were made for kids, such as Disney Channel, have advertising breaks.
In these breaks, nearly all adverts are directed toward young children.
In these adverts, often young kids or mascots are playing with the newest toys while singing or dancing.
These advertisments often make kids want the toys, or worse, make them want to be like the people in the advertisment.
So should television advertising directed toward young children even be allowed?
Some people might say yes, they should be allowed.
It's the parents responsibilty to protect theire children.
If they don't wannt theire children to be victims of the modern world, it's on them to forbid theire children to watch TV.
That's something every family has to decide on it's own.
But forbidding these adverts won't be the solution.
Many children like them because of the catchy music or the fun dancing.
And they don't take any harm from it.
It's ridiculus to think that a two year old girl would compare herself to the twelve year old in the advert.
On the other hand, there are many people who would forbid such advertisments.
It's just another way to make children feel bad about themselfs.
"Why don't I have long blonde hair like this girl, mummy?"
"Why don't I have these shiny shoes?"
These are just some of the questions, parents have to deal with on a daily basis thanks to television advertisments directed to young children.
In familys who don't have the money to buy the newest toys or cloths, it's even harder.
Adverts like these make them have to explain to theire three year old, that they can't buy these things, because they haven't got the spare money.
So these children are being made aware of theire familys financial problems at a young age.
Is this what you want?
I think television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because they're unnessesary and cause more problems than you would expect.
The problem with such kind of advertising is that the children getting manuplated very early.
In this age the child just sees the advantages of the product.
The Child isn't able to realise that the advertisment just want to sell his product.
The argument of the statement is that we have to protect these children from this manipulation.
But the counter argument is that if the parents allow their children to watch TV at this age they can't complain if they getting manipulated.
Their are also diffrent advertisments for older children in the television wich could influence the young children.
My personal opinion is that it is very difficult to see the diffrence between an advertisment for older children (aged six to ten) and the younger children.
So how can you forbid this advertiment?
I think that this is not possible.
So it should be the parents who regulate the consum of TV of their own children.
I don't think that you should put your four year old child in front of a TV because the child anyway won't understand anything.
Television advertising is a subject concerning everyones everyday life.
Everyone got so used to it, that nobody really thinks anything of it.
But how does it affect young children especially when the advertisment adresses them?
It of coures can be a good thing to confront children with that subject from an early age on to teach them to have a reasonable understanding of it.
Especially as this is a subject in our everyday life and children are influenced by it.
From the advertisment makers perspective it can be a good thing to adress children when they are their target group.
It can make sense then to prromote a product in a way that it is attractive for children so in this case their target group.
Television advertising directed towards young children might also have a very negative influence on them where children of a specific looking type are chosen and younger children start compare themselves to them.
It might then be more difficult for them to accept their imperfections and impurities later on especially in puperty where boys and girls have a lot of insecruities.
Also again of a ad makers perspective it does not really make sense to make advertisments directed towards young children.
Eventhough the product might be for them they are still not their target group.
The parents are because they buy the product so the ad must be attractive to them.
All there is left to say is that advertisement towards young children has its pros and cons but I reckon that the negative ones overweigh the positive ones.
Advertisement influences children in a way parents don't really think about and which can damage them in a way that they might don't really like for example their appearance anymore later on in their life because they compare themselves to what is shown on TV.
In my opinion, childrens between the age of two and five aren't able to notice exactely what the should do with an advertising.
I guess they are just thinking how cool this object is especially when it is a toy or generally something to play with.
It could be, that they want to have that so despreatly, that they cry and shout until the parents buy it for them.
This is especially a big problem for parents which aren't abel to buy there childrens expensive toys because they aren't earn that much money.
I think that gives the parents a bad feeling, because they can't give there childrens what they want.
It also depends on what they want to present with the advertising and especially how.
When they want to present a playgun and shoot at each other then this would havean bad impact on the young viewers.
That would be a big no-go for me.
In the other hand advertising could be something useful,because parents can notice what there childrens want and what they would make happy.This helps especially for birthdaypresents or when they are upset to make them happy.
Television advertisings aren't always a bad thing as long they're not silly or bad.
But when they are they should need to put out from the TV to protect the childrens from bad thoughts.
Television advertsing directed toward young children is a very controverse topic.
In the age between two and five the children are much busier with things like learning to walk, to talk, playing etc.
In the following essay I will write about why I think that Television advertising directed toward young children is a bad idea.
First of all, why should a child in the age between two and five sit in front of the television and watch this kind of children shows?
Our grandparents didn't even know what a television is when they were 20 years old.
I mean, this kidswould also make the parents and the children lazy.
They shouldn't learn the i just to do nothing.
They should go outside with them.
The kids should see the world, breath the fresh air and not sit in front the TV on a super sunny day.The generation of today is even enough lazy, why should we teach the upcoming generation also like that.
But, the must important point is that the child wouldn't learn the essential stuff like walking or crabling.
Looking TV is like a drug.
If you starts once it's hard to stop again.
It would also be very disappointing because at this young age, the children have a very big potential to learn new things.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward two to five aged children is a extremly stupid idea.
We should look after our kids and don't let them being lazy.
The teens are even to much sitting in front of this box and looking to their series.
We should defend our youngsters of this laziness and connect them more with the nature again.
Let's go outside, playing soccer, basketball, hide and seek or other diffrent funny games but don't stay at home.
Advertising directed toward young children on TV is an undiscussed subject in the modern society of Europ.
But I think, we should look more critical at the very popular "good-night-story" for children.
Of course, there are many pros on this subject.
I am sure that most children like to watch TV.
So children have fun and have something to do.
Thats a quit qood reason for parents, because this way they have some free-time and can let the child alone.
It's also good for parents if the child has a blessure, so the child can forget his souffers in front of the TV, with Mickey Mouse for an example.
There are also cons on this topic, and these cons I don't hear them very often.
It comes from my originally suspects to all media work.
I don't believe in any news messenger or social media.
I think that most media, especially TV is an instrument of political influence.
And most influence you can take on the life of young children.
And children also lose their interests in other subjects.
They only play on sub So it's logical that I am suspicious on television advertising directed toward all the people but especially toward young children.
It's my opinion that television advertising should be forbidden
Should television advertising directed toward young children be forbidden?
This is a very difficult question regarding the fact, that a lot of parents don't want their children to be manipulated by advertisements, but most child directed programms on TV rely on income made through adverts.
So does the restriction of adverts also mean a decline in good TV programms for children?
Advertisement directed toward young children is a highly controversial thing because children can be easily manipulated so they want a certain product and try to persuade their parents into buying it.
Is it okay to use the easily influenced will of a child for such materialistic purpose?
A lot of people think not, certainly a lot of parents who fear their children could become more materialistic themselves by whatching the little films where buying a certain product seems to lead to great fun and the end of all boredom.
But, would TV programms still be able to make high quality emissions without the additional income made by product promotion?
Could they even survive?
Probably not, so they would rely on state subventions, similar to TV programms like SRF and it is very questionable if the state would be willing to pay for an additional channel.
I conclude: The path between less advertisements and high quality emissions is quite narrow and it won't be possible to forbade all advertising on childrens TV altogether.
So maybe one should try to put only unproblematic advertisements on child programms (if such a thing exists).
Advertisinng

Nowadays advertisements toward young children are very popular.
People have different opinions when it comes to watching television very often.
I personally  think that advertisements directed toward kids aren't good at all.
There are two main reasons why I am against it.
The first reason why I don't support advertising towards young children is that mostly children at a young age don't really understand the reason why there are so many adverts on television.
They don't realize that all those advertisements are made from huge companys which want to earn as much money as possible.
The products we see on television are often not very neccesary.
Companies promise that we would be happier if we had those things which they are trying to sell.
The problem with this is that young children are more naive than elder people.
They don't really understand if a product is neccesary or useful, actually they just want it becouse it looks nice or because their friends have a similar one.
The second reason why I am "contra" is that andvertisements influence the standart of the people watching them.
Through watching televison advertisements, kids get an image of perfection and they are told how life should be.
If they are influeced by a given image of perfection at such a young age, kids get very high standarts and don't know what is normal and natural.
In general I'm nor against children watching television but because of the useless content of adverts i think that it in not the best thing a child could watch.
In the following text I will write about the affect of television advertising toward young children at the ages between two and five and if adds for young children should be forbidden.
Advertices for children aren't good, because they can manipulate the children very easy.
They show exactly what every child wants to see and they also show them an irrealistic world.
The children can't understand it, that the world which they see isn't real and also that it wouldn't be that way if they get what the add want them to buy.
Many years ago for exemple there was an advertising for a toy for girls ans it was connectet with Arielle.
In the add you could see two girls who were swimming in a sea and they have seen many colourful fish.
When I was younger I thougt I would also see this fish if I would have this toy and I asked my parants to buy it, but they said no and told me that even if I would have it I wouldn't see this fish.
Then I didn't want it anymore.
But the children or their parants dont have to buy these things which are shown in the televison.
The add is just there that people know that the product is there, but it doesn't say you have to buy it.
It's your own decision.
In my opinion television advertising for young children shouldn't be allowed because I think it isn't very good for children if they always see things on television which they don't have.
They can become very sad because they think that everybody gets this thing and they are the only children who don't have it.
I also believe that it can be very stressful for parents, especially parents with not that much money, when their child always want something which it has seen on television and the parents don't want to buy or can't afford it.
Imagine your in the Bahnhofstrasse and you see a little boy who is shouting at his mother, that he wants to buy a action-figur which he saw in television-advertise.
To change this television advertising should not be allowed.
First of you have to say that it isn`t very terrible for little kids if they watch a television advertisment because they can`t do anything or perhaps they don`t understand the advertsie yet.
And it`s also the faut of the parents of the child if the child watches television at this age.
But on the other side tabletts, computers and televisions get more and more popular.
That leads to that even children at the age of 2-5 already have a smartphone or a tablett.
In other words this means everybody has electronic things so the parents can`t do anything against.
It`s also a problem that little children, if they have seen something on TV, they want it.
So they ask their parents to buy and the parents are going to get it or they start to argue with the kid.
In the end the kid has his toy or it`s crying because it didn`t get the the toy.
Both options aren`t really options because it isn`t fair to influent little kids who can`t defend their selfs against these advertises.
In conclusion I totally agree with this statement.
Television advertising is really common and most TV companies have to use it to gain the income they need to pay their ongoing costs.
In their everyday programs many TV channels, depending on their target audience, sometimes or the whole day play series and movies for children often including formats for younger children aged two to five.
Those children like television very much and they like to watch those channels but also those channels have to gain some money.
Often they solve that issue with advertising.
The problem is that advertising for children is not the same as advertising for adults.
Most Adults are mature enough to make a decision if they want to spend however much money on the product they see in advertising and they can also understand the problems they could experience after having paid too much money on a product they don't really use.
In general, children aged two to five can't even propperly understand the concept of money.
So they constantly ask their parents to buy them the new toy from television.
And because parents love their children they often end up buing something their child uses once or twice and then doesen't even care anymore about it.
Of course that is not the fault of the child but the question is if it actually is the fault of the parents who constantly buy new things for their children or if itis the fault of the TV companies who advertise to a target audience which can't make resonable descisions.
Personally I think advertising and children TV channels havenothing to do with one another and should be prohibited.
A good example would be the german "Kinderkanal" or "KIKA" which, at least when I watched it, didn't play advertising at all.
They could afford that because their income didn't actually come from advertising but from their mother company which, I think, was "ZDF".
I think that this would be the best solution for every children's TV channel because the only other ones I can think of would be to prohibit children's TV alltogether, which doesen't really solve the issue.
Like that children would probably just start to watch "normal" TV which includes the advertising but they couldn't really understand.
Should television advertising directed toward young people be prohibited?
Young childrens are watching more and more tv these days and so they also watch more and more adverts which are made for them.
But should advertising directed to young childrens be allowed or not?
Of course there are reasons why this shouldn't be allowed.
At first small childrens always want what they have seen at the tv because they think it is cool.
But for the parents this is really anoying because the childrens always want them to buy what they want and some of them just stop if they have what they want.
The problem is that some parents always buy what the childs want and so they never learn that they can't get everything they have seen at the television.
On the other side it is not just the job of the state to look for the childrens.
It is the job of the parents to look for them.
This also contains, that they have to look what their childs could see on tv and that they especially do not watch too much tv.
Because if they watch less tv they of course also see less advertising.
And there is also a really good aspect on advertsing directed to children.
They have to learn that they not just allways get everything they want.
Which is an important lesson for the whole life.
Because a child who learned (when it was small) that it could have everything it has seen at the television advertising might have some problems when it grows up and has to pay the things by itself.
They often sped too much money and so they have allready mony problems when they are young.
I think that advertising directed on young childrens shouldn't be frobidden because it is the job of the parents too look to the childrens.
So if they don't want that their childs see too much adverts they have to look that their childrens don't watch too much tv.
And if they don't see too much adverts it is also no problem for the childs.
For the companies who advertise, it is beneficial to advertise toward young children because they are more likely to believe to advertisements.
They will ask their parents if they could get what the advertisement says.
Young children are easy to manipulize with the advertisement and the companies would make a lot of money.
There are some good commericials out there.
Commericials about toys for example does not lead to bad habits or something, it just makes young children wish that toy.
Or sometimes the advertisement is also good for the children, for example when it leads them to do sports.
It could be a commercial about sport shoes and it shows how fun it is to run around outside with this shoes.
There are many good products for children out there, that are actualy good for them.
In the other hand, commercials about fast food, for example the Happy Meal from McDonalds, leads children to eat junk food, which is very bad for them.
They will think that it tastes good and they also like the toy they get with the meal and they would want to go back.
It could start to become a habit eating junk food and it is very bad for their health.
It causes diabetes, overweight and a lot more problems.
Children in the age of two to five also are to young to realize the compony manipulate them.
They do not know better yet.
When they are getting older, they will know that advertisement does not always tell the trough about their product and the will be more careful.
When they are so young, they are helpless and depend on their parents.
Sometimes the parents can not afford the childs wishes and the children will be sad when they see the happy children in the advertisement with the product they would like to have and the child can not get it.
In my opinion, television advertising should only be allowed, when it leads the children to do something good for them, like running around outside.
Fast und junk food commercials towards young children should not be allowed.
I also believe that they should set the age higher then five years old.
They shoud set it to 9 years old, because until then, they will still believe whatever the TV says.
Watching TV is something many adults, teenagers and children alike enjoy.
Who doesn´t love watching their favorite show.
Be it a morning cartoon or the news or a deep political drama.
There is something for everyone on TV.
Television means uninterrupted entertainment for old and young.
But does it?
Ads are the only thing to rip the viewer out of their emersion.
If it wasn´t for ads there would be no end to the enjoyment of Television.
Just like TV shows ads try to reach a wide range of demographics.
From ads for a new videogame for teen boys to ads for a new frier pan for mom and high tech gardening equipment for dad.
Even young children aren´t safe from the barrage of ads coming their way.
Is it appropriate to let young impressionable children be subjected to unrestricted advertizing?
Are there any repurcussions?
Many may argue, that ads will damage the childs developement because it will hinder their ability to develope critical thinking skills that are much needed in todays society.
If a child is repeatedly bombarded with ads this could have the long term effect, that the child will start believing anything anyone says.
Because the TV has told them something is true over and over again they may develope the habit of believing ads in other aspects of life such as political discours.
Secondly ads marketiing directly to young children seems to be somewhat redundant.
The idia, that kids will ask their parents to buy them something by convincing the child of the product fails to see the parents as the customer as well.
Maybe ads should market a safe and educational experience for children hence market towards parents first.
The main argument against all this is why change it?
Ads have been running on TV for decades now and nobody seems to be severly harmed or scarred for life.
If it aint broke dont fi
I think wherter television advertising directed toward young children is allowed or not doesn't matter.
Children at this age don't watch that much television, or at least they shoulden't.
Also, they may be easily influenced, but even if they do watch it, they don't have their own money yet.
Their parents are the ones to decide what they get and what not.
Of course there are parents whom will give their child everything they want, but even then it's still the desicion of an adult.
When I was a child I saw a toy in television, it was a plush dog which could walk.
Looking back it was really stupid, but for a child of course it looked like it was almost like having a real dog.
So I beged my parents to get me one, but as an adult they knew it was stupid and that I would only play with it a week at most, so they didn't get me one.
All in all this means the advertising is still directed toward adults.
It's just a diffrent kind of advertising.
It's trough their own children.
This may have an effect on how many toys, or whatever it is they sell, they sell, but it has no effect on the children.
They will forget about it soon enough.
Of course you could say, they grow up to a world where you can buy everything you want and as much as you want, but even if it weren't allowed, there is still a lot of other advertising.
If it is directed towards them or not doesn't matter here.
In my opinion they simply shoulden't watch that much television, then we wouldn't have to worry about it this much.
We live in a world where technology and commercial is totally common and normal.
I think it is really important for children to already learn as a young child how to think about television advertising.
We see and hear commercials all the time, either in radio, televison or in newspapers.
Parents should bring up their children in our world we live now and commercial is a part of it.
Children should also learn to say no to something and should learn to be critical against foreign things.
They have to learn that they can`t buy everything and that not everything that seems nice is really nice.
When the parents give them everything they want, they will really have big problems when they get older because they will never be able to afford everyting.
But when they already have to ask themselves in young age if it is really necessary to buy something, later they won`t have any problems.
I know that it isn`t healthy at all when young children watch television the whole day.
If they do other things, for example sports, they don`t even see these commercials that often.
Maybe that`s why people who often watch TV often get manipulated by advertising.
But for young children it wouldn`t even be a big problem if they don`t watch TV all day.
When the children get older the commercials try to manipulate them anyways.
So why should it be a problem to already see those commercials when they are younger?
The sooner you get accostumed to something the sonner you learn how to deal with it and that`s why I do not agree with this statement.
I think there is a lot of advertising everywhere.
The television advertising is just another kind.
It's normal for us to have it everywhere.
And with the television you have it even at home.
It can influence our decisions a lot.
Specially young children.
When they see at television the newest Barbie or a game for the computer they want to have it.
But should it really be not allowed?
In some kind it is a problem but it is also a decision of the parents.
When the children are not allowed to watch a lot of TV, I think it is not an as big problem as when they watch the whole day.
When I look at my childhood it was never a problem because we didn't have a television at home.
It was a bigger problem to go with us in a shop and we saw some chocolat which we really wanted.
So I think it's not only the TV which influence the decisions of a lot children.
It's just everywhere we go.
There are a lot things they want to have and the parents have just to say no.
Television advertising comes everytime after a television show.
So it's a kind of boring and after the fifth time they won't give as much attention as on the first time they saw it.
May be we see just a problem in it where it isn't one.
So for me it is not the problem of the television it is more how they have grown up and what they were allowed to do.
If they aren't allowed to have new things they won't make any problems.
Television advertising directed toward young children is not perfect but the advertising is just a part of watching television.
It doesn't matter if it is directed to children or to adults.
It is important what we do with this informations.
In our society advertisment is a big part of our everyday live but should it affect really young children?
This is a hard question.
In this essay I try tho find arguments for and against this statement.
One argument against televison advertisments towards young children is the fact that those children can not even buy the things that are advertised.
They can only annoy their parents to the point that the buy them a new doll or the sweets.
So the parents are the onces which actually suffer from the advertisments.
Another agument is that those children have not yet learned how to respond to advertisments in a healthy way, they don't even know that they affect them.
The children don't know that the things shown in the advertisments don't show the reality.
But there are arguments for advertisments directed towards children aswell.
One important argument is that the children have to learn a healthy way of responding to advertisments sooner or later.
Especially since nowadays they are very present in our lives.
It can be helpful for the children to get used to the advertisments by seeing them on the tv but it is very important that the parents talk about the advertisments with their children.
Another arguments is the fact that advertisment is a very important thing for our economie.
Companies couldn'tsurvive without advertising their products.
It can be seen as unfair that a company, producing furniture is allowed to do advertisments while another company is not allowed to because they produce toys.
My conclusion is that this is a very controversial question and it is hard to answer it.
My personal opinion is that it shouldn't be allowed to do television advertisments toward young children.
I think that they are not ready to proceed the thing the see and that the companies use use small children to make a great deal out of it.
Advertisement in TV, which is directed to young children is theme which is critisised by many people.In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed to show advertisement, because the children are more affected of advertisement then adults.
If adults watch advertisement, they mostly know that these companies just want to make profit and that the products shown, are mostly not as good as they were presented.
But if a child watches advertisement, it just sees how cool a toy or something else is and not the background.
Especially because the toys are shown in a toyworld and not in a realistic way.
Another point is that a child aged two to five could never afford a toy by themselve.
But why do companies then advertise things to children?
Of course, because children can more easily confince there parents to buy a toy for them, then the companies could convince the parents to buy a toy for theire children.
Children are stubborn and they know much better how to get something of theire parents.
This is the second reason why I agree with the statement above.
I think that the companies are profiting more with advertisement to children then with advertisement to adults.
And this shouldn't be allowed, because children can't think as far and this shouldn't be abused.
Summarizing I would say that advertisement, which is direted to children is kind of an unfaire way to advertise things, beause the companies are using the power of stubborness and joy of children to make profit.
Kids are no consumers...
If we watch television today, it's full with advertising for the newest volumenshampoo, the most comfortable car, the best accurancy.
Yes, advertising is every where in our time now, but in television it has the greatest influence, because you see it again and again.
Adult people can better decide between the bullshit and useful things in advertising.
But how does it look by young children?
They believe what they see.
They think, that they all need to have from the advertising.
Imagine an advertising for the new Barbiecastle.
The little girl watch it and thinks "wooow", I need this.
She wants that her parents buy it for her,  the parents say now and she gets very angry and sad.
But I have to say, there are other parents, who want a happy child  and so they buy it.
The problem is now, that the child think it gets everything.
It shouldn't be like that.
In childhood, the human brain learns very fast.
Kids explore the world they live in.
But if we imagine that a lot of these young children spend their time with watching advertising, learning the advertisnig spells by hearth and thinking always to it.
Its shocking.
Kids should go out and play with other children.
These are reasons why I'm really against directed television advertising for young children.
Advertisings have become a big part of todays television programms.
There are different advertisings and many of them are directed toward children.
Now the question came up if television advertisings that are directed toward children should not be allowed.
On the one hand the advertisings are really manipulative.
They are made in a way that they reach the childrens attetion and that is what they want.
As son as a child has seen it, it wants to have it and in many cases the parents buy it for them.
So the important thing about it is that they already start with the maipulation at young age in order to have them as clients when they are bigger.
Furthermore children dont know anything about economy and so they can not know if it is something good or not, they just see something and then they want it.
That is the reason why it makes no sense to advertise for such young people because the parents of them are responsible for them.
On the other hand we also should have a look at the people that are advertising for their products.
They just make their job and they want to make as much money as possible like everyone else does.
If they do good work they have more clients and earn more money so from their point of view they are successful and they see no point in not allowing advertising that are directed to young children.Additionally we also have to mention that children at this age should not watch that much television.
so they would not even have the opportunity to be confronted to that advertisings.
It is the parents duty to control whaht their children watch and how long.
So it is in their hand if their child gets to see those advertisments or not.
On balance I think that this is a topic that should be discussed  more beacuse nowadays we are living in a world full of advertisings and manipulation.
From my point of view advertisings that are directed to children should be allowed .
The main reason why I am cleary against not allowing it is that it is in every parents hand to decide wether they want to let advertising convince their children or not and if they are not intelligent enough it is their own fault and not the mistake of the one that is advertising.
Well this is a very important question.
My opininion is that it depends what the content of the advertising is.
Toy advertising is very harmless and somehow they have to sell there toys.
It is normal that a kid should have toys, but we have to watch out wich toys.
Ipads or Iphones aren`t toys.
When you give a kid an electronic device he or she can`t handle it.
So you should watch out witch toys you should buy.
But things like food or drinks can the kid let think that he can gain superpower as a example.
So they spred lies in the advertisements and so the kids want to buy this things but they dont gain any superpowers they just become fat.
But for me the main problems are the parents.
If parents control their kids than the problem is solved.
A lot of parents just want have some quiet freetime and for that the kids must be quieted.
And so the parents give their kids some money and the kid heads directly to the grocery store and buys some unhealthy stuff like chocolate.
I should now this, I did stuff stuff like this.
But my parens didn`t gave me money.
So I stoled it and this was one of the causes that I became fat.
But the bad parents combined with the advertisement are dangerous for the healthy environement of our future.
Espessially in the United States is it a problem.
A big percentage of the american people are fat and this is mainly the fault of the food advirtisement.
But today there are luckily some limits and we can say that the world made some progress.
When you watch commercial of the 90`s than you can see that the sugar cornflakes are on the same level as fruits.
The people thought that evryithing was healthy wath the television said.
But today it istn`t anymore so extreme.
Should advertisements targeted at young children be allowed on TV?
It is certainly true that young children are very easily influenced by advertissements.
That could very well be a evolutionary thing, because children are genetically programmed to learn by watching their parents.
A child also can't really know that what they see in an advertisments is not what it is in reality.
But children are influenced by other factores too, for example the packaging of the product, or what their friends and "the cool kids" have.
So if you tend to forbid tv advertissements, you would have to do something about the other factors too, and that is simply impossible.
During childhood it is very important to have "cool things", for example toys, to be socially accepted.
If the parents of a child deny him toys, it might not be accepted in a group anymore, and the other kids don't want to play with him/her anymore.
It can even go as far as bullying.
But would it help to forbid tv advertissements?
Personally, I don't think so.
Even tho advertissements can have a big influence on young children, there isn't really a problem with them.
The problem lies more in the social behaviour of kids.
The worst thing that can happen if a child sees an adertissement about a toy is that it will annoy its parents to get said toy, because it obviously can't buy the toy itself.
If they say no, it will just be sad for a moment and then see another toy that it likes.
In the end it is more a question of parents being annoyed about their children begging them for toys all the time, not about any dangers that the child might face.
The conclousion is that it isn't a problem of the advertissements, but of the parents letting their kid watch tv all day because they don't know what to do with them.
For many parents it is hard to refuse to buy toys and other things for their young children if they continuosly ask for it.
Companies are aware of tthis fact and therefore use advertising that is directed toward young children, hoping they will "force" their parents to buy the advertised subject by asking for it over and over again until the parents finally give in since they can't stand seeing their beloved child being unhappy.
To prevent this from happening, the idea of prohibiting television advertising that is directed toward young children.
This seems to make sense since that kind of advertising basically exploits the parent's love for their children.
Exploiting love for commercial sucess is clearly moraly wrong.
Also, young children have not yet developed any critical thinking and don't realize they are being manipulated.
On the other hand you could say that it is the parent's decision to buy the advertised subject or not.
If they don't want to buy their children everything they see in television advetising, the parents will just have to say no to their children.
They have to keep that position no matter how much the child begs for it.
In other words, they have to teach their children that they can't have whatever they want whenever they want it.
That's something they must learn anyway.
Once they learn that, television advertising will directed toward young children will no longer work and therefore not be a problem either.
Besides for that young children shouldn't spend their time in front of a television anyway.
They should go outsied, play and get to experience the world.
In the end I don't think television advertising directed toward young children should be prohibited.
It might not be easy for parents to say "no" to their children but they'll have to anyway so why not start with television advertising that is directed toward their young children?
In the today's world it is a normal thing that a young child, in the age of two to five, is watching TV with the permission of the parents.
They also have to watch some advertisement during the breaks of the cartoon.
There are some television adversitising directed towards young children.
Some little children are playing with the new toy dog that can talk and act like a real dog.
Or the girls are laughing and giggeling with the brandnew barbie.
But does the television advertising affect the children?
And now the question is: Should the television advertising directed towards young children be allowed?
The advantages of showing the television advertising to young children is that they will see how many different toys are there with them they can play.
Not only smartphones or tablets.
When the young humans like them then they will buy some new toys.
So they probably will spend more time playing toys than watching TV.
This would be good for the fantasy insteed of staring at the electronic thing.
On the other hand there are some disadvantages.
Firstly the advertisement influents the opinion of the children.
They will annoy their parents to buy the toys and the parents don't have another choice and will buy them.
There aren't only good toys that the children can use.
In the advertisement they also can show some violence or sexual scenes.
And that's not the right thing for the young children who are in the stage in which they find everything curious.
The parents trust the channel that the children are watching at, but when would show to the little kids some brainwashing advertisements the parents won't be glad about it.
To sum up there are some advantages and disadvantages of showing the television advertising directed toward kids.
In my opinion I think it's not a great idea to influent the mind of the children.
They should decide by themself.
In my point of view the director shouldn't produce television advertising for young children.
Nowadays television advertisements increase rapidly.
Many channels often make advert breaks after a short time of a movie or a show.
Channels for children mainly advert toys or some free time activities like adventure parks.
But does it make sense to show children in this young age these advertisements?
Children are very easy influenced by TV-spots.
MAinly children between two and five years old.
When they see a cool new toy, they want it immediately and ask their parents to buy it.
Sometimes this desire gets so strong that the parents are forced to get it.
This ads don't just influence the wishes of the children, but also the decisions of the parents what they're buying on a psychological basis.
The kids are affected in a very early time by advertising-strategies.
They grow up with pictures of a perfect world and stereotypical things.
Those adverts can support stereotypes of gender roles, for instance there are girls showed with pink dresses and dulls in their hands having fun.
On the other hand: would those toys be bought if there weren't any TV-spots?
Television advertisement is a good platform for companies to show off their new products.
In my view television advertising shouldn't be forbidden for children in this age.
It's a thing of the parents if they allow their children to watch TV or some channels which show many ads.
To start with an agreeing statement you can say that television advertising should not be allowed because it will maybe affect the young children in ways you do not want the child to be affected.
A point which disagrees with this statement is that the parents should look after their kids and therefore they have to decide if they are allowed to watch it, so therefore it should be allowed to advertise towards young children.
A supporting fact, is that advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because kids can not think clearly and due to that it should be clear that this is not appropriate.
To react to the statement before you can say that advertising should be allowed if it does not make any harm to the young children.
A last point to support this statement is that advertising toward young children is unnecessary because they will not buy something but the parents will, so they have to advertise directed toward parents.
My opinion about this is following, I do not like advertisments at all.
So I can easily say it should not be allowed, also due to the facts which supports the statement.
Television advertising firected toward young children

Do you remember when you was a little child and you where outside and you played with your friends?
And now the kids have their I-Pads, their I-Phone and mybe thier own Televiosion.
But is that good for the kids ?
Would it be better to let them outside or let them playing with barbies and legos?
When kids in young age go outside into the woods or somewhere where it has not a good floor, it trains the musculature of the leg and the balance of thechild.
So they learn something for the rest of their life.
Maybe they want to climb a mountain if there where older, and whit their balance they trained, when they where young their are better then the others who sat before the television, when their where young.
The little kids have to do their adventures, and when they went outide and play in the woods maye they find their adventure.But if they only sit inside and do not really something they never see " the world ".
An other point is: If the young kids go outside and play with other kids they leran how to speak with other kids.
So they learn socoaligy.
That is something you need the whole life.
For exempel in your job, if you have a problem you can tell your chef other someone else maybe your friends.
The " to go to bed time " is not the favorite time of the children.
Because the want be like their old brother, he does not go to sleep now.
But mum does not give the kids more time.
Maybe the kid where outside and it is now really tired, but it can be that the kid watched the whole evening television and now it has a lot of energy.
The mum will need much of time till the kid goes to bed.
In television is a documentair story about horses and the child loves horses, so why don not let him watch, maybe they will learn something.
Finally I think the kids should go outside and play with other kids.
So they can built balance and socility.But maybe it rains and good film is in thetelevision.
Maybethey can learn something for the rest of their live.
Thekids should go outside but theyshould also have time to chill.
Nowadays the question, if television advertising which are directed toward young children should be allowed, is well discussed in public.
But where are the advantages and the disadvantages?
On the one hand it would be a success for toy shops, because children would see their toy of their dreams and aske their parents to buy it for them.
Secondly if a couple have thei first child and don't know what they have to posses, this advertisement could be helpful for them to make their child growing up well.
It also would be able to find something new to try for example light balls for falling asleep instead of a night lamp.
On the other hand this influence of advertising would bring up new mobbing victims, because you would be an outsider if you wouldn't posses this stuff that the others do.
Additionally stores which haven't the money for such big advertisement have to be closed, because people would stop buying things thei didn't have seen before.
Furthermore other Television series or programms would earn less money because there would be a longer section of advertisement.
In my opinion it should be prohibited, so I agree, because children should't be influenced by things from televisionno they should be able to make their own descisions, free willed.
I think young boys and gils shouldn't watch Television, in their yung years they have to enjoy the environment and playgrounds and go out with kindergarden friends or spend time with their family.
Advertisements are meant to sell something by presenting the product to viewers.
Making purchases are only accessable to people (mostly adults) capable of making transactions.
Children of the age of five aren't able to fulfill a purchase and don't understand concepts of money and the market.
So it is very useless to direct advertisments to children that age, because they can't understand.
But most advertisements are trying to convince childern that age, because they don't understand and take advantage of their lack of knowledge.
The people who make advertisements know that children watch TV and when they happen to watch an advertisement the childern go to their parents, becuase they know their parents have the power to buy things.
It's a stategy that avoids directing advertisements to adults, because adults ignore them, and taking advantage of their children to convince their parents of purchasing.
It isn't right to use childern as their "marketing machine", because they're incapable of knowing the purpose behind TV ads.
But it's a better way to sell the product, because parents won't ignore their childrens needs and buy thigs for them.
This stategy isn't unfair at all, because the child watches TV and it's the responsibility of the parents to let children watch.
Parents who really don't want them to watch ads, shouldn't let their children watch TV or at least the ads.
I agree with this statement.
I think it's just lazy and unfair to think that children can do all the work for the salesmen.
In my opinion it's useless for children to watch advertisements without understanding and the advertising producers should do it fair and challenge themselves to make a good ad for adults.
The televison is only one of many different medias we can use use today.
There are a couple of differernt channels wich have different topics.
There are some channels, wich are more informativ like News-Channels or channels wich send documantarys, but there are also some channels wich less informativ topics.
But the thing wich connects the most of alle the different channels is, that most of them send advertising.
Espaecially on the channels wich send cartoons or other topics wich are interesting for children, there is advertising sent wich is also interesting for childrens.
That's reality because children are easier to catch for sweets, toys and things like that.
The reason for it is that children can't control their wants as good as adults and so they're good targets for the industry wich will sell their products.
If you hear that the first time, it sounds a little weird in your ears, but befor you get angry on the people, wich had the idea to do that, you should think over some aspects wich show you the good side about advertising to children.
The frist aspect wich speaks real for advertising toward children is, that if children are catched from the advertisings on the television, the chance raises that the product gets buyed.
And that is a really good thing because you help the people working in all the toy and sweet-stores, wich really need the money for their own children.
The second reason why advertising toward children should be allowed is, that more purchases are very good for the capitalizm and we all know that this is very good for our circumstantials and so we all should support the advertising.
To coclude we just can say that advertising toward ch8
Television advertisisng are always worth a discussion.
Much more if it's about young children.
But in my opinion parents should decide wether they like to try out the advertising product.be a

Firstly,what is the perfect age to start to advertise and moreover which is the perfect age to start watching television.We all should be able to take resnsibility toward ourkids and it's enviroment.Moreand more trynot to face responsibility the htey get.
Furthermore does it not matter or would change aaything because however they would decide,there're always other dangers or possibilities of still seeing advertisment towards young preople.
Genually it's worth a shot because if  you others into it, which could have a bad influence on the kids you don't have ad's for little kidsj

On the other hand could it be a good idea, just to prevent their young eyes won't be manipulated.
In the end our world is gettinh worse and worse everyday we live by.
The biggest income of televison companies comes thrue advertising.
In these days the advertising is immense.
There are no borders from baby food to expensive sport cars you find everything.
But shouldn't it have some limits?
Especially young kids often are influenced by the advertisemts.
In the following essay I'll analyse this question and tell you my opinion.
It's obvious that these kinds of advertising in televison often puts a lot on the parents because kids want things when they see it and often they're impatient.
Let me ilustrate this with an example.
A young guy, he is 5 years old, sees a toy truckin televison.
The guy really likes it and want it immeadittly because he is impatient.
Because of this the child asks his parents if they can buy it for him and if they don't do that he'll rest asking.
So this shows that these advertisements can pressure the parents.
They can be a pain in the neck.
On the other side we have to understand that the goverment should't make even more laws and limit our liberate system.
In Switzerand there is a free economical system which shouldn't be interrupted rhrue laws, which aren't really essential.
Furthermore I'd like to present one last point.
There are advertisements which can disturb young child and aren't good for their mental development and health.
They sometimes shock them.
I come to the conclussion that the advertisement in televison directed to young children should'nt be limitated because we live in a free land and every company should have there right to advertise their products and it shouldn't matter if it's directed towards younger childrens or seniors.
A child aged two to five usually watches a spesific type of television prgramm or maybe only carefully by the parents selected series.
There are also special shows only for children.
In my opinion, on these shows and programms, there shouldn't be any advertisement regarding things to buy, even if they are meant for children, like for exemple a new barbie doll or the new iron man suit for haloween!
This supports already young aged children to "wanting to habe" everything, especially the things they see in this "cool" television.
I think a child should learn as soon as possible, that one can not have everything and like this should apreciate the things one already has even more.
What doesn't lead to anything like this is for exemple an "advertisement" for new series or films that would be shown later on ect.
So I think these are perfectly fine for the breakes between two films.
In the end I think the biggest part of responsability rests whith the parents: they have to be aware, what exactly their child is watching and if it's really okay for their age, the advertisements included.
Even though the producers have to "match" their advertisement according to the ages meant for the series.
For example it wouldn't make sense to show toothpaste advertisement on "KIKA" (a programm for children).
So I would say, showing real advertisement to children is not very helpfull and could lead to them wanting to buy everything, therefor it should not, or only rarely been allowed.
But when and what the children are watchins is still the job of the parents.

A lot of people are against television advertising directed toward young children.
But why are they against it?
Which effect has television advertising on young children?
Is it absolutely negatif or positive?
Or maybe it's something in between?
Today we gonna have a look on the arguments of both sides.
Of course is advertising directed toward young children a great chance for the economy to grow.
Companies which are using this type of advertising know, how good it works to influence the young children.
First of all you need to convince the young children and afterwards every child will do everything to convince their parents to buy it for them.
The own children are often way better in influencing the parents to get what they want, than any advertising could ever try.
You can see, for the companies this concept has a huge positive effect.
And so the argument is, that this concept is good for the economy and if it isn't allowed to use this type of advertising, it will have a bad affect for everyone.
But there are also people who think that television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.
They say that the advertising teach their children that they can't be satisfied with what they have.
In general advertising try to convince people that they need more than they have.
Young children are so easy to influence and they can't decide if they really need this or not.
In my opinion it's true that advertising will teach them that they can't be satisfied with what they have.
And I that is the reason why it shouldn't be allowed.
In the past years, Tv advertising has become more and more specific.
The companies gained a feeling of how to get us to by and use their products.
And most of the times, the statemetns in the commercials aren't completely true.
The companies are moving a little bit sneaky, because sometimes they write critical informations extremly tiny at the bottom of the screen and it's easy to get fooled.
So should there be a policy that blocks them form directing der advertisement toward young children ?
Children at the age of five arn't able to buy things without the promission of their parents, so if they get affected by a advetisement, their parents are the ones that decide what happens.
So it doesn't matter if there are ads of kids.
On the other hand.
A lot of children learn to "control" there parents.
So if they don't get a toy they, start to get angry or cry.
Now it is up to the parent, if they either by the toy or solve the problem in an other way.
All companies now that children are out of money, so they are sure that the kids convince their parents to buy stuff.
An there is a developement happening.
Many children don't use their imagination that often.
Thy only use toys premade for them.
I used to make my own toys with my brothers and sisters.
If you take a second look you notice, that companies are crual and want children to manipulate their parents.
And in a way they start to make the children depend on them.
Because when the kids are growns ups, they learned to always buy new stuff and they will maybe keep that behaviour for a long period of time.
In my opinion, it's a good idea to make a policy against ads for kids.
I think that companies will only loose a small amount of costumers, because the adults buy all the products and not the children.
But that policy isn't that important, because it's the parents job to look after their kids.
Today, the most of the families in Switzerland have an television at home and there are many children which like very much to watch TV.
But like I think, that everyone of us knows, is there in every programm a lot of advertising between.
So it's important, that we think about, if this is good for little children or, if it's bad for joung children and sholdn't be allowed.
Actually, there are many sorts of advertising, which are about things, like errotic stuff or pages for meeting someone in the internet, which children should learn from their parents or someone else, but shurely not from the television.
Things like this, they can also mot understand in a age under six years.
On the other hand,there is many funny advertising, which children like to watch.
And the children are our next generation and so the next consuments.
Also, are there a lot of errotiacal scenes or scenes of violence in the normal programm, like films or series.
So shouldn't we rather think about young children should watch TV generall?
In think that the parents of young children should think about which programmes and how longand often in a week they want their children to watch tV.
Because there are a lot of programms, which are extra made for little children, and in these series there isn't advertising witch for example errotic stuff in it.
But in my opinion children under six years don't have to watch TV, theyshould rather play with their parents or with other kids outdoors.
The discussion about advertising directed toward young children is very difficult.
The following essay will show and collect some controverse points and will try to figure out which one is better.
First of all it's important to save young children from bad influences like violent videogames or stuff like this.
Advertising for young children counts to those bad influences.
In the end those advertisings and TV-spots manipulate young children, they aren't ready to decide what's bad and what's okay.
The second reason why those TV-advertisings shouldn't be allowed anymore is that children should'nt watch that much TV they should play outside and search friend and television shouldn't destroy this possibility by using advertising towards children.
There are also arguments against this statement.
First there is the point that parents should also learn to save their children and they have to learn how they should teach the children how they have to behave, and what is good and what is not.
Advertising in the TV is perfect for that.
It's an easy way to learn separating beween good and bad.
Furthermore children can't understand much of those TV-spots so they would'nt have any grave psycholocical problems.
It is much worse for the children if they get saved from everything, then the won't learn the important things and it is ways easier to learn stuff at the age of two or five.
After this arguments I think it's clear that it would be wrong if we forbid advertising in TV.
I saw that children could learn very much with those TV-spots in an very easy and risk-free way.
They can learn to seperate good stuff from bad stuff.
It is clear that the parents should show the a good balance between TV an real live, so those advertisings wouldn't be harmful if the parents hold this balance and allow the children to learn but show them the right way.
My parents had not allowed me to look any televion advertisings when I was a child.
But not every parents have the same oppinion in the questen if they should allowed there children television advertising.
The questen is now if television advertising direct toward young children should be allowed.
If these advertisings are not allowed parents not think that it is good for children and they mayby not allowed there children to look any advertisings.
But some parent don't want to do something with their children and so they let look them television advertisings for children.
If it has nothing for children they let them maybe look some thing for older children or adults and that would be worse.
In my oppinion children should not look any televion but I also think that making a low against it is the wrong way.
I think parents should be careful what they allowed to their children and what not but parents must have the chois in these questions.
Today everyone is online.
Ofcoarse young children too.
Certainly the will also be exposed to the television and their advertising.
But is this healthy or not?
Would the be strongly biased?
Young children learn everything very fast, especially children aged two to five tend to learn fast from their surroundings, primarily their parents.
But TV and media are more and more taking place as a learning and free time platform.
Due to this exposure, they will see more advertising, and also be influenced by that.
But is that really a bad thing?
Well ofcoarse on the one han they will be biased, might want to by a new cereal, a new toy or try the new videogame.
So for sure there is an influence, but parents must teach their young offspring how to deal with it.
Since the real "grown-up" world, is stuffed more with advertising in everyday life then coke is with sugar.
So it should be viewed as part of growing up and learing to live in the overpolluted world.
And anyhow, if one was to eliminate advertising on TV, one would have to eliminate poster-advertising too, because parents can stop their children from watching TV, but can children be stopped from going outside?
Most certainly not!
Now the question is with very young children, but if they are so young, can they really understand what is happening when they are being manipulated by advertisment?
If not, then parents can fully control how much their chldren see it, if the can, they are old enough to learn how to deal with it.
So should there be a ban?
No!
Growing up, means learing to deal with the (free) world, and advertisment is part of the world.
(Which in the west is liberal, hence free for the TV to do what it wants)
In this statement I am going to discuss about the Television advertising directed toward young children.
Nowaday We humans can't imagine our society without any electronic devices.
Computer, iPhones and of course television became a very central subject in our world.
It is not easy to decide wether this huge technological succes is good or bad for this world.
The majority of western worldpopulation owns elevision, iPhones Computers and a lot of other electronic devices.
Let's focus on the Televison.
On the one hand a Television can be a practical device.
Watching television you have the possibility to  be always informed about the accurate happenings and events around the world.
Secondly having a television at your home can be very entertaining.
The TV programm has a lot to offer.
For example Series and Movies in all genres and sometimes also in diffrent languages.
On the other hand being a owner of a television has also its bad sides.
Firstly watching television often robbs your time away.
If you have to get some really important things done like homework or studies, you waste your time with watching TV instead of focusing on the essential things in life.
This is also the case with a lot of other things as relationships or creating your own lifestyle.
Not only does Television waste television your vulnerable time, it also has the ability to brainwash humans mind.
Especially for the younger generation.
When children in young age watch for example all this advertements, they grow up wanting them.
So they are being practicly thaugt to live in a capitalistic world which has the consequnce that their values will be about buying things and getting more and more things.
So eventhough television may have a few positve sides, I think that it is time wasting and leads to brain wash.
Advertising is everywhere.
Even we don't want to admid it, but everyone is malipulated by it.
We rather buy something, we already heared of, than something, that is completly new.
While adults still know, that it's not believable, what's shown in the advertisments, children aged two to five for example, can't make a difference between a friend, who likes his new teddybear, or a money orientated comertial.
Shouldn't we protect children that young from those manipulative television advertising?
The ads aren't only watched by the children.
A parent who is in search of a new birthday gift for the child, is surley thankful, if there is something seen in television, the child may like.
Or the child even sees the product it likes in the television, and asks for it.
That happens in magazenes too, we can't illegalize to get the product for children not to be brought to the people by advertisment.
Children might even get less funstuff, if the parents don't know what to buy for them.
Can children really make a difference, between something they will have fun with and something the will throw in the thrash after two days?
I don't think so.
Even if the parents still are the ones who buy, they often can't resist in the hope of making their child happy.
If it wants something, it gets it.
That isn't nessesarely bad.
Even if the children won't have a lot of fun with it, it is still good for the economy to sell something.
When a child sees a little modelcar in the television, thinks it is just as awesome as showen in the advertisment, gets it after asking and asking from it's parent, but in the end it's actually not half as good as beleaved, is that really good?
Wouldn't that make a child very sad?
That is a experience that the children may should have in early age.
The experience, that nothing is as good, as showen in the ads.
Later they will be bomed with advertisment anyway.
Better learning early.
If they can't learn, that whats good in the ads isn't always good in real-life by themselfes, there are still the parents, who should show their child what is good for it, and what not.
There is no good reason to not allow television advertising directed toward young children.
It is something we have to learn to be with.
In this essay I will be talking about the statement that children under five years old shouldn't be allowed to be targeted in TV ads.
The big companies make way to much money selling all there toys and garbage to little children.
Especially in places like the US and other first world countries it is a big driving force of the economy.
These companies rely on rich famalies with extremely bratty children to make money.
By targeting these children in terrebly obnoxious commercials they're securing their customers.
Because parents of bratty little children have no choice but to buy whatever toy or product their child just saw on TV or their in for a huge brain exploding tantrum.
The toy branch has become a large player in the economy in recent years.
The CEO's and chairmen of these big companies may be selfish and stingy, who take way to much profit money for themselves but nevertheless they create new jobs with the expansion of their buisinesses.
On the other side to the economical questions to this statement are the moral questions.
Is it ok to brainwash the joungest part of the population of a whole society with annoying TV ads?
Of course if one sais it like that the answer is no.
Who thinks it's ok to brainwash their child....
But these commercials can limit a kids perspective on things.
With these ads a little kid is bound to grow up in a very capitalistic surrounding without any other point of view.
That being said it isn't moraly justified to manipulate little children in such a way that may verywell have a big influence on their later life
In young age people are more likely to believe what is told.
So companies can take this advantage to make young children buy their product.
Should then advertisment to young children be forbitten?
The idea of the statement is that, young children should not be influenced by television advertsiment, so they can build their own opinion on certain thoughts.
But how should this law work?
Television companies do not know how old the consumer is who is watching the advertisment at the moment.
And what if the parents of the young child are whatching the marketing trick too?
To fullfill this law is impossible because there are to many greyzones.
In my opinion this statement has some good affects as like, the manipulation via television advertisment of young children would not take place.
But children are manipulated by their parents anyway.
Furthermore could the parents just control this by not letting the children watch television, which is in my opinion thebest way to solve this because children with age from two to five should not be watching television.
Conclusing, I do not agree with this statement because it provocates more problems than solutions.
The mentoinned problem is fullyin the hands of the parents because a two year old is not able to say wether he wants to see this advertisment or not.
It is believed by some people that television advertising directed toward young children aged under five should not be allowed.
Since there is the possibility of manipulation of young children, parents fear the risk of letting their children watch television.
A young child watching television will probably not be able to understand anything it is watching.
Since it is only two and not over five, it is very hard for a child to get what is happening.
It also does not understand if a clip it sees on television is an ad or just a movie.
So since it is not able to understand what is really going on on television, why would there be a law to prohibit television advertising toward young children aged from two to five?
Even tough it is already able to talk and most of the time understands what you are telling them, there comes the risk of manipulation.
A child aged from two to five is way too young to be confronted with such a topic.
Like I already said, it is too young to understand that it is manipulated, but since it understands what you are talking about in a conversation, it is able to make a connection in their head and realise that it likes what it sees.
So with an easy ad, a child can be manipulated into the consuming world very fast, which is way too early.
What children watch on television could also be read in a book by their parents.
So why even show them television in such a young age?
It could be possible that their brains could not evaluate as good as a child, who grew up without a television, did.
Because by watching television they do not learn the ability of thinking by themselves but let others think for them.
Children should be able to play outside and really enjoy their childhood without being confronted with any other problems such as manipulations and stuff like this.
I believe that children from aged two to five should not be confronted with television advertising, because they do not learn the ability of thinkinng by themselves or are manipulated way too early.
Televison advertising is definitely one of the most frequent forms of advertising because it reaches us in an easy way.
It catches even more the attention from children than from adults, as adults are already informed about the function of advertisement in general and have therefore a more critical view on it.
Children though might take it more seriously and get easily manipulated by it, mostly if it is a product made for children.
As a result, they ask their parents to buy them products which have been in the advertisement.
This of course is a problem for the parents, as advertisements may hang all over the place, not only are they found in television.
On one hand, from an objective point of view we could say that aready watching to much television does harm to our children.
Advertisment is not only the bad component of it.
But still it makes already young consumers out of our children.
Instead of doing more intellectual activities, they are manipulated and influenced negatively not only from advertisements but also from televison in general.
On the other hand, what can we do about it?
If parents dont allow their child to watch television, but the others do, then it may be excluded from the group, because the other children talkt about it and may get the newest products.
So this can not be the solution.
In conclusion I would suggest that there is actually no way out of our consumer orientated world.
We can not even protect our children, because nowadays, every child has an electronical device or is confronted with it at a very young age.
In computer games there are advertisements too.
And of course, going to cinema is a cool thing also for children.
There, logically, we can not avoid a confrontation with advertisement.
Televison advertising:

While watching televison you will always see advertisments for games made for children or advertisments for teddybears.
But do we even need this kind of advertising?
Mostly we wont't need them because theyare directed towards young children and they should not yet be allowed to watch television.
But why do they still show those advertisments on television when there are so many adults sitting in front ot the televison?
Maybe they want to attract the parents to buy the things the want to sell or they hope that there are children watching television and they want the things they see because the adverts are made especially for them.
I think it is a bad idea to show these adverts on television because children at that age should be doing better things instead of watching television.
And if they are watching television, there are special channels for children where they can show films and series for children but not adverts.
Children should be raised to know how to spend money properly and not just buying everything they see and want, but this is the point where the adverts create problems.
The children are watching the adverts and want it, most of the parents will buy them the things they have seen on television, because they don't want to make their children sad.
On the other hand it isn't to bad to show the adverts on the channels for kids, because it is the easiest way to show them.
Most of them can't read, so they just make funny and cute videos to attract children.
In our world it might be one of the last chances to sell things that aren't connected with mobiles or computers.
Children stay more and more in front of screensand don't play with real toys and figures any more and the the mobiles are much easier handle for parents because they only have to buy one and than they can download everythingthey want and at the end it will be much cheaper for them.
Because of the mobile games the toy producers had to find a way to sell more.
In fact, I think it would be better to show them other things insted of adverts because like that they don't make them want something and maybe they can safe more money for the parents.
But in the more and more digital world i won't get easier to avoid adverts madefor children because it they stop them on television, they will just show them on the Internet or as hidden adverts in games created for children.
Imagine you are with your child in a shopping mall and suddendly it starts to run at a window, points at the electric dog.
"Please dad, I saw this on television, I need that now they said!"
First you are strict and ignore the shoutings of your four year old son, but after some minutes your heart gets soft and you buy the dog for 99 dollars while you are secretly killing the advertisiser at the TV in your mind.
It's a fact that all television programs need to advertises something to get some money.
But do they really have to influence our youngest members of the society?
These kids, discovering the television, are so young and so innocent that they belive most of the things an older person says, how should they know that this isn't the truth what the person in the TV tells them.
The only way the learn what they should belive and what is total bullshit is, that the parents tell them.
But today, in a modern family, there isn't always someone around the child, because both parents are working.
So its totaly impossible to get full control of what your kids watching at the telvision, which is not only bad, but to protect our children the directed advertising toward young children should not be allowd.
In the end the parents are reponsible for their children so they have to get controll about what their kids watch on the television and waht they are buying them.
But as said before total controll ist not allways possible which is good.
Only than the kids can grow up to independendt citizens of our land.
And in addition how can resit when such a lovley young child looks up at you and ask if you could buy a thing for them.
We do not want them to become influenced personnes and teach them from the begining of their live that everything in the television is the trut, that is what politicians try to make them belive early enough.
Regarding these reasons I would say that we should help the parants ouf our new young and independent citiziens and make the television save for children and the parants wallet again.
So television advertising directet toward young children should not be allowed.
I think it's a very interesting question, because it isn't often discussed by politicians and the media, so you can't just copy opinions and answers from other people.
So when I read the question, I was quite surprised that I never thought about it yet.
And my first thought was: "well advertising direct towards young children is quite absurd".
But than there came more and more different arguments about this topic and I'm still quite ensure what to think about it.
So I try to start with the opinions against direct television advertising towards young children.
You could argue that it's really bad to use young children only to make profit and it shouldn't affect these childrens in every form.
So if the advertisment is a bad influence for the kids it should be forbidden.
But in which cases it's bad and which it's not?
I think it's extremly hard to answer this question.
You'll never find an answer which is 100% correct.
You could also say against this phenomen that you shouldn't make direct advertising to groups who can't afford this products by themselves.
So you shouldn't put the parents under pressure to buy something, only because you manipulated their kids.
On the other side I think all parents who let their kids watching TV know about the "risks" and should always controll what their kids are watching.
So they are always able to stop them watching these advertisments.
And you can also say, that we life in a capitalistic society.
If they watch a special TV show they know that this show has to earn money.
And advertisments means a lot money for these companies.
So these companies have to show direct advertisments to their main consumers.
In the end I think it's a difficult question and I am still not sure what to think about it.
I believe that the advertisments for small children are necessary because it's the main source of money.
But I think also that there have to buy very strict laws which say how far these advertisments are allowed to go.
It shouldn't be allowed to make advertisments for guns or things like that.
We live in a world where moderne media, such as television, is normal for us.
We are possessed by moderne media, it has become a habbit for us to check our facebookconto, new pictures on instragram or the stories of our firends on snapchat.
And this new habbit is converting to younger generations every day.
When I was a kid, the smartphone wasn't invented, novadays a kid, age eight to ten, is allmost dying for likes on social media.
But now back to the subject.
Are televisionadds good for children, age two to five?
Should it be allowed?
Little kids aren't that fast in understanding things or getting them correctly.
They have to learn new oppinions everyday.Televisionadds meant for them could influence special points of view and control them like scientology.
In addition to that, it controls what they think, therefore their point of view.
The point of view controlls their habbits and their habbits their character.
At last their character defines their destiny.
Therefore television adds could define who they are becoming instead of what they should buy.
In addition to that TVs use special light waves to function differently of those from the sun.
The sun send all light colours and creates natural lights, TVs instead create unnatural lights, which could hurt the eyes of the viewers.
This could lead to diseases such as blindness or allergys.
To complete my point of view: I would rather send my child to play outside instead of watching TV.
Children in this age often go to bed early, if there watching TV a big part of their day has faded away.
I want my children to experience nature, to find new laws, like gravity when a stone or a ball falls down, and most important I want my child to play outside and have friends.
Therefore I think that televisionadds meant for kids, aged two to five, shouldn't be allowed.
Almost every Family has a TV at home.
And most of the people like to watch TV after their long day.
When children get home from school or kindergraten is it really a good idea to let them watch Spongebob?
Watching TV is not always something bad or stupid, you can also watch smart TV Shows where you can learn something and these Shows are made for children too.
As i said can children also learn from watching TV and then it should be allowed so kids can learn quick, beacause I think that children learn quicker when it makes fun and every child likes watching TV.
For example Dora the TV Show so many children have watched this or are watching this and that's a show where they can really learn something.
If you watch Dora in german you may learn english what is great.
You may also learn something about animals and stuff that happens in this world.
But should the children really see this in a screen or in reallife?
There are also not that smart TV Shows for children that are just for amusement for example Spongebob.
I have watched Sppngebob but when I think back now I think it is a bad show for children because you learn nothing but useless things and children may come bad ideas by watching this kind of shows.
And young people should also get out of the house and play on the playground instead of watching Spongebob cooking Burgers.
This is where these kids get to know the real, important things and where they are in contact with other children what is also very important in that age.
Watching television in the age of two to five should not be forbidden but the parents should look that the kids won't watch too much or silly things.
It won't be bad for children to watch half an hour or something around that.
Advertisement targeting childres has been a controvercial method to boost profits and is now widely discussed in many communities since a nordic state banned them inorder to keep the children out of the market as customers.
In this following text I am going to give arguments for and against this statement inorder to aquire a better level of understanding of this problem.
In the end I will state my own opinion on this topic.
First, children are the the targetgroup of whole industries.
Especially the toy industry, but also the industry for electronic devices or sportsarticels relies heavilly on their underaged customers.
If advertising directed towars children was not possible anymore, those industries would have very big profit cuts eventually resulting in many peolple who have to leave their job.
Therefore the children are a too heavilly relied on targetgroup to just give them up.
But children are not able yet to determine wheather they really need something or they just want it.
Also the question arises, if the advertised toy or device is good for their developement.
Better commercial does not automatically mean better toy.
Since the advertisingindustry uses cheap psychological tricks in their commercials inorder to get the children to wanting their products, not the children but the parents should be targeted in the commercials.
It is also their money plus their decition how to raise their children

On the other hand, children cannot be protected from the influence of commercials.
If they never hade to resist the urge to buy something, only because they had seen it on television, they are not going to be able to hold themselves back, when they are old enough to buy their own products.
This will for sure lead into a higher rate of juvenile consumer debt.
But finally, not the children but their parents walk into a store, take an article and lay the money on the table.
The child is just a manipulated family member that pushes his parents to buy stuff it most probably does not need at all.
To get there the advertisers want the children to produce tentions between the children and their parents by desperately asking for some article they don't need.
In the end many parents give in just to have a good time with a not whining child.
But what the parents olny recognise too late ist that by a behaviour like this the kid will only get spoiled.
In the end I don't think that it is a good way to protect the children by shielding them entirely from everything.
But it is also important not to expose them to a "full load" from zero to onehundred.
I think it is good to control the dvertisementindustry and to give them some restrictions.
This would not lead into a "toycrisis" but still keep the children guarded from annoying their parents over actually unimportant "issues".
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed
In our time televisions, mobile phones, computers and all the other electronic things are a very important thing in our life.
Already for young children.
We even can't image a life without all these medias.That is one point, that we really depend form this things.
But the other point is that they influence us in a way that we even don't know.
Mostly everywhere we are confrontated whith advertisings.
So should televison advertising especially directed toward young children not be allowed?
Television advertising for adult and also teenagers is already not a good thing, because much of them believe that, what they say.
But for young children it's much more bad than for us.
For example there is 5 years old boy who saw in the televison that he should defenetly buy the new chocolate because it will give him more force in his life.
So imagine the young boy will run to his mother and ask her to buy him this chocolate.
He cries and says that he absolutly needs that chocolate to have more force.
The young boy isn't old enough to know that this can not be real.
On the other side it is in the hands of the parents.
They should decide what is good for their own children and what not.
So if they think that the young boy for example isn't old enough to "not influence himself" they shou

So in my opinion televison advertising for yound children should not be allowed because they are still too young to beurteilen what is true and waht not.
Now a days you find television advertaising everywere.
It is imposible to watch TV with out any advertising, especially on TV programs for children.
so there is the question,if television advertising directed toward young childern should not be allowed.
First I like to mention a positive argument, why it should be allowed.
Advertsing can help children to create new ideas, then a child likes to crate new stuff.
For example the can see a new cowboy costume in the TV.
So trougth this advertising`s manitulative way, they like to play cowboy outside as well.
in this way it is not a bad thing.
Normally then they do not have a costume at home, so they trying to create it on their own and will use their imagination.
An negative argument is, that all advertising is way to manipulative, as I mentiond before.
Children are easily influenzable.
The marketing calcultes it really well.
If they can not convinz the parents they try it by the children.
So the children can later convinz the parents for them.
An other bad thing is that the children get really early involved in the economie.
The economie lives from buyng and using and this is not a good way children should be pushed in.
so for me it is clear that televison advertising should not be allowed, because of its manupulativity and the bad education.
Young people (aged two to five) are easily influenced by everything.
For example it's impossible to go shopping with a young child without having an argument with them about wether they can have this teddybear or not.
At the checkout there is always some candy on the eyesight of the children so they complain about having it.
The shops make a lot of money with it because you would rather buy the candy for your child than hearing them cry about it the hole day.
If children see advertisment on the television it is the same problem.
Children see something and they wand it and won't stop crying until they get it.
The shops make it very clever.
They place the advertisment at the right time and place so most of the people who see it, buy it.
On the other side it's useless to cancel advertising on thelevision because advertisment isn't only on thelevision, you are always confronted with it.
If you cancel television advertisment you should also cancel all advertisments for children because only then the chilrdren live a advertisment free childhood.
But obviously thats impossible.
I mean how should we only save children from advertisment on television if the parents should still see it.
You can't.
If children aren't alowed to do something htey'll do it anyways.
I don't think you should stop children from seeing advertisment.
We should learn them how to deal with them and that they aren't allowed to have everything what they see in them.
Should television advertising be allowed toward young children if you consider that they are not able to handle them yet?
There is a lot of evidence which speaks against it because children of that age don`t really have the judemental possibilities as a grown up does.
Imagine your kid sitting in front of your television, watching cartoons and there is a commercial break, which shows the newest toys, including this great little stuffed puppy, which can move and talk.
Probably most children run up to their parents begging them to buy this new toy.
Of course most parents don`t like to see teir kids disappointed and also don`t like the situation of a crying child begging for a toy, which is totally unnecessary.
Another point is that it`s just not fair to produce television advertising for children because they are so easy to convince.
They are not able to decide whether this is a trashy toy or not.
As long as the commercial looks good and there is a nice music playing in the backround or even if it is just some television show related toy they want to have it.
So it is not right if big companies try to use children to sell their toys.
These companies make some of these kids unhappy and make them feel frustrated when they see this great toy commercial but they can`t get it.
Also television advertising is something that kids can`t learn anything from by watching it and is pretty useless.
Over all I think it`s not correct to use yound children`s naivity for your business strategies and too sell a lot of toys.
Parents should not need to handle their begging kids and there are still going to be enough sold toys because these children see them at other kids houses and on the playground where they get their wishes and tell their parents.
Advertising is a very controversial topic.
Alot of people want to ban advertisements, while other rely on them.
In this essay, the question about banning television ads directed toward young children will be responded.
Television adverts are all known to us.
While watching a movie on TV, advert breaks are always present and take up a lot of time.
This has led to falling viewing numbers and popular streaming services like Netflix or Amazon Prime.
While most adults are more or less immune to ads, many children react to them.
We all have seen this amazing toy on TV and wanted to have it.
But most of the time, our parents did not agree with this purchase, so we were not happy about that.
So the question about banning adverts directed to young children comes up.
First of all you would think that such a ban would have no negative points.
Children would get less influence from ads, because in such ages kids are very ease to influence.
Alot of toy companies use this "feature" and direct very aggressive advertising strategies.
During christmas time, many kid channels are full of ads about this new toy and that new game.
The same thing is featured in many following ads so kids get the desire of having it and putting in on their Santa wishlist.
A ban would fix this and let kids decide more on their own about their christmas presents.
The wallets of not so rich parents would be stressed less, because often these adverted toys have higher price tags than comparable products.
And it would be less effective to get political agendas into the brains of the kids, like it had been made with superheroes like Superman and Captain America during the Second World War.
But how could you enforce such an advertisement ban about a specific age group?
How can you decide wich advert is directed toward four year olds and wich to six ones?
Toys have often no real age limits.
So while specific adverts get banned, toy companies would host ads wich do not cover these age groups.
But these kids would react to these ads and the problem of the whole advertisement would not be solved.
Another problem is a financal topic.
These ads bring in a lot of money to toy companies.
Because of the raise of electronical devices, they already have sinking sellling numbers.
If ads take away another source of money, little, not so well known companies, could be in serious danger of having to cease business.
These would lead to rising unemployment numbers.
In the end, banning these ads would be good.
Children would have less influence from big coperations and could deciede more freely wich toy lands under the christmas tree.
But sadly, such an ban would be almost non enforceable.
Kids do not only react to age specific ads, but on these of other age categories too.
A ban would influence the financial security of companies negativley because adverts bring in a lot of money.
In the end,  a ban would almost bring nothing and is most likley to land on a Buzzfeed List of some non effective laws.
Growing up in a privileged first world country, I got used to watching televesion every week.
I always looked forward to the moment, where my mother would announce, that we would watch a movie tonight.
But the only bad thing i remember were the advertisement breaks.
Even if they sometimes showed me the possibility of what I could wish for christmas or my birthday, I just wanted to watch the movie.
So why exactly do enterprises want to make advertisements directed toward young children?
Should they even be banned?
The one word that comes to my mind when I hear advertisement is "profit".
It is a way to sell products to people, but in a very manipulative way.
They use psychological tricks to get more buyers.
For example the perfume advertising.
Have you ever seen on television a Dior perfume accompanied by an average looking woman?
Did that woman ever look unspecial or natural?
No, clearly they want you to connect their product with beautiful and attractive things, so maybe next time you'll stand near the perfume section in a store, you will subconsciously feel comforted by the mere sight of the flacon.
You got brainwashed.
Imagine that situation whith a child, only aged two to five and still having a young brain.
Those advertisements would have a much bigger influence on it, than they have on us adults.
They still don't realize what the difference about realoty and imagination is.
They even can't see the difference between an other person and himself.
They're still growing and evolving.
If they already get influenced in this negative form, they won't know in the futuere what's right and wrong.
On the other side are advertisemt a way to learn about the world and the things, that exist on it.
Useful could be this knowledge, as children who watched them, will be more experienced when it comes to learning vocabulary.
Every advertisement can show a picture of a product, and a person who says something to it.
An easy and playful way to learn.
I personally thing, that advertisement should be banned, as the risk of influencing children the bad way is too big.
I feel uncomfortable when I imagine how many children want to buy things, just because they saw an advertisement of it on the television.
So yes, stop the brainwashing on children!
Ban advertisemennts
Many young children watch TV or use mobile phones but when we are at this stage of life we should be playing outside with other kids or spending time with the family.
I understand that it may really be a problem that most parents have to work and they don`t always have time for their kids but it is the wrong way to just put them in front of the TV or give them a mobile phone to play.
When children watch TV too often they don`t have the chance to socialize with other kids in their age which may cause problems later when they are at school.
But the advertisements in TV which are for kids and starred by kids don`t consider that problem and they are especially produced that children watch them.
That is not particularly good for the child who is watching them and on the other hand not better for the kid that is part of the advertisement because both of them can`t be outside playing with friends and making their good or also bad experiences.
They are way too early in the life of an adult who always need to work and type on their technical devices and are stressed when they can`t, like a kind of an addiction.
It`s not only the social factor but also the health which suffers from this TV or mobile phone addiction and kids shouldn`t be part of it at all.
So I really support the statement that Televsion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Despite the fact that television advertising directed toward young children can cause real damages and can create bad characters, there are also advantages which can lead young children to learn new things ore even let them calm down in a different way than just looking out the window.
Looking into a computer or television screen all day long can cause real damages on your eyes which can be irritating and annoying.
It would be very irresponsible to let young children watch tv all the time.
It can damage their eyes and could lead them to wearing glasses in their future.
Adding to the damage on the children's eyes, watching tv all day long can damage their brains as well.
They can create very strong character unable to work in groups or even comunicate correctly in their future.
These children are used to watch tv on their own which did not learn them to socialise with other people in their age.
On the other hand there are some great advantages of telvision advertising directed to children.
There are a lot of interesting channels, which can learn children about the nature or other important subjects.
They can learn new languages or know more about geography and our earth.
Telvision advertising can also calm you down.
Watching relaxing things just as for example documentaries can calm you down and relax your mind.
In my pont of vew, telvision advertising directed to young children should be allowed, as long as it is combined whith other important things just as playing around, doing silly things and also communicating with other people.
It should be a healthy mix of everything.
the Television is now an object in our every day buissiness which will be more and more importent.It is very simple used and shows you interesting perspectives from unknown experiences.it also can show you things in complet different way as it in  real exists.
Advertising is one of the simplest possibilities to take the visitor in this in televion showed beautiful and simple life if you follow the facts which were told.
I think for a young children it's very difficult to filter out waht is real and what is fiction.
It's an age where you live in a imaginationed world which can be forced by the televiosion.
this will be dangerous and children will lose their thoughts in imaginaition.
The advertising otherweise brings a big stress for people.
The thought or the willing you always have to buy something.
The point is television uses advertising to bring success to a idee.
which is mostly very lovely, coulourfull and kind made.
it's an unecessary way to show unknown things
Opinion directed essay- Advertising and young children

Advertising is a very big and important theme of today's society.
Every brand or new thing tries to sell and promote their products through ads like television or internet.
There are a lot of advertising that are in television for adults but influence a lot young children.
Games or cereals with particular designs like Disney figures are sometimes made for young children.
As an example the cereals, maybe you wouldn't think that it is an ad for children but they will recognise their favourite figure and tell their parents they should buy this cereals.
Or maybe they will see it in the television and afterwards in the supermarket and beg their parents that they buy it.
It is probably not really fair because they are just children and they don't think about money or the actual product but just connect their favourite things with the design of the packaging.
But are this ads really directed towards young children?
The most ads in television like supermarket or thing to wear a made for adults.
So the brand wants that the people buy this things.
This are things that are especially made for adults, like a car it's not for children but has another destination of buyers.
So let's say that on television a brand is promoting a pram.
Pram are made for children, but are the children deciding which one they want to buy?
Or special milk to grow well or something to eat that helps the children growing better, this are ads that are directed toward children because they are made for children but who decises which one they will buy?
I don't think that the children will tell their parents at the supermarket which one they want unless they tried some or the packaging looks like something that children like.
There are some advertisings that are made for children and can influence them but where is the point on prohibiting this one on television?
Maybe before some ads are not allowed on tv, people should just watch how much time their children spend on watching tv and what they are watching.
There are not only on television but also outside a lot of ads, which can influence children and their behaviour.
In my opinion the problem is not with the ads in tv because they are more directed towards the buyers and not towards little girls and boys.
In my opinion it should be allowed.
Because it isn't a big thing and if the partens of the children allow them to watch television, they'll know that it will also have advertisement.
And also an advertisment won't do anything to a child.
If the parents think it would do something to a child or has some bad influences, they don't need to allow them to watch television.
Advertisement sometimes also can help to learn something new.
Watching television isn't a bad thing at all.
Children have bigger possibilities to experience many new things and they may learn from it.
Some people may think that television advertisement is something  bad.
The children want to buy this and that.
And maybe the children will get addicted to the things which are shown in the television.
They may want to buy more and more and won't accept if the parents won't buy them the things shown in the advertisements.
And because children aren't that smart yet, the people who make the advertisements can trick them and just make the children more stupid than they already are.
In the whole I think it should still be allowed.
But I can understand if some parents are afraid that television advertisement make the children even more stupid and that they won't learn anything from it.
But it isn't dangerous or anything like that.
It's just unneccessary.
No one needs it.
The parents should decide if their children should be allowed watching this but no one else.
I agree with this statement.
Products are shown and it's told how great they are, but negative parts of the product are not mentioned.
Of course they have to do that so that people buy the product.
But in a way that is also a form of manipulation.
For example: You see on the table of McDonalds how great the burgers look, but if you buy one you get a crumply bread thing that doesn't even get close to the one you saw on the picture.
The manipulating part is making you think that you get something better than the actual product.
But since everyone knows it it shoulnd't be a big problem, right?
But now these manipulating pictures come in form of a short video advertisement between two cartoons your five year old child is watching on TV.
And it's about a stuffed animal.
Your child absolutely wants to have it, not knowing how to critically watching the video because of it's age.
Children get manipulated like that all over the world, they want the new Kellogs they saw on TV or the new Star Wars Lego set and and and...
They don't know that it breaks easily or that it has a way too high price for its' value or that it actually tastes like soap, they just see how great it is.
And you as a parent get the disaster if saying no and have to explain to your child why, but it still believes more into something it sees on a screen than in the words of its' own parent.
The bad part that's left out in the advertisment is the one a parent gets to feel while trying to calm its' child, even though every parent is just telling the truth and the trying to make a five years old understand how the world really is.
So companies actually make similar things like some states do with their people, like dictators do with the population of states.
And this can't lead to a good thing, could it?
There is a lot of television advertising.
Every twenty minutes there is a advertising break for about 10 minutes.
These breaks contain a lot of advertisement and some of them are directed towards kids.
Now there are people who want to ban television advertising directed towards children.
Children are unfluenceable.
Very easily.
If they see something that seems cool or looks pretty they want it.
You just have to make a advertisement about a toy, mske it look ultra cool and kids think you can't ive without it anymore.
On the other hand, children have no money.
At least usually.
The parents are the ones who need to pay the stuff for their kids and parents are rhe ones deciding which toy they will buy their kids and which one not.
Advertisement directed toward children is something not very nice where you can make easy money but in the end it is the responsibility of the parents.
Advertising for children only
The question if TV advertising directed toward young children should be allowed is very intresting, there are many arguments which show that it would be a crime to allow it, but on the other hand there are at least equally many points which tell us, that is is not that much of a big deal.
I personally have never seen, or at least never noticed adverts, which in my opinion would have adressed only young children aged two to five.
This surely doesn`t mean that there is no, but maybe there are no so many in my region which makes the controvers question less important.
Of course I could`ve easily miss it because I`m much older then five, but from what I see on the streets every day, the adverts are more likely to be adressed to a much larger group of people, for example women or older people, not people from 65 to 70.
On the other hand, if advertising as described in the task is currently present in the world, it would mean that almost all children from two to five see or hear it, and because of that, they could easily manipulate the parents in their choices.
But with that in mind, the question rises, what is so catastrofic about children who manipulate the parents.
Because also the parents see and hear adverts and are equally.
or even more affected by them, as the parents really buy things and can decide how to spend their money while children simply can`t.
Anyway the children can be affected by advertising which could change their personality as they grow up.
Children are more easy to manipulate and are much more easy to convince, which at the same time makes them an ideal group to direct advertising to, but also acts as an external factor on their growth and can manipulate the not completely formed brain.
I think that adverts made for children aren`t a big problem, but there have to be people who are disturbed by them anyway.
And although I think that there is no big difference for the companies wo advertise between adressing a child or their parent, the children could get affected more.
In my opinion children should first grow up, at least to the age of 10, and then start to make decisions and not already be manipulated by advertising from the past years.
That`s why I would vote for a prohibition of advertising for children only, but I don`t see it as somthing very bad.
Like always there are two possibilities to answer this question, but neither of the two answers is completely correct or wrong.
It is a matter of opinion wether youare for or against advertising towards young childre.
In my eyes however advertising towards young children should be allowed.
I can not think of many reasonable reasons lead to the answer that these adverts should not be allowed.
I do not see this adverts as a bad influence on children, neither do I think that these adverts harm anyone.
My main argument for that is that these adverts do not contain products that are dangerous for children, all they do is make children want their product which should not be a problem as long as the adverts are not for cigarettes or alcohol.
Children wanting a special toy they have seen on television is not bad for them, it might inspire them for a new wish for their birthday or as a christms gift.
Some people may think different and are concerned for parents which have another opinion of these adverts, but then I think it is in their duty to make sure that the kids do not get to see these adverts.
This would lead to children not sitting in front of the television which is better for them anyways.
So as a conclusion I woud say that it is impossible to answer this question with yes or no.
There are good arguments speaking for both sides that can not be completely right or wrong.
In my eyes the arguments that speak against these adverts are not strong enough to beat the ons on the opposite side
Should childrens advertismenets be allowed?
Nowadays after every show or almost every fifteen minutes there is an advertising break on television.
Most advertisments are directed towards adults or adolescents, however should there be advertisements for young children?
If there is a commercial on the tv about the latest Princess Doll out on the market and your young daughter sees it, she is most likely to want this doll afterwards.
However as a parent, we cannot buy our children everything they desire, so we have to say no.
The usual then starts: They start to scream and cry, saying they want the doll.
If there would be no advertisments directed towards young children, some of these breakouts could be avoided.
On the other hand, young children might not even notice the commercial.
They look at it but just admire it and wait for their movie, tv show etc.
to continue.
Most sellers have the right to advertise their products on television, then why shouldn't these sellers be allowed not to?
They should be allowed to advertise any product, regardless who is watching.
I think that if an advertisement is going to influence a child it does not depend if it is maid for younger or older audience, it is still going to affect them.
So in my opinion there is not going to be a big difference in cancelling the advertisements.
Televison advertising influences people who watch televison much.
And as we all know kids are even easier to influence because they are young, naiv and can not decide if the commercial they watch is true or not.
So out of the perspective of an advertisier televison advertising directed towards young children is very effective, because they can sell more and earn more money.
But does not the moral suffer?
Maybe the kids watch a commercial while a film break about an ice cream.
They want that ice crem but do not know that it might look different because of photoshop.
They tell theire partens to buy it and maybe they even do it because they want theire kids to be happy.
Then the children are depressed because the ice cream looks different and maybe does not taste as good as advertised.
Or even worse: they watch a commercial like "how to get thiner - just drink these smoothies twice a day", so they learn that they should be thin and drink these drinks.
That could have a serious future effect, maybe when they are in theire teens.
They think they should lose weight and remember the many commercial they have seen in the age of a toddler.
In my opinion televison advertising directed toward young cildren should not be allowed because kids are too young to get influences that much in a bad way.
But I thinke parents have to educate theire children too.
They can tell them that commercials are often lies and that they have to keep attention if they want to buy something.
I agree with the fact that the children should not be influenced at such a young age by television advertising, because the advertising could have a bad influence and it could be a promise of something the children could never get to.
Firstly I think that from television advertising only the people behind the advertising profits and almost never the people who watch the advertisement.
I also ask myself what these advertising should be about for children at the age of two years.
They wouldn't even understand any adverstisement.
I found that they are way too young at the age of two to really understand what an advertisement is about or they would get it the wrong way.
For the people who make those advertisements it is for sure a good invention, because children are very quickly excited about things.
So when they see a new thing made for them on television most of them would get their parents to buy it.
On the other hand I think it is best when young children just watch some series or movies made for children.
Because with advertising for instance for a new toy, the child wants all this stuff and has high hopes.
But in realitiy a majority of them wouldn't get it.
In addition to that, the advertising could also be used for bad.
With that I mean that there may be a new product, but it is for example not good for the environment or the child's health.
Television advertising directed toward young children is a very controverse toppic.
There are many pros and cons.
On of the pros that can be mentioned is, that the kids can see what kind of toys there are but they are too young to go and get it so it's not like they go to the store and waste their parents' money on something unneccessairy.
This shows that there is no actual damage caused by advertising directed toward young children.
A con is that they might see something on TV, that they really like, but their parents can't afford it.
If they go to kindergarden or daycare and see an other kid having this exact toy they might get jealous.
On the other hand this can also be seen as a pro because it teaches children that they don't always get what they want, which also makes it more special when the finally get a toy.
It also encourages them to maybe ask a friend, who has a toy they like, if they could play together, which can help to improve children's social skills.
The negative aspect to this is that childeren with rich parents, or spoiled children in general, might have it easier to become popular because they have all the "cool stuff" the other kids want.
But again, this is only directed to children from the age two to five and kids that young don't have an exacty defined social order like older people do.
The most important positive aspect for me though is definitely, that if a kid sees an advertisement on TV that leads them to do something else but just sitting around watching television all day, it definitly influences the kid positively.
All in all I can say that I don't think TV advertising directed toward young childeren is not needed to be forbidden.
It is the parents' decision if they want their kids to watch TV and see those advertisements or not.
Even though I can't see a real advantage it also doesn't cause any damage.
In today's world, the different types of media are well discussed and almost everywhere we look we see advertisements wanting us to spend money on something.
Also a critical point is the right way to educate your children.
So what if those two things came together?
Do commercials have a negative on young children?
Advertisements are a way of fooling people, but what consequences does this have on our kids?
To start off, the fact that is has become normal and acceptable for children aged between two and five to sit in front of a television regularly is pretty much the cause of this questions.
Because of the new technologies and differents ways to take care of our kids, letting them watch something on TV is a difficult offer to refuse.
Moreover the advertising showing up in the middle of a smurfs episode could give them some ideas to put on their wish lists for their next birthday.
However, advertisements have been proven to have a big influence on the viewers psychologie, and it should be put in question whether it is good for these young kids to confront such conflicts at such a young age.
Kids at such age do not really have an independet character yet, making them vulnerable to such adverts.
Some critics even say that the five minutes of commercials are a way of exploiding the children's minds by taking control.
Another point that speaks against advertisements at such a young age is the future image of their lifes.
Most kids that see those many teddy bears, board games, princess dresses and hot wheel cars being offered on the screen see it as a necessity to get them.
This leads to an ungrateful and spoiled boy telling his mom to buy him the newest batman costume just because, or, even worse, it can make them feel disappointed if the toy they received in the mail is not exactly what it looked like on TV.
Getting to a conclusion, I believe that it would be smart to ban the television advertising for these ages, as they trick you into seeing a fake reality.
Kids should not have to be treated like clients in a material world, as they can't even buy the products themselves.
I agree with the fact that this kind of marketing should not be allowed.
The television is nowadays a comman way to show advertisement.
You can project short clips oder just an advertising sentence or picture.
This way it is a very simple one for producers to spread their brand new products.
But there are many other options so as the newspaper, the radio or the cinema.
Television advertising reaches out for everybody who is sitting in front of the television.
Also the kids at a younger age.
This is what I talk about in this essay.
In my opinion it is an easy and uncomplicated way to advertise things that have just been launched.
It attracts people during their freetime so they enjoy watching it.
Some advertising clips are very colourfull and accompanied by beautiful soundtracks or music.
Therefore it is quite interesting and exciting watching this advertisement especially for toddlers oder babies.
They don`t really understand what the television is saying or what the message could be.
But they like seeing this spectacular play of colours and music.
So they stick to the display and enjoy seeing it.
This is the funfact about it, they are happy.
They see things they would like to play with and go to their parents to ask if they could get it.
So they can communicate their  needs.
They start learing how to express their needs at a young age.
This is good for their future.
But there are some disadvantages too.
Sitting in front of the television is not really healthy for young kids.
They stick to the display instead of playing with toys or outside.
In addition to that they get influenced by the advertisements.
The kids know every new toy so it gets difficult for the parents to show their kid something that it doesn`t know yet.
They will claim about not having the newest toys of the advertisement.
Further, a two-year-old gets to know all these products olthought it`s not even necessary at this age.
They do not just see the advertisements of toys but also stuff that aren`t made for eyes at this age.
It`s a bad influence that has consequences for the behaviour of the kid.
In conclusion I say that it shouldn`t be strictly forbitten for young children, so I do not totally agree.
But I think it is the parents duty to look after their toddlers so they do not always (24/7) watch the television advertising.

Nowadays many kids watch TV for example before going to sleep or when parents want them to be quiet.
With television advertisement economic manipulation starts in a very early age.
This is affecting children and with them their parents.
One can argue that this is just how our society is treated and lets itself treat,so why should this be prevented for kids?
One main reason against television advertising directed towards young children is that they are affected way more emotionally and cannot think of anything else than this one need raised by an advertisement.
This hinders them from playing peacefully and learning important skills.
An argument against any prohibition of television advertisement is that parents can decide from what age on their kids are allowed to watch TV.
If they don't want their child to be influenced by television advertisement they can let them listen to CDs or read stories to them instead of placing them in front of the TV.
Further it is impossible to prevent children from advertising influence as this is everywhere: on the streets, on posters, in supermarkets, toy stores and so on.
Everyone of us has come across the situation in the supermarket where little children cry for drink or cereals which include a toy or is packed targeting kids.
The parent cannot continue shopping conveniently before promising to buy this certain product the child desires.
In my opinion television advertising should not be forbidden because i don't think it would change anything, neither for kids nor for their parents as .
Television advertising directed toward young children is very difficult because the kids do not watch many channels either than a long period of time.
All that makes it not easy to direct only children.
But when children watch some advertises for example of a play they want to have it and that is very difficult for parents because they do not want to buy new things for their children all the time.
That is why I agree with the satement.
An other reason is that the children see every day a new advertise and they want all these plays.
After it is very difficult for parents to say no because the others of the class get this new play.
When the parents have more than one child it costs a lot of money and they have too much plays at home.
Also when the parents are not as rich it is too expensive for them to buy every week a new play.
Additionally, the children have to learn to be contnet with the plays they have.
Already, they do not understand that their parents work for buying the plays and that the plays cost money.
But when they are adults they have to earn their own money before buying something new.
That is why I think that it is important to understand that already as a child that you have to earn money and and that plays or stuff like that are expenisve.
At least in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children from two up to five years should not be allowed.
It is less stressful for the parents who have not to spent a lot of money and also for the children who do not want to have the newest plays all the time when the advertises are not allowed.
In our every day lives, we are confronted with advertisements probably more than we are aware of.
Unconsciously we lean towards brands we have somewhere seen in an ad appearing, when we have to take a decision.
But what we do always have, is the decision to buy whatever we want.
The ads only try to influence our will in some way, no matter if its a child, teenager or adult.
Some parents think their child can be protected from the big, dangerous world until they one day turn into adults and can make their own senseful decisions.
This protection may be possible for a little while, until it reaches the point, where the child eventually will want to step out out this protected world out of pure curiosity.
The parents no longer have the control to decide what the cild will see and not see.
The ads we have around us, will maybe influence us somehow but we still have to learn how to control our minds on our own.
And even if we do not learn this from an early age, life will not necessarily become easier.
A child who really wants something, will not want it more just because they liked the ad so much.
Somehow it does sound unfair to do ads for an age group, who is not even able to earn their own money.
To make them convince someone else, in this case the parents, to buy things for them because they sound so exciting.Children are very vulnerable and may even think their life is not complete without this one thing which leads to them being upset at their parents.
Doesnt sound pleasent for anyone except for the shop, who maybe benefits from it later.
Shortly summarized, we arent able to protect children from the society and its norms even though it would be an ideal thing to do.
It is the attitude of the child that has to be worked on, not the restriction of advertisements.
Keeping them away from the world, will not make it easier for them in the long run.
These days these is a lot of televison advertisements.
Some of them interesting, some funny, some just straight out lame and some of those advertisements are directed towards young children.
Should these advertisements be allowed?
Many young kids mights find that advertising is boring and they dont really pay attention.
But then when thy see toy advertisements or something similar in that way they completely fall in love with this toy or whatsoever and they want to have it so bad.
Witch results in them asking their parents for the toy and if the parents tell them no, many kids snap and make the lives of their parents a living hell by criing or screaming around and constantly asking them again and again.
No loving parent wants to see their child sad, or they just can't stand the screaming anymore so they end up buying this toy from the advertisements.
And this results in children getting spoiled and a spoiled child can be a bit of a problem.
This is why many parents don't allow their younger kids to watch television at all because of these advertisements.
Buts this might not be a problem at all when parents are strict and are consequent in their decisions.
If these parents can stnd tough and don't budge under the weight of their childrens constant pleases they should not be worried about such advertisements because if your child know it cannot get what it wants through screaming and crying it will stop on its self and give up.
All you need as a parent is a bit of a cold heart and some discipline.
They need to learn to say no to their sweet little children.
I think that television advertisements directed towards young children should not be banned because it's not the advrtising that is doing anything wrong, it's the parents.
And parents saying that such advertisements are bad and should be banned are those kind of people who don't have a lot of control over their children.
So I think that banning TV commercials for young children won't solve anything.
First of all it is a common topic that the TV shows much advertising and that they all have consequences on our lives.
An example is: A little child sits in front of the television and is watching his favorite TV-show.
After half an hour, the first advertising shows up.
Most of the children think, as soon as they like what they see, they have to have this product.
So they run to their parents and show them this thing that they "really need".
Parents can react differently to this situation.
They can say to their child, when they clean their room or when they get good grades, they will get that toy.
This way those television advertising has a positive aspect.
So the child has a goal that it wants to reach everytime he looks at this toy in the TV again.
Secondly it is good for those who sell these products.
Because such young people don't really think about what they really need, they only look at this product and when it has many colours around it and when they see that others have fun with it, they want it too.
And the parents can't always say no to such a cute little child that askes with big, cute eyes if they could buy this toy for him or her.
But on the other side the televison advertising towards young children make the parents buy more and more just to make their children happy.
Especially in the young age the children don't think about what they really need or what they could really have for a long time.
So they just see the product that is shown in the TV and already want it.
And it is clear that those who invented those kind of advertising use this kind of people to sell more products.
Secondly, the more the little toddlers want, the more they think about what they don't have instead of what they have.
This could cause that less children in this young age are satisfied with their childhood.
And we all know that this is the age where you just don't think about problems or got negative thoughts.
So this should not be changed by this television advertising.
To sum up i think it's important that the television advertising should not be made for such young people and more for those who already can see the difference about needing and wanting.
And I think it is better to look at those things they already have instead of wanting more and more.
So this is, in my opinion, the key to a wonderful childhood without any television advertising that only uses these young audiences.
Television advertising is a well known possibility to make great business by introducing products or showing a typical point of view that the company stands for.
I mean who hasn't watched a advertisement and was inspired to buy the product afterwards?
We see often large companies like Niike, Coca Cola or Nestle  advertising in television for a new product because they can afford the costs because television advertising is a very expensive thing.
In my opinion the advertisment has in general not a big impact on me.
Some of them are done very well that I even like to watch them but others are just complete bullshit.
I think the young years of life specificaly the years in between 2-5 are very important.
I think in general that the they shouldn't sit in front of the television.
Advertisement is not usefull for a young child.
The child can't do alot with it.
Maybe it can ask some random things like " What is that daddy?"
but thats not even that interesting for a child.
In his young years a child likes to move and to play with certain stuff.
In these first years it learns to balance to walk to jump and to think in a way to create relations between objects or things he knows and I think advertisment has nothing to do with all of that.
I can imagine that advertisment could confuse a child because its very random sometimes.
I wouldnt prohibit it but it is not necessary.
The question that televsion advertising should not be allowed for children at age from two to five years shows up many pros and contras.
In the one hand, TV advertising may confuse children.
For example, when they are watching their favourite programme and suddenly it disappears, children may be sad or confused.
Another reason is that almost every child is very unpatient especially when they are bored.
So they always need to be entertained and should never be interrupted.
In the other hand, being honest, children at this young age do not really notice when an advertising appears.
They probably think that it is part of their TV programme.
Furtermore, advertising is not here just to annoy us.
People make much money out of it.
Children especially at this age should take breaks and should not rest for hours in front of a television.
They should move their body enough and play outside instead of just be lazy at home.
And this is exactly the reason why advertising is important.
For example, a child needs to pee but his programme is much funnier and more interesting than the toilet.
A child will never come to the idea that it should stand up and do whatever it needs to to.
So a TV advertising is just like a reminder for the important things in your live.
To sum up, I think that advertising should not be prohibited because there are many reason against it.
Maybe this people who are responsible for advertisings, should shorten it a little bit but never prohibit it completely!
A child aged two to five isn't able to make the right decision for themselves, often they aren't even allowed to do things or buy things, without their parents permission.
Furthermore shouldn't children of this young age be confronted with consumption of any manner.
Moreover it's bad for their developement if they think, that pretty much everything can be bought with money.
On the contrary, is a child, no matter which age, a human being, who's allowed to have toys, to have clothes or eat the candy they want, so why prohibid the advertisments of these kind of stuffs?
Furthermore children nowadays are being spoiled from their parents with gifts and stuff much earlier than the last generation used to be.
So if the parents decide wether what's good and what's bad for their particular child, there's no problem helping them with it.
An other point is, that if parents let their children watch television, at this age, it's their resposibility of what their children actually get to see and advertisements are just part of the television business.
I think there is worse stuff in television children could get to see, than an advertisement towards them, which would be toys and stuff.
Furthermore, just by seeing an advertisement, it doesn't have to mean, that they buy it, use it or consume it.
Most of the kids in this age haven't even got money, so it's still in their parents hands.
And if those parents feel pressured by their three year old kids so that it influenes their idology of how to grow up ones one kid, then their just useless parents.
So to sum it all up I would say that unless, it's a sextoy advertisement on a child programm, there's absolutely no harm of directing toy advertisement and similar advertisements to young people, whose parents still are the ones taking the shots.

Today, advertising is an importent part of our lives and also for the companies witch bring them out.
There have been many studies about how publicity influenc our daily live.
In scool we talkt about witch advertising is better and why is she better than others.
So there are many different opinions about thsat theme.
If a child is in the age from tow to five, somebody could say that they see the advrtising but they don't pay attention to it, but perhabs it does something with them in the sub-conscience.
its the same thing with the grownup persons.
so they couldbe influenced from a very young age up.
It also plays a rolle wicht kind of publicity is that.
If its for a toy they perhabs realiced it and walk afterwards to the parents and ask them if they could buy it.
People also can say that its not good to show children advertising, because they get early in that flow of buying allways anything if they have money.
Or, and thats an other argument for contra, even if they don't have enougth money.
Its easyer for them to make a lot of problems with money.
We also could say, that showing pub to them, heps that they could better understand the word of commerce and so they could learn not spending to much moneyone things they don't really need.
So they are many different ideas and meanings, but I think there are more arguments for the negative sight on this problem.Its not necessary to show them advertising because they don't have to be influenced in such a young age.
They can not protect themselv from this attacs in the sub-conscience.
And that is also my personal opinion.
The open market worldwide is booming and every company needs to claim themselve.
Just because, the companies need to make advertisements which are shown in the TV then.
Young children (aged two to five) have this "aww-effect" which attracts the potential clients attention.
Maybe he remembers the advertisement, and thats exactly what its company wanted to reach.
In this way, television advertising is a good support for the economic growth.
But, who thinks at the children, who are effected.
I mean, who is able to make serious decisions in this age?
Perhaps later, these grown up children regret what hey did in the past.
In some way, it`s there parent`s fault.
They were the actors who forced there own children to be in a television advertising, just because they are "soooo proud" parents who always wanted the best.
Television advertisment.
Everbody knows it every body hates it.
And young children shoudnt watch it.
Why?
So I dont know why not because if they watch television with two years its bad no matter if it has television advertising in it or not.
It's just stupid.
Young children should play with things, with friends, go out in the nature etc.
They will watch enough tv the rest of there lifes.
But back to the advertising.
You could say that maybe they can watch sextoils advertisment or sth.
But look, that wouldnt be bad because they wouldnt get it.
they dont understand all of the advertisment maybe these about chocolate.
But okay they watch a chocolate advertisment whats bad about it?
Whats could be bad about a chocolate advertisment but not about a serie about a mouse and a frog?
I dont know.
Children doesnt need to watch the serie about the mouse and the frog and they dont have to watch the advertisement.
You can think that my opinion to this is that television at all should be forbitten.
but thats not.
i think its your choice what you are going to to with your children.
I dont like television and stuff like these so no i wouldnt put my children in front of a television with the age of 3.
But it wouldnt be really bad if you would do it.
Its just not really healthy because you dont walk and dont smell the free nature.
you get really "faul" if you look to much tv.
So go to the scouts.
Its great.
its better than watching TV.
You make friends you are outdoor.
You are getting a better imunsystem.
And lot more.
So dont watch TV You are getting poor eyes.
So my end is: DONT WATCH TV IT MAKES YOU "FAUL" AND STUPID .
and it doesnt matter with or without advertising its stupid 
so go and search a hobby for your child.
Is that good for young children to look televison?
My first oppinion is that young children shouldn't look too much television, because they should for example be in their garden and play with their toys and friends.
But when I was young I also loved to look my series.
So I think a good education is when the parents precise a time in which their children can look TV.
And the rest of the day the boys and girls have to find other occupations.
It is very important that kids aren't addicted to the television.
And than it depends also what the young children look.
If they look things too violent, films with murders and wars, that isn't good at all!
In this age the young children learn very quick and are imrpessioned by many tings.
So if the parents show them bad films, these young kids maybe don't understand that the scenes that they see aren't good and than they will imitate this bad things with their friends at school.
Or maybe they are afraid and make very bad dreams.
So I think that it is important that the parents show their kids films which are appropriated too the childrens ages.
So the first point is that parents must give their children a fix time for televison and the second point ist that parents should control what their children look.
The oportunity is that children aren't adiccted and can have fun with other things.
Healthy things like playing football, go swimming, be with their friends... To be social and adventures!
The question 'Should advertisments which are directed to young children, between two and five years old, be allowed?'
is a controversial question because the children could suffer from the adverts when not advertised properly.
For example if children see a child-friendly add in which they need to download a game, which many children can do nowadays, the game could be locked behind a payment.
That payment could be extremly high and the children, manly because many cannot read or do not know the value of money yet, would accept it.
Therefore the parents would recieve high accounts and the game manufacturer would become wealthy for using childrens inexperience.
However, the addvertisments could also show children a toy which they then could wish for, for birthday or christmas.
The parents, when shown the addvertisment, could then dicide if the toy could help the child, in which case they would say yes or not and say no.
Finally, an advert which is for a museum, is helpful for the child and could then awake intrest for something the child did not know exsisted, like dinosaurs or deep-sea creatures.
This could help the child in its future career.
In my opinion, advertisments can be accepted as long as there isn't any money-making scheme behind the advert.
Furthermore if the child experiences harm during the advert, the advert should be recalled immediately.
But if the advertisments are for enlightening the childs intrests and could possibly help him in the future, for example choosing a subject to study, they should be allowed to broadcast.
"Television is bad for your eyes."
That's a common sentence used by parents to draw their children away from the TV.
Maybe it's just a fairy tale made by concerned parents or maybe watching television really has become what most parents fear: addictive.
But what about the advertsising?
Don't we all hate it?
These breaks between our beloved television shows or even between a really good movie?
But what about children?
Aren't they in danger of a bad influence made by ads?
Well it's not that easy to say.
We could say that advertising really has become a big thing.
Ads by McDonalds or the new doll that every young girl needs to possess.
Ads always give us this feeling that we miss out on something.
They give us the feeling that we need something even do we can't afford it or we know that it's not going to have the effects we want it to have.
Children between the age 2-5 probably see flashy colors in front of their eyes while a catchy song is playing but it's hard to believe that they actually understand the content of an advertise.
They are still so young and the brain focuses on diffrent things than advertising.
Also we could say that most of the children don't really spend their time in front of a TV.
Most of them are playing outside during the day in the evening they go to sleep early anyway.
Also most of the time parents are pretty strict about the TV rules and most of them don't allow their children to watch TV besides some childrenmovies.
But still we can't deny that young children are naive and can be influenced very easily.
We may not notice it at the first glance but isn't their always a child that wants a new doll?
Or a new plastic boat that's probably not even good in quality?
But why is that so?
Is it because of advertising in television?
Even though I said earlier that the probably only see flashy colors and can't remember properly they are always in a learning progress.
And if they see something they want it.
It's easier to get a childs attention by using an ad because they can't read and sometimes it's easier to just give them pictures to look at.
Also the ads are catchy and most of them are promoting useless toys that can't even be used properly.
Some of the ads even promote an unhealthy lifestyle for example McDonalds with his famous happy meal.
And food is as we all know something that holds us together and it doesn't need much words to say that you're hungry and that you want a happy meal.
So should we cut the access to ads for young children?
I don't think so.
The ads may be made for them but as I can say from my own experience that it's pretty much useless.
I don't remember most of them anyway and if I have seen something on TV and want my parents to buy it they would be strict about it.
I mean it's still the parents choice what they buy and don't buy for their children.
Television advertising is something completely normal nowerdays.
Advertisments are used to convince the people of specific products.
Often they are directed toward young children.
Because if they like it, and they see the product in the next shop, they are going to try to convince their parents to buy it.
Often they have a bigger chance of succes, than the original television advertisment.
That'swhy the people in this business  directed it towards them.
But should that really be allowed?
That's the question discussed in this small essay.
It is obviously a little "sneaky", what the advertisment people do, to convince as many potential clients as possible.
But does it really harm the children?
It is much easier to convince little children of a product.
You just need a funny, colourfull, little clip, that somehow speaks to them and they will do the rest.
Maybe not even knowing what they're doing, the will recognise the product and will want to have it.
That really does not seem to be too bad.
Children are very influenceable, which makes them to easy victims but they are also in a stage of learning.
So you not only indirectly convince their parents, you also make some potential future clients.
What they see in their younger ages and what their parents use, they will remember later and are going to use the same thing.
You don't really give them the possibility to choose.
They are not yet ready for that.
But their makes does the choice for them, making the children want something that might not even be good for them.
But in the end, there are still the parents, which can influrence their child and simply say "no", if their children want something stupid.
Also making television advertsing directed toward young children, already asumes, that there will be children watching it.
An advertisment does not work, if nobody is going to watch it.
So young children are already supposed to sit infront of the television.
Which is really sad, considering people that young should rather go outside or play with friends.
I think it should not be forbidden.
But it is also not very good.
In the end it is thou the parents,that influence their children the most.
Television advertising directed toward young children is a controversial subject.
While some people's opinion is that it has a bad influence on young children, some others claim that young children don't get harmed by television advertising at all.
In the following paragraphs I'm going to explain different reasons that agree or disagree with television advertising that is directed towards very young children.
First of all, opponents of television advertising argue that children this young are influenced very easily by their surroundings.
Amongst other things, this can be their parents, friends they play with and also television.
If they are being exposed to television advertising, critics say, their personalities can't develop as well as if they weren't, because advertisements are always very persuasive and try to change people's opinions, which is not something a young person should experience.
Second, some people say that young kids should spend their time on more useful things like playing with their friends or crafting instead of sitting still all day in front of the TV.
By allowing advertising directed towards children, companies are more likely to try to persuade parents to let their daughters and sons watch television more often, since they can possibly make profit out of it.
This is a trend that is not beneficial for the children's brain development, since passive activities like watching TV don't create a lot of connections inside of the brain.
On the other hand, supporters claim that television advertising is actually beneficial for children.
They say that the advertisements are designed almost like any other show for kids: Friendly, colorful and underlined with fun music and therefore can't be harmful for young individuals.
Furthermore, they say that the advertisements never promote anything harmful for kids, but new toys, coloring pages or similar instead.
They think children, even children as young as a two-year-olds, should be informed about the things they might like and maybe even get an idea for a birthday wish out of it.
In my opinion, advertising for children on television is not something I support or am particularly fond of.
I don't think that it's beneficial in any way for the children and just another way for companies to generate more revenue.
I also think that it can have an unhealthy effect on very young children who are to young to tell the difference between reality and fiction.
Nevertheless, I think that not all advertisements should be banned but instead watched evaluated by experts for human brain development first before they get released.
Television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed.
The television is a media, who is very common and important in our life.
Between Films or Tv-shows is mostly a break for the advertisement.
That's Marketing in our modern world.
And that's an important part of the business of many organisations and labels.
But is it really important to refer television advertising direct toward children?
First of all there are labels which refers especially to young children.
For instance Barbie, Hot wheels, Playdooh and also sweets who are made for children.
So you can say that the children are the most important group for this label.
But who thinks that the children buy all the stuff on their own?
The parents have the money and the parents buy the stuff for their children.
So why do the labels don't make the advertisement for the parents.
For example:"Happy children and happy parent", as a slogan.
For a second point, isn't it morallly wrong to refer the advertisement direct toward young children?
They should play, they shout learn and they should grow up.
But they should not be the victims of the desire which is always hidden in every advertisement.
At least the children should not be part of that society which thinks just at profit and the money they made.
They should not be consumers.
They should first learn what is really important in their life befor they think about other stuff.
As a conclusion I think that television advertising direct toward children should not be allowed, because children are too young to think about all these things and they should basically learn, play and have fun!
So first of all, I think children, between two and five shouldn't look that much TV that they have to look the advertisings between the movies or the serie.
But, okay, in our time nearly all 10 minutes is a break between a serie.
And of course, there are advertisings for young children as well, because the company has to mark themself as well.
So it would be kind of hart, when you would them not allow, to do their marketing.
But children have (not in all cases) not a big known, and not so much experiece in life.
When they see these advertisings, which seem to present the coolest thing in the world, of course they want the product, which they have seen.
They don't know, that the products in reailty are sometimes not that special.
But would it be fair, to disallow them their advertisings?
No, I don't thnik so.
I think this is kind of a job from the parents, to look that they learn that not everything, what it seems to be, is what it is.
When the parents let their children watch TV for the first times, they should, maybe sit next to them and explain them the situation.
Because, not every advertising is a bad one, which tells them a fairy tale.
When a child wants something for Christmas, or his/her birthday, TV adverstisings can be helpful.
And I think, when you wouldn't allow their advertisings, athor advertisings should be disallowed as well.
Because, there are a lot of adults which fall for the advertising-tricks as well.
And in Difference to the children, they gonna spend their money on the product.
Nowadays there are many parents who do not care how long and which kind of TV channels their children watch.
This could have big consequences for their education, but do the parents have to forbid to watch TV to their children?To my mind, there are two points of view to this question.
First, many parents let their children watch TV to entertain them so they are not bored.
For me this is not bad because I learned a couple of facts by watching TV.
Furthermore, the producer from the kids channels also had the aim that childrem can learn from its series.
In addition, our generation is very influenced by the internet or the TV, so it is good that the children learn early what TV really is and what sort of channels are there and they also able to learn the language better.
To the opposite many parents do not let their children watch TV and they somtimes do not even have one.
They only let their children play outside or to play with toys.
They have the argument that there is only "rubbish" in the TV which make their children stupid.
I am not saying that this is not true but it is to abstract.
To sum up, I totally understand both sides because both of them are right.
All in all all is a question of how much and what kind of TV channel it is.
In my opinion it is not good to let the children watch TV everytime but the solution is not to just forbid it because lots of children like to watch TV and for example in the morning when everyone is still sleeping and when it is cold outside the children are glad to watch TV so they can pass a little time and it is also easier for the parents so they are able to sleep longer.
Television advertising directed toward young childern schould not be allwoed

In our society in europe, it is nothing new, that television contain a lot of advertising.
It let the people think, that advertising is something normal.
Something taht a lot of people is not even more questioned.
In our society in europe, it is also normal for a child to look a lot of television.
They grow up with television.
And also with advertising.
In what a society do we live in?
And more, waht happen with the childern, who look advertising every day?
First, I think adverstising should not be banned.
It is a part of our society.I dont say, that it is a good thing.
But childern have to know, for waht advertising is existing.
It is existing to make the people buy a lot of things.
Advertisinges are never, or mostly not critiqual.
It is up to the human, to find out about advertising.
If the want to.
In the second place, I think it is important to learn how to live with advertising.
If I walk through the roud, I always see advertising.
Not always just in the television.
Childern have to learn, how they can protect themslefs of the world of advertising.
In the third place, I'm anyway against things adult people wanne forbidden their childern.
I mean, they live in our wolrd.
They grow up in it.
They should now, in what for a wolrd they are living in.
And from where should an adult know, what a child should see and what not?
In conclusion, I think it is important to let the childern now, and letting them making an own opinion about advertising.
Not an other person from outwhere.
Basicly because he is not the same person.
Advertising is always communicating with us in many different ways.
Either when we are walking down the street or when we are sitting in front of the television at home there are always advertisments, which are trying to get in touch with us.
Advertising is a personal thing as it can be seen on Facebook, where it is tried to do some commercials, which perfectly fit in our interests.
This leads to the question are there any moral stops for advertising?
Advertising companies are entering more and more our daily life and also started to do advertising for young children.
Young children can't have an own understanding of life.
They try to act like their parents and also try to find their first own interests.
If advertising interrupts these processes it obviously stops the children from growing up.
The companies try to influence the children to buy their products and to be a customer who only buys their products.
Nestea for example is a big company that produces lots of baby food.
A few years ago scientists had shown that there are food extras in these products which makes the babies like their other products in the future.
Also the parents won't like that the big companies are already influencing their young children.
The kids want to have products like lollies or drinks when they do the grocery shop with their parents but not because they need them.
They only want to buy them because the social stereotypes are telling them to do.
They see other children walking around with their lollies and they see the advertisment so they want to have them too.
A good example to support my thesis is the well known "Kinder suprise egg".
As I already the children have no chance to create their own interests for example which game they would like to play.
The communication of the advertisment tells them what they want to have and what they like.
This is also proved by many scientists.
In conclusion it can be clearly said that the advertising tries to influence the young children to make them dependent to their products.
This is not good at all because we all are being influenced by something we don't want to, which is sort of doing harm to someone.
The young children can't do anything against this process and in my opinion this is where also the profit-organized businesses should stop.
Btw.
im tired and hungry so dont expect anything.
Television advertisements are a thing, every television watcher is exposed to.
From a very young age, to uneducated and older people.
Advertisements can be very manipulative and almost brainwashing, so therefore a majority of people think that advertisements to small children should be banned.
In this Essay I will figure out wether or not this is worthy my time or not.
On one hand, they are ads and people who put their two year old children infront of a television either know, that they are confronting their children with ads and don't care, or if they don't know, they are probably too dumb to have children anyway.
Also, how are companies supposed to sell their products, if they are not allowed to promote their products.
Every big company we know got their name off of marketing, for example coca cola or mc donalds.
They will make no to little profit and stop selling products directed towards young children.
On the other hand, children are easily manipulated and an easy target for any kind of ad or propaganda.
They can bevery stubborn in what they want and they don't fear the ways to prove this.
To conclude I will say that all parents should be aware of the consequences.
If they don't want to confront their children with ads etc.
they can buy them DVD's and download movies, because "free" telelevision also needs a way to earn money and stay alive.
Therefore i think advertisements in any way should not be banned.
The question of whether or not television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, is quite difficult but important, since the early years of childhood shape us as humans.
It goes without saying that children are easily influenced.
Parents might want to protect their children from an exposure to advertising, since they fear it could be harmful for their mental well-being.
When children see something on the television that is clearly marketed towards their age group, they may suddenly desire these things that they've never really thought about before, and that they don't really need.
This could lead to a materialistic world view, that lots of parents disapprove of.
If the parents spoil their child, the child could become greedy and keep on demanding new things.
This can easily become a nuisance for the parents, but punishing the child by not allowing them to watch television anymore doesn't seem like a good solution.
The damaging adverts are not the child's fault, after all.
But how can parents keep their child from becoming obsessed with expensive toys?
Especially when they aren't able to afford the things advertised on television, it may lead to conflict within the family.
Children don't see advertising as something artificial, they don't recognise the presented scenarios as fictional and romantisised.
If a child on TV can have such a good time playing with these dolls, then why shouldn't they?
Sooner or later, children have to be made aware of the reality of advertising and its purpose.
Some people might say that if the child is used to seeing adverts, it doesn't really pose a problem; the sooner they learn to recognise advertising, the better.
But in my opinion, parents should introduce their child cautiously to the world of advertising, and forbidding advertisements aimed directly at them could be a huge benefit because the child can learn about adverts in a more removed, distanced way.
It depends what kind of ads the kids are watching.
First of all a young kid like that should only watch specific series for children on channels like "Kika" that are designed for kids.
I don't know if it's still the same a when I was fifteen years younger but at my time I never felt the ads to be distracting or manipulating me to really want an object and even if a kid gets obsessed with an item in an ad they couldn't buy it by themselvs and would need to beg their parents for their desired object.
Obviously the responsibility lies in the parents hands.
They need to teach their kids that they can't have everything that they see in televison and also observe what the kids are watching.
I'm not quite sure if there are even companies that have a specific programm to manipulate kids through advertiment because I don't think that's worth.
The ads are like they are for adults, to show their product and perhaps raise interest.
Of course little kids, me aswell back in the day, want many things they see in television but if the parents just accept that and buy everything their child wants, they are guilty when their kid becomes a "crybaby" when they don't get what they want.
In my opinion it would be a waste of time to ban ads directed toward young children because it is not as important than that the parents watch after their child and control what they are watching until a certain age where the kid beginns to think rational and starts to know by his own what kind of stuff they are watching.
Now-a-days even young children watch television quite often.
As a consequenze, there are more adverts especially made for them so that they know what they could set on their next birthdaywish letter.
Firstly, it is not possible for these young children not to see any adverts.
Although you can ban telvision advertising, they still are confrontet with adverts for older people, adverts on the street and adverts in different shops.
They have an effect on them as well.
No matter where we are, there is always some kind of advertising.
In spite of this fact there is no ability to ban television advertising for young children unless advertising is banned at all.
Secondly, if there is an influence toward young children, their parents will have the power to say no to the wishes triggered from the adverts.
Furthermore, they cannot allow their children to watch television.
The children might learn how to deal with it and they learn to decide what they really need and what they should not buy.
During the time when most children watch TV, one could ban adverts which work with psychological tricks to make the children buy their product.
In conclusion, TV adverts do not have to be banned.
o
Television and other medias like the internet are a huge theme in our society.
There are many pros and contras.
But should young children have already contact with it?
Is the influence positive or negative?
Our world is full of medias and there can be found things to every theme you ever want.
Is this good for young children?
It can not be, some people are saying, there is to much that this young eyes shouldn't see.
Television should be forbitten to them.
Children should play outside and not sit inside in front of the TV.
But computer and things like this will be very important in their life so they should grow up with it to understand it.
And in in this young age they won't understand much they see so it isn't important to be afraid that they could be traumatized or something like this.
It's a part of our life, why it shouldn't be one of the children life.
The decision if children should watch TV or not should be a thing of the parents, they know what's the best for their children.
I don't like to say anymore so I will stay and snore.
TV is rubbish, I'd like more to have a fish.
They are much more interresting to watch than television with promotion of swatch.
The TV is not a new thing anymore.
Basically every family has a television at home and watches the TV.
There is no television channel without advertising, that's not a problem for adult people but what about children?
Can they really understand the advertising shown in tv?
Is it necessary?
And what woul change if the advertising towards young children was forbidden?
When I was a child I don't think that I watched Tv until I was six years old and even then I wasn't allowed to watch alot of TV.
I used to watsch from 7pm to 7.30pm the "Sandmann" which came on the children channel or sometimes I was allowed to watche Barbie-films.
In the breaks during the film, came a lot of advertisings.
To be honest, it wasn't a problem for me or my family.
I could still grow up like a normal child even if I saw some advertising at the television.
I am sure, that times changed and my childhood was different than the childhood children have now.
I used to go to parcs with my parents and friends and I used to play alot outside.
I know that nowdays we have the problem, that children watch alot more TV and they don't move alot.
But I don't understand why the advertising should be a big problem.
It is more the fault of the parents.
Alot of parents are scared that theire children break a leg when the play some wild games and prefere that they stay at home,where the are "save".
But that's not a good idea!
So, I do not allow with the statement written above.
The problem is not the advertising itself, the problem are all those parents, who don't want thire children to go out because it's too dangerous.
Parents often like to turn on the tv because they want that theire children have something to do (and watching tv is something they can do without any adult).
I don't think, that the advertising is dangerous, as long as it is advertising which is adopted to children.
It is clear that children shouldn't see advertisings which are scaring, but most of the children channel are aware of this.
Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed.
There are many arguments that it shouldn`t be allowed.
It isn`t good for the children to watch much television in this age because they are to young and it`s bad for their development.
Before children have to go to school they shouldn`t watch television because it is prooved, that children who watched a lot of television aren`t as good in school as the other children.
If it is bad to watch television in this age it is bad to make television advertising for them.
Also children in this age are easy to manipulate and if the advertising tells something is good they will believe it and so they want to have it.
If they want something they will find a way to make their parents buy this things.
People who are older realise that in the advertising the product seems to be much better than it really is.
In this young age they can`t see this.
There are also the proposers of television advertising.
They think it should be allowed because the company can sell a lot more than they would do without television adertising.
So it is good for the economy.
They also think why should it not be allowed?
If they wouldn`t make the advertising there would also be other advertising young children could see.
I think it isn`t the best thing in the world and maybe it would be good if it were forbidden.
But I also think it will be difficult to make a law which says television advertising should not be allowed.
I think it should be forbidden but I don`t think that it will be forbidden.
We have a lot of other problems which we have to solve and this isn`t that important.
In my opinion you have to separate two different types of this advertising.
There are often some who refere directly to young children but the most of them are just for the parents.
So they want that the children can see all the amazing toys and article.
The children really want these toys and so in the end it has only an effect on the parents.
They can buy them what they want or they can just say no.
The most children aged two to five haven't money to buy them these things by there own.
Even if you have to separate, I think it doesn't matter if the television advertising is directed toward young children or for there parents, because the resault is the same.
Maybe the children react more to the advertising then the parents, because they are way faster faszinated of it.
The parents are already used of all the influence of advertising, so often they do not even realize or they just don't listen to it.
In general I would say it shouldn't be not allowed.
But in my opinion it shouldn't be allowed before or after a show for children.
In all the breaks of shows for children aged older the five it shouldn't be a problem because ether the children don't watch these shows or the parents could switch the channel if there is to much advertising.
My conclusion is that it should be allowed with some rules or laws.
At the end it's anyway always the decision of the parents if they want to buy the advertised article or not.
If the parents would have a problem with all the advertising, I think it would anyway be much better no to let them look television aged this young.
They should go outside and do something active instead of sitting the hol
The question if television advertising for young children should not be allowed, is a question that concerns many people.
There are parents who do not want their children to see it because if the children see those advertisements, they could be influenced in a way they don't even understand yet.
They don't realize that in advertisements, everything is showed that it looks more beautiful as it is, and that mostly the product isn't as good as in the advertisement.
But another question is, why shouldn't it be allowed, because young children shouldn't be watching television all the time, because it's not good for them.
A child should be outside playing with other children to get more social, so the advertisment in the television shouldn't bother them at all, because they don't see it so often.
But sadly, it isn't normal, that a child isn't allowed to watch television when it wants so it's a reasonable doubt if they could change their behaviour or something else because of the advertisment.
I think the main problem is, that the children grow up as careless consumers when they see it, a consumer that doesn't care if he really needs the product or not and in the world there are enough of this specific kind of people.
For example, a child sees a machine that can make bubbles, and is so fascinated of it, that it wants the machine no matter what.
Of course the child is too young to think about the money that it costs and the water that it consumes but I think if a child is used to get things without thinking about the reasons to get it, or the use it has, it will have the behaviour as well in the future.
Another aspect is, that the parents could be even more stressed, because their child wants all the things he sees in the advertisement.
We can all imagine a young boy crying on the floor because he didn't get his water pistole he saw in the television.
And if this happens a few times in a week, because the boy sees another thing he wants in an advertisment, it could be really stressfull for the parents.
But there is also a good thing that advertisments for young children can do.
They can show products that are healthy, for example a snack made out of fruits.
If a child sees this he might change his preferences in eating, and instead of eating a chocolate bar, he'll eat a bar made out of fruits.
In a time where there are a lot of people with too much weight, this is a good way to change the eating behaviour in the young ages.
In conclusion, there are a lot of negative aspects in advertisement for young children, but there are positive aspects too.
For me, I don't think they are really usefull, because all they do is create a society that consumes too much, and in addition they can create problems between the parents and the children.
But the most important thing is, that a child isn't at home all the time watching television, because the social contact is really important in this age.
Since a child of two to five can't buy something itself, there's no danger that a child buys something it shouldnt buy, but the advert can make the children want the product.
The content of the advert plays an important rule.
When there's any kind of violence, sexism or racism in it, it should be forbidden, but then it shouldn't be allowed anyway for everybody.
Maybe an advert about a videogame, which is not dangerous for an older child to see, but a younger one shouldn't see it because it cannot differentiate between reality and fiction.
That the most series and movies for children are fiction, the question comes up, if watching television should even be allowed to a child aged under five, but that's another question.
The most adverts designed with the goal to make children desire their products, are about tools to play.
What bad is about that, is that the child wants something new, even it mostly has enough things to play with.
That supports the consume society, and probably the child was happy and content before, but now it wants something more that it doesn't even need.
When a child is bored, it makes up its mind and thinks of other things to play and to do, and a child always will find a way to pass the time senseful.
Adverts that promise happyness and lots of fun with their product, only limit the childs natural ability to make up very creative things to play with.
So I think the advert isn't helping any child or parent, but the decision what to buy, make the parents.
There's no need to forbid the advertisment.
Advertising in general can sometimes be something really powerful.
Our world is full of it, especially in the television.
Different companies try to sell teir stuff to a various amaount of people.
For example an advertisment for toys is directed to a specific group of people: the children,who are going to play with the toys.
But is it alright to show the advertisment to these young people?
Children change their opinions every day.
They are trying and seeing new things every day.
They evolve.
For this reason, they need an idol.
Someone who shows them the world in a right way.
They should learn from their own experiences.
Not only the parents, friends or other relatives may be a huge influence,television advertising is as well.
But is this advertising influence a good thing?
It's not, because often you get a wrong picture of ethic values.
For example there are rarly children in a televison advertising with black complexion, and if there is one it's mostly in the backgroud and not the main actor.
Secondly, the children are going to think, that they need to buy the toys andare going to ask their parents if they are going to buy it for them.
So basically a company who directs the television advertising toward the children, are only using them to make profit.
On the other hand children get the option to see what they could buy next or what they could want for christmas.
Also they can get inspired.
Me for example didn't always buy the toys I wanted, sometimes I made them by my own.
In my opinion advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.
The influence that it takes, is just to big.
Children have other options to get to know the world and see what's out there.
I neither agree or disagree with this statement, for the following reasons: Reason number one is that I don't believe in capitalism, meaning I don't think it should be allowed at all to make advertisings in televison.
But that's an other discussion.
To discuss this topic we also have to make clear that I would never allow my children to watch television at the age of two to five.
With these believes I can't really agree with advertising directly towards children, especially as young as the ones we discuss.
Advertising and especially towards children is against all of my morals and with that not enough.
I believe that it's a crime to make profit out of naive children.
For example, I think that if you ask anybody on the streets, if it was alright to sell something more expensive, than 10 Dollars to a child under the age of five, that not one of the asked would say that this is morally correct.
That's because of the brain we human beeings have.
We have to learn first, not like deers which are born and then can survive, throughout our lives we learn.
And at the age of five an human beeing hasn't learned yet what value is, or how much value something has.
In conclusion everyone should agree with me that it is wrong to sell objects to kids, and even to advertise directly towards a child is unacceptable.
Also someone who lets their children watch television at the age of five or under must be crazy.
Some people might say that directing adverts to children should be forbidden.
However why would it be bad for kids, who do not have any money to buy something, to see an advert about a toy.
It might make them want it and what is so bad about that.
In my opinion the adverts are probably not even adressed to the kids rather to the parents so they get inspired what they could give their toddlers for Christmas.
I think most people are scared when kids are confronted with advertisements too early they might get as 'consumption needy' as our society.
But as I see it there is no escape out of this mentality because we are their idols and as long as we do not change our way of thinking there is no way that the next generation grows up differently.
So if you do not want that our children grow up with the same mentality as we have you could say we should ban adverts from the television in general.
But what sense would that make.
I mean most of our companys rely on advertisments so they can sell enough products.
By banishing adverts we would just ruin most of todays factories.
As I see it the only reasonable solution for people who want advertising directed towards kids not to be allowed anymore is that they should not let their children watch telly.
This might be harsh but in my opinion it is the only option which would work for most or rather all.
Who really raises the generations that were born in the era of computers, roboters and self-driving cars?
This is a good question to start to analyze the given quote.
The quote might be very controversial to some of us since there are people who are more interested in the economy than with the education of young children.
Obviously, television advertising is a good way to boost the economy.
Thanks to the big influence that the media has over our society, many young children will be watching television.
And if children see the ad, they might want watever is shown in there.
Many parents will give in to spend money for them.
For me, there is an issue with television advertising that targets a group of such a young age.
Advertisements are not meant to support whoever is watching them but are purely self-interested.
As we all know, advertisements are full of details that crawl into our minds and get stuck there to manipulate us.
So if the ads are directed towards such a fragile audience, they will have a big inpact on them.
The ads might not just make the children want something but they might start to shape their personalities and the way they reason.
The children will be used to have the same opinion as the advertisements.
To be honest, I strongly agree with the quote.
Manipulating people that cannot yet have a real opinion is just unfair and kind of corrupt.
I think most of the people I know would agree with this statement, because they are afraid of electronic technology like some day the whole system could be controlled by machines which are human-made, but let's be honest; television advertising directed toward young children has also its sunny sides.
For example get those children used to systems like TV and are faster to lern new things in technology than adults who never had something like a TV.
In the West World, electronic technology is used in nearly every activity, so if you watched TV at a very young age, you may understand better how our technology functions, because in television advertising, new technology is often used.
Otherwise it dosen't seem to be good for their future.
The media influences people on a very high level.
With photoshop, showing only things they want to let the people know and other ways to hide things of the real reality, people who watch too often TV or children who are directed to television advertising only see the opinion of the medias.
They don't have the knowledge to do things by themselfes because they saw it in the TV but they didn't tried it by themselfes.
They possibly also forget to think by themselfes and realise that TV doesn't show the reality.
In my opinion, televsision advertising directed toward young childern shouldn't be allowed, because like this, people don't do any further progess, they go backwards
Television advertising, one of the most annoying things in the world.
Whenever you are watching a movie, you can be sure, that in the middle of the most nerveracking scene there will be a commercial break.
But what happens, when companiess direct their advertising towards a new, younger age group?
Honestly, I do not think, that advertisement directed towards young children should not be allowed.
I disagree with the statement above.
First of all, I do not see the problem that should be caused by advertising.
Secondly  I think it does not matter whether young children see a commercial for a new toy or not, because their parents are the ones who can decide whether their child will get it, because they have the money to buy it.
And thirdly, I do not understand what could possibly be so bad about these commercials, because if they are directed towards young children, they certainly have to be suited for young children.
Of course, I am not a parent so I do not understand their point of view, but I think that it does not matter if companies direct their advertising towards a younger audience and I certainly beleive, that this is not a controversial topic.
The advertisings have been increasing over time, not only that they nowadays they are really specific for each mankind.
When we talk about TV commercials, their way haven't change much for ages.
However one can say that they have also increased.
Often there is a 15 minutes commerical break between the TV programms.
The commericals target the certain viewer.
The question here is, if it's moraly supportable to have advertisments for children between the age of two to five.
Children around the age of two to five are the most influentable.
In their early childhood they are learing to talk, walk and also learing about their surrounding.
They don't even know, what is good or bad for that.
The law even declaires, that a child only knows to judge situations around the age of eight.
That means that the toddlers can't jugde whether a product is good or bad for them.
Considering all of these factors, there shouldn't be any advertisments on the childrens channel.
But the sad truth is, those childeren are the main target of the big companies.
A companies main goal is to have loyal longlasting cunsumers.
They simply don't care if the children can decide whether something is good for them or not.
The companies know that the children tell their parents about that new toy and they somehow persude their parents to buy it.
The families, who can affort them, spoil their children with all these goods.
Concluding, I think the children's channel shouldn't have any commericals, because they aim to manipulate the children.
With those advertisment the children face our cosum oriented society and I think they shouldn't have to cope with that.
An average child between the age of two and five loses their ability to judge situations, when they are confronted with commericals on a daily basis.
Adding to that, not only TV advertising should be banned
Nowadays television has a huge impact in our society.
The television is one of the biggest massmedia that control our society.
It has a huge role in our decision making and influences a lot of our actions and ideologies.
The biggest group that is affected by the television advertising are young children.
They see something in the ads ( espacially toys) and immediately run to their parents and want them to buy it.
This "trick" of advertising their products towards children is used by companies because children especially young children are the easiest to manipulate.
I personally think that the companies are faceless because the use the innocence of the children to make them believe that they need their product.
This is one of the reasons why children nowadays own so many toys because the are heavily influenced by the big toy companies and buy their products.
Not only do they then own something which they dont really need but they sink into this spiral of consuming more and more.
Especially in the virtual age we live in the children are able to purchase "products" through in-app purchases.
This leads to that the children don't realize that they did even spend the money and keep on spending more money on the companies' products.
Which furthermore lead to a big surprise for the parents because they do not know about the spendings of their children on  the internet.
To sum myself up.
I personally think that television advertising or any sort of advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.
These children do not know the value and importance of money and dont know how to control their spendings on the internet.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed

Is it fair or not to include young children in television advertising?
Are they able to realize what advertising is doing with themselves?
I don't think so.
It is simply not fair because young children are not able to see that the toy industry just wants to sell their products and don't care about them at all.
It is also impossible for them to see that the things showed in advertisings are not as nice in real life as they are in the aderts.
Just because they don't even think about it.
They just see a toy they like and think that this toy will make them very happy because the child in the video is also very happy with his new toy.
But let me ask another question first: why do we even include children in these adverts?
They can't buy things by their own anyway.
So they'll just annoy their parents the whole time until the parents are willing to make their wishes come true.
Why include children out of this business if it's the parents who decide to buy it in the end?
The adverts just show children the latest toys.
In the end the parents decide if they want to give a certain product to their children or not.
On top it would be unfair against companys who sell products for children.
All the other industrys are allowed to make their products look nice on television.
It is just normal to use adverts to sell your products in our society.
If we want to fight against things that are bad for children, we should start in closing Mac Donalds 
and Burgerking because these fast food restaurants are far more dangerous for young children.
They make them believe their food is good and they make their restaurants very attractive for young children in having playgrounds, a clown and toys inside the "happy meal".
This kind of advertising is worse because it destroys the childrens health and it's not Television advertising.
There are also good things in Television advertising directed to young children.
 The aim of commercials is to have an effekt on the person who is watching and to create a desire to be in possesion of the promoted product.
But should commercials generally aim for young kids aged two to five?
Kids  that young can not decide themselfes wheater to buy the product or not.
Still the commercial can achieve  that they wish for the product and to convince their parents to buy it.
A child that is completely dependent on their parents.
It is in a stage whereit has to learn many new things.
So it is used to observe it's environement.
This means it is way easier to influence than older kids.
Considering that I don't think that television advertising directed toward children aged two to five is a good idea and agree with the statement.
The advertising toward young children like the statement confirms shouldn't be allowed, because children are very easily manipulated.
The children will manipulate the parents which they see in the tv the parents to buy theme.
Children can influens the buy-comportation and choose with the parents in which mall they go.
The children influens also one below the other by seeing things that other children have, they want theme too.
On the sight of the commercial this strategy will work for his buisness and he will gain much money.
By influensing and manipulating children they will buy his products.
My personal opinion is that the children shouldn't be influenced by this kinds of things.
I think it should be a low so that the children are save.
To influence young children isn't a good thing and I wish that the state will do something against this, but I don't think that it will be some change in the next years.
But the adults are influenced too.
May be that no one cares ot^r other think that it isn't true, but I think it is, because I see it by myself too.
In our society today we have the disadventage or the adventage of having so many medias.
Already young children want to know things about them and want to use them.
Now we have to think about it wheater it is good or not.
It is not good when children watch the hole day TV and forget their real life.
It can happen when their parents put their children in front of the TV to get them quiet.
Children will not go out and enjoy the Nature, this can lead to a problem when they get older.
But we can not forget the adventage of televison and our modern medias.
You can watch documentarys and learn many things.
In school it sometimes is also used as a media to teach kids.Because some people can learn much better in the visual way.
In my opinion television is not a very bad thing you can learn many things from it but it can also teach you stupid things or it can give you a strange way of our reality because there are humans who do not understand, that about keeping up with the Kardashians is not much real.
Thats the main problem I think.
So I think it would be good if it was not allowed for children in this age because they can not separate reality form TV.
I have to add that I think the limit of five years is not enough.
A good way would be, that children are allowed to watch TV at the age of 8 years and after this age they are allowed to watch TV for example 30 minutes per day but their parents check what their children are watching.
To sum up I think it is a good idea no to let children watch TV in this young age.
Advertisement has become more and more popular.
Recent studies showed, that the average american watches several years of TV-advertisement in an average life.
Thats a lot of time, and therefore it is absolutely worth discussing witch TV-avertisement should be allowed and witch ones not.
"Ich bin doch nöd blöd!"
One sentence and most inhabitants of Switzerland will know to witch brand this slogan belongs.
It is absolutely necessary that a firm is known immideatly by its customers.
For this effect, especially toddlers are great persons.
What a child beleves it its heart will stay there very long and it need moch effort to make the child think diffrently.
They beleve what you say them even though it might not be true.
Furthermore, we live in a free country, where basically every TV-spot is accepted as long as it is not violating any laws.And exactly that point is important for brands and firms, they need to have the possibility of being diffrent.
But as metioned before, toddlers developpment is to little to make a difference between real and fantasy.
If you let the thinking of "the more I buy the luckier I am" succed in them, they will pobable never loose it again.
In addition to that, they don't have any relationship to money, witch makes them beleve that they can have everything, as long as their parents do buy it for them.
That is not true but nether is it true that consuming maokes anyone happy in  the longer therm.
In my oppinion, TV-spots for toddlers are somehow immoral, and should therefore not be seen on TV.
It is a sign of weakness if a firm nedds to manipulate the smallest of our society just to survive or even make profits.
Small children are worth being protected and therefore it should also be possible for them to be educated by their parents rather than by unperonal, lying TV.
Television advertising has become quite a common way of introducing new products to the population nowadays.
But should young children already be confronted with such ads?
On the one hand children of the age two to five shouldnt be watching too much TV anyways as it isnt ideal for their age group.
It is the parents responsibility to monitor their childs television consumption and decide if its good for their well being or not.
If they notice that the televison advertisements directed at their spouses isnt benefiting them and their behaviour is changing it is their job to find new activities for their children.
On the other hand some parents dont have time to constantly watch over their children and might allow them to watch short sequences of TV daily.
As children can be influenced very easily and are usually persistent in what they want it doesnt take a lot of advertising to plant and idea or a certain product in their head.
Parents usually have enough to worry already  so they shouldnt have to be worried about advertisings changing their childs mind aswell.
Also it can be annoying when children start whining about wanting something they saw on TV.
Our society is already very fond of consumerism which I personally find shouldnt be encouraged even more, especially not at such a young age.
It will make them materialistic when they grow up and ubable to spend their own income a reasonable way.
At this point the government should take some precautions and responsibility and stop persistent companies of directing such commercials at children.
I am against such crommercials as i find them wrong and terribly bad for the mindset of such young humans.
It doesnt benefit very many people either as in the end still the parents decide what will be bouoght and what not.
Children should be able to form their own opinion about something instead of constantly having advertisements telling them what is best for them.
Should television advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?
Nowdays almost everyone has a TV in their home.
Children grow up with them and can not imagine a life without a television.
There are a lot channels for different aged children.
Of course there are also a lot of advertisment.
We can not imagine a channel without that.
So is it right to make it direct toward young children?
If you watch TV and swich the channels often, you will see that every ten minutes you have to watch advertisment about everything and not surprising it is everywhere the same.
At children channels there are of course a lot advertisment about children things like toys and so on.
They need to do that so those people can make them intersted and then they go and buy it.
This is the point of advertising.
The children will get a view about things that exist and how they can have fun with things they do not have.
But it is important that they do not make pressure that the kids think they have to buy those things or they can not be happy.
It should be childfriendly that makes them happy.
So they should give them an oppurtunity to learn new stuff.
But if they sit 24 hours in front of a screen and they can not have enough, the situation can escalade very quickly.
The kids trust them and think they have to get all those stuff.
So the parents begin to buy it, but they never have enough and the kid want more and more.
Poor parents!
It is import to limit the quantity that the kids and parents are happy.
So TV advertising should watch that they say and do the right things.
To sum up, I think it should not be permitted to advertise direct toward young children.
But we have to look that we show them the right things and do not esagerade.
Those kids have to learn so much things give them the freedom.
You often see young children on televison.
They look cute and impress the people.
Is this also a good experience for the young children or will they going to have problems later?
Television advertising directed torwarted young children between two to five should not be allowed.
There are many arguments for and many against.
First I deal with the positiv site.
Young Children are very likely seen on Television.
They look cute and impress the people.
Often the children has fun and a lot of people who know it.
For companies it is also a big bussines because children are not as expensive as older persons but mostly has the same effect.
When they will forbit advertising torward to young children they will take more freedom from the humans.
The negative site is much longer.
Children aged two to five are to young to understand and to decide that they will be seen by the whole world.
Oftens the parents would like thaht theirson or daughter will goining to be a star.
They push their children all the time and forget that the children has to be protected by the parents.
The young children should enjoy their young life without any stress and strict plans.
It is also dangerous to present your young child on television because there are nearly the same problems like in the social network.
It could be that the child later get mobbed by ohter children.
They are clearly more facts against advertising direted torward young children.
In my oppinion it should be not allowed because it is to dangerous for such young children and they could not decide by themselves.
First of all, I think we have to ask ourselfs, what kind of advertisement we want to forbid.
Is an advertisement, in which small children eat cereals, also an advertising toward young children?
Because adults could eat these cereals to though.
Or do we want to forbid only advertising for toys or things like that, which are clearly only meant for children.
Actually I think there is a wide range for interpretation, what kind of product is specifiacilly meant for young children, but I think there are some interesting aspects from both, the pro and the kontra site, which I'm going to talk about later on.
I agree in some kind with the statement, as the fact.
that young children can be influenced pretty well.
If your an adult you can also be influenced pretty well by the advertisements, but it's not really the same.
As a small child you're like a sponge.
Everything what was told to you, you immediately believe.
Same is it with the advertisements.
If the clown in the TV tells you, that this specific toy is the ultimate thing you've got to have, you want it.
So this is kind of unfair, because basically you can sell every kind of product to a small child, because it just has no clue if it's good or not; it just believes you.
I think this can also be really exhausting as a parent.
Imagine if your son or daughter, just saw an advertisement like this and it really want's this toy.
He would cry like hell and in the end, because he never gets calm, you simply have to buy it.
I don't know, if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because in some way the companies, who sell their products literally would have no way, to make their main target group buy their products.
Television advertising towards children is a common practise in the advertising industry.
Should it be allowed?
The pro argument is that it was always common in our society to advertise.
It would harm the economy because it`s part of our capitalistic liberal system.
How could a company advertise a product made for children if it wasn`t allowed?
Another argument is that it`s just using the same mechanisms that are also used at adults.
And even if it`s influencing: In the end, parents have to decide to buy a product and not children.
On the other hand stands the contra argument: Children can easier be influenced than adults.
They aren`t as experienced and even more important: as developed.
Also they can easily be scammed because of the same reasons.
In the end we have to find a solution somewhere between: We can`t just forbid advertising to a whole industry but it`s also clearly too influencing.
Why could we not reduce that?
It would be a good solution to advertise less agressive and more directed towarts parents.
The little children sitting on the couch in front of them a huge, bright flatscreen.
Wild conversations are coming out of the speakers.
The eyes of the kids are wide open.
The children are watching the advertising of the new shoes from the Geox company at her prefered channel Nickelodeon.
Those were the shoes the kids had seen all day while their watching television so its possible that these kids want to buy a pair of them.
But should advertisings directed towards young children not be allowed?
On one hand the children learn something.
The volontear to buy something that they had seen somewhere is a step in the direction of growing up.
To have a own opinion what I want and what I dont want makes out your caracter.
Also the advertising industry earn mutch with those wishes of the kids.
On Christmas and their birthdays alot of their gifts have their origin in those advertisings.
On the other hand the children are to young to understand the meaning of those advertisings.
This huge industry is not made for  those young candidats.
In my oppinion the children at this age shouldnt even watch television.
TV can be a relly big addiction.
Nowadays, the economy does everything to get in touch with hypotetical consumers.
They would like to influence young children with the expactation that their parents buy the product which seem to be the best way to make your child pleased.
But should it be allowed to set television advertise toward young children?
On the one hand, we should protect our children from advertisings by the reason that they are too young to understand what a advertise would like to achieve.
Another aspect that should be considered is, that children should be able to watch TV without wrong expactations from the world.
They should get known about the stuff that they are having at home firstly, before they will fancy the stuff which is cooler because they do not have it available.
On the other hand, a television advertise which is directed towards young people does not have such a bad impact on little children as some television shows are having.
It is a fact, that the modern marketing would not try to get in touch with the littlest enemies in our society, but they think about a huge amount of money which could be gained out of this persons.
To sum up, I think that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
Because I believe, that the final dicision is taken by the parents and if they think that there child should not have this game or something like that, they should not buy it.
As a parent you have to stay strongly by your opinion, because if you do not defend your on decision you will have lost all your impact on your child.
Television without advertising?
Seems utopian, you can not even watch half an hour before getting irrited by high volume and special effects ads who want you to buy a specific produt, but what about ads towards young children?
Should it be banned?
Some people argue that those ads should be banned because they harm the cildren in different ways: One of them is of course that those chidren have no option to realize if a product is healthy or not, or if they are any disadvantages.
Antother point is that a study has indicated that children are getting focused on brands and their products, like passivly manipulted.
They even buy this product probably more often than others.
Others arg


All in all this is a very controversial topic.
Personally I understand people who wants this ads banned, but I also think that a well educated child should be able to manage their income and nutrition by themselves when growing up
Televison advertising directed toward children should not be allowed?
In our socity the televison is a commen thing, who don't have a televison at home anymore?
A study shows that in Switzerland 80% of the people had a televison at home.
Also much more children sits on the coach and watch TV.
The televison not only shows children programm but also a lot of advertising directed toward children aged two to five.
Now we have to ask us, if this should be allowed or not.
If kids see advertising for children they could not know that advertising is often just for making money for the companies and often what they promise in the adverstising is unreal.
So they get a wrong view.
Also when the children see all the stuff, which the companies want to sell, they want these things too but the family can't effort all these things.
The children get an unrealistic expection from the reality.
But they could also dream a little bit of the things they see in the televison advertising and that could also be a good thing.
I think televison advertising directed toward young children should not be forbidden.
I think the children should have the opotunaty to dream of the things they see in the TV but I think also that it should have less advertising in TV directed toward children, because it shouldn't have too much influence in the lives of the children.
If you're a parent, you might have cought yourself watching a kids TV show with your kids.
Maybe you also comapred your childhood to your children's childhood.
And you probably came to the conclusion that you didn't have any TV shows at all, or if you did, then they were more fun out of your point of view.
However, many people often think that today's TV shows which are created for children are not as good anymore and don't have much meaning in the stories like they used to have.
Coming from a childhood with way less technology around than today and having all these memories where you played outside all summer with your friends, it can feel pretty unastisfying seeing children today hanging on their parent's phones.
TV shows make children feel attached to specific characters in the show, what makes them want to watch it everytime it comes on.
But is there any space left for their own fantasies if it's always already kind of premade?
Because if parents or family members don't interact enough with the child, it won't ever get the chance to have a chance to speak their fantasies out loud.
Reading a story to a child would be much better than n just leaving it sitting in front of the TV.
Because when stories are read to the child, there is way more contact between the child and family member.
Also, the child can get used to seeing letters and how they're pronounced.
An early contact with written words will help children to learn how to read much faster.
On the other hand, there's shows that are considered to be not funny or without meaining for any age group, so why not for young children as well?
Parents can always check on their children for what show they're watching and even make a list of TV shows that the child is allowed to watch and so forth.
Something that comes with watching TV shows on the TV is ads.
And as we all know, many brands chose to have some kind of animal that is their "brand-animal".
It has been proved that when brands chose an animal to be on their packages or ads, people will feel more comfortable with the brand because it seems like you can be friends with the animal.
Which so leads to the end product that you are more likely to keep this particular brand in mind.
Now think about what happens, when you show these kind of ads between TV shows that are for kids.
They are even more likely to be influenced, without them noticing obviously!
In conlusion, TV show don't have to be a bad thing if it isn't consumed too much.
Parents can make sure that the children are only watching shows that they have seen themselves or which they of that they're not bad.
I think this theme verry difficult to discuss because i haven't really a opinion.
I think that a tv programm shouldn't have many influence of the kids.
Because it is difficult to find a ritght programm.
So it is verry dificult.
Than the televission advertising can have wrong influence to a kid.
So i can agrre or desagree, because for me it is a theme which i never discuss with myself.
It should not be allowed because television adversiting is made by psychologists and they're aiming at manipulating the consumer.
A young child has not developped his mind enough to recognize the manipulation and so it has no chance to defend itself from the adversiting.
It's very unfair towards the children because as they grow older they are kinda drilled to consume the products from the adversiting.
As an example we could take Coca Cola: Coca Cola highlights the bottle by making the picture black and white and only the bottle colourful.
A young child only sees the bottle, it's focused and the child has no idea why.
So that's where the manipulation starts.
If the child sees this picture over and over again it will get used to it and see Coca Cola as something normal, something that belongs in his life, something he has discovered and he/she now loves it.
On the other side you could say that it's necessary for a company to manipulate its consumers if there's a lot of other companies dominating the market.
It's a strategy to get the consumer used to its products and gain profit.
In my opinion, it shouldn't be allowed.
The idea of gaining profit and manipulating consumers only to achieve something that's motivated by the human greed isn't going to bring us any further.
It's an idea straight from the capitalistic economy structures.
It doesn't learn our kids anything.
They even want our kids to be not thinking consumers.
So why should we let the companies manipulate our children?
"Advertising"

It is a fact that nowadays television advertising is a normal thing.
Everyone who watches television gets in touch with it.
But should it be allowed to be directed toward young children?
Television advertsing is a popular way to catch our attention.
Young children also watch television which is why they get confrontated with the advertising too.
This is a good thing for the people who advertise because if children see something they like they tell their parents and the parents buy it.
Furthermore, they should get in touch with advertisments because if they want to watch television they have to watch the advertisings too.
On the other hand it is not good if children see an advertisment for things like chocolate or any other kind of sweets because they would want to buy it although it is not healthy for them.
Advertisments often do not tell the truth, for example Kinder Schokolade, they say their chocolate is healthy because it conatins milk and nuts.
We know that it is not true but young children believe what the advertisments tell them and get fooled.
In conclusion I think that it should be allowed because although it has many negative aspects, it is a normal thing.
They will get confrontated with it anyways so why not at the age of two?
They can learn to not believe in everything the advertising promises and the earlier they learn it, the better.
I think that if they watch television they should also watch the advertising because when they grow up there will be television advertising directed to them too.
Advertisment are in general something bad.
The only reason they were created was to increase the comsuming society.
The persons who make those thing, want to see their production growing up and that's a normal thing in the world we live.
The problem is that they are making advertisments for the kids too.
It's not something that is acceptable.
The kids are to young to realize that what is on the screen isn't real.
If only they could do realistic advertisment, it wouldn't be so bad.
But everything that we see on these short videos are wrong.
Maybe not completly wrong but they make the thing better and nicer that in the reality.
The kids could be influenced by such a thing.
They began to think of things that aren't real.
They look at and they want those things just because it looks cool or because the video was funny.
They can't have their own mining about it.
Those advertisments are just a lost of time and are dangerous for the childrens.
I agree, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Becaus first i think a child in age of two don't even have to look tv.
Second a child in age of two plays one day with a toy and the next day it isn't anymore intrested.
Parents don't have to buy toys, becaus their children saw it on tv.
A little girl wants everything, that is pink.
Doesn't care what it is.
Little children don't know, what is good for them and waht not.
Their parents have to say what is good for their children.
Children in this age have to play outside and creat their own toys with their friends.
In the tv looks everything much better.
It's expensive and not good quality.
One week is a barbie in the television advertising and in the next week a ball, witch can change the collors.
And the barbie is already history.
The childrens cry for the barbie to get it.
And when the parents finaly buy it, they don't care after a few days.
If there would be no television advertising for young children, they wouldn't need this things, becaus they never heard about it.
The children in age of two can't buy the toys becaus the have no money, so their parents have to buy it.
If the children can't buy it, the advertising shouldn't be for young children.
They should go out and play with trees, animals, nature and their friends.
Children should learn new friends know.And not seat in front of a tv.
Actually, the advertising for products which are concepted for these young children is not for these young children, it's for their parents.
The children can't buy the products anyway, because they're too young and don't have any money or anything.
So why would someone say that this type of advertising should be banned?
I have two ideas: Either, the children shouldn't see these advertised products, because the parents will get annoyed by them wanting all the new stuff they saw in the television advert, or the children should be raised without having to watch all these dumb adverts because they may influence them in a bad way.
But I think, these two reasons are both bad, because if you are a parent not wanting your children to be influenced by all these adverts, you should just stop them from watching tv advertising, it's very simple.
There are many strange things being advertised in the televsion nowadays, and it would be unfair if firms who make toys and other stuff for young children would be banned from tv but all these perverted dating sites have no trouble at all.
The advertising is for the parents anyways, because the children can't buy anything in the first place, so why ban something that harmless (or if not harmless, that easy to avoid) as advertising for children in a world with so many much more fucked up things?
I Think, this question is of no importance, seeing so many much more horrible things going on on the planet than advertising for young children...it's like comparing a death of a close friend to a spilled cup of tea.
The television and the big concerns use promotions and television advertisings to get the attention of people.
The promotions show the product and for what it is used for.
They are often loud, coloury and catching, so you want to have the product too.
But should televison advertisings directet toward children be allowed?
Adults, if they se a promotion, know what they need, what it is udes for and if its unnecessery for their life.
They have expierience and can decide if they want to spend their money on this product or not.
Kids or children dont have this expierence.
They want to have things that are loud, funny and coloury.
So they feel very attractet to things wich are promoted in the television, espiecally things to play with.
Children dont know what it means to earn money and to have the contingency to buy things you like.
They are bored with old things and alway want to have new things And then, if they see a product they want to play with, they are going to ask their parents for it.
If it isnt a big thing the parents would probably say yes to it.
But if they feel like its unnecessery, they will say no.
The kid is going to be crying and disappointed.
So the concerns used it to lock the childs attention and the feeling to play with it.
The concerns dont care if the parents have money for it and if the family has a good wealth.
They want to earn money and thats it.
I think promotions for things like musicals, festivals, films etc.
are allowed because its more easily to decide if someone likes it or not.
But promotions for kid products usally dont tell the truth.
They are over produced and just use the naivity of children.
The television a place infron of which a lot of people spend their freetime.
Not only adults but young children too.
These minors sit infront of that evolutionary box because their parents placed them infront of it, while they were too busy to look after their own kids.
Adverts, something that influences mankind strongly.
Not only in their thinking wise but in what way they handle stuff and in what they say.
You don't only find adverts in newspapers and on billboards but on TV too.
Advertising changes your state of mind and persuades you to buy things you've never planned on buying.
But mostly, television advertising directed toward children are about toys.
So if a child sees a new lego car in the TV it naturally will want it.
Because it looks so cool in TV and everybody has it, at least that's what the advert says.
The kids will beg their parents to buy them the new 'oh so cool' toy and they will cry over it for hours until ther parents finally can't hold their cool anymore, give in and buy the thing their child wants.
So this brings the following question upon us: Sould television advertising directed toward young chidren (aged two to five) be allowed or not?
In the last paragraph I told you reasons why it shoulnd't.
And additionally it can be said that companies try to sell their stuff even already to kids.
Their manipulation is already directed toward people of a young age.
But that's what the selling business relies on: manipulation into buying more and more things.
So that's why I'm not completely against TV advertising directed toward children aged two to five.
Adverts are something todays market relies on.
And the adverts I've been talking about might be seen by young children, but I think they are mainly meant to influence the parents.
So if this kind of advertising would be prohibited then all kind of adverts would have to be forbidden and that's just not the world live in.
The economy sector would not work without advertising.
Television advertising toward young children.
Young children are learning a lot.
In early years they basically pick up everything they see and it stays in their memorys.
So, is it really a good idea to let children watch advertisements on television?
As told before young children learn very cuickly and especially; when it comes to languages.
So hearing lot's of speaking would possibly help them with getting more confortable with speaking their language.
Depending on the education they receive of their parents, children can be tought, that they won't get everything they want from seeing all the advertisements.
For example when a child sees lots of advertisements of toys and it want's them all, it is the parents task to not buy them everything.
Buying the children all the things they see in the advertisement, leads them to be spoiled and you later may recognize that as a bad side of their characters.
An advertisement, that shows stupid content can also influence children in a bad way.
They can't decide yet what is true and what is wrong, so they may believe wrong content, which wont help them when it comes to education.
In my opinion letting children watch advertisements isn't the best thing for them.
Watching television in general has to be done in the right measure.
If they spend to much time in front of the television they wont learn some really important things, like knowing the nature.
I am lucky that my parents always told me to brush my teeth during the advertisement, shown in the serie i always watched before sleeping.
Television advertising for children could be a way to more independence and responsibility or it could be a bad influence for them.
Firstly television advertising is a method to influence people into buying something.
So that means you need money.
Now, if you make television advertising directed toward young children you want them to buy something, right?
But for that they would have to understand what it is about.
I'm not sure if a two years old undertands that.
Even if the child would understand it, how will it buy the product?
It can't.
The parents would have to do that.
I don't believe parents would want to buy whatever the child wants.
Secondly when you have money to buy yourself products you are more independent.
If we could and would teach this earlier to our children maybe they would use their money more responsible later on.
They would learn how to use the money given to them and not to throw it out of the window, for example using it for drugs, alcohol, etc.
It might help them to focuse on other things and not to feel controlled all the time by their parents.
In conclusion they could turn out to be more responsible but if they have that much independence early in life they wouldn't get to know the limits.
They just learn how to buy things, whatever they want.
It's a possibility to get addicted to this, and I do not think that parents want shopaholics as their children.
In the end I do not believe it's a good way to learn how to be more responsible with money.
Children that little do not understand all that is going on in the advertisers.
And they could not buy the product.
The possibility of them getting addicted to shopping or just being irresponsible with money is just to high of a risk for me.
So, no, I do not think it should be allowed.
Everytime we are watching TV there is some advertising.
We all know the situation when the film we are watching is interruped on its best scene just for about ten minutes of advertisement.
But we are adult people so we are used to it but it really shocks me when I see my little child watching Tv an then there comes a advertisement for Caprisonne and the little girl there tells her dad that she wants to go to school as supergirl.
So her dad agrees and gives her a Caprisonne.
And then the next time I go to the market my daugther asks me to buy her Caprisonne so that she can go to school as supergirl.
So is the advertisement towards young cildren a good idea?
No it is a bad idea in this world advertisement is everywhere.
So the earlier they get used to it the better because then they can lern that it isnt all that correct what they tell in advertisements.
And anyway you can not avoid children to see them because they are a part of television nowadays.
You would have to create a law that forbids advertisement in the Tv shows of children but that would not be a guarant that they do not see any of those.
Because when they are watching a film with their parents they may as well see some advertisement.
So we should rather decide a law that is forbidding children to watch tv what i think is as complicatet to do as the otherone besides i don`t think that the people  would ever confirm to such a law.
They are also learning to not believe all the things that are said in television and to think more critic about our world.
That could also help us to grow a more critic generation who is able to create a better civilisation.
Yes it should be banned because these advertisements are telling the young people how to live and so they are not open to find their own way anymore.
Because they always see some hetero peoples and so they think that they have to be just like them and so they do not even see the gayway of live.
it could also developp eating disorders because the young gils want that bad to be like th ones in the advertisement that they start to maybe throw up after havin eaten or to stopp eating anymore.
So these advertisements are killing our young generation and we as the generation of parents schould do anything we can to keep them save so I say it would be alll correct to bann the advertisement directed towards children.
My own opinion is parted because I think that there are good arguments on both sides but personally I think that it would be helpfunl to bann
Should television advertising be directed toward young children (aged two to five)?
Television advertising is advertisement on the television, which can be broadcasted any time a day.
Advertisement is used to inspire people to buy things or to react to politics,or so.
Children at the age of two to five are not able to build up their own opinion because their to young.
Children do what they want or what they are told to in these young years of their lifes.
Advertisement is only good if the content is also helpful for these children.
For example: what every parent wihes for is an intelligent child.
So if the kid watches television and an advertisement for a laptop comes on and they see how much fun these children in the atvertise have, they want to have it too.
What the child doesn't realize is that the laptop has the function to teach how to count, how to read and has games to train addition of numbers.
In 
the best case: the child goes to the parent and they buy it.
But as you can tell in the former example, the child just wants to have it because he sees how much fun other childern have with it and not because of its functions.
And that's the problem.
Cildren at the age of two or five can be easily influenced by the background of an advertise.
They just want to have what looks fun.
So instead of a laptop, which teaches you useful things, it also could have been a violent game.
I agree with the statement.
I think children shouldn't be watching a lot of television.
They should be out and play in the sand and their friends.
Children shouldn't be influenced by andvertisement so young.
First of all, they need to learn to have an own opinion.
Television advertising is for this technology world we live today completly normal, the most poeple even don't know how it was whithout advertising.
Maybe it's okey that we elder people see advertising daily, because we are already grown up and can decide on our own how we react about it.
But is it good that we try to manipulate young children with television advertising?
First, I will have a look at the argument against televison advertising directed toward young children.
I think it's time we lose for making advertising for children, because they don't understand the message of the advertising.
We talk about very young children aged two to five so just this statement is sick.
Of course childre are easylier to manipulate them with
I agree with this statement because in my opinion children don't see the television advertisings as we see them.
They don't know if its true or false, what they say in the television.
And because they believe it all they want to want to buy the barbie doll, witch you can feed for example even if they have 3 others at home.
Or when you're in a store and your child wants to buy the chocolate chip cookie instad of a healthy joghurt because they saw it on tv .
So that the television advertising  have a big influence in the life of the children and also parents because they have to pay it in the end.
Also small children can't see the difference of a television series and a televisoin advertising.
They think the film or series is still on so that their focus stayes.
So that they become to new targets of markenting.
Every company does them and tries to get you tu buy their product.
In our capitalistic world you have to do this to survive as a company but I think children should not be part of this.
Because they want to get to the money of the parents and the children are just a way to get to it.
Also I have to mension that parents can control it in a way.
They can do rules so that the children do not watch television all day long and so they aren't effected by the television advertisings.
So that in the end the parents have to point the finger at themselves a little if they allow their children to watch tv all day, if they have seen a game in the television adertisings and now want to buy it now.
Television advertising directed toward young children - allowed or not?
young cjildren are growing physically and physisch.
Not just their bodys develop themselves, also their brains are in one of the most important process of life.
Children want to explor the world.
They are  fascinated of the environnement and animals.
They love to play with other children outside.
Spending time with their parents and siblings is such an important thing in their lifes which should be saved fot the rest of their lifetime.
So why should their be any advertising directed toward young children when they aren't used to watch television?
Stay at home  while watching television isn't that good for children - especially for the younger ones.
In reality is this the most common activity of younger children.
Why parents let their kids doing something like that isn't understandable.
Maybe they are to lazy do play or entertain them or just haven't any time.
The problem is that children who watch television soaps are doing nothing - they are inactive and are just consuming stuff.
The affecting of childrens from all this consummed television shows is giant.
They influence them in their opinion and in their young  personality.
As usually children want to improve the "big ones".
They want to be like their parents, neighbours - just like any older person which are included in their life.
Children aren't abel to see the diffrence between good and bad personalities.
It is not a bad thing at all but it shows as how important it is with whom children are going through this very sensitive part of life.
Advertising will creat desires.
We can not say if they will affect the little ones good or bad yet but we can expect.
Most of the people would say they will not and so I.
Parents should decide what if their children are needy and what exactely they need to can not live whitout it.
Advertising just make unimportant desires.
First of all I`m not sure, if children, aged two to five, are even interested in television commercials.
I think they just want to watch their children-TV-series and nothing else.
For the case that the kids would pay attention to the advertisings,they could get manipulated very easy, because young humans always belive everything without doubting it.
If there is a Superman commercial which tells yout that this plastic Superman has superpowers, the children will believe it, because they don`t know how to separate reality from fantasy or imaginations.
After the little kids have watched like five different commercials, they want to have all of the toys and stuff that they just saw on the screen.
In this case, parents would be pressured by their respective children to buy all those things immediately.
So the parents are know struggling with themselves, wheter they should buy all the toys for their kids and make them happy, even when they know that they don`t have enough money or that their children will lose their interest in this toys after maybe just one month of playing with them or don`t buy all this stuff and make their kids crying for days and being called rude parents in the entire neighbourhood.
Because of the fact that the parents of young children would have such a dilemma at home, I think for myself, that television advertising should be forbidden through out daytime broadcasting.
In my opinion, the television channels could be allowed to present children advertising during primetime broadcasting, because at this time, there are just older people watching like adults and teenagers.
If they would see a good children commercial, they could find an idea for a birthday- or a christmaspresent for their little children whitout being pressured from all possible sides.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged tow of five) should not be allowed

Children in age of two to five do not know what the advertising in television want.
All what children see in televisison they want to have.
But it can not be not allowed for companis because afterwords we do not know which new toys there are and than no advertising should be allowed and not just advertising for children.
First of all they are to young to know why companis make television advertising.
It should be not allowed because companis know how to make children that they want this new toy.
As an parent you can not say no because there children sees other children how have this new toy and they do not understand why that they do not can have this.
Altough we all felt in a advertising once.
We can not say the companis that they it is not allowed to make television advertising.
Also adult know the feeling if they see something new.
When adults eat something new they want to know how to cook it.
So it is normal that we always want the new one.
But without advertising there is no market.
So we can not not allowed it.
If we have a compani we also want that others buy much of our stuff.
To sum up i think it is a problem from the parents.
They should look that there children do not watch as much television that they see so much advertising.
Parents should also look that there children appreciat what they have.
But not just children should be careful also adults have to be careful to not fell in ba an advertising.
Directed advertising television toward children is not that bad, because in their future they will be watching the Televisions, so they can't help it but see it in their young age.
Espacially when their older siblings are already watching the Television.
So when they come by and see them doing or better watching, then they also want to sit next to them and watch with them because i think older siblings are like idols for yonger siblings.
Although those positive aspects i think it should not be allowed.
Because children in that age are exploring the world, life and starting to question everything.
But when their in frot of the Television they might think, that the answers, that they get from the Television might be right.
Well very often those answers aren't right because it's the Television and they often say a lot of things, that aren't really right,just to earn money, as everyone know.
Well every adult.
Because they already experienced a lot of thing in their childhood and that wasn't from the Television, that they get to know all that stuff, no from playing in the garden, get hurt while playing soccer and so on.
And i also think that it shouldn't be allowed, because they could watch things that they shouldn't see, like prostitution or more vulgar movies or series.
So they start to question it and i don't think, that it is a good age with two to five to know that stuff.
There are also a lot of movies where an age is given that says, if you can watch it or not.
Like it says 16 so you have to be sixteen to see it.
And i think thats a good thing, so it is unterteilt in certain sections.
But a really inportant point is, that children aged two to five can't alway read.
Of corse there are some kids, that can but practically always they can't.
So perhaps their parents or older siblings aren't at home and then they will see those things, because they couldn't read the warning.
So what i would say to the parents of young children: "Parents always be there for your children."
Young children are very naive and don't have their own opinion yet.
They have to get some things teached befor they are ready for this world and they have to get a certain amount of maturity.
But until they have this maturity they are very influencable.
Influencing a child in a bad way is wrong.
But isn't this exactly what TV adds are doing?
Well it depends on many factors.
First of all, is the adversment influencing the child in a wrong way?
Influening s child isn't allways just wrong.
You have to influence a child somehow - Most people call it parenting.
That isn't wrong.
You have to influence a child to teach him whats good and bad.
So if the add doesn't infleunce the child in a ady way I think its totaly okay.
But adds aren't allways good for a child.
Getting a kid to buy toys just because it was super cool in the adversement isn't right.
And "brainwashing" them with some "propaganda adds" (political adds) is even worse.
In genereal, the lack of expirience and the innocents of a child shouldn't be used against them.
You can't ban all adds from TV but you can surely censor them so young children can't be influenced in a bad way.
And if you can't do that because of the freedome of speech, it's allways the parents decision if their children should watch TV and see these adds.
Should television advertising directed toward young children be illegal?
Little children are highly influentual.
Seeing an interesting game or play tool in an advertisement makes them go crazy for it.
This is problematic because it will end in an argument with their parents.
On the other hand side shouldn't children such a young age be watching television often anyways.
In my eyes are not only the avertisements playing a problematic role but the whole television-watching-actiity itself.
Children should be playing outside.
There are a lot of things children shouldn't be watching and as long as they are not watching it, there is no problem.
What I want to say with that, is that parents are responsible what their children are watching.
Advertisements should be directed towards adult people anyways.
These people are the one with the money and the one who will eventually purchase a certain item or tool.
So I think it is a clever move to make advertisements directed to adults rather than little children.
But it shouldn't be illigel to make advertisments for children.
I'm not a big fan of too many prohibits.
And advertisemetns are not harming anyone.
The only problem I see is that the children will start to complain that they want a certain game they have seen in a specific advertisement, but good parents will get over this situation.
Today it is normal that television advertising is commmon and in every break of a film for example there are a lot of advertisings.
For some people it is interesting for other just disturbing.
But how is it for young children?
Do they look interested to them or don't they understand anything?
Therefore should they be forbidden for them or not?
First i want to talk about what the television advertising contains.
Some are just about clothes or some new eating stuff.
The producer make this kind of advertising to get as much as possible publicity so they can sell the new stuff to the people.
That's one of the easiest way to get to the peolpe.
Other advertisings are about new store which have to get public.
Than there are also advertisings about health.
They tell you about how you can live as healthy as possible or the advertisings talk about health asegurations.
Then there are the advertising who want to show you how thin you can be or how you can find the love of your life.
And then there are the disgusting one.
This kind of advertisings are about strippers, sex or sextoys.
Do the parents want their children watch this kind of advertising?
I don't think so.
Luckily most advertising that are disgusting came late in the night when the children should be sleeping.
That's why theres no problem if the young children watch advertisings.
There's nothing dirty and they don't understand most advertising.
But because of advertisings the children could get a "bad" immage.
Maybe when they see every time really thin models in the advertisings they want to be also so thin when they grown.
They don't know nothing else.
They learn also a lot of wrong stuff and honestly advertisings are unusable.
They don't make you more intelligent.
They just manipulate you.
That's why I think that for young children should be forbidden to watch advertising.
They manipulate our children from the beginning no matter if they understand them or not.
Because passing the time they will understand them but they wouldn't see that they're getting manipulated.
In my opinion advertisings are somesting for adults and they shouldn't be shown in children channels.
Advertisements can be utterly exasperating when watching one's favorite TV series.
But even though we might think they have no effect on us, they fill us with considerable subliminal information that influences our ways of seeing this specific product and other daiily life matters as well.
And if it does that to us adults and teenagers, we can only fathom the effect it has in our youngest generation.
My personal opinion is that children in such an early stage in their lives should spend as less time in front of a rectangular screen as possible and figure out how everything works, be it a toy or their own body.
Now, coming to the matter of television advertising directed directly toward children of that specific age group.
Such ads can have a rather negative effect on the children, they see some older kids playing with toys or presenting the product of the ad, and they crave for that very same item.
Children can become extremel spoilt once they see children slightly older to use the product in the ads, or even worse when they see that even their friends now bought that very toy.
If the parents don't agree on buying it, the child will be offended and it influences their character in later life.
I'd rather have the chlildren find out where their interests lie, gaining a few experiences that makes it clear to them what they like and what they don't, and knowing that then deciding on their own what they'd like to buy.
I've seen plenty of children on which such ads have had enormous effect on how they act and think, and I feel like we should move towards a world in which we try to prevent such things from happening.
What parents could do now is to lessen the amount of time their child spends with the television, maybe even let them watch DVDs instead of TV shows.
This subject had been often discussed, if young children should watch television or not.
I think also it depends in wich country we are, in some countries there isn't a problem with that, in other that's a big problem.
First of all I think, the young children have better things to do than watching television.
The time you're spending on the television, is a time wasted.
The young children should go out and paly with other children.
When I was young I always went outdoors and played with the children in the street.
The chidlren, who are so young, they shouln't spend so much time on the television.
An other suspect is physical, I mean the young children, they watch TV so close on the screen and this isn't good for the eyes.
They are really fragile and it's not worth to damage them, because the chidlren want to watch television.
For example, a friend of mine, in the young age, he had really problems with his eyes, and his parents didn't know what it was , so they went to the doctor and and after five minutes  the doctor said, if my friend would watch a lot of television,because the lightning of the screen isn't healthy for our eyes.
Since than my friend really stopped watching series or something else.
Instead he went more often out with his friend or he read a lot, That's why he became today a very good writer, maybe one day he's gonna be a very good journalist.
Like I mentionned, the young children coud read books and do something in their lifes, which they can profit of.
On the other side, the children can learn from television.
It also depends what you're watching or which serires.
For example there is one serie, it called Dorie and there can chidlren learn speaking english, or some sentences.
So it doesn't have to be always bad for the children, and so I think,it shouln't be forbidden.
I think just the parents have to look after their children, that they have both of them.
When you're watching television you often can see spots or advertising with children where they have to present a product.
This can start in a very young age for example with two years.
Athough it looks very sweet, is it good and fair for the children?
When a child is so young it cannot decide whether it wants to do that or not.
The parents think they know what good for their child is and say what it has to do.
It doesn't matter if it wants to do it or not.
The children which have to be part of a spot aren't often happy with doing it but they don't have a choice.
Critics say it isn't good for them when they have to do something they don't like to.
Children should do what makes fun and shouldn't be working in a studio for someone they don't know.
In the television you can't see how it really is.
You just see a perfect life and moment but this isn't real.
In reallife the children aren't happy with it and must do it although they don't want to.
It's just a fake image in the television advertising which persuade people to buy something they don't need.
The good thing about it is that they get many experiences by doing it.
They can do such cool and funny things and not just very normal and boring activities they do the rest of their time.
For the person who wants to sell something it's very good because a lot of people which see the advertising think it's very sweet and usable so they buy it.
You can get a lot of money when you sell something by using a sweet child.
I agree definitive with the statement that this advertising should be forbidden.
For me children with the age of two to five are to young to be in the television and to work in a studio.
When I was a child i enjoyed it to be outdoor or to play with someone else in my age.
I would never like to make advertising or do whats other people say I should do.
The television should definitive stop with showing their audience a fake world where everything is so perfect.
In reallife the things aren't so perfect and peaceful and the children aren't so happy with it and do this voluntarily.
Children should have fun and play something and shouldn't do advertising because it isn't good and enjoyable for them.
The influence of advertisment on kids ist horrible.
You can really controll their opinion, since for trend, wishes and shopping wishes.
That's how the most kids trends began and this trends are allways huge.
That's the same point why u should allowed to show the clips.
The kids are an importent market to sell.
When thy grow up with their mind spread with those things the're used to it and don't want live without that.
That's why the stuff will be long on the market and a good selling thing.For the one who sells the things with those clips it's important that it stays allowed to show advertisment.
For the kids and their parent it make to go shopping so much harder.
If the kids are really in the stuff you can't bring them away from this.
I think advertisment is usefully for the stores, but not fair for the kids, because they can't diffrengiate the advertising and what the seller want.
They just like it and want it and that's really really dangerous, because we don't know why the stores exactly sell the stuff to kids and maybe they do bad things to them.
That's why I think advertising should be not allowed.
Should the television advertising directed toward young children be allowed ?
This questions is very tricky to answer because there are on both sides good arguments for and against the advertising.
If a advertsinig with young children should gets directed then you need the "Okay" from hteir parents and if they agree with the plans of the directors there should be no problems.
But it also can be that the parents have not enough money and don't want it but have to , and because of this there are huge discussions.
On the one side is an television advert with babys more cute or brings the message for a product more to the customers then just a slogan.
But the baby knows at that time not what it's going to do and this is a very important argument for this discussion.
The parents must give the "Okay" but do they really know that their child is going to be exposed for all people around hte world who do watch this advert ?
But I also think that the adverts with babys are no danger for the children's future because they just walk around and look cute so is this argument not that good as other ones.
I'm not an expert in television advertising with young children but in my opinon this television advertising shouldn't be taken that serious as the critics do, at the end no one gets hurt and everyone gets their peace, and so I think this television advertising directed toward kids should stay like it is now and shouldn't be changed because the way it is now is a good one.
Television advertising for children between two to five 

Every kids, teenagers and the rest of the people love to watch television and on the TV we dont only watch movies and news.
There are also advertisment.
So should children between two and five years old watch advertisment.
Firstly, watching a food advertisment makes a child to eat something.For example if there is a new lindt chocolate advertisment on TV and your son or daughter is watching it, I am sure that this child has appetite to eat one of these chocolates.
Most of the kids are starting to cry.
Because they want a chocolate right now and that is a problem.
Secondly, most of the advertisment are about toys.
While the chiildren are watching TV, the parents be sure that their child want to have one of these toys.
For example when you are going shopping with your child, your child will  see the teddy bear trom the advertisment.
By the way children have a very good memory.
As first the child will pick the teddy bear and ask daddy and mummy if they could buy for him.
Most of the parents will say no.
How will the situation looks like.
This child will start to cry and makes a lot of noise in the shop.
So you cant slap your son or daughter so you are forced to do something.
Finally, there are also advertisments which aren't thought for children.
For example an advertisment about how to shave your legs.
Why should your child look this advertisment?
My friends sister, i think she is four years old.
Once when the parents went to work, the girl was alone with my friend at home.
While my friend was in her room, the girl went to the bathroom and took the racer out of the cupboard.
Suddenly my friend heard that something fell down.
She run to the bathroom and the she saw her sister with a racer in the hand and the racer gel on the floor.
I think sometime when kids watch advertisment they try things out and get in trouble, which isnt nice.
In my opinion all children after 5 years old are allowed to watch ads but under the age of
Today we ask the quesion: "Should TV advertising towards young children be forbidden?"
A Fact that is for this statement is that young children should' be involved in such things yet.
Young children can be easesly manipulated for someone's needs and advertising could be seen as something similar to manipulating.
The main reason of advertising is to convince the consumer to buy their product.
So children could be heavely affected by this and because many parents often try to fullfill every wish of their kids, they are affected by it too.
A Point wich speaks against this statement, are the basics of Economicliberation.
Almost every western country has free economics.
You can't just forbid the Companies to make advertisments.
It's clear that the companies have to let their costumers know, what products they have and convince them in every way possible.
Every Company has to do that for surviving and that the Economic system can work.
We also have to talk about the actual problem of this topic.
The Problem isn't the fact that there are advertisments for Children.
The real Problem here is that parents let the kids get affected by something like that, because they let them look TV too long.
We wouldn't have this problem, when parents wouldn't let their Chilren look TV all day long.
So it's nonsense to sarch the solution in the companies.
And the last argument states my oppinion towards this topic.
When parents complain that their children get affected by TV advertisments too heavely, it's just pushing the debths from them.
Parents should just reduce the TV consume of their Children and the problem would be gone.
So in my oppinion the question should be different and the solution to the Problem should be searched elsewhere.
Advertising is a common thing on all platforms, such as on the web, on television or even in real life.
With advertising, platforms can offer more to a cheaper price.
Everyone gets a piece of the cake.
Advertisments always reffer to a certain age-class.
Even advertisements directed to young children are common.
Young children look TV solely to be entertained and not to be advertised.
Advertising "uses" people for their purpose.
Ads wants people to buy.
Children do not know what they are watching.
They don't know that an Ad is an Ad.
So they get brainwashed in a way.
These children then ask their parents to buy.
So in a way the Ads use the children to make the parents buy stuff.
All this could lead to a bad relationship between the children and the parents and even to arguments.
The child could start to feel alone and might grow up in hatred just because of advertisments

I agree with the statement.
Television advertising shouldn't be allowed to be directed towards young children because they are not old enough to understand what advertising is about and how it works.
Raising up a child is already hard enough for the parents and it should not be influenced by others.
If young children should be the target of advertisments is a very crucial and debatable topic.
People that are against it tend to say that already at an very young age children get influenced by big advertisment companies.
The children can often be easily manipulated and the resulsts are that the parents need to spend money on products that the children mostly don't need and the joy won't even last for long, cause these children same as the adults will fall for newer and better products when they come out and they won't be able to have enough and wil never stop craving for bigger, better and newer products.
children shouldn't be influenced and manipulated at this very young age, they should be playing outside, socialize and being educated and not a consumer victim at the age of 5.
By not knowing what exactly it means to buy, spend money and own a product those children that are targeted will get a bad understanding of earning, owning and buying.
On the other hand we live in a consumer world where our needs get mostly fullfilled by products which is debatable if it's good but thats how we work.
So shouldn't those children be confronted with the true World at an young age the learn how to live with it.
They could develop skills and a feeling at an very young age what advertisments really are and getting a better understandning of products and advertisments.
In a faster grwoing world it seems logical that children should be confronted with the ups and downs and start to learn about them and how to  live with them.
Nevertheless children should be allowed to be children to play learn and have fun and not being influenced by big companies at the age of four.
What those companies do is brainwashing by using nice colors, sounds and children to play in the commercials.
At this young age the Children don't have an understanding of what they're watching and that what they're watching should make them buy stuff.
Because of this and many other reasons I highly discourage the advertisment of young children aged two to five.
In our generation, social media, television and of course with all that, advertising is very popular.
Companies target diffrent age groups depending on the products they are trying to sell.
It is a very popular buisness nowadays.
Should it tough be allowed to target young children, with television advertising?
With technology always progressing and nowadys in many families, both parents having full time jobs, it is quite comman for young children to often sit in front of the television.
Companies can easily profit from a situation like this and advertise specific products directly to the interested children.
I seems perfectly planned out.
The parents have very little time, with their full time jobs, so it would be ideal for the children to choose their own toys and items that they want, so they can be always be intertained.
Many though believe that television advertising is very bad.
Because it would prove and  show, that in our society more children are sitting infront of their tvs all day.
This would make them a perfect target for advertising.
Parents do not have the time to intertaine their own children, so the television does that for them.
Many also fear that television advertising could expose children to certain topics far to advanced for their age and knowledge.
I personally believe television advertising is not per say bad.
I do believe though that perents have should have a strict overview, of what they let their children watch.
I also believe that this topic, just show how little time pernts have for theit children and how little attention they give them.
So personnaly television advertising wouldn't be a topic, it perents would just do more with their children, like for instance going out, instead of staying in.
Television is a big part of our childhood and so is advertisement.
Parents hate it, because it causes exhausting fights against crying children, wanting that one product they saw in TV.
But is it reasonable to not allow advertisement directed toward young children?
Every parent taking part of this discussion would be screaming YES loudly, heavily relieved.
If they let their children watch spongebob, they always have to check wether the ad is already over or not to avoid the exhausting drama of kids wanting new stuff all over the time.
It would be so much easier without this stupid ad.
But let's be honest, we live in a world full of advertisement.
The TV is only a small part of all those firms wanting us to buy their stuff.
Wherever we go, there's always ad and we are so used to this that we don't even look at all those placards, writings and short video clips.
It's an illusion if you want to bring up your children wihtout the affection of advertising.
And I know it might be very hard for parents stopping their children from wanting everything, but it's not only the TV that is the main problem.
If you take your child shopping once, it will be horrifying to walk past all this choccolate without buying any, while everyone stares at you because your child screams loudly.
We live in a generation of consummation and one of the most important things to teach our children is how to deal with all those amazing things you could buy everywhere.
If it was forbidden to publish ad directed toward kids, you will have problems to deal with them screaming at the age of 10.
There is no TV without advertisement as they grow old.
We live in this world and thats the way advertisement tries to trick us all, so we have to teach our children the ability of saying no and being capable to not buy everything that seems cool from their very first year.
There may be parents who want to save their children from all this consume and who would love to watch TV without advertisement, but I think there are ways for them to avoid this.
And if you really want to do good to your child, don't even let it watch TV too much from two to five.
Let it play in the woods!
Statement: Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowe.
This is a very important question.
I think there are many diffrent arguments with pro and contra opinions and it could be a very intresting disscusion between some parents and teenager.
First of all i think the children are so young and movements are very important for their body.
They need to go out and play with some other children.
They need the fresh air and they have to have fun.
But the parents have an important rule.
They decide when they go out and play some football, they decide when they stay at home and watch some television...
But actually to watch some television isn't so bad.
You can learn some great things.
For example there is a show in which a little girl explanes some things in english or sometimes they show how to life.
In the television they are always friendly, happy, helpfully and they have fun.
So the little children can learn something but they have to know: It's not real.
The fazit is, the children have to move but it's also good to watch some television.
(But not to often) Maybe you can allowed the children to watch some tv when they've done somthing really good...
Watching your favorite tvshow as a kid, who doesn't remember that ?
But with watching your favorite show also comes those advertisingbreaks in between and that's what I'm going to be discussing today.
Furthemore the statement "Television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed".
Let's first discuss reasons why I agree: One reason why I agree with this statement is, that children in that agegroup are very impressionable and are influenced by the things and people around them,television marketing is one of them.
I used to always want the newest barbie displayed on tv and used to beg my mom to buy it.
Another reason why I agree's that it prolongs the time of a movie or a tv show, so the child spends more time overall in front of the tv, which could be used more produvtively by playing, hanging out with other kids or doing sports.
Another reason why I agree's because this supports consumerism and the need in children wanting new toys or snacks for example.
A reason why I disagree's because people are usually always surrounded by advertisments wether it be on the street, on youtube or at the cinema and at one point or another you have to learn to handel that and not always be seduced by advertising.
For example pretty much every website has some ads on it nowadays.
A reason to disagree's that tvshows need to make money somehow and the way most of them make money is through advertising.
Whithout it you wouldn't have as many free tvchannels.
In conclusion I think that television advertising for children in that agegroup shouldn't be allowed, because I think that's best for the children as well as their parents and their wallets as shown by the points above.
There is a great deal of advertisement in televison programms all over the world showing the greatest, newest and best things we do not know we want yet.
These advertisements influence us on a subconsces level and even if we do not want so change the way we live.
Should it be allowed to manipulate the youngest of our species with these advertisements that show ous heavly photoshoped images of a world we live in?
Our society is programmed on being consuming as much as possible.
We always want to be up to date with the newest trends and do not want to be left behind.
This is how capitalism works.
To get such a well trained society, companies realised that they would have to influence the youngest members of our society, the childrend aged two to five.
There is no morning programm for children without advertisements of the must have "Dora the Explorer" writing book and matching to that the new backpack that will surely make you the coolest kid in school.
Every mother or father that does not allow his kid to buy any of this marchandise sure has to be evil and not loving his or her child in the eyes of the companies and the children themselves.
Which demonic parent does not want his child to be accepted and tollerated in school?
But children do not have a good sense of distinguishing between necessary and useless things in life.
If they do not get there seventh action hero doll that now is able to handle one weapon more than the old one, they do not understand the world anymore and get angry.
Therefore we should protect them from the companies that only want profit no matter what and bann advertisements directed to young children in televison
I disagree since that is perfectly fine, it's good to raise the hole world to a hoard of consume and profit seeking bastards as the most are now.
The best would be to advertise about weapons, how they could improve the amount of CO2 emission or how cool it's to be gay.
Maybe you could also advertise the new beaty clinic they opened some villages away since y'all are some really ugly bastards and the way to real beauty takes a very long time so why not start right after toddlers age.
You often find advertisments about fast food, that's actually not very good in my opinion since fast food gives these children the idea that you had to have something "food" like to get your toxics and chemicals.
That's very unefficient, they should advertise for Lolipops for example.
Lolipops maybe not with some flavours like cherry, strawberry or apple but maybe E110, E140 or maybe you could even get some sort of starter pack where you get everything from E100-E180 and then they could sell E181-E200 as an expansion or a DLC.
But no one seems to see the actual problem: How are these kiddos gonna buy some stuff if they don't have credit cards or something.
The advertisement companies should provide a system where childern (2-5) could give their stroller or things like that as an insurance so the may buy the sniper they wanted always and give billy the neighbours kid a real smooth headshot.
But you see this will always go further since now you gave away the stroller for your sniper riffle but no one told you that you may need hydrochloric acid or a good shovel to hide the body...  
Now you should be able to see the pros and cons: The pro is: you actually enriches the lives of thousands of children by making it special and they start to feel better since they get this "I'm still alive" feeling because now everyone is hunting lolis and shooting around but your major problem is: You will always have to invent something new the keep it going like after the snipe comes the hydrochloric acid or after some E number lolies you have to find a way to bind sulfur so they could get it intravenous, this means you need to create jobs to find new things to maintain entertaining them.
Actually just as I'm sitting here: The best idea would be to get some of the older ones, four/five maybe to actually get this job and find new funny things for their younger compadrés.
You'll see in a very short time you get the infant mafia and sooner or later they're gonna rule the world and maybe maybe at this point they could actually surface how illuminati works and how you are actually able to walk on the sun (at night of course).

Best text evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa :'D 

In my opinion: A child until 7 shouldn't even know what a TV is.
<---- real opinion
Children aged two to five mostly watch television with supervision of their parents.
They probably won't get what's in the advertisment because their parents will have the last word.
Throgh that they'll learn to be sceptical and not to buy everythig that's on TV.
Also commercials can teach them about how the world works and what's outside of their hometown/city.
On the other hand, children are the easiest to manipulate through advertising.
Parents that aren't in control of their children might give in and just buy them everything.
So this subject also depends a lot on the parents and how they act in certain situations.
Also watching to much TV in general isn't the best thing for a young child.
It can be very overwhelming, damage their eyes and they might even neglect their social contacts.
I personally think, it's not very damaging for children to watch commercials.
It's a very important step in our modern time to not be influenced by the huge media world.
Instead the children should learn a good method of handeling such things as advertisments.
And in this case "practice" is very important.
In fact I think it's more damaging if they don't get in touch with any commercials.
This could become a much bigger problem in the future when they watch a commercial as an adult and simply can't resist because they never learned how to handle it.
No i disagree with that statement.
I think it schould be vorbidden to show TV advertisments to young children.
I think young children shouldnt be confronted with our unhealthy consum habit.
The influence of the media should start as late as possible.
if it starts to early they will become adicted to media like smartphones etc.
I think smal children shouldnt watch TV at al because i think it has a bad influence.
Smal children should rather go out and play  with theyr friends or theyr parents.
I think children shouldnt be influenced by stuf theyr parents wont buy them ore what might loock cool but actualy just sucks.
At least children should be freed of anoying TV advertising if they must watch TV.
TV advertising is crap no mather who it afectes ore whos it derected towards.

I think it is not very good when young chhildren aged under five years watch tv.
If children in this age already begin to watch tv, there is a high risk of treat the child unwell because if they sit a long time in front of the television, they don't have to think by themselves and I think it isn't very good for their eyes.
When there is advertising in the television, young children can't think about it and just want to have the advertised product, because the advertising says if the little child has the product, it will be happier berfore.
And of course such a little child would like to be a little be happier and if the product makes the kid happier, what else does it need?
A little kid hasn't a reason like it gets when it grows, and this means that it can't think about the product and if the product is really as good as shown in the advertising.
In another point there is a risk for parents by letting their children watch tv, because if their children want to have absolutely a product after watching television, it is the own problem of the parents if they get angry because their child wants to have something absolutely.
All in all, I think it is the own problem of the parents if they let watching their children tv in such a young age.
My opinion is that it is risky to let children watch television in a young age, because then they don't have to think by themselves and they just sit on the couch and watch straight forward.
This means they could get physical and psychical problems, what could be incorrect.
But if the parents let their children watch tv, it is their own problem if they get problems with their child because it wants absolutely to get a product.
This means that I think television advertising directed towards young children shouldn't get unallowed, because I think the television is a product made for a little bit older people and the tv programs are free programs and they can advertise whatever they want, except of bad advertising.
So if the children see something on the tv what they would like to have, I thik they can get it if they want.
These days much of the television advertising is directed towards young children and many think it is wrong but is it really that bad that it shouldn`t be allowed.
First, I would say that advertising directed towards young children is a bad thing because children are very easy to convince to do something or to buy a certain thing and the companies who are making this television advertising use that to sell there stuff.
In the other hand if a child want something it doesn`t mean that it would get it automatically because the parent won`t buy something or do something just because there children have told them.
But even tho the parents won`t buy or do it it doesn`t mean that they wouldn`t buy or do something if the children want it really bad.
At the end I would say that even young children aren`t that stupid to buy or want anything what they see in the television.
To sum up I think that telivision advertising should be allowed because it is not that worse at all it doesn`t harm young children and I also think in some cases it could be very handy.
Television advertisings can be really brainwashing to be honest.
If people see a product over and over again they start to think that this specific product is actually good.
But do young children even care or does the brainwash affect the children even more?
Children do watch television and most of them do like watching Tv for sure but do they really think about those stuff.
If young children watch cartoons about cowboys shooting each other the child won't go out with a gun and shoot people.
A child at age four already knows that that's not a normal thing to do and at the age of four he will already have experiences about what he can do or can't do.
But on the other handsite a Tv advertisment is a different story.
If a child is that young he looks up to people to his parents of course but maybe also to superman I mean who doesn't want to be like superman and so how should a young child be able to differentiate between his father who says vegetables are good for you and the guy in the Tv who says these toys are good for you.
Not only young children get brainwashed by television advertising so do adults.
It happens all the time peopel buy those silly things like a new little handy machine which helps you burning fat.
People believe it because all humans are lazy and that's a proofen fact which explains that the thirty-four  year old guy who sits infront of the television all day is to lazy to go to the gym so he just buys the machine thinking that he'll get ride off those insultings about him beeing fat.
If the thirty-four year old guy doesn't see that the products are just useless how is a four year old kid supposed to see.
Instead of not allowing televison advertisings which are directed towards such young children I would rather allow it but teach the kids how to detect the useless things which the companies want you to buy.
So my opinion is to let the companies do their television advertisments toward chidren but the parents or even better the teachers should show the kids how to use television advertisment the right way, even if they're like aged two to five and they obviously can't afford those things by their own they should get to know what they can use or really can't use because it is just useless and a waste of money.
Not everything in television advertisments is crap but most of it and the children should start already at a young age detecting the "wrong" things.
Televisioin advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed:

There are a lot of difference arguments for this thema.
As example is it good for the firm because the children in the age of two since five years, are good to become.
They belive all what the television or the parents said.
When the television said, that in the aged of four years every boy have a Carrera cars and every girl mus have a Barbie, then every boy and every girl want that because they haven't it and all the others have it.
A second argument for the television advertising is, that it is allowed to have a advertising for some plays in the television, the firm can show us what they have and wehn the children have birthday or wehn its christmas its good for the parents when they have presents.
But at the other side it isn't good, because the children want all these thnings they sit more bevore the television and watch it.
An other argument, because the television advertising for young children should not be allowed is, because the little children can't know what they need.
The parents want to do all perfect for his little child and when the child want something he become it.
This is like a manipulation for the little children but they can't understand it.
My personality opinion is, that it should be allowed, because each firm must do advertising for his own things and when the firm sold things for little children, they should make this advertising.
"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
", this statement shows us the situation of the children today in richer countries.
Where more or less every family has a television and every child grows up with it.
What frightends parents is not due to food or homelessness.
It is due to the television.
From a very young age, children are watching television and do not play outside.
However with this situation, televison have a huge impact on our children and so on our and their futur.
The television companies are aware of this and know how to use their influence on todays children.
With hidden messages they can get into the brain of our children and make them think, what they want to think them.
Of course this statement of mine is quite hard, but I believe, that watching television as young children, can have a very bad inpact on their lives.
However in the last few years in which television got more and more popular, the population has changed.
In an very early age children are confronted with pictures of cruel murder or pornography.
Through this the children today are more violant and have sometimes a strange behaviour due to sexuality.
To sum up all these facts lead to the conclusion, that Tevelevison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because it has an influence on our futur and the futur of the world.
We should protect our children and should not allow television advertising toward young children.
Every day, 365 days a year, there are television advertising.
They should influence us, to buy something.
But young children watch also television, but they can't buy anything because they haven't any money.
Is that good for the children?
Should the television advertising not be allowed?
Or do the children not understand what they see?
First, the advertising isn't good for children, because it influences them.
They dream about a lego toy or a car.
They will live in a fictive world.
In a world with all these beautiful toys, in a world in wich they could have what they want.
But the real life isn't that easy.
Who has enough money to buy anything?
An agrument against the first argument is that they can't think right in this age.
The cildren would forget all the advertising two or three years later.
A second argument is that people shouldn't watch a lot television.
To live in a fictive world you must watch a lot more hours television than an average man would.
A third argument is that when a young child would watch a lot television a day, there should be a ban on watching television, and not to the advertising.
A fourth argument is that a television concerne couldn't exist without advertising.
Young children shouldn't even watch television or when they watch television they should watch something that has been created for their age.
And on a programme for children there shouldn't be any advertising.
Young children want almost everything they see and for parents these advertisings for children wouldn't be good at all (although their parents could say no, but most parents just want their children to be happy).
So for the family and especially for the children it would be a bad thing, also because if they can watch television they can't watch long time (most children at this age i think), and then the film or series would be distracted by some advertising.
But surely there would also be a pro, for example for the people who want to sell something for children, something like a game or maybe even clothes.
They would make a lot of money i think because children aren't so smart at this age and they believe what the advertising promises.
It's much easier to convince children than parents or generally adults.
The programme would also make a lot of money because advertising isn't cheap and they can decide which price it will be.
I think that this statement is right and we shouldn't allow advertising on television for children aged two to five.
It isn't nessecary to advertise on television, children also look at stores, they wouldn't earn much more money.
And when I'm thinking about the poor parents whose children just want the game that was on television, I fell with them.
But most important, I think children shouldn't watch television when their so young, they should go playing outside and if it would be like that, we wouldn't even have to think or "debate" over this.
Maybe these young children don't even care if they watch advertisings, but maybe they do.
I think nobody likes advertisings in the middle of a film and for that I think we shouldn't say that it's okay that our children have to watch it.
Young children, aged two to five, should not watch Television.
It is proved that children who watch television since the age of two later will have a lower intelligent quotient that children who play with dolls for example.
But there are a lot of children who watch television anyway and are confronted with television advertising.
Firstly, Television toward young children influences them in various ways.
If they see a girl wearing a rosa dress and playing with a doll, they may think girls have to do that.
So they learn stereotype behaviours.
Others may say that television advertising has not that much power.
More important is the behavoiur which children observe of  their parents or of other children.
If they see the girl with the rosa dress, but their parents show them that they can play with dolls or cars, in most cases they will be influenced by the parents and not by the advertisment.
Secondly, if children are confronted with advertisment they will want things that they do not really need.
They just want it because they have seen it on Television and think



I do not think that television advertising toward young children should be banned generally.
Because in my view they do not affect the children badly.
But I think that it is important that young children dont watch TV, it is important that they play with other children and that they go outside.
In my opinion the question we are asking ourselfs is: what influence do these advertisments have in our lives or the lives of our children.
If there was no efect whatsoever, we wouldn't be concerned about our children but what effect does it realy have?
It increases our desire to buy things we don't need or only buy to fullfil our desires, mabey it creates desires we weren't aware of or didn't even existe bevore we saw the manipulating add.
The possible consequense is: we cant controle our desires and just go on to buy loads of stuff we don't need but for me, this isn't very likly to happen to children due to theyr lac of financal independance.
Especialy from age two to five you are not old enough to buy whatever you want and whenever you want without your parents consent.
As long as you have a parent who is able  to tell you that you can't have what ever you saw in this television add.
But by this I dont mean that it schouldn't be allowed.
What I am trying to say is that I don't see any reason in makeing adds for kids becose most of those adds ard for things that cost money and kids don't get to deside what to do with that money.It's theyr parents desicion if they wantto spendmoney on the things promoted in the adds made for theyr children.
But that leads me to the question: why would we even show adds for things that cost money to people who don't have any.
They will just now what they could buy if theyhad money witch they avent.
So I guess in my opinion youshouldn'tmake advertising, for example on the television, directed directly to children becose it will onlytresult inthem whining aboutthings they'll never have and woul'nt even know of if it wasn't for the add.
I think whenever parents wand to treat theyr children they can go toa toystore abd the kids can chose from whatever toys there are in the shop they visite.
In my opinion you shouldn't make those adds becose kids, evenmore than adults or teens don't have mouch feeling for what tey need and what thes just want.
First I need to say that children between two and five aren't able to decide what's best for them.
They probably just want to have everything that is "shiny" or "supercool".
If they could choose between something they could use for the next hour that would be absolutely fun and something they could use for the rest of their lives that would be extremely helpful for their future, they would probably go with the first possibility.
That shows that children just want to have fun and that's absolutely no problem at all, but it's clear that kids can't know what's best for them.
That's the job of their parents.
Children don't have a clue about money.
But I guess that when they see an advertisment and they would want this superhero or this barbie it would be better if they choose.
Otherwise their grandmother buys them something else but they didn't even want that, because they were dreaming of this advertisment.
Further I think it's so important that children can play and enjoy their lives.
Without any sorrows they just have to be young.Even though in my opinion those advertisments can cause a lot of trouble.
If a kid wants one of those things, it's parents sometimes get under pressure.
What if the parents can't effort that thing for their daughter.
Or what if the son comes home from kindergarten and one of his friends has this superhero from the advertisment.
This son wants the same but he gets into an argument with his dad because his wish is too expensive.
An other point is, that children shouldn't watch too much television.
They should go out and play with friends, this defenitely is possible even without any stuff from an advertising.
This discussion is really difficult because it sometimes gets hard to see into children but in my opinion it's better to not allow advertising directed to young kids.
Televison adverts for young children, should they be allowed?
Children so young shouldn't be watching that much television to be influenced by it's adverts, but also children at that specific age are most easily to influence.
So now I'm going to bring up some pro- and con-argument head to head to see which of the sides is better.
At first young children are very easy to influence.
They believe in a big man with a big belly, in a red coat and perfect white hair, who lives in the uninhabitable place at the north pole with some flying reindeer, one of them with a big nose, and many elves who don't do any other thing the whole year than making presents for the whole world.
So when they believe such a story, then they are going to believe every word that is said in advertisments.
On the other hand they want so much  but are happy with so little, at least when I was a child.
I wished for the whole Kidoh cristmas catalogue because everything looked so cool.
In the end I only got so little or nothing from the catalogue but was still amazed by the other presents I got.
So the small children are going to want so much but are only going to get so little.
An other reason to forbid television adverts addressing  our smallest is, that some mothers can't handle it when their children cry, because they can't have something, so they buy their children everything so they just throw their money out the window for things their children play with once or twice.
But how would the television companies not declare bankrupt if they are not going to get all their money from the adverters which is their main source of income.
Also do children learn that they can't get everything in live they want when they don't get anything from those cool looking TV adverts.
This of course only works, if the parents are strong and not just give their children everything they want.
In my opinion television adverts for small children can be allowed, if companies want to invest all that money.
Commercials have companied our society for quit a while now.
And there is barely a place on earth where you don't walk pass a commercial at some point.
Adults have already accepted to live while having them at theyr side.
But can adverts have a bad impact on small children?
There are studies that have already shown that comercials, may there message reach you consciously or not, have in fact quite a big impact on us.
The find theyr way through our nervesistem and creep right into our heads and even menage to make tiny changes 'round there and not even be noticed by us.
Now these kind of changes can be really dangerous for someone whose brain hasn't yet fully developt.
Now on contrairy you could point out that even if adverts have an impact on us, that's joust how society works.
Advertising is not just something modern, it's been a mean for companies to sell there products for decades now, so why sould theyr impact on us randomly increase?
Further on is neither a danger for adults nor for kinds.
Especially kids don't even really understand the meaning of the comercials, it's just colours and catchy kids songs playd on a ukulele just as in every other kids programm.
Kids may not understand everything they see but that dosen't mean that they don't somehow recieve the message said in the commercial.
Also at that young age, kids are more likely the remember what they've heard than adoulds, and when a kid hears the same jinge more than twice it can sing along by heart.
Critics could argue the messages in kids commercials don't ever contain any violence or other themes that could have a bad influence on children.
Another thing is that what ever is presented in the commercial, it's not really up to the kid to buy it, is it?
So kids commercials are a wicked way of bringing parents to buy things through there bagging kids who have seen the ad.
Against that you could point out
Kids shouldn't watch TV, because it makes them use their valuebal time they have as kids.
It's important that they are allowed to be kids and not grow-up to quickly just because they are allowed to watch TV.
When I was a kid we didn't have a TV and I'm happy that we didn't.
Dini Mudda.
SALEEEEE.
I totally agree to this statement and I hope that most of the people do, because we want smart and cool kids, and not the unse who are pumped up with TV trash.
I don't like people who watch too much TV, so as 23 hours a day, they are really dump because they miss the oppertunity to live and have a fun life with friends, parties and family, only because they watch too much TV.
And everything is too much.
TV is pretty much trash and it's no good that it got invented.
I don't like TV.
Only when I'm feeling trash it's ok to watch trash TV.
Then the TV and I are both trash and I feel better because I have a trash friend.
HOYA.
Our society is made out of addicted people in any way.
We are addicted to : cigs, coffee, TV, drugs (such as coke), we love to drink a good drink and live the high life.
I don't like to watch TV or do any of the things above.
Because I concore the addicted and try to be different.
Kids shouldn't watch TV.
It makes them dumb.
CAN I GET A HOYYYYAAAAAAA.
My  friends are cool, we're the cool kids.
When I was younger I wanted to become cool, and here I am.
Cool like ice and hard as a rock.
I hate television.
SALLLLLLEEEEEEEEEand CAN I GET A HOYYYYAAAAAAAA























































SAAAALLLLEEEEE





















































































































































CAN I GET A HOOOOOYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Television advertising is a difficult theme, were many people discause about, especially the one directed to young children, children at all.
It looks like, it's the easiest way to advertise new consumer.
It's much harder to make an adult buy your stuff, than a child.
Produce a nice, funny and sweet short videoclip and they'll love it.
And these two minutes during a break while watching tv, it won't disturb anyone.
Everyother company does the same, so why can't I?!
And if the parents allow small children at the age of two to five to watch tv, they don't even know what their child is watching, so they won't care at all.
Sure?
Me not...
Why would you make a child love your products, if it can't even think clearly?
Do you like to say: "The only one who buy my things are small children without really thinking about"?
I wouldn't.
They would choose your company only because the sweet bunny in the advertise or the nice music playing while watching the ad.
If parents allow their kids to sit in front of the tv and watch a cute story, they want them to see the film and not an advertise about fastfood or expensive, not working toys!
If you show small kids how tasty fastfood can look, it's clear, that they want to try it.
But as known, that's not healthy at all.
It's also known, that many many peolpe in for example the USA carry around to many weight.
So why don't show kids whow you can live and eat healthy instead of promoting fastfood

So for me it's clear, that I wouldn't allow television advertisement toward young children.
They can't really think about which toy they want to buy, because kids get easily influenced by cute or funny ad.
So it's not fair to lie to them with cool shots of a toy, which the thing can't even do, as shown in the tv.
These days many kids and toddlers already watch TV and there are many advertisments who are directed to them.
But why are there advertisments even before the really understand what they're seeing?
Young kids are easily influenced.
And since our society is one that's all about consuming products, there are many advertisments that secretly tell you to buy stuff that benefits their sales to make money.
So why not start at a young age?
These kids don't really understand what they're seeing and because of that, they can easily be brainwashed.
While using a nice and soothing voice in their campaign, they're telling kids to buy these certain things.
Suddendly when they're with their mother at the shopping center, they recognize certain items and cry for them until they get them.
Advertisments are indeed really nice to look at but everyone should decide for themselves and create their own opinion about it.And little kids just aren't ready.
On the other hand, there are many aspects that contradict that.
Little kids aren't ready.
Maybe that's the point.
They don't really understand the advertisments so they sure don't care about it.
Then why forbid these advertisments?
And if people think that they're kids are getting brainwashed, then maybe they shouldn't put them right in front of the TV.
Parents can decide for themselves.
It's not as if they are forced to let their kids watch these advertisments.
I, for sure, think that advertisments directed toward young children should not be allowed.
The world is full oft advertisments and we really don't need more.
Little kids shouldn't care about them.
Television advertising for young children
Fourteen years ago, I was five years old and after every television advertisings with toys I asked my mother, if she can buy that for me.
I think it was horrible for my mother.
Because I had a lot of toys, but I wanted more.
Because every toy in the advertising looks very nice and funny.
They want that the children ask her parents all the time for a special toy.
So I think for unstressed parents, television advertising must be forbidden.
In the television advertising they get the children a wrong Imagination.
Often when I bought a toy, which I saw, then it wasn't so funny like in the advertising.
In the advertising every thing make a sound and you can see a lot of colours.
Another trick, how they make that everybody want to buy this toy, is that they make a very nice background.
It could be that the toy is in a very nice room or the toy is in the real world.
For example the advertising of Playmobil.
They make an advertising for one toy but in the advertising are a lot of other toys.
So when you bought one toy, then it's boring.
You have to buy all toys, that you can play like in the advertising.
Another thing with Playmobil is, that they have playmens and in the advertising sometimes they can speak.
but in the real world it's impossible.
In the Television advertising you can see things for the first time.
You couldn't know that they exist.
And sometimes you see something and you realy want it but your parents are again this toy or this play.
For example it's a war game.
The problem is, that when your parents say no, you'll go to your grandparents or to your godfather or godmother.
you ask everybody until  somebody say yes.
And then your parents can't say no.
I think for a better relationship between the parents and the children television advertising shouldn't be allowed for children.
The television industry is a huge part of the media with billions of dollars made from advertisments.
A big part of the people living in industry countries watch television daily or at least a few time a week.
Because it isn't free for the channels to show a movie or a series on the tv, they have to generate an income from advertisments in the breaks.
Channels with content for children aren't excluded from that need for money.
But should it be allowed to advertise toward young children ?
Well the television industry generates thousands of jobs in every country of the world.
To keep those jobs channels have to make money.
There are some national television channels in many countries, which don't have to make advertisment breaks because they are financed by some kind of tax from the inhabitands.
But most channels are private and rely on advertising brands in the breaks.
Channels for children of course show adverbs for toys.
Without the money from the brands, they couldn't satisfy young children with their favorite shows.
But young children are very easy influenced by their environnment.
When they see an advertisment for a particular toy, they want to have this toy, but this can also happens without television.
They can see the toy in a store and still want to have it.
Also these channels can't advertise cars, holidays etc.
because children don't care about them.
Advertisments are directed toward the community that watches the channel to make the most money.
That's just how business works.
I can remember watching television as a child and it
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed

Adverts towards children are a popular marketing stradgedy for many buissinesses that for example sell toys.
It's pretty easy to use a childs fantasy and dreams to improve the own financial situation.
A children of the age two to five is easy to impress and excite about a new thing thats on the market, unless it's colourful and there's music in the backround.
After they've seen the adverts a few times they are are going to ask their parents about the stuff they've seen on Tv until they buy them for them.
Successfull marketing has always to do with an emotional connection to the customer.
That means if a brand is set in your mind before you've reached a certain age, as an adult you'll remeber the brand and connect it with good feelings or memories you've had in your childhood.
In my opinion that's manipulation and shouldn't be allowed.
But I'm not sure if it's that effectful, because the brands manipulate us anyways, it doesn't matter if we're 5 or 99.
The princip of using our feelings for their marketing works for adults the same way as it does for children.
Does Television advertision influence young children?
At the moment there is a big discussion in television advertising towards young children should be allowed.
One point of view is that young children don't even understand the sense of commercial.
Yes maybe they will run to their parents and ask if they could buy this and this but they don't have the money on their own so the parents still can decide.
So people say the problem is bigger for teenangers than forchildren because teenagers start to have their own money and yes it's difficult to handle this in the beginning.
how much money can I spend?
How much momey should I save?
So if they see something in TV they can decide on their own if they wanna buy it.
so they got much more influenced.
On the other hand it's not good to be influenced by advertising already in an early age.
Because if we want or not we get influenced and we make our decision based on commercials sometimes and we should protect the children from that.
They should learn to make decision without getting influenced.
But why do such young kids spend their time in front of a TV?
So my personal opinion is that the advertising directed towards young children is not that bad.
they don't get influenced by many commercials and the parents still can decide not to buy something even the kids want it.
it's worse for teenagers because they need to learn how to handle money and the commercials do not make that easier.
they are surrounded by many attractions.
so yes I think we can allow it for children but in general we should keep in mind how much we can get influenced.
Television is one of the most popular media o our time.
Everyone spends between two to six hours a week watching television.
Commercials are made to entice us, to tempt us, to seduce us to buy a product.
This does not only apply to adults, but to children as well.
The first commercial that comes to my mind is Geox.
"Does it really breathe, mum?"
This must have been the most frequently asked question when young childred first saw this commercial.
Now, how right or wrong is it to inlfluence such young children and should it be prohibited?
It is importanat or children to recognize that money and spending moeny is the most important thing in our current world.
What would prepare them better than showing them commercials and letting them decide what they want to spend money on rom an early age on?
All commercials have the goal to make us buy the product, to make us believe it is the best product to buy.
To influence a child is quite unfair, since all parents ever want is to make tehir children happy.
Another way to achieve that is more often than not to buy them what they ask for.
A child, however, can not distinguish between a long lasting product and one that will be good only or one time use.
But is it not what drives the economy: Driving people in whatever way to buy products they have no need for?
That is how it thrives and how not only the economy but capiatlism, too, can continue to exist.
Getting parents to buy things for their children, which's quality is questionable, is ruthless.
Moeny that would better be spent on long-term things or saved for later education is thrown out of the window.
This is hardly the capitalism's fault, but rather the parents for not managing their money correctly, some might say.
It would be interestig to see someone refuse their child something it was brainwashed to want.
SInce young children are only just developing the most important parts of tehir brains influencing them through commercials is not a hard thing to do, just an unfair thing.
All in all I belive that it is wrong to seduce anyone, let alone little children to buy products of which they have no need for.

Especially very young children in the age of two or three years may don't understand what they see in TV in this is probably dangerous because it might be the case that these children missunderstand the advertising.
So they might do dangerous or silly things they saw in TV.
As young as you are as a little child, you aren't able to get the right meaning of irony or jokes in the TV.
Otherwise there are a lot of funny and entertaining advertisements in the TV to make the kids laughing and show them funny games to play or toys which promise a lot of fun for young children.
These advertisements with a clear message without a potential to be missunderstood should be allowed because they're simply entertaining for the young kids.
I think it isn't the right way to forbid television advertising directed to young children by making laws.
But in my opinion it is usefull and necessary to make laws about the topics which are allowed to be directed to young children and which not.
Topics, which aren't dangerous or likely to be missunderstood by young children should be allowed, because they are entertaining and I see now reason to forbid them.
But topics in a advertisement with a potential to be missunderstood should be forbidden.
But I think, even if would may be important to make laws in the future, it isn't likely to became reality.
In this time, the medias are allowed to say and produce what they want and they haven't many limits.
Television is something that can influence peoples about they`re meanings and looks.
Many peoples look Tv every day and there childrens do it too.
The most of the television programs for childrens are made to feel them happy.
Thats good for the evolution of a child.
On the other side, there is the problem that some childrens think different and are not able to understand the happiness of a tv program.
They will think than different and will be different in there character too.
A other problem is, that it can`t be able to do a tv program for all childrens together.
Like the old peoples, are childrens by them self different too.
For example, when a really intelligent children looks something witch it knows allready but in the television it is present different, than the children will be irritated.
I think that the most important thing to allowed television programs for childrens is, that they can make choices about what they want to look about.
It shouldn`t be only one program whit they can
First of all, i think that television advertising is like a human right.
So why would i diasagree with the statement?
Some of the children who watsches one of the advertisings and really focus of the main plot of the message surely can remember this one little toy.
It`s the very same thing with adults!
We only focus on the ads which we like the most.
The little boys and girls can learn something from the television, what makes the hole statement even more interesting, because that would be great when they can still remember that one advertising ten years ago!
If there are advertising directed toward children, there`d be specialists who created those and that makes it a lot less worse

On the other side, some of the televisions ads can be disturbing and terrible, even the ones for the children.
There`s always a risk when i let my child watch one of those advertisings.
Another point would be that the child got a passion for watsching TV when they start to like advertising.
When they grow up and always be in front of their screen, then I`m sure that`s not good for their healths.
It would be anyway better when the child is like 90 percent of the time outside and plays with his friends, like we all did.
So when I get the chance to put my child in front of A TV or outside, i`ll go with the second.
Many people say that the world gets dumber every decade.
I associate that with the statement here.
Ads in a young age are just bad for the development of our brain.
It`s from child to child different if it learns something or got a bad habit from advertising which are directed toward young children.
Advertisment is a big subject in the world of today.
When we put on the television to watch a specific show, we get interrupted by advertisment very often.
Advertisement is present as well in television shows for children.
Should this be allowed or could it be bad for children aged two to five?
When children watch TV, they wan`t to watch TV and not advertisement.
Advertisment is another world than the shows they maybe watch.
It`s possible that they can`t differ an advertisement, in which a person does something unhuman, with the real world.
They don` t understand what this all is for.
This could cause that children try things they`re not made for.
When advertisment is directed to a young child, they can`t decide what they really want of all these things which are shown.
As a child you want to have all the cool stuff.
The child may get`s aggressiv when his mother doesn`t want to buy the things he has seen in the TV.
This could cause problems as well.
We see enough advertisement when we walk on the street or driving in the car.
Advertisement is so much information for a child, but for an adult as well.
The children can`t deal with those informations because they don`t know what the advertisement is for.
Maybe they missunderstand something important.
Advertisement could be good as well.
With all the things that are shown in the TV the children maybe understand earlier how to deal with some things in the world.
It could also be positiv for their vocabulary.
in adverts there is often used difficult vocabulary.
The children could learn to improve their spelling and hearing in front of the TV with more complex words.
With all the argument I said, I think advertisment shouldn`t be directed toward young children.
With the advertisment they spend even more time in front of the TV, and I think that this isn`t very good.
They should play outdoor in the forest or somewhere else and discover the world and his nature.
First of all I would say that it is an important question what the content of the advertising is.
I think children with an age of two to five shouldn't be watching that much TV, so if there's television advertising which attracts the young children that much then it could be difficult to bring them away again.
In the world of today there's a huge value on the technology and children grow up with it but I don't think that this is the right way to do it.
Children get manipulated by these television advertisings and they often get an illusion of reality.
So if they have their first day in school all they can talk about is TV, games and other things.
Parents often don't come around with the situation if the children aren't quiet and then they put their children in front of the TV.
Mostly of the time they are quiet then and the mother can do her homework and whatever she has to do and she can leave her children for a couple of hours alone.
Maybe children at this young age can learn a lot of things by themselves if they are watching these television advertisings.
Many series for young children are made to learn, for example counting or easy reading.
I think I agree a lot with this statement because there's so much more you can do with your children than hanging around in front of the TV and watching those advertisings.
The kids at this young age probably won't understand it and if they get used to it they just want more and more.
Kids who watched a lot of TV at this young age have later higher wishes especially to the parents.
So as a parent it could be difficult to make the wishes come true for them
Advertising for kids

In our world of media, advertising is a huge part of our lives.
Everytime we go to the internet or watch television advertising accompanies us.
The adverts are directed toward every age group, from young to old.
Now there's the question if advertising toward young children should be allowed, or not.
Especially young children are depending on their parents.
In every category: Their learning processes, their social life and also financially.
Because of that fact, it's very questionable if adverts should be allowed towards young children.
Everything the children want, the parents have to pay for.
Shouldn't parents be able to decide themselves what they want to purchase for their kids?
The kids are also influenced by the adverts.
If they see an advert, they might think that it's the truth that the advert tells, but in the sector of advertising lies are a huge part of the business.
That's also a huge argument for forbidding advertising directed toward young children.
Anyhow, advertising should be a free business.
Why should the Government be allowed to censore the adverts in those dimensions?
Adverts directed toward young children are automatically also directed toward their parents, because they are the one's that by the stuff for their children and decide what they want to buy.
This makes them legit again, even if it would be forbidden to advertise toward children.
So, it wouldn't even be controllable to forbid any adverts according to the age.
I disagree with the statement that Televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because I think in a free world with a freedom of speech, etc.
we should be allowed to advertise toward who we want, especially because it also can not be 100 percent correctly separated toward which age category an advert is directed.
When young children watch a lot of Televiosion is that not good.
Children, who watched the whole day Televioson are not happy.
Many children, who watch a lot of Television, have not learned to play.
For example they didn't learned to play with "lego" or playmobil".
It is very important that children learn how to play, because that is good for the live and the phantasy of the children.
When children watch Television at the morning, before they go to school or in the "kindergaten", then I think it is very big problem of the parents, because they should know, that it is not good for the children, when they watch a lot of Television.
But many people with children are working a lot and they don't have the time to look at their children.
And then it is very praktik for the parents when they can say, "yes my child you child you can watch Television".
And then the parents don't have to look for their children, so they don't have any work with their children.
I think it is very important, that parents take time for their children.
When I was a child it was very important for me, that I can play with my legos or playmobil.
I have learned a lot when I have played.
Me and my famelie, we don't have a television at home.
My mom and dad think, taht it is better for me and my brothers, when we don't watch a lot of television.
We watch also a little bit of Television, but on our computer.
But not a lot.
I think chilrdren should watch a little bit of Television, but not the whole time.
They should also have enough time to play with their legos or playmobil or cars
Television advertising directed toward young children

The use of the television for children is a serious subject.
Nowadays children spend much more time infront of the TV.
Is television advertising really supportable?
Kids (aged two to five) are easy to manipulate.
If they're see candy or things to play, they're impressed quite quickly and they want to play with it.
For children it's hard to split the reality from the things they see in TV.
Also they doesn't have a own opinion that age.
So it's better when parents decide, what their children really needs sometimes.
Children don't really know if they're in need of the things they see in TV and they start crying, if they see something they want.
sometimes that's annoying for the parents.
Another argument against adverdising for children is, that they are spending too much time in front of the TV anyway and this would make it even worse.
A childhood outside with your friends and playing hide and seek is much more adventorous and better for the children, than in front of the TV.
All in all I wouldn't allowed television advertising directed toward young children.
There are far more arguemnts against it.
We live in a world full of every possibly imaginable merchandise, and each of it has a matching advertisement.
As this has become normal in our western society, we're kind of used to the constant promotion, especially to television advertising.
But while grown-ups can mostly deal with these constant offers of sometimes desirable objects, it is to question how small children from age two to five deal with such situations.
If you look at it from an economical point of view, it can be said that advertising is a big and helpful tool to promote new products which means more income for the producers of this product.
As there is an immense market of lots of different offers around, this has become more and more important for companies to stand out against concurrents.
Another important aspect is that advertising can also be helpful for costumers as it sometimes helps to discover new and interesting products an to be able to decide quicker what is best for oneself.
A lot of people like to get informed about new products and their advantages.
And why should this process stop when it comes to children?
They're humans too, and humans have their natural needs.
On the other hand, children from two to five are in the middle of their development.
They don't know the meaning of money and they can't think about what they really need.
If they see an object, they just immediately decide wheter they're interested or not, and if they won't get what they want, they will show their disappointment by crying and complaining, which is not very desirable for their parents.
Regarding these children's not fully developped skills of cognitive skills as speaking and thinking, they are easily to be influenced by everything that surrounds them.
This means that they can also be manipulated by televsion advertisements with ease, which does not at all seem morally correct.
On the whole, I don't see the need of adressing television advertising to young children.
What they need in this age is love from their parents and many opportunities to play and learn.
They will not be able to understand the meaning behind advertisements.
And they will have the same interest in a brick on the ground as in a colourful gadget worth 100 dollars.
Essay

"Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed."
Many people think that television isn't really good for young children.
Some think that what young children hear or see on TV can be understood wrongly by them or can influence their actions and thoughts.
For example when there is an ad for sweets, a child in that age just thinks: "I want that."
This is because children in that age aren't thinking as reasonable as children in a higher age already do.
A child has to learn to know the results of their actions.
But you could also say: just let your child watch what's okay for it, if you don't agree with advertising on TV.
Just today there are so many options on the television, that there isn't really a problem anymore of what's on TV, because there is everything on TV.
And anyway: there are so many television shows which give you much information about nature or technology and the whole world.
So TV can also give knowledge to children, which they hadn't whithout TV.
So all in one TV is a good thing an there are many aspects which are good about it, but parents should keep an eye on their young children when they watch TV so that they don't get anything wrong.
I think they should watch for their children themselves and not forbid the whole television advertising.
If advertising in the TV is for children aged two to five it supports watching TV for children in this age.
I think in this age you shouldn't watch very much TV an better go outside with friends or play games, read books.
If a children watches TV and see an advertism they wanna see more of them an their parents begin to have troubles with allowing watching TV.
In my opinion it's not fair for the parents because kids are always fascinated by the things who are showed in TV and they can be easier manipulated with good advertism.
The second problem could be that poor parents can't buy their children the toys which they see in the television and then the parents can begin to feel bad and the children thinks their parents don't like them because in this age they often don't understand what poorness is.
An other problem could be that the children always want to have the newest toys and that they never will be happy with the toys which they have because it always exists a new toy.
It's not possible for parents to buy their children always the newest toys because it's too expensive and it exists always a new one.
In advertism are the toys often showed better than they are and be too expensive for the quality that they give.
I think the magazines of toysrus or franz carl weber are enough for the kids and can show them the newest stuff.
Advertism is not bad but it's bad for children aged two to five and not necessary.
In the television they show too much advertism and often bad advertism.
So my opinion is that advertism shouldn't be allowed for children aged two to five or even for children aged two to ten.
There are some good and bad points about television advertising.
Advertising is like making people do or buy something by presenting the product or whatever it is.
This should influence some people and let them buy or do these thhings.
If that happens, we know that the advertisement was successful.
It always depends on what kind of an advertisement it is.
But it's important to know that young children are very influencable.
Television advertising can infuence these children better than adults.
And like I said, if these advertisements are specifically made for children, these children would want to have these things ike toys.
Nowadays there are these phases where a specific toy is the "best" toy and every kid wants to have this.
And that makes an entire group get these things.
Well that's the case if the advertisement presents toys.
But its the same thing if the advertisemnet is about an activity.
It well may be positive but also in that case it depends on the content of the television advertising.
I think that children aged to two to five are too young to even understand the intention that these advertisements have.
They see the pictures and videos and that's it.
But especially the fact that they only see what's on the screen is another negative point about that.
They wahrnehmen these things other than teenagers.
That statement above is generalising the advertisements.
I can say (from my own experience) that not all advertisements have a bad influence to children.
I've seen kind of "advertisemnts" that tell young children to go to bed early, to play outside and more.
Because of that I believe that it really depends on what kind of and televisison advertisement it is.
More importantly what and how it represents- So, I can't really say that I agree or disagree with that.
Our society is full of diffrent form of advertising.
Youre eye will always meet an advertisment if you go for a walk in, for example, a city.
Advertising has become so important to this world, because of its power.
Capitalism does not functionate without any form of advertising.
But in what way do advertisments affect on us?
And espacially how does advertisment shape our thinking and behaviour in a young age through technology, like televison?
this questions will be discussed in the following paragraphes.
Advertisments can be helpful.
If your watching TV, and an advertisment is comming up, you can see what products on the market and decide if you need them.
There might be a porblem with young children watching those.
Because of their young age, they aren't mature enough to consider if they really need the product who popps up on the TV.
Parents may than be confronted with a lot of wishes from their children.
There is also a risk of creating a fake or unhealthy perception of the world watching TV advertisments in a younf age.
Young girls will unconsiously save the images of "beautiful", slim and tall girls in ads.
Later in life they have the need to become similar to them.
Children in young age, it they watch TV ads, will be indirectly confronted with our capitalistic system.
So new generation will be used to this society structure, so the may not have the need to question the bad in this political system.
In my opinion TV ads should not be allowed to yoz
We are confronted with advertisement everywhere our everyday life.
Offers to buy the new classic burger or the best computer in the country pop up in newspapers, sings on the streets or in television.
Children aged two to five usually watch TV and therefore the television is their way of connecting to the advertisement world.
Advertisements in television are specified.
During lunch time you can see food commercials and during summertime there are holiday commercials.
Even if you weren't specifically thinking of buying a hamburger as an example, after seeing the commercial you may crave one.
This is how advertising influences our subconsciousness.
The aim of commercials is to make create a potential customer who is paying money for this certain product that is being advertised.
However children from age two to five neither have the money nor the possibility to buy this product.
They have to show their interest to their parents in order to saticefy their needs.
Advertising could lead the children to be interested in challenging toys and games such as memory games or puzzles.
In contrast, ads also could seduce the children to wish for dangerous toy like toy guns or little toy that could be swallowed.
Toys and games also have an psychological influence on children whose brain is still developing and growing to reach its maximum size.
Toys like a Barbie doll may lead to extreme beauty ideals with girls that could cause a later eating disorder.
If a girl plays with similar looking dolls that have slim legs a tiny waist as well a perfect face she may develops a low self-esteem because she keeps comparing herself to her Barbie doll.
Boy toys that immitate shooting could lead to aggressiveness in the adult age.
So toys can be very important with the psychological and characteristic development of children.
They either influence children that young age in a good manner by challenging them or can lead to controversial ideals and behaviour problems.
In my opinion television advertisement should be censored and approved by authorities in order to protect the children.
One one hand television advertising directed toward young children could influence them very bad.
If, for excemple, children would watch advertisings about toys, they see how happe the children in the advertising are and how funny it would be to have the same toy.
Maybe they start to finde their own toys borring because they are only concentrated on what they don't have.
And if they would get something new, this would get borring too after some days because they have seen another toy in a television advertising.
On the other hand, the television advertising could give the parents new ideas on what they could buy for their children.
For the enterprise it's a good possibility to influence the parents too because they see how happy their child would be to have toys like this.
It would also be clever for an enterprise if they would show these advertisings, especially the ones where they show toys, on chanells which children often watch because otherwise onbody would ever watch these advertisings.
Television advertisings could also be a possibility to show the parents toys which could help the children learning new things or toys which could suport them in some situations.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because the children in this age don't have the possibility to by these things by themself.
So if they would see something they would like to own, in a television advertising, the parents decide if they want to buy it for their children.
These advertisings could also show the parents new ideas or things that could suport their children.
For excemple when I was young it was very difficult for me to hold all my playing cards in my small hands so for birthday I got something that helped me holding my cards and I was very happy about this gift.
I think it's the responsibility of the parents what they do with the things the
Many commercials are made for a specific group of interest.
The question in the following Essay is, wether advertisement for the age group of two to five should be allowed.
First of all it is important what type of content is presented to the children.
It should not be legal connecting cigarettes with a mickey mouse logo.
You also have to keep in mind, that children at this age are not fully able to comprehend the value of money.
This is not a big problem, when they do not get weekly or monthly cash from their parents, but otherwise the children are seduced to spend there money in a not wisely way.
The group of two to five year olds is a big consumer group and very important for economic reasons and when they get interested in a particular product they will be trying to get hold of it very powerful.
We all remember the awkward situation in a toy store, when a child screams and shouts to her mother, because she really wants the new lego expansion pack and altough her needs are declined, she still tries to manipulate her mother to buy it.
Im convinced that the television is a pretty important medium for many companies to sell products to the little ones and advertisement does not always has to be a bad thing.
You get exposed to unwanted rubbish aswell as really interesting stuff.
You should take into consideration also, that many television programmes for little children would not exist without commercials, because there would be no selling point in showing them, and for my part, I loved to watch cartoons and television shows made for my age group.
In conclusion I think there is not a big problem in showing commercials to children as long as they are reasonable and not graphic or off-putting.
I think television is great.
I like to watch tv all day long.
It's a amazing way to calm down and to relax.Why shouldn't it be allowed to watch tv advertising how's directed when you're two to five years old.I mean you have to start early learn a correct way to use television and Co. And alot of television programs are made for children so they also should be used in advertising.There are a lot of toy producers they want to show they're stuff to the children on tv.
So if television advertising is not allowed for children.
To watch tv shouldn't be allowed to because there are alot advertising how don't have a direction like for example: food ad, event ad or ad for the newest movie at the cinema.
Children are around ad's all the time not just when they watch television.So my oppinion to this it's there are advertisting around children anyways if they are directed to them or not.
So i think it's up to the parents if they let they're children watch tv ad or not.
And parents also should decide it they allowed they're children to buy that stuff from the tv or not.
Imagine you are  a four year old child and you like to watch television.
Before your favorite program starts there is an advertisment, which shows you exactly what you want.
If you are boy it could be a giant fortress made out of legos.
If you are a girl you may be shown the barbie doll you desperatly want.
After the advertisment was shown you run to your parents and ask them if you may have the shown product.
Probably they will not buy it instantly, but after a while of complaining and crying they may consider buying it just to shut you up.
This situation is nothing that I would have wanted to ever exist.
Sadly it partually became reality with companies, whose advertisements are directed toward young children.
These children are heavily influenced by those ads and they make their parents buy stuff they don't need.
Many parents don't have very much money to spend on such things.
If the advertised product isn't bought, because of one of many valid reasons, the child will be devastated.
If it is bought the parents will often have a bad feeling about it, as the product is almost never a necessity.
Not to metion that the advertisments are directed towards children because the parents wouldn't have bought them if they saw the advertisment.
The child probably doesn't know where and under what circumstances the product was made and what materials have been used.
The product may have been made by children in asia and the materials used may be toxic.
The child probably wouldn't even care.
It only sees the product of their dreams.
These advertisments open up the opportunity to sell products, that couldn't be sold differently and probably shouldn't be sold at all.
In conclusion I think it is clear that this form of advertising should not be allowed, as it influences the children in a way they don't even notice.
And if one of the products gets bought, not everyone will be happy.
Many young children watch very often television, should it be allowed or not?
The most of the children, who watch televiosion, watch a movie or a serie.
But there are good and bad movies for children, or movies, whitch aren't for children.
By some movies the children will learn something, for example, when they watch a documentary or a movie for their age.
On the oposite, if they watch a movie about war or something uninterant for children, it isn't godd for this young children.
But, what is, when a child watch a movie or an other thing in the televioson, whitch isn't good for children?
Maybe they have later a problem or are scary from things they saw in the television.
An other point is, if they see every free minute television, they haven't time to play with friends or to do things, whitch are normally for so young children.
This will be a problem when they are older, they haven't friends or any social contact.
I think, the little children should more play and be a child in this age, without watching television or playing videogames or sometihnig.
But in this poin, the parents play a important rule, they have to say, if it's okey when their child watchs television or not.
Maybe they can make a "Movie rule" for their children, whitch movies and series their children can watch.
When I was a child, I'd loved watching TV, especially the advertisements between two films.
I don't why, maybe the reason was that I knew I wouldn't ever get anything of this things or toys they showed me in the TV.
So when I watched this, I dreamt about how it would be, when I would be this girl or boy who could play with this toys.
In fact there are a lot of children who see the advertisements and go to their parents and beg for a new toy.
But who wouldn't do this?
When I, as an adult, watch TV and see a new parfume or something, I also want to get this.
Of course when we're older we know about the conditions for buying something and we know how hard it is to earn enough money to get everything we want to have.
But the mood to get something new is still here.
So is television advertising directed toward young children wrong?
Why should it be?
Because of the children who would be sad if they don't get this toy they saw it  in the TV yesterday?
Don't you think a child really doesn't matter if it gets new stuff everday ?
I remember when I was a child my wishes changes every second.
In one second I wanted to have a dog, but in the other second I actually died to get a new Barbie doll.
Of course the advertisements shows every child what it could but doesn't have.
But is this something bad?
We must learn to say no to something and be happy without it.
Why shouldn't we learn to do this at the age of a child?
What's better?
To learn things early or late?
This is a question who everyone must ask itself, there isn't a correct response for everyone.
Children always want nice things.
As  we can see in the store there are many sweets at the check-out.
This is a strategie to wake hunger in the children, them will ask the parents and to satisfy the children, they buy it.
Is it the same in the TV-publicity?
The publicity is pointed toward children, they will have it and they will ask theyr mom or dad for it.
I understand when this is annoing for parents.
But is it worth to be forbitten?
Why?
Yes i hate publicity too, but it is the money that suports the TV-show financial.
And the children will probably forget it up to the next time they are in a store.
The younger of them won't really understand the publicity and that you can buy this stuff in the next store.
At all parents could also shout off the television when publicity is on-air, when they don't want the children to watch it.
An other argument could be, some publicity makes the children feel in a unrealistic world with just sugar an toys.
But thats probably the world they are mostly in with that age and in the TV-programm is a even more unrealistic world.
So when they watch TV anyway, that shouldn't be the problem.
The publicity could show the children products which could hurt them, for example LEGO, they could eat one what is not very good for theyr health.
But in the end there are always the parents who buy this stuff.
It's their matter what the children have and what is forbitten for them.
I think advertising toward children is not worse than make publicity towards adults.
It makes us phantasie about what we could have and feel bad abou't what we don't have.
I don't think it's bad to make this publicity, becaus parents could switch the TV just off during this period and it pays the kidsshow they are watching.
The question is for me not if we should make publicity in TV for the children or not, it is more questionable if we should let them watch TV and at all what we should let them watch?
I'm going to start with some lyrics in order to make my point: I'm not him but I'll mean something to you.
"I may be younger but I'll look after you.
We'r5e not in love but I'll make love to you.
I'll let you guys prophesy.
We gon' see the future first."
And another one: 
" You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven youre my hell
Youre my now youre my forever
Youre my lies youre my truth
Youre my war youre my truce
youre my questions youre my proof
youre my stress youre my masseuse"

These lyrics are supposed to hook the reader even though they have nothing to do with the topic.
Now I start talking about the topic.
Picasso is dead, walter disney is dead.
Name somebody living who can be named in the same breath as them.
Start with the truth.
Start with what everyone's thinking.
And put some dope shit with it.
What's the point of thinking?
Look at Nicola Mussio.
He was considered to be a photographer.
Then he made Twelve years a slave.
It ain't no joke, Rakim told us.
I got ideas that can make human race's existance within our hundred years better.
Period.
Oh, that wasn't about the topic.
Television advertising toward young children should not be allowed, because it makes our children dumb.
But we should let them listen to great artists such as FRank Ocean (Frankie) or Kanye West (Ye).
YOung children respond too sensitive towards this advertising.
The advertising exploits the fact that children are not capable of differentiating between te reality they experience on the street  of Chicago where Kanye, Chance the Rapper and Nicola Mussio had to grow up and a fairytale generated by large corporations.
Let's look at the infantile NIcola Mussio.
He likes watching Spongebob and is immediately hooked up by advertising.
He clicks on every pop-ad when he's surfing on websites with por*********** content.
Now he can only drink Red BUll.
He says: " Ich könnte auch Prix Garantie saufen".
These two bodies underline my principle argument.
Thats why I think TV advertising should be forbidden.
Television advertising is most of the time really annoying for us.
When we want to watch a film and there are always these ten-minute-breaks in it full of advertising, some of us are getting really angry.
But should it be allowed to show some television advertising for younger children in the age between two and five?
I don't think it should.
They are too young to know if they want to watch the advertising or not.
The companies are making profit out of this.
They want younger people to buy (or make their parents buy) their products.
I think children should be protected from all the advertising stuff.
They should have time to grow up and they should learn in the kindergarden and the school about it.
After that, they can decide much better what they want to do.
In option to the advertising toward young children, there're can be produced some advertising toward their parents.
These are the people who have to spend the money on it and these are the people who have to deal with the wishes of their kids.
On the other hand, there is no reason why the children (aged two to  five) should watch television anyway.
I was playing football and jumping around when i was that young.
Thats why I think that parents should protect their children from modern technology until they're old enough to understand.
After all, I really agree with this statement.In my opinion it's fairer not to show television advertising to young children.
Television propaganda for children?
Babys, if treated correctly, have the possibility to learn every language in existence.
Due to this, they are also very widely able to absorb information.
So small children are still very receptive to different kinds of information.
I myself have a younger sister and she doesn`t watch TV, she litteraly stares at the display with an open mouth.
So advertisements directed towards young children too most be highly effective.
Let`s see why it is a bad idea to use television advertising directed towards young children.
Let`s look at why we use advertisement in the first place.
The one and only goal is, to make a person to buy a certain product.
But children at the age of two to five years aren`t able to buy products at all because usually they don`t have any money.
So their parents have to decide to buy the product.
Most of the time, the parents won`t buy them the toys they want.
This puts them in a state of constant desire to have toys, which they can`t get, which makes them unhappy.
So the children are in a complete overflow of information, of which they can`t decide what`s important and what`s not.
They might miss information about the importance to be social, but know every possible McDonalds advertisement by heart.
In the following essay I'll talk about this following statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
An argument for this statement is, that a lot of people think that advertising is a good idea also for children, because while watching it they can learn the language and so when they got to kindergarden they don't have that much difficulties in the language.
Of course we can say here, that the parents talk to their children and there's no need to watch the advertising to learn the language, but here's a problem.
Not all parents talk to their children in the official language because not all people have the same nationality.
An argument against this statement is, that children often believe in something new they see a and so their reality gets destroyed.
For example if they see a speaking animal they could start believe that it really exists and so they would learn something new that is actually wrong.
Also if the children enjoy the advertising they want to see it really often and that leads into that the children want to stay in front of the television the whole day.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because I don't really see the good in that.
I think it's important for a children to go out and see the world with their eyes and not from the television.
All people see things in a different way and think different of something, so it's also important for the children to have a own view of new things they learn.
Now a days children are surrounded by television, smartphones and computers.
In the television there are many different programmes for children but I think some children also watch programmes which are for adults and teenagers.
As we all know there is always pretty much advertisement even in the channels just for younger kids.
So it`s important to overthink if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Children aged two to five do not know yet what advertisement is.
They might realise that the advertisement does not belong to the show they watched but they do not know yet that there are huge enterprises that have only one goal and this is to sell more of this product because they want to earn money.
In this age children are still learning a lot which means that they absolutely do believe what they are watching.
They do not ask themselves if what they tell in television might be wrong.
If an advertisement says for example that this is the cutest teddy bear and you can see really happy children playing with it, the children who watch the advertisement think that exactely this teddy bear has to make someone happy.
They do not doubt it, because they can see the happy faces of other kids.
So they want to buy this teddy bear and the enterprise has reached its goal.
A positive aspect of advertising can be that if it is an advertisment for something good.
For example in the cinema their is always an advertisment to donate money for sick children.
If children see this they might learn that it is important to be social and also help others.
So they can also be influenced positive.
But overall I think advertisement toward young children should not be allowed because the children get influenced too much because they do not understand yet how advertisement works.
It might be possible to not allow advertisement on channels for children but the problem is that many children watch also shows which are not made for their age and I think it is not going to be possible to not allow advertisement on all the channels because the channels also need to earn money and they do this in part by allowing advertisment.
Essay about a statement 

In our society social media is really strong presented.
Social platforms like Instagramm, We heart it, Facebook etc.
influence our relation to the internet and also, in general, to electronical tools.
The invention of electronical tools started really early.
With the invention of the radio, news papers started to become less importan.
When televisions were created movies started to become a high weigh.
Books become less important.
With the introduction of advertising, the electronical society reached a new level.
Beauty products, "Thinmakers", toys and a lot of other things were presented in television advertising.
And now, advertising is everywhere.
There isn`t one platform tht I know where you don`t find advertising( youtube, instagramm, facebook...).
But why is advertising so important for the sellers?
Advertising has the effect of manipulating the watchers.
Especially really young kids are confronted with "Thinmakers", Toys (like dolls, plastic cars etc.)
and beauty products.
They think that the advertising is telling the truth.
This kind of manipulation against young children is definitely terrible.
Children still have the sense of innocence and they don`t know "the bad thing in life" (war, exams,).
For them everybody and everything is good and is telling the truth.
And exactly this innocence of young children is the sensible point.
In my opinion, advertising has more bad aspects than goods.
For example: A young teenage girl is finding herself and creating her character.
In that age, children are "finders" of themeselves.
Advertising show with thinmakers like pills and several diffrent shakes, that only skinny people are beautiful.
This is a really dangerous presentation of beauty.
A young girl thinks really fast that seh has to be as skinny as the women in the television.
And than she starts to eat less.
This can end in Anorexia Nervosa.
Of course this is an extreme example.
But if your studying the studies of anorextic people you can realise, that advertising is kind of dangerous.
80% of all teenage girl suffer because o Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia, Binding Eating etc.
If your looking at the level of boys then you see "only" 3% of all teenage boys.
But this are 80% and 2% way to much.
ALso the trend of clothes is terrible shown in advertising.
With your style you can live your creativity.
But so many people don`t know that most of this products were made by children in the Third World.
I think advertising is showing us a definitely wrong illusion of our world relations.
It is showing a perfect life but not, that other peo
I definitely agree with the statement but I think, that it should be in genereal forbidden in social media.
Television advertising isn't dangerous for the childrens.
It can't hurt them and it doesn't destroy their minds.
But the question, if it's good when childrens watch advertising is realy important.
Today, most of the families got a television at home and most of the childrens whatch a lot of television.
That's already the first problem of todays erea.
Instead of plaiing in the garden with their friensds, the childrens are sitting alone in front of the TV.
Because of that, there are always more advertising who are directed toward this childrens.
Childrens in this age aren't able to understand exactly what the advertising says and that can be a little bit dangerous.
If childrens see the adertising for example of a toy, most of the time the want it just because the child in the advertising got it to.
But the childrens in thes ages can't buy something on their own so the parents have to accept it.
With this, the parents can control the child and the advertising aren't dangerous anymore.
I don't think that these advertising shouldn't be allowed.
I think the only bad thing at telivision advertisings who are directed toward these young childrens is, that they only see the things they don't have and they always wan't more.
Maybe the childrens don't notice the cool ting or the toys they already have.
The question is if television advretising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed or not.
There are reasons for both sides.
Firstly, kids shouldn't watch TV when their aged two to five.
So there's no problem with advertising, because they won't see it anyway.
But here's a possibility that they have very bad parents.
And when the parents don't care about their children, or spend the whole day at work, the kids watch the whole day TV and then they want everything they see, because their easy to manipulate.
Secondly, for the parents it could be helpfull, but only for the bad ones, we shouldn't support.
For example when they have no idea, what their children like for christmas or birthday, they could get inspirated by the TV spots.
But the kids could also get a bad influence, when they just want what they see on TV and they don't have an own opinion.
Finally it shouldn't get a habit to watch TV and then buy the things presented in the adverts, especially not when your a young child aged two to five.
Because then we buy a lot of thrash we don't really need.
In conclusion, there are a lot of arguments wich say that TV isn't good for young people and we have to protect them from what they think they want.
Personally, I think television advertisint directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.
I really don't know how anyone could come up with a sentence like this but I have to do this task anyway.
At a young age humans can be easily influenced by anything here an example: A child which was born into a christian family could be kidnapped by terrorists and raised to become a suicide bomber, once again this was just an example so why don't i start with my arguments.
Well it is true that children are easily influenced by things as mentioned above but there is one thing in their life which can prevent things like that, those individuals are often known as "Parents" and they have the power to lead there children to the right path, the path of christianity, or rather the path of common sense and not christianity because religion could also be a bad influence so anyway.
I don't see why it shouldn't be allowd to show children advertisments which are directed to them because if they and their parents are easily influenced by advertisments on the television, for example for toys, they are simply naive and probably not really intelligent.
Another argument against this silly statement is that children aged between two to five are often not even capable of thinking and besides that they do not even own money and if they do it's a case of bad parenting but that's just my opinion cause what do I know right?
I'm just a student not knowing anything.
The points I made may seem invalid or stupid but think about it, if you really think about it two or three times you will come to the same conclusion or opinion.
So in conclusion this statement above is completely stupid and I don't know how something like this could end up as the theme of a discussion between two or more people.
It's as if people would start to discuss about terrorism which clearly is the best thing in this world, did I say best?
sorry I meant worst.
(By the way the timespan for this task is way to high I would shorten it a bit maybe to twenty minutes?
or even fifteen?
cause I'm already done with this and it only took me about fifteen minutes so yeah.)
(Please don't take me serious especially about that terrorism comment I'm just trying to be funny and laugh about myself and write in english because it's a very nice language.)
(Did you notice something?
if you would have given me less time I wouldn't have been capable of writting so much nonsense below the actual text.
And there is still time left for some more nonsense.)
(Let's practice some smileys: ._.
this is an "Are you serious?
"-smiley)

Children between two to five years shouldn't spend much time in front of a TV to have a good education.
I think that television advertising directed towards them is nothing bad because they just see and like some toys or other fun activities they would join, so there is nothing damaging at the TV which can cause something bad in a childrens head, just by seeing an advertisement for them.
As I said, the advertisements mostly contain some toys for children and if not, it's an advertisement for something a whole family can join like a waterpark.
A big disatvantage of watching TV in the young age between two and five is that televisions aren't helping the children to build a progress in their brains as it's important in this age.
A creativity for exmaple is not here if a child is watching TV everyday for a long time.
A child can get some diseases like it can't talk very well for a child at its age.
The disease can be worse so the child has to go to a logopedical therapy, where it can make a progress in its brain to finally go to a primary school and educate itself.
My personal opinion of the theme is that good parents won't let a child watch the TV too long in this young age so there will be no damaging effects of a TV and the advertisements in it.
Advertisements should be allowed because they don't damage anything and are more there for fun.
To that, children are watching wathever they think it's interesting so I've never seen children in this age watching an advertisement because they are not interested at it.
Many people watch regularly television, also young children.
Many parents let their children in front of the televsion in order to do something else.
The question that I will discuss in this little essay is, if television advertising should not be allowed for young children (aged two to five).
Young children learn a lot of things through televsion.
There are many series for little kids, in which the producers are trying to show them the world.
They learn how to count, how to spell words etc.
They use television to make up their minds.
Many parents use television to have a little pause from their children.
They do not have any patience left and so they let them watch tv, to make them quiet.
But is it really good to let the young children watch tv just to let them be quiet?
I do not think that it is good that young children are sitting in front of the television.
We are living in a world, where the media things are getting bigger and more important for everyone and I do not think that this is a good thing.
We are complaining about the social media and things like that, but we are letting our children sitting in front of the tv and letting them watch tv.
They are our future and so we should try to make out of them the best they could be.
Watching television makes also really agressive, this is something that has been showed.
You may also lose the connection to reality, because you might like "live in the television".
And do not forget, that a lot of kids just started watching television because their parents wanted them to be quiet.
It might be, that there are good series for little kids, that show them some important things, but in general I do not think that it is good for them.
They should go out and play in the green with other kids, they should enjoy every second of their childhood, playing, crying, smiling, fighting and not sitting in the house in front of the television.
As there are advantages of letting young children watch tv, I do not think that it should be allowed to let them watch tv.
They should go out and explore the world, they should enjoy their childhood.
Living is the best option for learning, if you are living your life fully, you are always learning something.
Advertisment is a part of our daily life.
As the day passes, we see uncountble ads on streetsigns, our computers and the television.
It also affects the smallest in our society, the 2-5 year old kids.
Do they really need to bare this constant flood of advertisment?
When we watch a commercial on television, we often think about it for a second or two.
Like, do I need this or where could I find this.
Small children do not think much about their actions or anything that happens around them.
They live for the moment.
So wehn they see an advertisement in television, they do not waste another second on thinking about it.
Though, how often does a kid that age really see an ad in television.
They play with their siblings, parents or other children of the same age.
Every day they live is a new adventure to them.
So why waste any of this precious time watching television?
They do not spend hours a day looking at a screem, so they would not really be affected by it.
If they do spend hours and hours in front of the television and see a lot of advertisment directed to them, they could not do aynthing with that information since they do not have any money to buy something.
They would start to ignore the commercial, like we do every day.
So it would rather help them for their adult life then harm them.
Small children do not watch a lot of television and if they do, commercials do not have the same effect on them then it has on an older human.
So why bann commercials for children that age, if they do not even work the way they were supposed
Monica, a three years old girl is sitting in front of a TV.
Her mom is cooking and her  dad still at work.
Suddenly an advertising comes on the TV, its about a Barbie, that in the advertismet evreybody popular in the school has.
Monica herself, is not really well liked and popular, so she decides that she relly needs one of these Barbies.
She talkes too her mom, that she really needs this Barbie, first her mom says she wont buy her one.
But after Moniva startes too cry her mom agrees, and says that she will buy her one.
This example lead to the question, if its appropriate to direct television advertising toward childred in a young age, or if this should be banned.
In the case of Monica, the advertising should be banned, because the industrie uses the anexiety of an young children and says with a materiel thing that she would be happier.
Thats a wrong way to think, and if children already think that way in a young age, they will end up being a shoppaholic when they are going to be older and having a hard time.
They always will be thinking, that buying a lot of trendy and exoensive things is what makes them happy.
But on the other hand, you could say, that TV itsself isnt good for the right development of a children in a young age.
So it doest matter if the children are watching dump cartoons or advertisings were at least a few people can earn some money.
So its overreacted, when for exapmle parents are making a drama out of advertisings, when their children are sitting 2 hours per day in front of a TV.
Because if the advertisings really would distract them, they just could take the children to a playground or even just watch a DvD.
We can see, that we cant just say "No" or "Yes" to advertisings for children.
But what I think, is that the development of a child is not being supported with false images of what is important in life and what not.
But I think we also could use that as a chance to make a change in the world, because to be real, mostly evrey family nowdays has a TV , and television is watched from time to time.
So why not use this as something good?
Just make advertisings were children can learn from, and it wouldn't be a problem for anyone anymore.
I want to state the cons first.
I think it is not very good making advertisements like that.
Lets give it a look from the psycological side.
Young children get influenced very fast and that by nearly anything at that age.
That is probably even a scientific fact.
Big toy companies can aim for that age with some advertising and hook up the children with their goodlooking toys.
This may sound pathetic in a way, but it really is.
Children in that certain age are not mature enought to handle money with the same value as to an adult and if the companies don't mess up the ad they can really inplant the wish for that toy in a childs mind.
That sounds very negative for sure, but it can definitely cause some harm.
For example a poor family is watching tv, then there is that ad about what not of a toy and the boy/girl is totally into that.
They want it at any circumstance, but because of the familys lag at money they can't afford it.
That is unpleasent for the child and for the parens as well.
The next negative thing i noticed when I was watching tv as a child, the stereotypes.
Girly stuff is totally covered in pink and the boys stuff is full of manly things or styles.
I can understand why companies make that but it is not helping children getting along eachother better than without toys.
As an example I can take my childhood.
There were some cool toys for girls and I really liked them.
Because of the Pink package, pink manual, pink toy itself tho, I never really wanted to get them.
It's kind of a little detail, but when there was something you liked and it wasn't for your gender, it was not really acceped by others.
Profit is the companies goal and I'm totally fine with that.
But the companies have to spread the awareness about their products, so advertising is still a profitable thing to do.
And when there was something I was looking for and it was mentioned in an advertisement, I was happy.
Basically I think these advertisements should still be allowed, but regulated by some laws concerning the psycological
The subject over which I'm going to write is the television advertising towars young children and if that shouldn't be allowed.
One reasen for arguing this these is that the raise of the children at this age, should fully be under contol of their parents.
It is very dangerous showing children stuff on television, because a lot of children do what they see, so if there is someting showed on televison, it must be sure that children don't come on stupid ideas.
On the otherhand if its something about food for children or something like that, I suppose that it then would be okay, perhaps not an advertisment about a fast food restaurant or unhealty food at all.
Advertisments can also be thaughtful and can wider their knowledg, for example showing parts of the world or things on the hole which they never saw before.
There are always "good" advertiments, for example some years ago there was one from Coop with the singer Stress, he was talking/singing about our world, and that was the first time I was thinking about our world and that our world has to be protected.
But most of the Companys which make advertisments on televison for their product, just want to make money and that has most of the time not such a good influence on the children who are looking this advertisments.
To conclude, I think it would be better if there aren's special advertisments directed to young children.
It is to dangerous and to be honest, children at this stage of life shouldn't be watching television, so economicly it would also soesn't make a lot of sence.
More and more companies use television advertising to speak directly to their audience: Young children aged two to five.
They want to spread their products for childs and influence them.
But is this a legit method to sell more product?
Should television advertising toward young children not be allowes?
Critics say that there is always a free market, even in advertising.
For this reason, companies should also be free to make advertising to young people.
Another point is that with ads speaking to the children, they can also learn something about business that really concern them.
Otherwise, they just see ads for adults, which they propably don't understand.
When watching TV, they get into a world that made from adults for adults, and that may propably influence their innocent childhood negatively.
Supporters of a ban have opposite strong arguments.
They say that children in this age are too young to have an own opinion.
If they now see an advertising where something is promoted as a incredibly good and cool thing, they automatically want it, even it's nothing they could use or have pleasure on.
If children now want such a product, it's hard for parents to deny it.
This decreases parent's autority, when there is another force (next to the parents) that tells the children what to do.
In my opinion, this sort of advertising should be prohibited, as it may harm a child's own world which is to protect with all available forces.
It is better to speak to parents when there is to sell a product for children, because they have the risk for their children and they are old enough to decide, if they want to buy a product for their sons and daughters or if they better leave it.
Television advertising

Nowadays television advertising is an important topic.
With those ads people get manipulated to be better consumers.
Children are an important group of custmers because it is easier to catch them with advertising and they do not really know that there is some advertising company behind who gets all the money.
The youth of todays society should not be more interested to consumption than we already are.
Children should therefore be cancalled as an important group of consumers.
If we do not intervene children will more and more just care about money and consumption.
Like that they would lose other kinds of values such as liberty, friendship, privacy and happiness and so on.
They would be educated just for buying more of a particular good.
Nowadays every data that is given by us is collected because of the huge surveillance we got.
This together with the advertising is used to get to know what people want in order to make them better consumers.
I personally think we should definitely not let this happen to our kids.
In my opinion the world is already more than keen enough on money so we should not never allow television advertising which is directed to young children.
This would be even worse than what advertising is doing whit all other people.
Television itself gets more and more important and that is why the advertising would work more efficient too.
Many children watch television but in the advertising for playthings the children also won't that.
Should be television advertising not be allowed directed toward young children (aged tow to five)?
This question I'm disgusting in this essay.
If young children watch television, they don't has to watch the advertising, so it is okeay that they diricted advertising toward the children.
The parents can take their child away from the television when it has advertisment, if the don't wont that their child watch the advertising.
It's not good for children and their parents that the television adertvising are directed toward the children, because I think it is exhauseded for the parents when the child something from the adertising will and it didn't get.
If the children wacht the advertising they learn something.
If the children watch the advertising and they didn't get the things from it, they learn that they don't can have everything.
So it can not be bad for they.
The television advertising can transform false inpressions from life.
Because in the television advertising the reality is manipulated, so the young children think that the advertinsing are the reality, but it isn't.
For exaple in the advertising someone can fly, so the young children think that humans can fly, but it's wrong.
I think, it isn't alright that they directed the television advertising toward the children.
But I also think that two to five years old children doesn't have to watch television.
So they also don't have to watch the television advertising.
Many companies pay a large amount of money in order for their advertisements to be aired on Television.
They are not only directed to teenagers and adults but more often to children.
Survays proof that advertisements do in fact work and can manipulate us into purchasing the product shown.
We as adults can comprehend the affect advertisements have on us and resist.
Children on the other hand, especially toddlers aged two to five, are very naiv.
Are advertisements for children as young as two morally wrong or just another maerketing demographic?
Businesses sell products.
In order to sell them they need advertisements and in order to sell alot and make lots of profit they have to have a wide range of demographics to cater to.
This is how our economy works.
Children love toys and their parents often fullfill many of their wishes.So there shouldn't be a big deal that businesses take this opportunity and profit from it.
Childern wan't everything they see -  it doesn't have to be from an advertisement particularly.
It could be a toy another child in kindergarten has or even adult things like clocks oder laptpos.
It is the parents who have money and because of that they are responsible for what they buy for their child.
It is their parenting that makes the child thankfull or greedy.
But advertisments to manipulate is which could be seen as morally wrong.
Even though we might not believe that we could be that easily manipulated, it is mostly the case.
We might not want to buy the product but we do remember the brand.
As an example: you might see an advertisement about X Brands hair dye.
You might think at that particular moment that you don't need hair dye.
But later in time, maybe weeks or months later, you'll be in the supermarket looking for some hair dye.
And while you can't decide which one to get you suddenly remember this advertisement you saw a long time ago.
And unconciousley you take X hairdye and buy it.
So if it can manipulate even us adults, who can reflect on information, advertisment must have a big affect on gullable little children.
In todays world society has already gotten very materialistic.
We want a lot and we buy a lot.
Often times unnecassary things.
Isn't it our duty then to protect our children from this materialistic world as long as possible.
A child could be happy with just a stick as a toy.
But as soon as he sees all these advertisement promoting plastic guns, dolls, tablets etc.
they get brainwashed into thinking that they have nothing and need more toys.
Because of that they get unsatisfied and angry which could lead to even more tantrums then toddlers already do and to spoiled children.
There is no reason a child between the ages of two and five should be want more than basic supplies it needs to live.
At that age they can't even comprehend their surroundings so why fill them with all these false desires and corrupt their vurnerable mind.
My opinion is very clear.
Todays society is really materialistic and I think it's disgusting how corporations are now catering to young children.
Instead of spending quality time with them more parents leave them alone with toys, most of the time technology like tablets and phones.
There is no need for children of that age range to be confronted with advertisements.
Today most of these children are watching tv or playing games on the Ipad every day.
So they are confronted with advertising in different ways.
I don't really know if they recognize it truly when they play a game or watching a film.
But the advertising has not to be an advertising aged for older people.
They shouldn't see any advertising which they don't really understand.
But I think it shouldn't be banded because everywhere are advertising messages in your life and older people are confronted too with them why not young kids too?
It's not anything that hurts or makes your stupid, it's just a way get more customers for this product.
Some could say you should not manipulate such young kids and it's horrible for the parents when their kids want to have all these toys or other things which they've seen in the television.
I think it would be better when those kids could go in the city and walk into a store and see what they really want to have.
Not that they are at home sitting on the couch and drinking a soft drink while they're watching tv and then they see what they want to have.
Also young people are interested in many different things so if they see a teddybear they wanna have it or if they see not real money to play with they also want to have it too.
For the parents it's not everytime easy to complain why they can't have all those toys and things they've seen on television.
I can't really say if it shouldn't be allowed or it should be but the number and the kind of it does really matter.
I think today the social media is an important part in the life of these young children so you can't live without advertising on television.
The best thing would be when the parents set a time of watching tv, probalby one hour per day.
The rest of the day the kids should go outside and play with their friends in the garden or going in the forest.
Because then you don't have these problems at all.
Children are just playing and having fun with each other and the advertising on television isn't a problem.
"Today, most of the children aged two to five aren't interested in playing outside, because they prefer watching television though."
That's what most of the people think now a days.
But is it better to forbid the TV?
I see the point about the missing time outside, playing with other children, running around in summer, building snowmen in winter or playing with animals.
It's very important to children to make friends.
But without going outside, it isn't possible.
But why forbid watching TV at all?
I mean, when I was little, I was allowed to watch television, but I had a limit.
And that's what children today need too.
When the have a limit, they can go out too and make their expierences in the real world.
By the way, not all shows in TV are dumb.
There are some really good shows, for example Dora.
The children are learning english while watching the show.
Also, children can learn much about freindship, helping each other or being courageous.
Some people think, watching television is bad for the childrens eyes.
Well, I'm not a doctor, but I don't think it's that bad.
One more argument against the forbid is, it's the today's world.
The world is full of tecnic!
So children should be allowed to live modern too.
I think my opinion about that statement is clear.
Children should definitely be allowed to watch TV, even in young age.
As long as it's not the whole day, I can't see the problem.
Everyone saw advertisements for sweets and toys in television.
Every company has the sweeter swts or the better icecream.
Now there's the question if it's fair to use unknowing children to sell their products?
In the following text I'm going to talk about this.
Adults are responsible for there child.
For there education and their consumation of modern media like Television.
They have to tell their children tha they should not belive everything they see or hear in TV.
If the children want to buy those toys they should do it.
Otherwise they'll never learn ho to properly deal with money and our free market system in our capitalistic world.
Otherwise a child should have other problems than having to save money to buy the newest vidiogame represented as so calling good for them.
They should play outside and meet friends and play with them.
Therefore its ruthless to start propaganda that five year olds always have to eat unhelthy stuff and play with rubbish produced in China.
After all children shouldn't be an advertising target.
They often don't know how to deal with money or are to naiv to get the point that they get used for profit.
Modern media shouldn't be a crime.
Everything has an effect on small children.
They want to imitate their surrounding.
It doesnt matter if its their parents, strangers they meet or Television advertisment.
All in all they are very easy to manipulate.
Advertisement is made to make a product more attractive.
Children are a good way to get their parents to buy your product.
Some parents can say no if their child want to have something and wil buy it for them.
Children also dont know what they really need.
They just want everything they see and dont have.
Thats why advertisement directed to young children is very effective and commonly used.
In america for example only one out of 200 food advertisments on television is for healthy food.
But the other 199 are for sweets and fast food.
Children will think that fast food and sweets are the main nutrition.
If the parents allow them to have these kind food then they could get addicted to it.
This problem would get out of hand and there would be child obesity like in the USA.
I agree that bad television advertisment directed to young children should be banned.
But I think all bad advertisment shouldn't be allowed for children not just television advertisment.
With bad advertisement I mean everything that doesnt benefit the childs life.
But good advertisement like the healthy food one should be allowed because it shows the children how to live a healthy life.
When you watch television, there is always that little thing disturbing you.
It is called advertising.
A couple of adverts take young children to sell their product.
A lot of people think that the use of children in television advertising is bad.
According to these people the adverts show a different image of the reality.
Yet, there are people who support this idea as well.
They say the children only do it if they want to and if they have fun whilst doing it.
Many companies try to sell their products with the children playing in the adverts.
They want to show that the product spreads happiness and joy.
Kids are a good way to express that.
They are happy about the little things in life and they don't think too much about an issue.
Therefore, I understand why they use children.
I want to buy something much more if the adverts shows happiness.
If the kid is having fun during it, why should it be bad?
Unfortunately, there are not only good sides within this issue.
Companies want to get a good image with cute children in their advertising however, they treat them bad which leads to the children not enjoying it anymore.
In addition, sometimes the kid has a lot of pressure by his parents which want their child to become a star.
At the end, I think it is not bad to use children for advertising.
As long as it enjoys what he does I don't see any problem in this.
Yet, in my opinion, there should also be strict conditions on working time and how to treat the child.
To the question about telivison advertising for little children, I thinkt there are two sides.
But for me there are more arguments against, than for it.
On one hand children in this age don't know anything about money and how to earn it.
So they could spend a fortun in toys and stuff whitout knowing its value, or how much money they wasted.
But on the other side the children could see their dream toy.
They could save their money till they get this toy.
That could be the positive side.
But there is the point, that children are very easy manipulated.
It doesn't take very much to make a kid think "that toy is the best thing, that will ever happen to me" so they need to buy it.
As a fact; televison advertising is more evective on every human, incloudet adults, becouse it doesn't only affects on the sense of seeing.
Even greater is the affect on young childeren.
Televioson advertising is dangerous, thats also the reason why ads of zigarrets is forbidden.
A new argumen against it is, that if children want something, they get it.
They cry until her mom buys her everithing.
They just look cute and they now all the triks to get their wish come true.
All together: I think that shouldn't be allowed, becouse this type of advertising can make you buy nearly anything.
I mean how haven't spend to much money on much to expensive pokemon cards, or other overselled toys, which were never be used anyway.
Nowadays, television advertising is becoing more and more important, as lots of people own such a device and use it daily.
With such a great popularity it is inevitable that the little children are going to watch TV from time to time as well.
The advertisers, who of course always want to make the biggest profit possible, make use of this and develop advertisment specifically directed toward the young children.
But should that really be the case?
Young children are easily influenced by their environment.
Eventhough the TV advertisment isn't always showing the reality, the children might perceive it as real life and thus be disappointed when it doesn't turn out as they expected.
Children between the age of 2 and 5 years don't think rationally yet.
Once they see something they want, they won't think of anything else.
They consider neither the price nor the usefulness of the wanted thing.
Another good reason to prohibit TV ads designed for young children could be that it won't even be the children who are going to decide whether to buy the product or not.
The advertising companies put a great pressure onto the parents, who more likely will purchase the product when being begged by their kids rather than watching another advertisment on the TV.
Without the advertisment, the children probably would not devote as much time to unoriginal merchandise of their favorite movie character or in general watching TV.
I think children should not have everything they want just layed by their feet, but rather use their imagination in order to fight boredom.
In my opinion, childdren should enjoy building a hut in the forest with their best friend much more than playing with the lates Barbie(TM) dolls their parents bought them because they coincidentally watched the ad out of boredom.
TV ads don't do any good to today's youth and if an advertisment has to be diredted to the children, it should maybe be more like a pep talk to go out and play and not to buy a consumer product.
Therefore I think it would be justified if TV ads directed toward young children should not b allowed.
There are many advertisments directed towards young children.
Those usually include adverts for kids TV shows, pre-school necessities and toys.
The question of, if it should be allowed or not, is debatable.
With advertisements directed at kids, it is usually meant to give them more incentive to ask their parents to buy it for them.
People in marketing know, that parents usually can't say no, when their daughter or son is begging them for whatever it is they saw on the television.
The only real loss of this, is the money that the guardians of the child spent.
But there are other consequences of advertising for children.
If kids see more of what they enjoy being displayed on TV, then they will be more likely to watch more of it.
The concern here is, that young children should not be spending a lot of time in front of a screen, because their minds and bodies are still developing.
If we take that into consideration, then there should definately be some regulation on advertisments for children.
On the other hand, people have the right to advertise their products on television, even if they are for young children.
If the products were harmful to the children, it would be something different.
But all that the toys and other products do, is give children more entertainment.
Since young kids are known for being hyper active and very easily bored, this is very benificial to them.
In conclusion, I see no real reason why advertisments directed at children should be strictly forbidden.
I could, however, see the logic behind regulating them to some extent, so that kids do not feel the need to sit in front of the TV all day.
I think the best way would be to have a nice mix.
Any child should be able to watch a few minuets during the day his or her favorite series.
It's not just that series make dumb, there are a lot that actually really help children to learn something.
The child during the age of two to five has the most cappacity of learning something.
So if a child watches a show like "Dora", where they are learning words from english why should that be bad?
There acutally have to be some boundries, because if you let your child watch too much television it will become addicted and will forget about his/her social live.
That would probably be the worst, because every kid should still play more outside with his/her friends than be at home and watch television.
The other point is, if you let your child watch as much as it wants to and then just say it should immidiatly stop, the child will become angry and begin even maybe to cry.
Thats why there should be some boundries.
Maybe one houre per day is enough.
One other thing is that if you don't let your child watch any show it will not be able to talk with friends at school about any show and so it could become bullied by the other chidren.
Essay: Advertising directed toward young children

Many people think that advertising directed toward young children influences their minds in a very negative way.
Some even say it's illegal manipulation, because the mind of a small child is very fragile.
Everything a young child sees influences his way of thinking, his memorys and his habits.
For example if a child sees a spot where other children in his age violently destroy a doll, the child autamatically wants to take part in the shown activity.
Advertising becomes reality, you could say.
First thing to say is that it wouldn't be fair for all the advertisement corporrations and industries.
It's not possible to forbid it because everyone has the right to produce and show commercials, no matter to whom.
Plus at the end you are the one who decides what kind of programms your children are allowed to watch.
On the other side there would be a big advantage in forbiding advertising direceted toward young children, because many speculations and fears of (for ex.
his son's mind getting mnipulated and sort of controlled) would finally take an end.
Bygetting rid of these commercials there would also be more time for actual series instead of advertisings, which's durration is still growing!
But the people who proeduce these kinds of advertising would'nt have work anymore.
Also toy industries and other playstores would lose a big chance to make commercial about their products.
I think if people don't want their children to watch advertisement then there are other options.
A suitable solution would be to specifically watch episodes of the child's favorite TV series on the computer.
There might be some commercials aswell but at least you can install an addblocker or something like that.
An other advantage of this methode is that you can control and therefor reduce a child's watching time.
So in my opinion you cannot forbid some kind of commercials and leave the others untouched.
There should either be a huge change in advertising or nothing.
Alright, that's a really difficult statement to argue about.
So first, let's find out, what this statement means.
It means that young children between two and five years shouldn't be influenced by the television, so they shouldn't watch TV.
If we say, a child can't watch TV, it plays with other untechnolized products which aren't as dangerous as technology to find out some things a children shouldn't or to see something which can dramalize a young child.
But television "canals" mostly have some shows which are made for them and are helpfull to learn about our earth, our world and the life which is waiting for the young guys.
But a bad point of the television nowadays are the propagandas for all new playproducts.
A child can always see other cool and interesting things to play and can't see how much he already has at home.
So watching TV makes one's child unthankful and it wants always more.
They want some things which the parents maybe can't afford and as a gift for for the last christmaspresent, they have a sad or angry child at home.
They shouldn't get so influenced by the technology nowadays.
It's horrible how they try to manipulate the guys before the TV.
In this reason, it should be forbidden for the children and also for the parents.
But if I think on the first point i've manchened, whatching TV shouldn't be forbitten, but it should be in the sight of the parents so it won't be too much a day.
The parents should be aware what their child is doing and what he's watching!
Today there are many television advertisiung directy towared to young children, older children and also for adults.
There are adverts like for chocolate, dating  apps and anything else.These adverts manipulate your brains and the stuff for which they make adverts are generally shown better as they really are.
Older people like teenagers or adults would understand if the product is good or not, but should it be allowed to produce television advertising directed toward to young children?
First of all young children shouldn't watch television at the age of two to five.
They should play around, learn how to go, learn how to speak and many more.
Its not good to watch television or play games like our generation is doing at these days.
Nowadays you see often children with iphones or ipads.
They waste their childhood with these electronic stuff.
As I was a child I played around with my sister or played soccer with my dad.
But otherwise there are also good television programmes to learn english like Dora or there are nowadays also apps on the television to learn to speak english or something else.
Parents should only allow their children to watch these stuff and not stuff like normal television programmes with all these television adverts.
Producing Television advertising especially for children is also a money waste.
I dont think that they are going to understand a lot by watching these adverts, because they aren't ready to go on with what they see at this age.
But it also can be that they only recognize what they see.
For a example, they see chocolate or something else, so they consider on that thing to buy it but they do not recognize how bad it could be for them.
In my opinion television advertising toward young children should not be allowed, because the hard fact is that they just should not watch television at this Age.
The producers want to manipulate the brains of this young children with this adverts but i think its a money waste and a thing which makes no sense to me.
Generally they won't understand anything or they just recognize the pictures and after that they consider to buy that what they saw, because they dont understand if it's good or bad to them.
Enterprises do absolutly everything to sell more products.
One way to do it, is by showing ads on TV.
There are advertisments on adult channels but there are also ads on channels for young childrens.
Should this be allowed?
Is it okay to show television advertising directed toward young kids between the age of two and five?
I think that it shouldn't be allowed to show tv ads to young children.
We all know how childrens behave when they really, really wan't something.
The childrens don't understand how complex the world is and which evil tactics the enterprises use trying to influence them.
The kid only wants to enjoy the shows he or she is watching and they don't understand that the ads between two episodes wants to make them buy something.
They start to cry because they see this toy that they really want.
And they cry for a long time.
What should the father or the mother do?
Of course they go to the shop and buy this toy.
It's such a simple tactic yet quite efficient.
Mainly because the kid isn't aware of his behaivour, I think it shouldn't be allowed to show ads on television who are directed to young childrens between the age of two and five.
Advertising directed towards a specific croud is probabally the most efficent way of marketing.
But should it be allowed to show adds directed toward children aged tow to five on television.
Young children can very easliy be manipulated with one way beeing television advertising.
If children constantly are spolied with adds of some toys for instance, they most likely want their parents to buy them that specific toy.
This    then requires some reliable parenting.
On the other hand, if television advertising directed towards children would be forbiden, there wouldn't be less advertising between the shows or children programms.
What mostliklely would happen is a change of topics ot these adds.
Instead of showing adds directed towards children, there could be adds containing contend whitch maybe shouln't be shown to children.
Ofcorse thats the extrem version of what could happen but I think it illustrates my point very well.
And after all children probabbaly even enjoy watching these adds as they normaly are created in a funny way.
Television advertising directed towards young children should still be allowed.
As they are directed towards young children, they rather watch these than others.
Alltought there has to be some sort of rules attached to it.
Adds containing overly agressive marketing should be forbidden.
Television advertising has increased a lot in the last ten years.
To place a product between two TV-shows or even in a TV-show can be very lucrative.
But there are people who say that this is not good for children between two and five years.
In my opinion television should be allowed but just in small ammounts because it is really unhealthy.
The brain can not fully develope if they do watch too much television.
But i dont think that  a small ammount of television is too bad.
If ou watch a presentation of Manfred Spitzer he can explain you every single detail.
He is a professor for neurosciences.
If you want you can also ask Samuel Tschokke he is a very good informed man if you want to know something about biology.
When i was a child i didnt watched too much television but sometimes i watches some Walt Disney movies together with my family.
I think this has yust a good influence as long as the consume isnt too high.
This was a beautiful essay and i am so glad that YOU can read and correct it.
I hope you have much fun to read it and hamachsafang.
I'm going to write about the use of the television from young childrens.
Why should young children (aged two to five) already use a Television?
Would a Television advertising direct toward young children be a problem for there developpement.
It became something usual or nearly normal, that a Television is a kind of basic object for the ideal home.
But it wasn't everytime like this.
The Television came up in the las century and now it is a part of the humanity.
A Television is ideal to check the news, to kill boredom ore just to enjoy a lazy evening.
Why should this be forbidden for young childs, a Television is harmeless.
I remember that I used to watch Television with my parents when i was younger.
It was a giant grey maschine which looked like a square.
I grew up with looking the "Schlümpfe" ore "Flipper" and so on but just because my parents had chosen those channels wich I "had to watch".
Now, about 15 Years later a Television is much more easyier to use and because of the comming up of the Technology in humanity a lot of parents don't even check what there childs are watching.
There are a lot of chanals wich I child might not should see.
There is a reason why all those Film have a sticker on them on wich the adult for the watchers is written.
A child should not be allowed to chose the Televisionprogramm in such a young age.
The parents should spend more time with them and also not that much in front of the television.
It is important that those child gain progress for there Delevopment and it isn't the ideal way to let them gain there progress infront of a Television, because we all know there is a lot of unnessesary stuff in this "world".
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed...?
(I never had a Tv at home, so I don`t know much about it...)
pro: 
- bloody pictures, viedos
- the content isn`t for their age
- sexual content 
- bad influence
- THEY SHOULD GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY THEIR, THEY DONT HAVE TO WACH TV!
contra: 
- how you wanna forbit it?
- parents have to decide waht their children can wach

I think the biggest problem is, if the parents are waching tv all day long, I understand that their kids are waching too.
But I think the most thinks that are shown in Tv is wronge, stupid or a bad influence.
There are so many progarmms wich bloody staff and their is also a lot of sexual content.
their are also good and helpfull thinks in tv but it`s just a small part of it.
The kids shouldn`t wach much Tv in this age.
It would be better if they play outside or inside with friends in their age.
Now a day many childrens haven`t a childhood more because they were all the time wich electronic staff.
(tv, mobilphone, playstation) But I think it`s very dificult to forbit it in general.
My opinon is that it should be a decison of the parents.
Television is in our society a common way to influence people's thinking.
Therefore can specific advertising have a big effect on our actions.
Adults usually have a lot of experience in telling wether someone's trying to manipulate them or not.
Most children though don't have this experience.
That makes it very easy to convince them that for example a certain product is essental to have.
Also, today, television is a common way of entertaining young children.
Because of that it is very likely that many children will see the advertising, which has the power to spread it's message fast.
Depending on what the message is, that might not be a welcomed effect.
On the other side, advertising which is directed toward children usually isn't intending to cause any harm.
Mostly it deals with things like toys.
The only real effect this would have on a child is, that the child has the desire to possess this item.
Except for some arguments between the child and the parents, there shouldn't be many othe effects.
Also children often don't even think about what they had just seen on television and it's likely that the advertising has hardly any influnce at all.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children isn't dangerous in any way.
Therefore I don't think that it shouldn't be allowed.
Besides that, I think putting up laws against that kind of "problem" seems to me like a waste of time and resources, which we should use on more important subjects.
I belive that we should trust our society enough to let everyone deal with that kind of problem on their own.
Should be television advertising forbidden for young children aged two to five?
We are living right now in a technical world and in the wealth areas of the world is a living without electric issues not possible or just not to think about.
The children nowadays grow up completly different than I did.
And when my parents didn't allowed me to watch lovely episodes like 'Biene Maya' or 'Pumuckel', I think my parents would have had several problems with me of course.
Because watching TV was always a time to relax.
But the films I watched were so lovely and there wasn't any violence to see.
But that was because we could only watch films and not surf through several TV-channels.
And thats the big different between these days and the old days.
These days, it's so easy for the kids to know how an electirc machine works and so they are theoretically able to watch the biggest bullshit in the TV.
And this could be very unhealthy for her mind.
The TV can have a lot of bad influence and I'm personally glad, that I don't watch TV anymore.
I think the kids should play outside than sitting inside and watching TV or playing with a smartphone.
Otherwise the kids can't build up a relation between themselves and the nature, they don't get confronted with the reality and they will be allergic against many things of the nature.
But I think it's also important, that when a rule like this is coming up, it should be controlled in a good way.
Otherwise there are gonna be like two groups of children, the ones who never watched TV befor and the other ones who are always talking about series and stuff.
Today we can see advertisement everywhere, it belongs to our world.
Every company has one for their products, even schools have some, so it seems that it's normal for us.I could even say that it would be rather strange if the streets were empty and there wouldn't be any of them.
So back to the statement.
There is a lot of television advertising especially for young children.
Most of them are for toys and small games which were made for children.
Of course when young children see the advertisment they likely want to have this exact toy.
But on the one hand this is a good thing for the parents.
If they don't know what the next birthday present should be, they can easily decide with these advertisments.
The children help the parents and give them some hints.
I used to do this with my parents too, I told them what I saw on the TV or in the shops and they used to buy me the toy.
On the other hand it could be that the kids want lots of things and they don't stop complaining about it.
They get angry and sad and the parents can't find no other escape and they have to spend a lot of money for every single product which was shown in the TV.
That often happens today, I see that with my neighbour's daughter, she gets everything she wants, because she doesn't stop complaining about it.
Another negative aspect is that the children watch too much TV.
They want so see every new thing which is out on the market and they keep watching and watching.
They spend too much time watching TV than going out and playing with their friends.
I can clearly see that with my sister and her friends.
They would rather watch some advertisements than going out even on a sunny day.
Still many young children, especially from two to five, don't have a chance to go to a shop and look at things and buy it themselves.
They are too young and maybe the parents don't have much time.
So the television advertising gives them a good possibility to see what's going on in the shops and on the market and they can make their wish lists for christmas much easier.
So it's also good for the parents they don't need to spend much time going into a shop with their children.
I disagree with the statement above, because I think television advertising means no harm to anyone.
Every company and every shop needs to find a way to sell their products.
Further I don't think that they "brainwash" the children's mind, I think the children got used to it and they don't even notice the advertisement anymore.
It's also an easy way for the parents to find an accurate present for their children.
The young children should go out and play with other children.
They should discover the world and not wasting their time at home staring at the television.
Because if they don't learn to go out that will never change.
Human beings aren't made to stay only at home and that's the biggest danger for the young children.
And also the UV-rays can be dangerous for these.
We all know that the technology isn't very healthy for us.
That's a reason why we should short the using of technology.
Of course there is also a good thing of looking television, especially for kids.
So they can learn something new.
Young children (aged two to five) are in the phase where they first must learn the language.
So television is a good thing to learn a lot of new words.
So I'm not definitively agree with this statement.
It should not be disallowed but the parents should take care of the young children that they don't stare the hole day at the television.
I absolutely agree with this statement.
TV adverstising directed toward young children should be illegal.
Young children can`t buy the product the adverstising is for anyway.
So the advertising should be directed towards their parents and not towards them.
this can be very problematic for the parents when they don`t want to buy a certain product or can`t afford it.
nowadays children are exposed to advertising everywhere.
So I think TV should ot support this and make it worse.
of course young children are very important customers and many factories produce tons of toys, clothes and food only for them but in my opinion it should not be allowed to make advertising for someone who isn`t able to buy something on themselves.
The TV advertising mostly shows things which kids don`t necessarily need but it manipulates them so they believe they need it.
And they could make their parents big problems when begging for a toy or whatever tey saw on TV .There could be a damage done in the happy family life when parents and children are fighting over something ugly like this.
in order to protect the family advertising should not be allowed.
Dependig on what the advertisement is, it may also be unhealthy for a kid.
For example if it`s for sweets or games.
the young child won`t understand this and be mad at the parents who are only caring about their child.
what I`m trying to say is that advertisment could make it difficult for parents to raise their kid the way they want and buy him or her the things they think it needs.
So in conclusion I think that the TV adverstisement should be directed toward parents and not toard theit children.
Now our days, the young children watch a lot of TV and there are more and more television advertising directed toward them.
Which influence does it have of our future generation?
Should we bane it?
At first, young children take example of what they see.
If they see other children playing with LEGO, they want to do the same.
So they ask them parents to gave them one for their birthday or for christmas.
But no all parents have the money to buy what thier children ask to.
On the other hand, if the television advertising is good, it can show the children what they should or should not do.
For example an advertising showing children eating fruits and legums.
In this case, it is good thing that the children do the same.
Nevertheless, a young child has not the critising sense.
If he does not have the toy he saw on TV, he would be very sade.
Because in the television advertising, the children were happy with this toy, and he would think that if he does not have this toy, he could not be happy.
To conclude, I think we should bane commertial advertising directed to young childen on television.
My personal opinion on this subject is that it should not be forbidden, even though I don't think it's a good thing.Young children, especially from the ages two to five, are easily manipulated.
Once they see something in an ad, they instantly want it.
This can be extremly annoying for the parents of these children as often the minors don't need the advertised products but they feel like they do.
Many parents aren't financially able to buy there kids everything they want and many also believe the don't need it either.
My opinion though is that you can not forbid advertising for such a specific target group.
If you want to ban advertising for younger children then you have to ban advertising completly.
I think it would be alright if some broadcast companies decided they don't want to show ads for minors becasue of their companies morals.
I do not agree however that they should not be allowed completly.
The whole idea of advertising is to influence people and motivate the viewers to buy the advertisers products.
If anything, advertiments for adults should be banned as theyactually have the financial power to buy what ever they want or what ever they think they want.
And what else shoud be shown on television channnels dedicated to children; ads for shaving equipment, tampons and washing powder?
No, children should be allowed to watch ads directed at them.
bI also remember when I was younger that I liked to watch ads, even though I knew I could never have the desired product.
Kids like to dream and imagine and part of that is fantasising about birthday and christmas presents and of toys they will never have.
You could also argue that these young children learn that they can't have everything they want in life and it also forces the parents to be a bit stricter with their children and not give in and buy them everything, meaning it teaches both discipline.
Advertising directed toward young children has been a critical topic for years.
It is a powerful meaning to speak directly to children and make them want things really bad that they didn`t even know about five seconds earlier.
But before arguing about whether advertisement is good or not, I think you need to make a difference between advertising for things that don`t do no harm to children, such as toys or events for kids, and things that really are bad for children, fast food chains for example, like McDonald`s or Burger King.
Since children don`t have much experience they do not really know what is good for them and what is rather unhealthy.
So if they see a funny advertising of McDonald`s in TV that, overall even promises them a toy delivered with their happy meal, they might feel the need to eat unhealthy things, which is rather bad.
Children are easily influenced, so I think it could be seen as dangerous to advertise for children.
On the other hand children are still people.
So wouldn`t not showing advertisements for them mean to kind of disrespect them?
Moreover, TV advertisements can have a good influence on children.
For example, if you advertise a sports camp in TV that children all over the country can go to, you motivate children to stay active and be healthy.
Also, toys aren`t so bad, as long as they don`t have anything to do with people fighting and hurting each other.
I think that advertising for children is a really difficult and complex topic.
There are things being advertised that, at least in my opinion, children should not be confronted with at all.
But they can also influence kids in a positive way.
I think the solution would be to simply decide for each advertisment whether it influences kids in a good or in a bad way.
The positive ones can be played, while the rather negative ones should be banned from TV.
But still, who is going to decide which advertisements are good and which ones are bad?
"Mom, there was this super cool advertisement about the new LEGO police station.
Can I please get it?"
We have all heard children asking there parents about productspresented by advertisements.
Television advertising toward young children is a big topicnowadays.
So the following essay is going to be about the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
There are many pro- and many contra-arguments, I am going to start with a pro-argument, followed by a contra-argument, and I will end this essay with a conclusion.
Firstly, you have to think about the strength of these advertisements, they are in a way comparable to probaganda.
If a young child sees a advertisement, by watching televicsion, the first thing it is going do, is to ask its mother about buying the products it has seen in the advertisement.
For instance, the example in the introductiory part, toy advertisements will lead the child to go and ask its parents, to buy these presented toys.
The problem is that the child does not care about the financial situation , or the company that produces the toy.
So it can not set its own mind.
Secondly, you have to think of young children watching television.
The problem is that it can not take up all the information seen, as fast as adults do.
So if you have a toy company, the best tactic is to show the costumers the product by advertising it.
So why should a toy company not show advertisements in the television of the products they sell, to their customers?
Compared to advertisements for unintresting products for a child, for exymple a car, it is nothing but fair that companies, who sell product for children, are allowed to place advertisements.
As well it is nothing but clever for the company, because in one of five cases, the advertisement will lead the parents to buy the product.
Summed up, you  could say that television advertisements for young children, are not good, nore bad.
Its a question of perspective.
On one hand, the company needs these television advertisements to sell their products.
On the other hand, it is not nice for the parents, because the child wants the produts it sees, by watching television.
I think that television advertisements are a two sided story, because for the companies they are needed to show their products.
But for the customers they are, most of the time, annoying.
I think as well that young children better shoukde go outside and play.
Television is good for learning things.
You can learn many things from the television but it matter whitch tv programm you are looking at it.
There are some tv programms which are good for learning things like galileo.
But there are also other series like Köln 50667 which aren't that good for the kids because they have many problems in this series.
When they look series like this after they think this is normal what they are doing in this series.
I think that young children shouldn't look television.
They should learn things from looking at the real life and outdoor in the nature.
It's important to be in the nature with children because the sun and the air of the nature is very good for their health.
In young age you learn many things from looking at something.
I think it's better that the children learn from their own mother or father and not from the television because the parents of the kids can controll the things that they are making and in the television they can't.
So today it's easyier to show the children tv programms then going out in the nature with them.
When you want to go out with the children it needs more time and today some parents haven't enough time for that.
So they show them the tv programm and haven't to be next to their kids and looking for them.
Most of the television advertising that is directed to children aged two to five is about toys.
Unlike adults, most children enjoy the advertisings between the shows as much as the TV show itself.
But is it corect to direct advertisings to little children?
A colorful and funny created advertising can influence a child a lot, especially a child in such a young age.
Those children will beg their parents for unnecessary toys, make their parents buy them, realize that playing with those toys is not as exciting as shown in TV and beg their parents to buy them the toy in the new advertising.
It becomes a vicious circle.
Additionally, the child possibly enjoys those advertisings since watching those funny advertisings becomes more exciting than actually playing with the toys.
This could make the child want to watch more and more television and can lead to antisocial and lazy or even obese children.
On the other hand, those advertisements have no direct harm.
If the parents can control the amount of their childs daily or weekly hours of television watching, there is no risk of addiction for the child.
Plus, the advertisings are also a help for the parents to know what goods are on the market and which toys can actually educate their child.
For example the colorful pianos that have numbers and letters and each tile and make a sound with each button pressed help the child to learn in a funny way.
Toy companies want to make people buy their toys, so where else should they show their advertisements other than on childrens TV channels?
All in all, I think it depends on the parents.
If they manage to control the influence the advertisings have on their children, their shouldn't be a problem.
Advertisings can also help the child and the parents to learn things or to know with what object the child can learn efficiently.
As long as the advertisings are appropriate there is no harm in entertaining little kids.
The intention of this essay is to say if television advertising directed toward young children, aged two to five should be allowed.
It is in fact quite annoying that while watching Television advertising always interrupts the best part of a film.
But what happens when children see direct advertising, should there by a law for what they are allowed to see?
On one hand, we all know that children are influenced by everything and quickly convinced about doing something.
They are even influenced by hidden intentions, some of them better or even worse.
The TV Industry is of a course a good media for advertise directed towards the young people and can have a really bad influence on their habit as for example the duration of watching TV through the day.
There should not be any erotic advertising on the television and also no war scenes in them.
On the other hand, young children should not be left alone and their parents are responsible for what they are allowed to see.
It is not possible or at least not a good idea to control all the channels on TV, because they have an intention that is definitely not (always) a harmful one.
Additionally young children do not really care about what is on television between their favourite series.
Even if the see an direct advertising, most of the time they do not really understand.
To conclude, from my point of view you can not control who will see the specific advertising and as a result it can not be prohibited.
In addtition, parents have got the responsibility for their children and consequently for what they are allowed to see.
Television today always includes advertisement which influences a human beinig in one way or the other to change his oppinion on certain topics, for example buying the newest gamebox or playstation in Mediamarket.
Should our youngest ones be influnced by this ?
Well, as we all know, children at that age aren't capable of deciding what is correct or not.
They just believe and do everything you say without thinking about the consequences of there actions.
If a child gets provoked various times that it should jump out of a window, because it might learn to fly like a bird, at some point it would try.
So advertisment can be very dangerous.
But thank god, at the moment as far as I know there are no such adverts.
What does appear on TV, are toy adverts.
The kids program will be interrupted at one point and the kid will be shown an image of the latest toy, often the same ad will reappear various times and with every ongoing one, the child will be more and more influenced by it and the image of this specific toy is burnt into the child's memory.
So when this toddler goes shopping with one of its parents, it will definitely point at it's memorized and now recognized toy and will start demanding for it.
The child will make a fuss and not seldom the mother will give in and will purchase the demanded toy.
So the combination of a child watching a lot of television and a inconsequent mother revolves in loosing a lot of money.
This might be called the downside of this argumentation.
The upside or pro could be, if the ad's producers would remodel and therefore recreate the whole sense of an advert, it could even be helpful for the parents.
It could teach the children not to jump out of a window.
But well, then it isn't an advert anymore, I guess.
My oppinion is that children at any age
At first I think young children shouldn`t be directed toward advertsing, advertising is something for people over the age of 10 because they can make their opinion and d`ont just watch it and think this are nice people in this this promotion of a product.
Young children also see somenthing and then they just wanna have the things from the advertsing so their parents always have to say no its not chrstmas or your birthday but then there is the problem that all parents want to be good parents and often give the children the present firstly that is fine for the children and also for the company, where they bought the product from, but for the wallet of the parents it`s not the best thing.
A big problem is also the young chidren can`t separate from the reality or from the advertising.
Young children also think everything what they see on television is true but the Company behind a promotion is often work with tricks because they know exactly that they can manipulate young children and that is the point where i think its not ok because young children get something like a brain manipulation from the television.
there is probably one point where i think that is ok when they promote something like a fun arkk for example the europa parc then it is ok because that is not something materialistic it isinsteadsomthing where the whole family can have fun.
a theend i think advertsing is bad for young children but there are
Advertising

I'm absolutely not ok with the fact, that there are so much ads in thelevisions for children.
And I think it would be absolutely ok if the gouvernment would forbide that.
It's really a shame, that such young children are confronted daily with televisionads that want to influence them to want for example this new baby born or the fastes toycar.
Children can't decide what's necessary or good for them.
They just see that ad and suddenly they want this new thing really bad.
On the other hand we could say that we're living in this new kind of world and that we're confronticed with these kind of things on a daily bases is just normal.
So because of that I think it should be much more important to inform parents about these subjects.
When we have to accept the worl as it is it's much more important to make a change there, where it acually helps.
There are a lot of parents, who leave their children (expecally in the holidays) for hours in front of the television.
This is probably the biggest problem.
Because when they wouldn't do that the children wouldn't be confronted with such television ads and then probably the producers would stop to produce ads for children because none of the chidren whold watch them.
So maybe it's not the right way to forbide these ads but change our habits and expecially help the parents who just don't know it better than leave their children in front of the tv.
I think these would be absolutely the better way.
Maybe it could also be a mixture of both of them.
When we could minimize these ads and also help the parents to be with their children and go outside with them to do things together and things like this would probably be the best solution of all.
I understand that companies make advertisements to reach more people and sell more products.
But personally, I am very annoyed when I once watch a great movie on TV and there is constant advertising.
It takes away all the fun and the tension of the movie.
When I see advertisement, it has to be really great to make me consider buying the product.
This mostly isn't the case.
Advertisement towards really young children is bad.
The advertisement doesn't even have to be good, when it shows a toy and what can be done with it, it's enough for the children to want it.
Young children are easily fooled by what's portrayed on TV.
I personally believe that this should be forbidden.
Kids should walk into a store and get the toy they like most, just based on colors, appereance and pictures, so that it is really their toy and really something they want.
They shouldn't walk into a store and look for that exact toy they've seen on TV.
They might not even like the toy too much, but if it's shown on TV, it's cool and will probably make the other kids jealous.
In todays world we're so easily manipulated by what we see on the internet and the TV.
I think it's a shame to start manipulating people from such a young age.
That's why I really am against advertisement towards children.
But not just towards children aged two to five, I think advertisement towards children up to the age of ten should be forbidden or at least reduced.
That might be a bit harder to control, because children that age might already watch programs, that are not directed towards such a young audience.
Children (aged two to five) are learning the bases of their life such as knowing wether something is good or bad.
Advertisments could strongly influent those bases and so it could possibly change the children's behaviour.
It's impossible to avoid advertisments and because of that advertisments should have to go through several tests before being published since even advertisments which target an adult audience can sometimes manipulate children.
One main reason for me to disagree is that the statemens would only forbid "television advertising" but social media is way more dangerous.
There are many five year olds who know how to use for example "YouTube" and so they could possibly see things / advertisments which aren't for their age.
Those "Pegi 18" or "FSK 18" messages won't help.
Parents should be forced to turn on a child safety mode and companies should be forced to supervise their ad system.
The worst thing that ads do is that they transmit subliminal messages.
Young children can't really think for themselves yet.
They try to copy things around them and because of that they are greatly manipulated by such messages.
Sadly I'm missing too many facts to give a more in depth explanation but I know for sure that there are many studies out there aboubt manipulation through subliminal messages.
Subjects were shown a movie wich had some frames containing a bucket of popcorn here and then and their lust for popcorn was way higher than after watching the unmodified movie.
Summary:
I disagree since advertisments, even with a target audience from two to five, should not be forbidden just more supervised.
The statement should also include every kind advertisment not just the ones being on television.
 In my opinion television advertising for young children isn't neccessary at all because it would be better for them if they would play outside and don't waste their time in front of the tv.
Another negative point is that it has got some bad influences on children f. ex.
if they see an advertising about a cool toy they're asking their parents if they could buy it.
I think it would be a lot better if the parents would give them some magazines with toys in it.
First of all it is much more natural then advertising in television and the parents know what they are looking at.
The worst point about advertising in televsion is that there are so many new toys and each of them is presented in an advertising video.
This causes that kids want all of them which could be very annoying for their parents.
Back to the option with the magazine.
If the kid sees something interesting it could ask their parents if they could buy it.
Now there are two options for the parents either going to a store or buying it online.
The first point would be the better for sure because the kid is having a real life experience.
If the parents order it online it is kinda lame because the only interesting thing is that there is a package in the briefcase.
But I think that ordering online is the best option for young adults and adults because it's much more flexible then going to stores every time.
Me as parent would allow my kids to watch tv for 30min a day which I think is pretty normal this time.
Another option is to buy them something like a gameboy or Ipod on which they can play games without advertising.
As I mentioned before the best option is to spend time outside with his kids and not let watch them tv allday long.
I think, I agree with the statement, that television advertising should not be allowed by young children.
At first I would say that children at the age of two to five are too young to know many things about the world.
They live in a world full of many other children and they have no idea what is really going on.
So I think they should do other things than beeing in a television advertising.
They should go outside, play with friends and have fun.
Everytime I look TV and I see young children are in a television advertising, I ask myself: If that is you, what would you do?
I would say, I would never be in a television advertising when I were two to five years old.
I think young children should be free and they have to enjoy life to the fullest.
Because when you get older, you will go to school every following day, at the afternoon you have to learn and you have to do your homework.
When you get older you have to work harder, you can't play with other children the whole day.
And there are many other things that aren't really great when you get older.
So when you're older and you would like to do other things than going to school or going to work, you can decide if you want to be in a television advertising.
At the age of two to five you can't decide if you want to or not.
I think at this age the parents decide what things the children are doing.
Because of these examples I have written, I say that television advertising directed toward young childred at the age of two to five should not be allowed.
Everybody who have a televsion knows it how it is when you will watch a serie or a interesting film and every thirty minutes it comes a advertising about three to five miunutes.
That can realy goes on your nervs, but it is allowed.
Is it also a good idea to screen adversting to young children?
The young children are in this age in the part, where they get away of their parent.
They bigin to distance to their parent and are more and more independence.
For example they can walk alone, eat alone and speak.
This time they want to explore the life and make a lot of new experience.
When they watch television they can't unterstand everything but even if they get older they unterstand more and more.
So when they see an advertising and it looks pritty they realy want it.
So they have desire for the birthday present or for christmas.
An other point is that they see new things for spending their time.
For example a new game.
On the other side it is no so easy for the parents, beacause when the advertising is very pritty then the children want it and asked everytime their parent to buy it.
So it can goes realy on the nerfs.
A negative point is that the children don't realy know what it is but it looks nice and on the adverting it looks very funny so they want it.
They realy get manipulated, they don't realy follow their own interest.
You should also take care if the adversting is for the age of this children or not.
Don't forget that some children get bored very fast when they see often advertising an not the serie or what they want to look.
So they easy make stupid things

All in all it isn't easy to say if it should be allowed or not.
It gives alot negative points but without the advertisig the television would have problem with the finance, because with the advertising they can pay alot of the cost and for the people it is less expensive.
I would say it should be a bit less advertising but n
Advertising on television is a huge deal.
It is really useful for enterprises using this offer, because they get the possibility to reach hundreds of people to convince them to buy exactly their chocolate, their tooth-brush or their chair.
At the age of a child your ability of learning things is the biggest, so advertising to children is very useful.
For example the "KINDER SURPRISE", an egg that is made of chocolate with a little toy inside.
Actually the perfect combination.
First eat the chocolate, then build your toy of the parts that are delivered and have fun.
MC Donald's uses this kind of advertisement in the exact same way.
In it's happy meal you find some fries, other food and a drink, and probably most importantly, the toy.
Food is not the only way to advertise children, but in my opinion it is he most likely way.
The most important thing is that children see some funny thing, a big amount of colors and characters, no matter if they are real or invented, having fun.
Advertising to children is bad.
Children get to see some products that they instantly want to buy.
You might wonder, why children watch adevetisements.
They are probably not allowed to switch the channel, because their parents told them not to.
So the little boys and girls are sitting in front of their televisions, watching the advertisesment and storing all the information in their heads.
When they go shopping the next time they kick up a fuss if they do not get, what they want.
The problem is that without advertisements television channels could no longer exist, where would they get their money from?
In my opinion advertising directely to children is a very mean thing, but there is no possibility to stop it.
It would make no sense do advertise shaving utils, coffee or cars on a childrens TV-Channel.
If an enterprise did that, they could equally just heat their headquarters burning money.
So to sum up I think advertising to children is part of the business, it's a bad part, but unfortunately an irreplaceable part.
Often, when young children return from school the first thing they do is to ask: "Mum can I watch TV?
Pleeeaaase!"
Nowadays, as there is a TV in almost every house.
Children are used to spend a  lot of their time watching TV and thus also advertisement.
Now one can ask if advertising shouldn't be allowed as young children are very in fluencable of which many advertisments take advantage.
There are many arguments which support the opinion, that children shouldn't be allowed watching TV advertising before the age of five.
As many parents tend keep them busy by letting them watch TV and thus also advertisement so that they have some time off to run the houshold or make a break.
Additionally,nowadays one cannot watch TV without simoultanously watching advertisment.
Young children are very easily influencable and it is later noticable in their shopping habits when they spend a lot of time watching advertising.
On the other hand, there are also many arguments which claim the opposite oppinion.
For instance, if the children have never been allowed to watch TV advertising before they tend to get addicted to it when they finally are.
As five years is still very young they might be that fascinated that they only want to buy the things advertised and at a age of five children might convince their parents buying the things.
At an age of two they are not as the parents can tell them off and they get used to don't get everything they want to have.
Further, in this time now the media plays a bigger and bigger role.
When the children are used to it and its influencing qualities since a very young age they won't have much problems coping with it later.
In addition, advertisement toward adults would be still allowed which can be very disturbing for children.
In conclusion, I think one should allow advertising as long as it is not too cruel or exaggerated and won't harm the children mentally so that the children can get used to it and won't be too much influenced later on.
But as a parent you should limit the time a child spends watching TV.


Banning advertisement targeting toddlers

Lately there has been some controversary concerning advertisements which target children aged two to five.
Since it has become a daily routine that from a young age toddlers watch television, they cannot get around watching advertisement.
But how could this affect those children and does this even influence them?
It is commonly known that these days, television overall has a big influence on young children.
There is a risk that they will not able to distinguish the invented world from reality.
that means that as soon as they see an advertisement trying to sell toys they will think it is essential to have one as well.
In a way companies can use advertisement to manipulate the viewers.
But that is no new thing.
The difference to adult advertisement is that parents these days are often spoiling their kids.
If a toddler comes and asks them to buy a toy, they will be more willing to do so than to buy themselves a pair of trousers or a new television.
Another aspect worth considering is that in advertisements everything tends to be depicted in an almost perfect way.
if a young child sees this and compares it to his enviroment, he or she might realize certain differnces and start preassuring the parents.
Another possibility could be that it starts to feel uncomfortable and unhappy with the living conditions.
Studies have proved that unhappyness and a demanding attitude at a young age can 
make the child depressive during adulthood and prevent it from performing his or her function in society.
To summarize the problem, it is clearly visible that advertisement can have devastating influences on a toddler.
However it is also very dependent on the amount of time it spends in front of the television and how closely it is under the supervision of the parents.
Banning advertisement targeting young children probably would not solve the problem since they are also affected by those who have adults or youngsters as a target group.
Every child starts to speak at the age of 2, so why it should not be allowed to watch advertisment ,which are dedicated towards the young among us.
They can improve there visual and speaking skills, through those interesting advertisment.
It does not seem like that they were capable to buy stuffs or even advertise for it, at this age.
In many cases children are also trapped in a social media world.
Every child nowadays has more contact with their tablets as with sport materials.
For long periods it could also effect the brain and nerves.
They will get quick furious and nervous if we would ban to watch televison or play video games.
For a loner period it could also cause many diseases at this young age.
Many of them will suffer from brain and nerve diseases, those are really rare cases but its also possible.
Advertsiments are good prepartions for school.
They can expand your vocabulary and your memory skills will increase.
In those advertisment streaming time children also have the possibility to got to the toilet or help their mother for example.
Otherwise they will stuck with the sofa and wont let their concentration rubbed by anyone.
They will recognize something at the grocerie store  that they saw on tv and won`t let go until you will buy them whatever it is.
In my opinion we should not ban the advertising for children at the age of two to five, because it`s unnecessary to do it and let them look what they want.
Your job is to entertain them nothing else.
In this century we do not know when the world is gonna end, so let them live their live.
We have other problems to look after.
All i can say is sip some lean and chill.
It will take time to find back.
Many advertisements on daytime television are directed towards children.
Whether it is the newest Nerf dart gun or a Hot Wheels toy car track, the same children's adverts are broadcast time and time again on various channels in an attempt to persuade children to persuade their parents to buy a certain product.
However, is it really fair to direct advertisements towards very young children?
A giant portion of the toy market exists because of television advertising.
Many toy companies such as Nerf or Hot Wheels practically only exist and can only sell their products and stay in business thanks to their success in advertising.
These particular advertisements are mostly directed towards older children, aged approximately seven to ten years old.
However, there are also ads with a younger target audience.
They are similarly successful and help to support a large part of the market for children's toys.
The market for young children's toys is very large and it requires the demand caused by ads.
However, the method by which these adverts are successful is not entirely ethical - they take advantage of young children's gullibility and make them believe that they absolutely have to have the product being advertised.
Needless to say, over time it can become boring and annoying for parents dealing with their children constantly begging for an overpriced piece of plastic which will be used once and then put on a shelf for the rest of its existence.
If the parents relent and buy their child what they want once, it happens again and again - the child gets used to getting what it wants and the parents waste their money.
Advertising directed towards very young children itself can also be a waste of time and money - at the age of two, a child can barely speak, let alone understand a television advert and convince their parents to buy them things.
In conclusion, television advertising directed toward young children takes advantage of the children's naïveté and, even then, doesn't always reach its target audience.
That is why I believe that it should not be allowed.
Young kids are easy to influence.
If you tell them something they will most likely believe it.
So you can tell them they will never have real fun if they don't get that toy, they will want it.
Even if they don't really like the thing, they want the fun they see in the advertisement.
So they will go to their parents and ask for it, if they are lucky they will get it, but the dissapointement is big when they realise that it's not exactly the same as the TV showed them.
So advertisement for toys for children at that age should not be allowed.
Producers use tricks to get the attention of the kids.
Children like bright colours, music and loud enthusiastic voices.
So the producers just have to make a really colorfull advertisement to get to the children.
Even better is when they use a personifcated animal or character they can identify themselves with.
We can see, manipulate children isn't that difficult and the question is, do we really want our children to be manipulated this way?
The concentration of little kids is not realy long.
They focus on something but it gets boring very fast.
It's more contraproductive to buy a child everything it wants when it plays with it only two times.
Another case is food advertisement for kids, like juices or things like that.
If we buy this the thing we buy will be consumed so it's not just lost money.
If they like it, great we can buy it again but if not the kids will know it when they see the advertisement the next time and don't want it that bad anymore, they may just enjoy the advertisement.
So for my opinion Advertisement for young children should only be for food, so the children can really play with things they have fun with and not just play with something someone told them it was fun.
The food is not a waste of money and the chance the children can get it is bigger.
And if they don't like it the parents just don't buy it again, if a kid doesn't like a toy they will have it and wont play with it anymore, so we can say that that is a waste of money.
Toys can be seen at toystores where they often can try it and see if they like it.
Television advertising is often an issue, especially when it is directed toward young children.
Some people argue it shouldn`t be allowed anymore, others disagree.
What are the arguments of both sides and which is the right way to go?
A search for answers in form of an essay

Young children are the most vulnarable human beings in our society.
Since they don`t have a value system or a guiding vision yet, they are in danger of being manipulated too much by Television advertising.
This because they do not know what is right or wrong, they are still building up their value systems.
If now advertising tells them ``this is good for you, you must have it`` they could just believe it - without being aware of the consequences, risks and meanings of buying that product.
This may, on the first glance, does not seem to be a very disturbing thing, but what if the children are manipulated with long-term effects?
What if they - when they`ve grown up -  become easy-manipulatable adults who are just part of a consumption-society which - unaware of its doing - is just ruled by advertising and media?
The way to go is a law against advertising towards too young children.
Affected are, anyways, just children aged 2-5, so it is not a very large loss for advertisers.
It is inappropriate to claim for a law against advertising.
Children aged 2-5 do not watch TV the entire day, and when they do, they just watch children-series.
Those series are designed for children, so is the advertising.
It is harmless for children, it rather shows them interesting products and the wide world.
And anyways, if the governament prohibited advertising for young-children, how should they control if children watch TV (with adult-advertising) or not.
A law against children advertising is not-practicable and useless.
It even would cost jobs.
I think it is right that one can no
Advertising is something that we are confronted with every day of our lifes.
There are posters at the trainstation, people that call us to ask if we want to buy their product and of course there are countless spots on TV.
In between shows and movies short videos promote products and tell us why we need to have them.
Most ads are about cars, laundry soap or shampoos, but there are also toys or stuffed animals that are shown in these little clips.
This kind of advertising is directed toward young children.
There are arguments for and against TV advertising toward young children.
Young kids do not really have an idea of how those commercials are made to influence them.
Children usually just see something on television and if they like the product that is advertised, they want to have it.
Regardeless of how much it costs.
They do not know that the commercial is made to make them want a product and that often these TV spots are really exaggerated.
Kids are not aware of how much a television ad can influence them.
Also, businessmen are taking adventage of this group of young people.
We all know how children can be when they want something at the grocery store: They sream at their parents and throw a fit, because they don't realize how much things cost and how important it is for parents to mange thir budget.
Even if adults tell them that something is expensive, they can not understand why they do not just buy it for them.
So TV commercial directed toward young children is not fair toward the parents, really.
Kids also already have to take in a lot of information from the media.
They have an information overflow everyday from their phone, tablet or television.
So TV commercial directed towards them makes it even harder to deal with this overwhelming amount of infos.
It is hard from them to know what is "real" and what is a "commercial" and not to be taken so seriously.
But since kids will be confronted with commercial their whole lifes it is also important for them to learn how to know the difference between a commercial and a TV show, for example.
When they see advertising from a young age, it might make it easier for them to see how the commercials influence them at a later point in their lifes.
Nevertheless, in my opinion television commercial toward young children should not be allowed, since they already have an overflow of information and with televison advertising this overflow is increasing.
Heres my overwhelming essay on advertising for young kids.
Fasten your seatbelts and be ready to read my opinion.
So here we are, discussing whether Television advertising directed toward children should be allowed or not.
Obviously children of the age from two to five couldnt really understand what advertising is.
They cant even understand it because they mostly not even know how Television really works.
I think that children of the age of five years or younger souldnt even watch Television rather then going outside and explore nature.
So the advertisment for the little kids would only aim to the parents, so they buy the products for their children.
I think that Television advertising as a whole should be minimized and maybe even should be forbidden.
For fucks sake, do we really watch TV for the advertising, to see what i could buy if i wanted to, or even better, what i should buy because without it i cant really enjoy life as I could with this product?
No.
This is also the main reason why I barely not watch TV at all.
The Advertising is annoying as f*ck and in the news they only talk about famous people doing shit about i dont f*cking care.
So back to the youngsters.
I dont think its a good idea to make advertising for little kids, only so the parents are more or less forced to buy that new super mega magnificient marvellous product for their young kids, for the only reason that they can see its nearly the same as all the others.
Because I have this kind of point of view on TV and advertising, I can only say that I dont think advertising is needed at all.
Either we need something or we dont.
The only thing advertising os good for, is that we buy things we dont reeeeeaaaaalllyyyy need to.
So we spend money on things we dont need, to impress people we dont like with money we dont have.
I think you should spend our money on the things we need to life a good life.
And not this kind of stuff we dont even have a use for.
And If you should have to much money, why dont invest it in Investment goods.
Like in stocks, houses, or even just simple trade market.
Buy things and sell it.
See?
profit.
Sometimes I see things in advertisments or in shops and think by myself: who the **** would buy such a s***?
Advertising is needed because if someone doesn't suuport advertising, his product wont be that succesfull.
So he wont make money out of it.
So he has to g with the flow and advertise too.
The amount of money spent in advertising is ridicoulously high.
And this for the use that people can see what brand is in trend right now.
Rest in piece capitalistic world.
Nothing against capitalism, but this site of capitalism is really useless.
You spend money as a factory on something that doesnt pay off.
nonsense.
It was me a pleasure 
:)
Someone gave us a statement to comment and you wont believe what happened!!!
(scroll down for the whole stroy, no clickbait)

























Televison advertising is a major concern in the last few years since it has evolved quite strongly.
For example are nowadays rather descreet messages to be found in advertising.
Accordion to certain groups, this is very harmful to children between ages two and five.
This text will show a some counterarguments to that statement, so better buckle the fuck up motherfuckers and be prepared for this boredom-infused, lit af writing extravaganza.
A major concern is that children exposed to advertisement directed to them will create whishes which can not be always fulfilled by the parents.
This pushes the cildren to spend more money as soon as they have some to spend since the want to fulfill all the wishes their parents could or would not fulfill when they were younger.
A further concer may be that toddlers are easily influenced by televisiion and advertisement.
The Problem wiht banning television advertisement for toddlers is that one cannot define clear borders for directed content and even advertisement directed to adults will most certainly influence children aswell.
Now, they could say that in general ads on childrens TV programme should be banned but then the question arises how the channels would make money in order to keep the service going.
Furthermore will the improtance of television advertising fall since the importance of the television fall and even young children will rather grow up with the internet than with televisions.
Therefore we could say that banning television advertising directed to children aged two to five is not the best we can do to protect our children from advertising.
In the end we could say that televison advertising to children has a influence on them but its influence is falling and we should rather concentrate on protecting our children from harmful advertising in the internet or in general in modern mediums.
In my opinion, the supporters of the ban have a point but they focus their concerns on the wrong medium since TVs have lost in importance (as seen in one South Park episode where Cartman becomes a internet star and there is a christmas special to do something and one of the kids stars a petition to save the televison, since that's what brought families together the best).
I fully agree with this statement.
One reason for this (probably the strongest reason), is that children are more oblivious to the marketing techniques of brands and companies.
They can't yet grasp what is true and what is a lie and also what they want and what they don't.
Children that young usually don't have a sense for the worth of money, they just see it as this "awesome paper stuff" that you trade in for things you actually want.
Lacking that feel for the worth of money, they'll spend all of their pocket money on useless junk, or nag their mothers and fathers (or other relatives for that matter) to buy this garbage for them.
This could lead to parents hating a brand or company because they would associate it with the annoying and embarrassing times when their children wouldn't stop nagging them to buy something in the supermarket, so that is something advertisers should consider.
Another reason to why television advertising shouldn't be targeting young children is that the brain of those young individuals ofthe human species still have a relatively neutral,unopinionated, shapable and absorbing brain.
They'll take in any sort of information like a sponge absorbing water.
That's a good trait for learning languages, but a terrible trait considering advertising, as they'll get hooked to a brand at a very young age.
The brands they learned to love while they were still wearing diapers would be like demigods to them, whilst any other brand would look like a two-legged donkey with leprosy.
This would eventually lead to only a few companies dominating the free market and any other company to go bancrupt.
Those monopolies would allow companies to manually and artificially inflate the prices for their goods, which itself would probably lead to a mass starvation in the entire western world,as nobody would be able to afford the cost of food anymore, thus leading the world into an age of darkness and throwing our society into an apocalyptic state of anarchy.
Alright, maybe I've exaggerated the impact a bit.
But to my excuse, I had to come up with something more to write to get up to 300 words.
Many young children, aged two to five, watch a lot of television.
Because of that some companies started to focus their television advertising directly to this young children.
This started many discussions about advertising and our society.
Should the gouvernement interups / stops these type of discussions?
Should it forbid television advertising to young children?
Than, of course, the problem and the discussions are away.
However is this the right way?
That are the questions I will look at.
It is absolutly true that television advertising directed toward young children is profitable.
Not many parents can say no to their children if they want something new to play, like a new Barbie or a little car, especially if the children wish that for Christmas or for their Birthdays.
However that also has bad aspects.
For example that the children want to many of new things to play or if they want something, which is not good for them but the advertising said it is good.
That is the thing I will look at in this paragraph.
Young children can be easily be influenced and they change their opinion rapidly.
When you use something they like as a help for example a comic figure like ''Olaf'' from the movie ''Frozen'', you can sell everything with this help to children.
Parents use this method when their child does not want to eat broccoli, but it work with everything.
When the gouvenement forbids television advertising directed towards young children than the companies will search another way to contact these children, because they do not want to lose this financial source of profit.
First things first the television is a normal thing today and it belongs to the childhood.
So it isn't an good idea to take this away.
It's just good if the children learn how to deal with things like this.
We live in a world where the people have to accept the developement of new things and this will also be an important thing for the future.
Television advertising should not be allowed because the skills of young children could become worse.
Television makes children unconcentrated and nervous.
So in school the children can't make good marks and their future is in danger.
But television advertising isn't that bad if you have some laws.
Over a short part of time it haven't any bad consequences.
It helps the children to develope their minds and creativity.
They get new ideas and learn how to put them into reality.
Another point is that the health could become bad.
The eyes are an important area.
So in the worst case the parents of the children have to buy some glasses or the children have to go to the doctor.
This have also quite big consequences for the future of the children.
So as a conclusion I would say that television advertising toward young children isn't that bad.
But we have to take care of our children because everthing have consequences for their future.
So it's our task to make laws and to control the consumation of television.
Of course it's important that we have a look on what our children are watching and in which amount.
Television advertisements can manipulate those who believe everything they hear and don't think by themself.
That is exactly what children are because the hippocampus in our brain evolves only in our teenage years and that's when we learn to think, weigh out arguments, make decisions and take responsibility for ourselves or even for others.
So a pro statement is for sure that children can get easily manipulated to buy stuff or even to do things and that television advertisements can be dangerous for them.
And by saying they get manipulated to buy stuff, I mean that they ask their parents to buy stuff and they will probably buy them becuase they want to please their children and make them happy.
Another point is that irony and puns are often used in advertisements and young children don't understand these jokes and could think that it is meant in a true way.
For example there is one television advertising where a man hits every guest at his grill party because they say something he doesn't like.
This is meant in a funny and sarcastic way but children who see this will think that hitting other people is fine.
Or a advertisement that probably everyone knows: The one from Snickers where someone is a monster or a diva and when they eat a Snickers they become a normal person again.
Children will take this ad literally and maybe think that when you eat a Snickers you will become magically something else than you were before.
With the example of Snickers this taking everything literally is not dangerous but I believe that it could be dangerous in other examples of advertisements.
As the contra part of the statements there is one that shouts privacy and another one shouts self developoment of personality.
You could say that it belongs to the term of privacy that every parent can decide whether they want their children to see some television advertising and learn to outweigh the truth of them by themself or if they don't want to show these dangerous puns to their children until they are old enough to outweigh it.
And some may believe that it's the best way to learn how to get puns and to develop their personality for their child.
But when I think about it I cannot remember any advertisements from tv channels for children in Switzerland.
I believe it should not be allowed to put advertisements on channels for kids between the shows and movies that young children watch.
But when you watch TV as a parent or an older brother or sister and a yound child is watching too you should pay attention to the ads that show and that you tell the child what is exactly going on there.
Advertising directed toward young children

Nowadays you see advertisment everywhere.
On billboards in the streets, in newspapers and on television.
Youngsters aged two to five are in an age, where they play with dolls, cars and many other different things.
When they see something they like, they will not stop asking their parents to buy it, until the parents give in and fullfill their wish.The problem is that children this young do not know what is necessary to have and what is not.
Often the brandnew bought thing is cool for a week and then it lays around in the children`s room and is not noticed.
They do not think, if they could need it, they just want it or not.
I think that it should be forbidden to direct television advertising to children because it will only remind them of what they do not have instead of what they have.
It teaches them not to be thankful, but to always want more and new things, eventhough the old one probably would have still functioned.
Suddenly everything they have is not good enough anymore.
Unfortunately the new thing once also will be too old or not useful anymore, so newer version has to be bought.
It is a circle of buying, being satisfied for a short period, seeing the advert of something new, wanting that and buying it and it will not stop as an adult.
Maybe you think that if you buy this one thing, it will make you happy, but the truth is that you will never be truly happy because there will always be something better.
It is an ilusion to think that it is possible to ban television advertising for children, but a step would be to not let ones children watch to much television and rather go outside with them to play soccer or hide and seek.
As a parent you should teach your children to appreciate ones ownings and not to buy the newest stuff because as a parent you are a rolemodel and your children will mostlikely treat their things similar as you do.
Built a tree house with them or anything else because self-made things are much better than if you always
A lilltle child is sitting on the couch and is wachting tv.
On the tv comes a tv ad, which shows us a fat lady who drinks a cup of a protein shake.
After one week she is slim like an model.
So the child asks her mom to buy her the same because she want to be like this lady.
So the ad has a big influence on the cild.
Is it positive or negativ for thechildren and for the society?
The arguments for this statement is, that the children would  be influence by the ad actors and the theme of the ad.
For exemple there is a ad with for a video game.
When a child watch it, he would be subborn and would ask his parents to buy him that.
Ofcoure it's a profit for the company but for the parents is acutally a loss, because they will spent their money and the child will only play the video game and would't concentrate on anything.
Which can lead to medical problems like problems with eyes and pyscology problems.
The thing is that in the tv ad they praise the product, which is their job, and the quality would be shown as high.
But when we buy it, the product would be awful and low market.
The children would be very excitied to buy the thing but finally when the bought it they would be disappointed.For exemple the McDonald's ad.
The burger looks so neat and pleasant but when we go to the raustrant it wolud look deadful and messy.
And the childer will be adicted to these ad.
They belive all what the admakers say.
The contra argument is, that the children will have a picture of life.
It means they would improve their general knowledg.
So when children see a cleaning ad, they would learn something about cleanig and would use it in their social life.
The other point is when we stop the children by watching ads,they would build a curiosity to know what it actucally is.
This would lead to many problems.
For exemple the children would get curios for everything they see which is some time very difficult to controll.
So when we let them to watch it,this problem owuld not be here.
So i would say that we schould allow childern for watching tv ads but there is a limit.
i wouldn't permit the children to watch awfull ads.
But i think by watching ads, the childern would learn somehow little things.
But i will definitly say that allowing children to watch ads is a very good medicine to build their general knownledg.
And they would get some freedom by that and would feel controlled.
With the upcoming digitalization and the frequent use of television and the internet it is normal for children, even of a rather young age, to watch a lot of TV.
They might be enjoying a cartoon, but the frequent advertisement pauses will eventually be directed towards them.
In this essay it will be discussed whether television advertising toward children of the ages two to five should be allowed or not.
Firstly, if parents let their kids watch television programmes by themselves it can not really be controlled whether they are exposed to and influenced by television ads.
Parents would have to be with their kids while watching television and not let them see the advertisements in between the actual programme to avoid that their children are influenced.
However, one could argue that if parents let their kids watch television in the first place, they must be okay with them being influenced by different advertisements.
Another argument that one might bring up, is that the advertisement probably isn't directed towards the children, but towards their parents.
In other words, are children even affected by seeing the advertisements in TV?
It is said that children can not possbibly be influenced, because they are not directly the customers of the stores and brands placing the adverts.
Opposing to this, one could say that children who see an advert in television could be telling their parents to buy or consume whatever was shown in the advertisement, which would then indirectly lead to the parents being influenced by the television ad.
In coclusion it can be said, that parents as well as the ad-placing companies have an influence on whether children are affected by the advertisement or not.
In my opinion, parents should pay attention to what their kids are watching, but it is not really necessary to forbid television advertising completel
Today its normaly when children play with Ipods, Ipads, Iphones or if they look tv all day.
In live its better and in school also: Children should go out and play with other children in nature.
Hike and seek is much bether for the growing up of children then looking tv.
If the children are always looking tv then they dont learn anything countable for their later life.
Shortly said, they get worse.
Playing games like Monopoly or Memory on a Ipad is not the same like playing the real game with real figures.
Television adverstising is not forbidden, it shouldnt be forbidden, but it should give a maximum of time where children can use it.
The time should be limited because to much of television advertising is bad for children.
A pro is that children can learn from it.
But its not the same learning process like when you learn it by doing.
Also the contact with other children could get lost, because you dont actually need other children to have fun with a television.
You dont need stron books.
I think television advertising should be allowed for young children(aged two to five)but it should be limited because with books you learn better and quicker.
It is a well known fact that advertising a specific product will boost sales and therefore increase profit.
At big events such as the superbowl companies fight over advertising space and time.
They know that be able to advertise during such events will profit their company.
Because of this they are also willing to pay a lt of money for just a few seconds on TV or a little space in the stadium.
The following text will discuss if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
The fact that advertising towards adults increases sales shows that adults are not resistent to the manipulation advertisments bring with them.
If only children would be manipulated by advertising then companys might not advertise anymore because if would not be profitable anymore.
However the main difference between children and adults is experience and rational thinking.
Because of this you could argue that children are easier to manipulate.
Meaning that companies would use childrens innocence to make a profit.
But you shouldnt forget that most or even all children aged two to five still live at home with their parents and do not have a lot or even any money.
Young children will always have to convince their parents to buy them something.
So in reality young children can not really be manipulated into boosting sales for companies.
In conclusion I believe young children and
Today there are more young children aged two to five who watch television than there had been in the past.
There are a lot of discussions if children in this age should even be able to watch television in this age, but that's not the point.
I want to show the pros and cons about television advertising directed toward young children aged two to five and if it should be allowed.
I haven't seen much television advertisings especially made for children yet, but the ones I saw weren't on programmes for children, but on those for the parents.
When it's like that, I think that advertising for very young children should be allowed, because when they're on programmes for adults, the parents normally are watching television and they can judge, if their children should now see this or not when they are watching television together.
On the other hand we see television advertisings which are shown to children on programmes made for children and there the children normally watch without their parents.
In this case it depends on what kind of advertising it is.
When it's advertising for a toy or a new serie on the programm, then I think it's not that bad, because the children can learn to know knew things and they aren't influenced that much.
It becomes more dangerous, when there are product placements shown on television.
There are some big industries, for example Mc Donalds, which want to influence the people by a very young age to buy their products when they are older.
To sum up, in my opinion television advertising for young children should be allowed, but song
I bougth allot of toys because I have seen the publicity on Televison.
So televisons influences children, but is this really a bad thing ?
In this essay I am going to write about this Subject.
One of the biggest problems is that espacially children get adopted to watching televison.
So there are a lot of different series that are made for children and were children invest a lot of time to see each part of the serie.
Children also give up reading because they prefer watching televison and that is bad for there creativity and languege skills.
But I think there are also good aspects for example: if there is a serie about dinesaurs children become interrested in dinesaurs and start to read about them or they also go to museum to see the bones of a dinesaur.
Or maybe theres a serie about the univers and then the children becoume interrested in astronomie.
So it can aslo inspire a child to read more about a speciall suspect.
A big problem nowadays is that a lot of children do not even go outside because they have to watch televison.
So the real life is less important than a fictional televison serie.
But I think each child in the modern society watchs televison today so I think if there would not be a speciall program for children they would watch other things and maybe they would watch things that should only be watched by adults so in this point of view television espacially for children can also protect children.
As I have allready mentioned in the introduction the televison can also influence children and push them to buy something.
I think this Aspact is a really important aspect because children do not understand how the get influenced by the publicity.
And maybe they create there own opinion about a suspect based on something they have seen on televison.
So based on all this arguments I have mentioned i have to say that I would not forbid televison espacially for children but I think to much television is not good for a child.
So i think that it is a task of a parant to observe the own children and to regulate the consume of televison.
A human being of the age two to five is a very sensitive creature.
In the so called sensitive phase people are like sponges.
We take in every information possible from a certain topic for example the language.
Many of these sensitive stages in our lives happen as a child.
Therefore children, especially young children are very likely to get influenced by television advertising.
But could it almost be considered as brainwashing or just a great way to find new potential customers.
First of all are children customers of today and for the future.
Once they are stuck with for example a brand of cereals they'll buy them and maybe other products by the same brand for quite some time and maybe one day for their own children too.
Another point why television advertising is a great way to reach out to young children is that it's very eye cathing and can be made very funny and colourful and may also create a bond between a character in the commercial and the child and because children are attracted to these kind of commercials they are very easy to impress and influence.
So this leads us to the points why television advertising should not be allowed.
In most countries people are considered adults by the age of eighteen which menas only then are they really able to make their own decisions.
Children of the age two to five are not.
They aren't sure yet what they want and what they need.They still need to learn what's good and bad for them.
Clearly children are taken advantage of by companies.
They take what children like and put it into a commercial, it doesn't even have to relate to the product.
In conclusion I find it kind of disgusting that they use innocent, easy to be influenced, young children only to make money and to benefit them.
Advetising is amazing in our country, because we should do anything.
Advertising is good, because the owner of the programm in the television raise money to pay for the movies or pay for the work to make a soup or anything.
A lot of young poeple watch very often tv, because they do not have other things.
Firstly,I think there are not very advertising for young children.
Nevertheless there are advertising for sweets or something like this, but I think the young children do not understand.
If the young children understand the advertising, they will go to the parents and say that they want this thing.
However the parents can say no, because sweets are very unhealthy.
Secondly, It's normal to do advertising for young children, because they want that the young children watch the soup or the movie.
The advertising for children soups is very friendly and not bad for the young children.
Sometimes there are great advertising for young children, because the advertising explain a very good thing, that the young children have to learn.
At the End, I think it is allowed to do advertising directed toward the young children, because they have to make money that they can pay the television programm.Also the young children do not know all about the advertising.
The parents have to explain to the young children and if the parents do not want this, they will not do.
Even young children these days watch TV a considerable amount of time.
While some watch films from DVD others enjoy the different programmes on TV.
And there is the problem: On TV there mostly are adverts, some of them even directed directly towards young children.
Should this be allowed?
Yes of course, one could say, there are adverts for good things like educative games or toys.
A child could see a game for learnig to read and then get interested in reading.
They would then ask their parents if they could buy it.
The parents still have the opportunity to say no.
But this way their attention is drawn to something that they had not known otherwise.
One could say that adverts directing towards young children should only be allowed for a certain product.
It makes sense to advert for an educative game but it is rather harmful to advert for sweets or other unhealthy stuff.
The children could get the impression that everybody eats a lot of sweets and they are the only ones who are not allowed to.
They could get a wrong impression of what is normal or what other people do.
There are strong arguments in favour of  restriction of TV advertisement.
Children, and even more young children aged two to five, need protection.
They can't decide what is good for them themselves.
As already mentioned above, children could get a wrong impression of their surroundings.
As they are very young they would then adapt to these patterns and get used to it.
This can have positive effects but, e.g.
regarding sweets, also lead to problems like overweight.
Personally, I think TV advertisement directing towards young children should not be allowed.
It influences them in a wrong way since companies are mostly interested in making money and not necessarily in the well-being of children.
Anyway, young children should not watch that much TV, they should rather go outside and play with other children.
Children between two and five usually watch a lot of television.
Regardless if television it self is damaging to our young children or not, is it good to show our young kids advertizing?
For a lot o companies it is hard to advertize products directed to younger children.
Unlike children adultes are constantly confonted with advertizements during their regular day.
But as soon as you need to get the attention of a young child it can get harder.
Companies had the idea to embed their product advertizement between childrens shows.
These companies benefit a lot from these ads and of course would like to continue using them.
However is it really that good for children to be conronted with advertizements at this young age?
Younger children are usually very oblivious and I can remember from personal experiance that it was not hard to persuade me to buy something from the toy store.
Showing young children that advertisement is good would just make them buy more unnessisary products in the future.
Of course companies trying to sell as much of their product as possible are happy about this but should think more about the damange they are doing to these young childen watching television.
Of couse each individual will have a different oppinion about this topic but a little bit less television or advertisement for our children can't hurt anyone.
Manipulating the youngsters

Many people say, that advertising directed towards children should be forbidden.
But is it really that dangerous?
Is it dangerous at all?
What does television advertisind do with our personality?
Advertising is always manipulation, so it is a manipulation for adults too.
Additionally, the decision wether something is goint to be buyed or not is still in the hands of the parents.
They should be able to tell their kids a simple "no".
Sure it's hard but it's also necesseray and a part of the maturing process.
Children are also a part of the society, so why should they be excluded from the television commercials?
As written in the beginning, advertising is always a sort of manipulating the people.
They should become a feeling that they need that product in their life.
But a young child can't separate as good between "I need that" or "I don't need that" as an adult.
So one can say that the mainpulation is much bigger for the young children as for the adults.
In my opinion television advertising shouldn't be forbidden, but it should be reduced, because then the kiddies haven't got so much input, but they get to know new toys and the parents haven't to spend much time with always saying "no" to their childs.
A big pro of this idea is that the children would spend much more time outside and not in the house because most of the products which are promoted in television are things for playing in the house.
When they promote food or drinks for young children in an advert this products contain often much sugar which is unhealthy but this does not matter for the children because they do not know about it - even sometimes the parents do not know it.
For example there are some adverts in the TV that when you go to a fast-food restaurant the children receive a free gift or something like this.
A child normally do not know the rules of economy and it maybe thinks that the company wants to be nice but in fact the company wants only to sell something to earn money.
Often parents give in to the wishes of their children and buy the products on the internet or in a store.
Sometimes they dont know what are the needs of a product but the child says that it is a cool product, so the parents buy it without thinking about it

Without advertising on the televison the profit for big companys would fall.
If the company does earn much money, there is a possibility that the will fire people.
It would be also a difficult situation for the legislation because as a company I could say that their products are for higher-aged children but actually their products are for lower-aged children.
Another big con is that normally the parents are responsible fot their children and not the companys.
So if the parents let them watch TV in this young age, they should be aware of the fact that many TV channels use advertising so that the reception of the signal is free for the customer.
I think that this statement is a good idea because today I can see many adverts on TV which are for young children.
There are often so many lies in the cotent and the companys sometimes say that their products are the best and the children believe this.
But I think also that the parents have a high responsibility for their kids.
So the best idea would be that until a certain age you do not let them watch more than an half an hour TV per day.
Children can't buy the Stuff without the parents.
They just can go to them and say i want this, i want this.
If the Parents don't want this thing they shoud not let the children watch tv.
The adversiting is often also good for the parents for christmas or birthdays.
they know what they can't buy the little kids so they are happy and also the parents are happy when they see the shiny eyes of the childrens when they get the Present they want.
It's true that the children often gets angry if they don't get what they want.
The adversiting get an effect on the little gets that they mean that they have to have this thing anf  can't life without that even it is just a toy.
that can drive the kids crazy.
And the parents often also get crazy about the kid so the buy the stuff and it doesn't matter if its is expensive or if it is cheap.
They buy it just for calming the kid and that isn't the goal parents should do.
the kids should learn that thy have to deserve a present not every day or any day.
they should be happy when they get one once a year and not more.
Television advertising is an effective way to get people into buying new things, things they might not even need.
Small children aged two to five might watch shows like "teletubbies" or "the Mickey Mouse show".
Inbetween they need small breaks in order to let the previous information and morals from the show sink in.
But should those breaks be filled with adverts for them?
Young children - especially around the age of two- maybe won't let the adverts affect them too much.
They might not really know what exactly is going on.
They beg for their mothers to carry them around and they love their old little teddybear who would belong in the trash bin because it is all chewed up.
They live very much in the moment.
They get affected by emotions and their environment, though they might not feel heavily related to those ads.
However, at the age of five, they sure know what they want to have and they begin to be thoroughly influenced by the fun little adverts.
It is ethnically not correct, because the parents are the ones who pay and the young children longe for the toys in a manipulative advert.
These advertisements often make people conditioned to an excitable, unconcerned feeling because of a combination of something enjoyable (for example a summer party)with the product they are trying to sell.
Five-years-olds might get envious of the other children playing with these fantastic new toys on the market.
They want to have, what they don't have at the moment.
Adverts, that relate to these young children are effective.
Furthermore we should ask ourselves if it is a correct way of influencing those young children.
It is possible, that they don't necessarily care as much as we might think, because they are too focused on living in the moment.
However psychologists found out that those little children are very much influenced by their surroundings and in my opinition we shouldn't confront and them with the marketing world of today's society, as it is manipulative.
Children can be manipulated easy.
If an adult or an other person tells them something they believe it.
They ask but they don't think they just believe it.
Childrens want to learn about the world.
So they ask a lot about random topics.
It isn't good for them if they get false informations because they won't think about it if it is false.
They think it's right because they think it is always right what other older people are saying.
They think we know it better.
But it is hard to say that television advertising is bad for the children.
It's all about the kind of information the television is telling.
If it is about a shampoo advertisement it won't damage the children.
They won't care about topics like that it isn't interesting for them.
If it is an racist advertisement, like the shampoo cleans a black man and he gets white, we can't tolerate that.
The children won't really think about it but in the backest corner of his brain, he could think black people aren't beautyful.
Advertisements are made by Adults.
The advertisements aren't a big problem.
It is just about the person who makes the advertisements.
If he wants to make racist advertisement he can make racist advertisement.
There are a lot of people you can't understand why they are doing this.
But not all kind of advertisements can be send out in televisions.
There are rules and nowdays nobody can make advertisement like that, while you are saying one thing is better then the other.
So I think television advertisement aren't bad for childrens.
Young children between two and five years often watch television because they like the little cartoon series or are fascinated by the moving pictures, the bright colours and the funny music.
When an advertisement pops up, they often don't even understand what it means and what it wants to sell.
When I was a child, I was always really bored when a TV show was interrupted by an advertisement.
I often just walked away from the television to play with my toys as long as the break took.
And I only returned to watch TV if the advertising sequence had stopped.
I believe many children feel and act the same way as I did when it comes to television advertising, especially nowadays wher kids are bored so quickly.
And what I personally don't understand is the fact that companies normally advertise a product to a specific age group because they want to sell it to exactly these people.
But when they advertise for example a toy, children can't buy it by themselves.
They first would have to convince their parents and only if the parents agree, they maybe receive that specific toy for Christmas or as a birthday present.
Companies therefore shouldn't advertise their products to little children because they can't afford to buy them anyway.
Television advertising for children aged two to five can't be efficient in my opinion.
And I personally don't think it is appropriate to advertise during a children's movie or show because children shouldn't be used to gain even more profit by advertising to them, they are just too innocent and shouldn't be waisted with such things.
So I totally agree with the statement.
But we wouldn't have to argue about this if children would just play outside in nature instead of watching television.
If they were doing this, they wouldn't be a target to many companies.
Today, nearly every swiss-family has its television.
It is common that children start to watch movies and series on television while they still go to kindergarden or even earlier.
With this in mind, the idea of creating shows for children is obvious and not very far from the idea of television advertising directed toward them.
Young children probably do not really understand television advertising, but it is a matter of fact that they are pretty open for it.
On one hand, the point that children are too young to understand what television is able to do should support the thesis that television advertising directed toward them should not be allowed.
An other point is, that it may makes children sad to see what kind of intresting things other kids have but they do not.
However, there are also some reasons which speak against the statement.
On one hand, the parents can decide by themselfes wheter or wheter not they want their kid to sit in front of television.
They know that there will be some advertising and they know best how their kid reacts if it wants to have something.
On the other hand, kids often are not really interested in advertising, which makes them go away to play something else.
And if they do not, they may even learn something new while watching television advertising.
All things considered, I think that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, but the parents should keep it in mind.
No matter if or if not there is advertising, I support the statement that young children should not be allowed to watch television.
Television is today normal and not think away of.
Many children grow up with it.
Especialy young kids spend a lot of time in front of the TV.
Parents should controll them, so that their kids don't spend to much time at the TV.
The Television is a good way to learn the own language and also other foreing languages.
Ther are many series for kids which animade them to be active.
As long as the children watch series or movies for their age it's okay.
When they watch movies for adults, horror or criminal movies, they get bad influence.
When the parent watch films which the children should not see, they have to look that the children aren't looking with them.
Young children should be allowed to watch TV, but it must be for their age.
They should watch teletubies instead of James Bond.
I disagree the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.
The television gives us many opportunities and for children a good way to learn many things in a fun way.
The children have to be controlled by their parents, so that they don't watch things they shouldn't see and that they don't spend to much time in front of the TV.
Television advertising is a common marketing trick among big concerns.
Especially the younger generation is very easy to convince of a product.
In our "digital century" more and more young children are watching television and of course concerns are using this to promote their products.
But should it be allowed?
It is so much easier to convince a child of a product.
If it is colorful and fancy and the child sees other children playing with this toy, it wants to have it immediately.
In my opinion it shouldn`t be allowed, because children aren`t watching television to get to know the amount of new toys on the market.
They just want to watch cartoons and animal shows.
Through the advertising children are getting more attached to material things.
They want to be owner of all the toys and fancy things showed on Television, but can`t appreciate them.
Of course also the parents don`t want to buy all the useless, advertised things.
For concerns the child himself is the best promoter.
It sees the advertising and convinces it`s parents to buy the advertised toy.
If the parents would see the advertising they would be far less likely to buy it.
It`s also the only oppertunity to adress an advertising directly to the child because it isn`t able yet to read a newspaper or other advertising platforms.
I would definitely avois the television advertising directed toward young children because they aren`t able to make decisions on their own yet.
Nowadays there are many different kinds of  television advertising.
They can be very special with many computer effects or just one sentence and every important point is already said.
Advertising are mostly directed to adults but there are also advertising which are directed to younger people between the age of two and five.
Should it be banned to produce advertising directed toward this young children?
Since there is being produced a big amount of diffrent toys for children the toys also have to be made public and charming to the potencial buyer.
This potencial buyer are parents.
But as they are toys for children the advertising are of course directed to children because they have to feel attracted by the toys and not the parents.
Watching television is nowadays a very big part of a childrens life.
Consequently they see a lot of advertising which are showing toys or food or something else what is made for children.
In addition it is known that children always want the newest gadgets.
However, the children may like or may dislike the product shown in the advertising.
But If they like it they are going to ask their parents to buy it for them.
So this might could lead to arguing between child and mother or father.
In conclusion, i have to disagree with this statement.
The advertising kind of have to be directed to the children itself.
If the advertising are directed to the parents the children would not be that much attracted by the gadgets and maybe they would not even want to possess it.
TOday alot of young children watch a lot of TV.
The TV channels of today show a massive amountof ads.
And everybody knows that young children are easily manipulated bythese ads.
So this isnt a problem, if a 5 year old boy sees a ad about a new couch.
But if he sees ads about all these toys available nowadays, this hasto affect him.
So should you show ads directed toward young children.
I think that this would be a great idea, beacause young children are the future of our civilication.
Nobody, expect some companys, wants that young children grow up with this much advertisment.
If our all people in the future had a childhood stuffed with all these ads, big companys have some loyal customers.
Now yout think, whats the problem with loyal customers?
I can tell you that this wont come out well.
If companys have many loyal customers, they canactually do what they want.
If the company is so popular, nobody can bring a company to fall, even if they had done some terrible things.
You could say that those companys influence your children like nobody else.
Its like these companys got so much power with these ads.
It cant be good if companys, whose main goal is to make as muchmoneyas possible, got so much power.
So with all these beautiful arguments against advertising toward young children, its clear that im fully standing behind this idea.
Prohibit these commercials would be a good step against the overwhelming capitalism in our society.
In this text we speak about the two sights if it should be allowed to advirtise directed toward young children on television or not.
On one hand it should not be allowed to advertise toward young children because they are too young to really understand what it is if they see something on television.
When they see another child enjoying something they want to have it too.
It is also not good when they see all they could have and do not have.
Then they already start in young age to be material directed.
On the other hand it does not matter if you advertise to young children or not they anyway do not really understand anyhing.
Also if the parent do not want that their child see advertisement then they just can not allow them to watch televison and  maybe just put a movie on or record the sope their child want to watch and then skip the advertisment.
It also has to be sayed that if a child sees something on television and then want to have it it is simmilar as if he see something on hes friends house and then want to have it too.
Another point is that it does not matter in which age they are they anyway see advertisement towards their age when the grow up, so why not already in young age.
In my opinion it shout be allowed to make televison advertising toward young children.
They are so many ways to go around advertisment that if you do not want that your child watching advertisment you can stop it from doing it.
When I go to our neighbours for babysitting, they never really want to watch televison, which I'm glad for.
Still, there are many families where the children sit in front of the TV all afternoon.
They see adverts and want their parents to buy whatever is shown there.
It would probably be better if these ads were forbidden.
Television advertising is made based on information about who is watching which programm.
If there are many children watching, the advert is more directed towards them because it is in general easier to make a kid enthusiastic about something so they want to have and therefore buy it than an adult.
A parent's first instinct is to watch out for his child and it's happiness, so it's not hard for this child to convince his parent to buy something he truely wants, or at least thinks he wants.
This connection should not be abused by big companies for their profit.
However, just because your child wants something doesn't mean you have to buy it.
Evedy kid should be thaught by his parents that one simply cannot have everything they want.
If they are not, there will be consequences later in their life and they won't be good.
If the parents treat and teach their children right, there should not be a problem with a television advert.
Foridding them would be of no use.
Also, a well raised child doesn't spend all his time in front of the TV, so there would not be a problem either.
To sum up, advertising in television directed towards children can affect the parents to buy something, but if we want to know the reasons, we have to look at the raising of these children and their parents.
Especially when you're young, your parents have a very big influence on your life and if they would teach their children that they can't have everything they want an of course not let them spend so much time in front of the TV, there would be no problem at all.
Adults don't buy everything advertised in television either an dif we wanted to ban advertising directed towards children, we should also ban advertising directed towards teenagers and adults.
In today's television programms there is a lot of advertisment of different products and for different ages.
A lot of people are watching television and all of them have favourite channels.
There are hundreds of different channels and every person can decide which one she or he wants to watch, there are channels with less advertising and some with more.
There are channels for two to five year old children, but even there advertisment is shown.
Little children do not understand how advertisment affects them, they just watch it and then, if it is something they do not already have, they want it.
That is exactly, what the companies look for, they want smaller children persuading their parents to buy it.
If companies want children to have it, then the advertisment cannot be brutal or with violence, because then, the kids would be frightened and they would not want it anymore.
That is why they make it funny, happy and colourful, so it is not bad for children.
In my opinion it is not good, that the companies use smaller kids as clients, i would prefer it, if they would direct it direcly to adults, because they can decide, wether it is useful for them or not and if they want to buy it.
Smaller children do not have the thinking to decide if it is good or bad and it is always the parent, who buys the toys or the other things their kids want.
In my opinion television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because the children can be manipulated so that the children want something that isn't necessary.
But on the other hand a child at the age of two doesn't understand what is going on that much and the advertises are usually going to be about a toy for children.
Children want allways something they like.
On television they see many different things.
And if they like something and see it in a shop for example they throw a tantrum because of how much they want it.
And if advertisements are directed toward children the parents have to deal more with the problem that their child wants something so badly but they don't want to buy it.
A child that watches TV doesn't understand what he sees.
He just can deside if he likes what he's watching or if not.For example if a three year old boy watches TV, it wants to see its favorite show and not some advertisement about some special dolls.
So it wont even look at the advertise.
The company's have to think about how to advertise their product towards young children.
They know that children don't care about school stuff or a new chair.
But they know that children always want new toys.
So towards young children they have to advertise mostly toys.
There are some negative sides and some positive sides to the advertisement toward young children.
In my opinion television advertising directed towards can be allowed because I don't think that the advertises are going to be bad for the children.
The only problem is to resist the needs of the children.
In the last years the amount of people who watch regularly some pogramms on the televison has increased.
Nearly every household has one at home and no matter which age, there is a good programme for everyone.
We are all used to the adverts in the breaks.
But should it be allowed to direct them to young children aged two to five?
The biggest effect of those adverts for children will be on the parents.
Imagine during christmas time, when they see their funny toys they would like to have everyday in the television.
If they don't get it on Christmas Eve they'll be very disappointed.
For the parents it's difficult to enhance the children to play with their old toys because they can see everyday the new toys.
On the other hand it is defenitely an advantage for the shops who sell the toys from the adverts.
They'll be able to sell much more of them to the customers.
They can increase their gain.
With television advertising they can talk to much more people than just with some adverts in the streets.
There might be another advantage for very strict parents.
They can show there children that they can't get everything they want.
But children who are only aged two to five might not understand this.
The question we have to ask us now is, if it's okey when we allow this just for some economic reasons.
In my opinion it's much more important to protect the children from all those technological stuff so that they can grow up in a safe environment.
When they get older they will make anyway enough experiences with all those advertisments.
And in the other hand I'm sure that if this would be allowed there are going to be a lot more spoilt kids.
In the end I think that there are more disadvantages than advantages, therefore I think it shouldn't be allowed to direct television advertising to young children.
Nowadays Television plays a big role in everyone's life, young and old.
The main thing we all encounter while watching TV are advertisements.
Advertisements make certain products and services attractive for the general public and a TV is one of the best places to put out advertisements, as most people watch enough TV to come across these advertisements.
It is expected that through advertisements, the product or service being shown, would be purchased or used more often.
Usually there are different target groups depending on the product/service being offered.
However, are advertisements shown on the television necessary if they are directed towards young children, aged two to five?
I will discuss this situation in the following essay.
On the one hand children that young get an insight into the adult world with such advertisents.
By this I mean that if they see a toy being advertised, which they really like and want to have, this could prompt the parents  to give the child pocket money.
By saving pocket money the child already gets an insight and an idea of financing and how money works.
However, for children as young as two to five, pocket money would not be a discussion, as they are only beginning to talk.
This in turn could lead to advertisements for children that young being a problem for the parents if they are in an unstable financial situation.
Since kids, which are so young do not understand much, they will not be able to understand if their parents are not able to buy "the newest toy, which they saw on the television".
On the other hand a lot of parents would not want to spoil their children, yet would still want to make their child happy.
However, to make their child happy, they will need to buy certain things that are wanted by their offspring.
If they cannot manage this due to a tight budget, they may feel under pressure and as if they have disappointed their child.
All of these problems would then be due to the advertisement on television.
In my opinion, I think advertisements for kids that young are unnecessary, as all they can do are cause more financial problems for families.
Children at such a young age are mostly interested in cartoon shows and might therefore also not be interested in the advertisement,as they are just learning the language and all the pay attention to, are the pictures on the screen.
So in conclusion, no, I do not think advertisement for children between the ages of two to five are necessary and in my opinion, should not be allowed in the first place.
Television adversiting is often discused because there is too much of it or it's just unsuitable.
This discusion is concerning small children too.
Should they be affected by television advertising.
On the one hand television advertising can be seen as a part of the child's learning process.
The child has to make contact to his environnement because then it can grew up and face to those problems itself.
If this learnig process is skipped at low age, there will be more serious and wide problems in the future.
So television advertising is an opportunity to learn and control oneself but on the other hand it can try to manipulate the the grew ups.
In fact this is a serious problem which faces parents too.
What should they do if their children ask for presents they see at televison all the time.
But television can be used as a source of informations.
From this point of view it can give useful informations about different products what makes the choosing of presents easier.
In conclusion television advertising can be seen as an opprtunity to learn and to get informations but manipulation of children has to be seen too.
In my opinion we should allow the advertisement but we should control it.
The television.
An Invention that has changed the life of many people.
One aspect is the aspect of the economy: Since the television has been invented, there is a new way of advertising.
Millions of people are able to see one's product in the television.
A completely new strategy to reach the customers, with something that is more than normal in nearly every house of every family in the modern world.
No matter what the ad is about, they all follow the same goal: The producer want us to buy the new table or the pretty bed or whatever.
Today, it's more than usual that the people who are conected to a television become younger and younger, because it's a normal thing today.
Even two or three year old children can see advertisments.
That is the point 'd like to discuss.
Children with that age can't build their own reason.
They think about what they like or what they don't like.
They don't really know that it's just an ad, that they probaably get pranked or that everything in the ad is a lie.
They just want that little toy because they think it's something really cool.
And if they see something they are really proud of, the walk to mom and dad and want them to buy it.
If they do, the producers win, because their strategy was succsessful.
I think because of the statements I gave in my text, there shouldn't be any ads for children who are younger than five or six years old.
They can't do any desicions about a toy or whatever in an advertisment of a producer who only wants to sell something to earn money.
Of course, the strategy of the sellors is brilliant.
Making ads for people wyho can't decide if something is good or if something is absolutely rubbish.
The tv shouldn't be used for ads who are directed at children who are under five years old!
If there is no advertising, there is no market where toys and stuff can be sold and buyed.A company always has to advertise, or no one knows about their newest products.
And if no one knows about new toys the company has  to close their doors.
There will be unemployed people.
And it's actually a big business, because everyone want's to see their kids happy.
And if you think about unhappy kids, who have nothing to play with...And to be honest, how sould they control if a kid of the legal age is watching the advertising and how should the kid know what's the newest toy if there isn't any advertising on television?
Kids shouldn't watch television advertising for their age because they always want more, and with these advertisings they get inspired.
Slowly the kids are getting materialistic and they only think about the newest, hottes trend they saw on television.
And that's what companies want to reach, because children are so easy to influence.
And if the kid always has these new wishes, the company never stops producing unneccessary stuff, made of plastic and other chemical substances, mother nature has to keep suffering.
Because when they grow up, or the trend is gone, they throw it away,without feeling sorry.
In my opinion, there have to be companies who produce toys, which includes advertising.
They have to make money somehow.
But I think they really influence kids in the way they advertise.
The child comes to the idea that he has to have it.
They don't have the chance of really being a kid, without adverts to care about.In addiction, I think it would be better for our environment.
It won't leave so much trash and the KEZO wouldn' have so much work.
In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I think it is not fair to manipulate such young children for the enrichment of the advertisors.
Because when these children learn so early how many things they could have, they are not going to be happy when they are older.
They are going to want everything they see because they never learned to be happy with what they have.
So we see that the adverising has negative affections of their further life, which is not fair.
On the other hand, for the advertisors it is a good thing to direct their advertising towards young children.
When they see something they like in television, they are going to ask their parents for buying what they saw.
And children this age usually keep asking until they get what they want.
So it is a good strategy to use children for advertising.
They do not think of money, they just want what they like.
So we see this statement is not just right or wrong.
There are always two sides.
But personally I am against directing television advertising towards young children.
The behalf of the children is more important than the money the advertisors earn.
So I agree with this statement.
Television advertisments are necessary for the television programm.
Beyond the advertisments for children there are also advertisments for other ages.
Not only to fill the gaps but also to pay high streaming prices, television stations are forced to show off brands in their advertisments.
These short clips range from the luxury car you would like to own to some delicious chocolate.
The advertising on television is based on the aida concept.
The concept is about attention, interest, desire and action.
The attention of the yound children is caught by things they like.
For example after a happy film there follows a advertisment for puppets or other things to play for the children.
So these children would like to action and buy those things.
Mostly the parents of the children will have to buy these stuff.
It should be allowed because on the one side there are the brands wich are making the advertisments and on the other side therer are the children and their parents wich are consuming.
There is no reason why these advertsiments should`nt be allowed.
At the end the parents are still the consumers wich buy those things for their children to make them happy.
In fact to allow these advertisments the parents have to stop their children from being on the television.
You as a young happy parent come home after a long exhausting day at work.
As you walk in your home you see your partner sleeping on the couch next to your wide awake little 3 year old daughter who seems to be weirdly mesmorized by a diaper advertisement of a brand which you really dislike.
What would you ike to be the effect of it or wouldn't you want an advertisement targeted at such young children at all.
to quote every known politician" the children of our society are the ones who determine and build our future."
this quote which has been numerously used sais that if we want to change something we have to influence the sprouts of our generation.
Advertising the right biological and ecological products and showing morally important messages might be one of the easier ways to make that happen.
Because we're really easily influenced at a young age.
But is it really the right thing to do?
It is pretty manipulative to influence such young kids into doing whatever some head of a business thinks is right to do or isn't.
We can't take the innocence of these kids to our advantage and form them into some sort of, what we think, perfect civilian of our future.
Also it's the parents who buy all the stuff for the kids.
IT wouldn't be much of a gain for any company to target young kids because they will probably spend more money on making and broadasting the advertisement than making profit out of it.
this severely controversial topic
Children learn the most things when they are still very young.
Thats a big advantage to learn how to speak or how to go but the disadvantage is, that they also learn the negative things.
Television is something fascinating for children and they could watch it for hours.
However as mentioned before they also learn from what they see and they relate this with the real world.
Some think that television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
Actually there is a point and in some situations it is really something bad for the children.
When they see something in television that is directly connected to themselves, they want to try it out.
Possibly they do not even want to tell something to their parents because they think that if the child in the television did it by himself why should not they be able to do it alone.
This can possibly lead to dangerous situations that do not everytime stay without serious consequences.
On the other hand it belongs to every parents own responsibility what to show and what to teach their children.
Television advertising does not have to be  something bad it can also be inspirational for the children.
In addition many parents get there ideas for presents from television advertising and presents are always something that really can make a child happy.
In my opinion television advertising is not something dangerous for children.
According to statistics the chance that it has a bad influence to children is pretty small.
There are not happening many accidents due to some children who watched television advertising that was directed to their group of age.
I think instead we should make the internet more safe for children instead of the television.
The internet is really the more dangerous thing for children.
Nowadays television is an object we see in every house.
There are programms for adults, children and even for babys.
The television is also an item that is a good use for marketing.
There are hardly channels that don't have advertising.
Even children can admire the beautiful toys they can buy at the next supermarket.
Now does this sort of television advertising for young children be banned?
On the one hand those advertisings will affect the kids social lives.
They can talk about for example the toys they saw on TV with their friends.
The fact that kids can have a chat with each other about interests they have in common, will support their social life.
This advertising will sort of increase the communication between kids, because they rather talk about toys, than adults do about politics for instance.
On the other hand this advertisings can have a big inluence on the children.
Young kids aged two to five can hardly denie the feeling of wanting something.
If they see an attractive toy, they want to have it and they will tell heir parents to buy it.
Of course then it's the parents job if they'll buy the toy ore not, but the kids will learn this procedure of seeing a toy on TV and telling their parents to buy it, so they will sort of learn that they can have something just by watching TV and not buy for example accomplishing something.
In my opinon the television advertising for kids should not be allowed, because the industries are taking advantage of the young children by showing of their toys in the most attractive way, so their incoms will increase as high as possible.
As I already sad children can't choose between wanting something and acually needing it.
Now a days so many children are watching TV even when they're still very young.
It is the reason, why more and more commercials are directed towards children as well.
But are theyt acually only directed to children and should they be forbidden?
Acually, it is true that there are many advertisments witch are made for reaching children.
But most of them reaching the parents as well, what i think is the main reason they do it.
An advertisement does only work, because the customer gets to know the product and later when he is at the store, he will probably choose the product he has seen before in the commercial.
If you directing advertisments to children and at the same time to the parents you will reach a higher percentage of one of them remembers it at the store and wants to buy the product.
On the other hand are children not yet smart enough to get what an advertisement actually is.
They just believe what they see and they can't overthink what the reason of the commercial could be.
As you can see, it is a lot easier to manipulate children than adults.
If you look at it this way, advertisement directed toward young children is manipulation and a wrong use of its power.
In my opinion it's not nice to manipulate children, but at the same time children shouldn't be watching TV at such very young ages.
I don't think these advertisments should be forbidden, because it's just an advertisment as every other one.
Furthermore i'd say, the problem aren't the advertisments but the parents.
If the parents would stop letting their children watch TV, the commercial toward children would stop as well.
Because why should they reach children if there aren't even any watching TV...?
In conclusion I don't think these commercial should be forbidden.
At least it is your own desicion what your watching and it's your own responsability what your child watches.
Shoud advertising for joung children be allowed?
This days many joung children, who are to joung to go to school, spend their freetime by watching TV, because their parents do not have time spending time with them or they do not want to spending time with them.
While they are watching TV, they see a lot of advertising toward children.
In this essay i will give some arguments for the advertising toward children an some against advertising toward children:

Advertising manipulate especially young children and they can not do something against because they do not even recognize that they were manipulated.
If an advertisement shows a cool play or something like this, the children can not resist and ask their mothers for having this cool thing.
Maybe she will say "Yes" to see her child being happy.This aspect only supports the toyindustry and make the money from parents go away.
But Advertisements could also encourage children to play with their toys outside with their friends, because sometimes the children see a special toy in advertisemnt which can only be used outdoor.
And may they remember that they have something like this in their house.
In general, i think children aged two to five should not watch TV in their freetime.
But if they do watch TV, i think television advertising could be a way to encourage children to spend their freetime outside with their friends, because some advertisements shows specials toys which can only be used outside.
For example: Waterbombs, waterslides...
Look here or there, quite everywhere are advertisements around us.
While looking television there are a lot intervals of advertisement.
Even children are confronted with much advertising, but is ti okey that they got influenced so hard?
At one side, if television advertising is directed towards children, they see something and then ask their parents with their friendly innocent eyes if they might buy it, the economie has benefits, because more products are sold.
The children get ideas what they could wish themselves for their birthdays.
Another point is, that if something is showed on television, it has a huge amount of viewers and potential customers.
But at the other side, it can't be right when parents are a kind of obligated to borrow things which their child wants to have because of the television advertising.
Young children don't know how this advertisements work and they don't know what is going on.
They just see something beautiful and are convinced that this must be something nice and it is really important that they have it.
So the missing knowledge of young children is needed, and this is really not a good thing.
It's a moral aspect, if one want to use young children for his benef

In conclusion, it's a question of culture and moral values if one needs the children to persueade of a product by television advertising to sell more products.
There are pros and cons with different arguments.
My opinion is, that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed becuase their not knowledge is needed how the advertising works.
Today, children are watching television several hours a day because their parents are stressed and have no time or energy for them.
The simple solution is to put them in front of the TV.
What the kids see there are advertisings for toys and other stuff which children love.
But should such advertisings directed toward young children be allowed?
For the industry of these toys and other playing stuff it is important to promote their things in the television to find new customers.They know exactly that the kids are watching television and also advertisings.
The customers are the parents of the kids which have seen the advertising.
They go and buy it because they want their kids to be happy.
Maybe they do not buy everything but often they cannot refuse them and buy it- a good way to get new customers.
For the parents it is not easy because there are so many different advertisings on television which their children see and they cannot afford to buy all these things.
But most of the children will not stop asking for the toys  until they get what they want.
The advertising directed toward young children causes this problem.
The parents have to spend the money for such things because the advertising supports the children to wish these toys.
In my oppinion the television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because the parents have to raise their kids tough enough to say no to such things.
When children always get what they want there is a problem in how the parents raise their children.
Another problem is that the kids do watch too much television and this is the main problem in my oppinion.
The reason why the industry has so many advertisings directed towards children is because they know that the children watch TV the most of all people.
Who doesn't know the moment, when you turn your TV on in the early morning to watch something.
I always notice, that there aro so many different channels with TV series for little kids.
Sometimes I ask myself, why should young children already be allowed to watch TV in such an early age?
I think Television advertising toward young children is something good.
There are so many things that they can learn just from seeing it visual on the TV.
But of course, there is no garanty that these kids can learn from it, because they are just to young to understand some things happening there in these series.
It is possible that all they see are some pretty coloured characters that are doing something, without getting the message they want to give these children.
Still I think kids may improve some cognitions like being helpfull to other people or how to face different problems in some situations with watching television.
We all know that young kids are difficult to handle when they wake up in the morning.
They cry a lot and are in a bad mood.
Therefore it is a good thing that it has specific TV shows for kids in the morning.
It is a great benefit fot mothers.
While the kid is calming down with funny stories for children in the Television, the mother can do other work and finish things, like household chores.
It can save so much time for her.
Of coruse TV can be harmfull for kids, not only for its health, but also for its social life.
It is possible that instead of going outside in the nature to play games and be with other children, all they want to do is to watch their favourite TV shows.
Still I think that these series are something good, because I experienced it myself with my little sister.
She learned so many things from it.
These TV shows are directed towards young children, so you can be shure that everything that is going on there, is made for their age.
In this generation it's difficult to forbid young children not to watch television.
If the TV is once turned on, you can't turn it off.
For young children there are alot of TV series, programms and advertising, which help kids to learn new stuff or the language.
So it has a good side, but also a bad side.
The kids could learn the language faster and easier by watching television with animation and sound and so they would be better prepared for the school.
The cartoons, which are made for children are also very funny and great for them, because they show them how to do things right and what's wrong and they're also cute.
So it pull up the kids very quick.
But if they watch to much television, it could damage their eyes.
The kids would just stare at the television and nowhere else.
They wouldn't play with toys or go outside.
They would just watch TV and wouldn't learn or do other stuffs.
Also the communication get worse.
The young children get isolated with themselves and would not communicate for example with their parents.
They just want more and more of the cartoons or other programms and they would become connected with the television.
There would be a solution, how to allow it without damaging the young children.
The parents could make a plan or just say that the child can watch TV for a hour and after that they have to play with toys or do other things.
They shouldn't allow the kids to watch TV by themselves.
(I understood the statement wrong and noticed it at the end, so I hadn't time to change it.
First I thought it was that young children should't be allowed to watch TV.. sorry)
Television is nowadays, like any other social media program, a huge part of our society.
There are many shows, films and of course: advertises.
We get influenced by them every time we watch TV.
And not only we do get influenced, the young children do so too.
But is it really right to allow this influence?
Should television advertising directed to young children not be allowed?
I personally think, that it should be allowed.
Children get influenced in so many ways.
Not only by their parents or their teachers, they get influenced by everything they see, might it be a television advertise, an advertise in a magazine or just a simple story they got told.
And nobody can stop this, so for me it would not make any sense to not allow TV advertising toward young children.
Because of this big influence, especially their parents, adults who can not be manipulated that easy, can raise their children in the way they want, so they can tell the child their opinions to advertises or just not allow the child to watch the advertises or TV in general.
Even tough I do not think, children of that age should often be watching television, I think it is a personal decision and up to the childrens parents to do, what they think is the best their kids.
Another reason for me is that people in our society have the right to say, think and publish what they want.
I truely believe in this right and because of that I do not see the point in forbidding those avertises.
Today advertsing is one of the most important point for the success of  companies or for someone who offers something.
On each corner we colud find an advertisment about a product or service.
The advertisment on television has much influence on the people who watch a film, series or an other show.
There are advertisments about every things and for each age of a person.
The television  advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
Often the young children couldn`t buy the thing in the advertisment on his own.
They don`t have enought money or they are still not able to buy it alone.
So the televison advertising for the young children are more directed to the parents of them and they can decide if they want to buy the thing in the advertisment or not.
The people don`t need this sort of advertising because young people don`t watch that much television.
Children  see an advertisment on television about a toy and then they really want it and thats annoing for the parents.
I think television advertising directed toward children should be allowed.
It doesn`t hurts someone.
Sometimes it could be annoiny but it is still legal.
And the people who don`t want to watch it can swap to an other channel.
In the last years the time children watch TV consantly increased.
Because of that children are more often exposed to advertising directed towards their age.
But should advertising directed towards children aged tow to five be allowerd?
There are different perspectives that have to be considered to get e good picture of this problematic.
First I have to mention that young children can get influenced very easily, so the society should be careful with whatever they show them.
Under the impact of advertising children can get a wrong image of things which can have a harmful effect in their future.
Otherwise big companies live from selling thigs and they want to sell as many products as possible.
With their advertising they can reach as many people of different age groups as possible - from young children to old people - and everybody sees their products.
On the other hand children nowadays watch too much TV so they are exposed to a very big amount of advertising.
If they watched less TV the impacts of ads would not be as big as it is today.
Children have to learn how to deal with technology because it is  developing consantly.
The last important thing to keep in mind is that companiey want to find future clients.
They attach young children to them so that, when they are older, they will always buy their products.
It is all part of a selling strategy.
In conclusion I have so say that both parents and companies have to try to minimize the problem.
Personally I think that there has to be a special children's channel on TV where no advertising should be allowed.
With this changement the advertising in general on other channels could be without any restrictions.
I disagree.
First of all, how can you make that children don't see an advert.
You can't write age 5+ before every advert.
Second of all, why should a television advert harm a child aged plus 5.
I've never seen an advert that could harm a child.
And I also think that children on that age won't even know the meaning of an advert.
Well maybe that could be the only "reason" why they should not see an advert.
There may be some adverts that don't really direct to the meaning of the product, but those adverts won't make a child go "crazy" or make them "stupid".
There are even some cartoons that are worse than television adverts, but no one bats an eye to that.
Also many TV canals wouldn't allow such a "law", because they would make less money, and the people who'd like to advertise wouldn't want to do so anymore.
For example toy adverts, how could kids know about the newest toy on the market, kids also have wantings and we should not take that away from them.
I think the laws for an advert are even too strict sometimes.
People always want to go stricter and they are triggered by every little thing, but why are they like that?
I really don't know.
Television advertising directed toward young children is a common topic.
There are many arguments for and against.
So I will explain one or two.
The people that are against advertising directet toward young children, argue, that the influence of young kids is enormeous, because they can't triage the informations.
So they want to have all of the objects they had seen on TV.
But there are as always people that are in favour to tv advertising toward young children, because the children learn how to handle the source of advertising, and learn, that they d'ont need all, what they saw in TV.
My opignion is like the first argument.
I think that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed.
The kids shoulden't sit for a long time in front of the TV, they should go out in the nature and play games.
If the kids are out, they can not watch TV advertising.So the problem is solved.
So I agree with the statement.
Ps: If the children went with their parents to the supermarked or to an other shop.
They want to have all the things they saw on TV, so it's quite a hard job for the parents to change the opignion og "needing" that.
"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
First of all, there's a difference between adult television programms and children programm.
So you have to define about which programm we are speaking.
When we talk about the adult programm, I agree with this hypothesis.
There are to many commericals and things that isn't for young children.
E.g.
There are a few commercials where women and men are half nacked.
When children see this commericals, they maybe think what the commericals shows is real.
So their sexual behavior will be an other as the sexual behavior of the children who didn't see the commericals in young age.
There are also too much movies with violence.
E.g.
war films like Hotel Ruanda or American Sniper.
This movies aren't good for the children's mental.
But when we talk about the children programm, I mostly disagree with the hypothesis.
The programm is made for the children.
The aim of this series is that children learn and see new things so.
It's really important in this world that you have a big knowledge.
And the easiest way to learn is when you do it in young age.
Children can learn e.g.
how to act with teachers or with other children.
They see that there's more than just the house where they live and the family.
The learn that there is more than a cat or a dog or there is more than their mothertongue.
Otherwise it's really difficult to learn children something that they can't see.
It's really important for the developpment of the tolerance.
Maybe they never saw a black man before and when they see one at the first time the maybe think that this man is ill or something like this.
In my opinion the parents have watch something children friendly when their children are around.
So the children can learn something and also the parents can maybe learn something.
I totally agree with this statement.
I don`t have a problem if companies want to advertise for themselves with short television scenes.
I just think that they just have to stay fair.
Often if a little child sees a television advertise it really wishes it could have this stuff.
The parents often suffer of that and calm the child.
If a child knows, that isn`t allowed to have something, he or she starts crying and screaming.
The parents have to handle with that.
Another reason why I think that should be banished is, that if a mother wants to purchase the whole food of the week in the supermarket, their children often have to attend them, until they`re not in school.
During shoppinng, the children are bored and often just start crying because of very small things.
For exampe, the child would like to have the delicious chocoloate, which he or she saw in the advertising, the child doesn`stop crying as long as he or she doesn`nt get it.
The mother is annoyed or just feels ashamed and because of that she purchases that chocolate for her kid, that she can continue with her purchase.
In my opinion the companies just want take advantage out of that.
They know that if a child really want to have something, they often get that after a certain time.
In my opinion children shouldn`t be influenced by anybody in their chosing of stuff for playing.
They should could deside by themselves, without any influence of television advertising.
A child should listen to it`s own real desires.
On the other hand I have to be honest and have to say, that I understand the companies.
Not only the adults are their customers, but also teenagers and little children.
They want to sell as much of their products as possible.
Theiy`re often not the only company, which sells products for kids.So they have to advertise for their product as good as possible.
Small kids often watc television series.
For the companies it is the best place there to reach the children and advertise as good as possible.
I think children may watch the tv but of corse just at a strict time.
My cousines for example (3 and 5 years old) watch every evening the "sandman" and then they have to go to sleep.
They're happy with that and my aunt can do the kitchen in this time.
But I also know another exaple the brother of my friend (5 years old) may watch the tv when he has done his homeworks.
He sit infront of the tv and watch untill the dinner is ready, sometimes that are 3 houres or more and that is to much for a child.
You have to be strict with your children and show them how to acept your rules.
In my opinion a child have to play outside - in the garden or in a park - that dosen't matter but it's not good for the kids when they just sit in the house or in the appartment they must have fresh air and sunlight.
But in my opinion it's to much to forbidden the tv.
So I disagree because when children may watch at a strict time that's good, like this they learn how to acept rules.
Children watch television almost every day.
It gets continously more and more daily to watch TV before going to bed or in the morning after getting up.
Should television advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?
One argument that it should be allowed is, that children can create a bigger fantasy with the things they see in the AD.
Lots of children don't know any of those things before the watch TV or before they go to a supermarket with their parents.
They will get to know these products also without any AD.
With the countinously higher usage of internet and social media it's not possible to stop advertising TV.
If it would be stopped the children could also watch the AD in the internet or like 10 years ago in a newspaper or a magazine.
This argument belongs to a time in wich the media wasn't developed like it's now.
With television ADs children could tell their parents what they wanted as a christmas or as a birthday present easily.
Nowaday the internet can also give them ideas but a few years ago the children fetched their ideas from TV spots and every time they were repeated they screamed that the parants came to watch.
They learned the melody or the text of the spot by heart, also this is a positive argument.
An Arguments that it shouldn't be allowed is, that the children can't build their own fantasy without the televison.
Especially two years old children wich realise things in TV for the first time and can keep them in mind could be scared from tons of new inputs in their brains.
They could be overused and can't handle all those things.
Another argument is, that children get addicted to ADs because they want the things they promise to them or because it's so fascinating for children from age two to five.
Lots of children watch a lot of TV during the whole day.
An argument against TV advertisment is, that children keep staying in the house to watch some spots wich fascinates them.
So they stay in the house and don't realise that the nature, wich is very good for children to learn new things, waits outside.
With this the children stay much longer in front of the TV than years ago.
This is very unhealthy.
Children need to move, run around, play with others and discover themselves and the world around them, not only a fictional TV world.
My opinion is, that televison advertising can't be stopped because of the continously higher social media amount.
If it could be stopped, I would stop it.
I think it's very important to play in the nature with the little children.
If I was a mother of a two to fice year old child I would control their usage of TV.
I would tell them that they can watch TV for example in the evening for a half hour and in the rest of the day my children should play in the nature, they should discover new places, new friends and new animals.
They could paint a picture or other things, but I wouldn't let them watch TV the whole aternoon for example.
The TV advertising makes lots of children lazy and addicted in social media.
I hope the media revolution is not growing up as fast as it did in the last years.
At the moment the television is a big problem for the most children.
So some people think that is better to not allowe the television advertising.
First the television isn't helpful for the children, because the childeren more like to watch televison, than play with other children.
The social contact with other children isn't importent for the children.
The biggest problem is, that they haven't any idear what to play in the nature and what to play with other childs.
The children should have the option to be creative.
The social contact is also importent, because they should learn how to handle a discussion.
For a discussion they have to form an own oppinion and this is important for the graduation.
An other point is that a television is expensive an not everybody can buy one, so the children become jalous of each other.
Finally when the television isn't longer allowed, the children could play more outside and with other children.
One desagreement is that the televion shows also good things, from which the children can learn something.
On the television are also documentations, which are very useful for everybody.
Another point is that the televison brings up a lot of jobs.
Every program on the television needs people who produce the series, the news, the shows and the documentations.
One least point is that the television shows the news and the oppinion about diffrent subjects.
I think it's importent that the children play with each other, they could learn so much about everything, when the look where and why they live.
But I think the television is another world, where the children can dream and do something else than everytime think and learn.
So I thnink the television adverising should be allowed.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed

First of all it's clear that television advertising isn't the best influence for young children.
With exiting, colourful and loud advertising for toys, clothes or food a childs attention is easily catched.
They now have the impression that they only want this one thing in the advertising and beacuse children are still so naive they believe everything what is said in the advertising.
On the other hand children should learn how advertising companys trick customers because when they don't learn those things as a child they have to learn it when they are older and thats as bad as when they're young when not even worse.
It's also business of the parents if they want that their children to see advertising or not so it shouldn't be a law or a rule about it but let the parents decide whats best for their own children.
Besides I think it would be better for children to play outside and be creative by their own instead of watching to much television.
And if they don't, advertising can't have a bad influence on them.
However advertising isn't always a bad thing.
Children can learn that the sometimes want things but it isn't bad when they didn't get it.
Or they learn that they have to wait for something and the can't just always point with their finger and their parents get it for them.
With this they are not going to be spoiled when they're older.
It's also nearly impossible to ban advertising from television so if advertising shouldn't be allowed televisoion advertising directed toward young children you can't let them watch television anymore and I think that's clearly unfair.
So in my opinion advertising should be allowed for young children.
I just think it's important that parents know how much television their children are watching and that they have some rules about using the television for their younger children.
If that happens I don't think advertising can have such a bad influence on the young children even though I know that advertising has an influence on us.
A child which is aged two to five years old is a young child.
A young child who should playing with other children in the country.
So they have connected frienships and be outside.
To be outiside is a important point.
Television is a electric device that is coming soon, so the child looks soon as posibile televison when they grows up.
It's also a question what the child look's.
When they looks childmaternity films it be ok, despite it's important to looks how long your daughter or son show television.
If they show a very long time it isn't well or when they looks horror films or other not childmaternity in this aged.
The child is in a phase that they learnt much of things which is very important for live.
Play with children, have friends, be outside with a lot of nature things, etc.
My mind of this statement is that child which is aged two to five years old is a important age to connect with other friends.
When they playing with neighbours the child is outside, should connect friendships with other children and a good way to have a very well childhood.
For me, children shouldn't shows television in this aged, maybe a little childhood serie at evening for sleeping.
OK. Prepositions are no words to end sentences with.
The universe is a cruel, uncaring void.
The key to being happy isn't a search for meaning.
It's just to keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense and eventually you'll be dead.
How many push-ups can Chuck Norris do?
All of them.
Today more and more children are watching TV at home.
The parents are often at work and have no time for their kids.
The easiest way is to leave the kids infront of the televesion.
The Kids are busy in this moment.
But between the shows it have advertising spots extra made for young children.
Is it correct to make this kind of television advertising for young kids?
Because of the television advertising spots a kid comes in contact with the modern ways to communicate.
It's maybe easier to understand and the kid learns the easy to speek.
The way a kid speak in their freetime depends on how much they watch TV.
The Television adevertising influence the mind of a young kid.
A kid at this age should more think at themselve.
It can't be the right way to manipulate a kid.
In my opinion kids aged two to five shouldn't watch TV.
The Television advertising influence their mind.
We should let them be kids with their own mind and opinion.
They should play outside with friends.
The term "advertisement" is mostly seen in a negative light.
Especially when connected with children.
Parents feel the natural need to protect their child from anything that might harm them.
Technology and television is more and more common with newer generations and children.
In todays society it is seen as normal for a young child to play with an IPhone while waiting for their mother or even to watch hours of TV.
But is it good for them?
While watching television it, the child automaticly comes in contact with advertiesments, directed specificly towards them.
With firendly music playing and colourfull backrounds.
But being exposed to this kind of materialism being that young could influence children alot.
Big companies know, that children are the weak point of their parents and use that to pressure them.
How can anyone say no when their little girl with a big smile askes for a new barbie?
Companies use the innocense an naitivity of the children to profit.
Children that young don't really understand whats infront of them and maybe shouldn't be confronted with something that is used only to grab money.
It also seems like that ads want to tell children what to like.
Girls like pink and boys like blue.
Kids get influenced by that alot and get pushed into sterieo types and gender roles.
But also one can say that this all is over exagerated.
Is it that bad for a child to want a new shiny toy?
Children are in the end only children and don't see anything bad in that.
For me personaly, I would't let my children watch TV that young in the first place.
I think for a child that young it is important to be in touch with what is around you not what you see on TV, ads or on a phone screen.
I don't think it is that big of a problem if ads are directed to them.
I certanly don't think it is very healthy for a kid to watch alot of TV anyways but i'm torn about the banning part.
In the end we all are overthrown with ads anyways and it is still the decision of the parent whether they want to get their child something or not.
contra arguments:
Television isn`t good for young children because it can destroy their eyes.
More children suffer on shortseeing and they need glasses to correct it.
The children don`t learn of the television.
The television is only used for the entertainment of children.
Maybe the social contact is reduced because the children don`t want to play with their freinds anymore because to watch television is more important.
pro arguments:
The children are entertained.
They don`t need attention of somebody and are silence.
First it is important what kind of film or series deos a child watch.
It`s better if a child (two to five years) watch films expecially for children.
There are also some special series for young people, for example Dora.
In the film Dora, there is a girl who speak quite slowly and explain every difficult word very easily.
So if a child watches films with this topic it`s good to let them watch these films.
But it`s not good and helpful, if a child watches actionfilms or horrorfilms.
This can be 
rellay bad for a child.
So it`s very important to find the correct subject for a young boy or girl so they aren`t afraid or feel bad afterwards.
A next important point to talk about is the time.
How long should a child, aged two to five, whatch TV per day or week.
I think its quite difficult, it depends on the special caracter of a child, but at least the parents should not allowed their children to whatch more 30 minutes TV each day!
It`s more important for a child to play with friends or do some creative stuff, for example drawing.
It could be possilbe, that to much TV could  change a childs caracter.
When they can`t play outside with friends, maybe the woul not play outside if they are older.
So they are often alone later.
Then they could get into a depression or something like that.
So if they watch 30 minutes or less each day and a series expesially created for children, it`s okey to let the children watch TV, but not longer because it could be bad or not helpful later when the child gets older.
Yes, I think that television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
Because the children betweent two and five are too young and advertising has a bad effect on them.
I definitely agree with this statement.
First of all I have to say that children in this age are influenced so easily.
They believe every thing somebody tells them.
That is the main problem in this topic.
When children see something in the television advertising they believe it if it is true or not.
That could have a negative effect because children think that this is the truth and they want everything they shown on TV.
When I was young, my parents only allowed me to look films because they did not like TV very much.
They said that the advertising is boring and I should not watch it.
I think they said this because they thought that it could have a negative effect on me.
An other point is that children can not make a difference between advertising and a serie or film.
For them TV is TV and they do not even now what advertising is.
So how can they understand the use of advertising.
They only see it and think that this is the real life and that they want the same thing like the person in the scene.
I think there are many adverts which want to direct to young children because they think that this children are easily influenced.
It is easier to reach children than their parents or other adults.
So they try to reach the adults with using their children.
Many parents make everything for their child and like this it is easy to influence the parents with the young children.
Have you ever noticed that when your children watch television they are confronted with a lot of advertising?
When you let your kid watching television, you know that it will see adverts too.
You accept this fact by allowing your child to watch television by itself.
Companies search for young customers who could buy their products or beg to their parents to buy these so this strategy is allowed.
Young children should also get used to watch, comment and think critical about an advertisement.
But young children (aged two to five) are still very sensible and believe all or a lot of the things said in tv.
And as the advertising directly thought for these children are sometimes very convincing the children are manipulated.
We should not allow the manipulation of our kids.
Even the adults are a bit manipulated!
But they have experiences that the things told in the television are not always as they should be.
Children nowadays are also confronted by advertisements in the streets, in magazines or even in the internet.
But it isn't possible to remove all these adverts, there is too much lobbying of the companies.
For me personally it is clear that I don't support this kind of advertising.
But I also think that young children should not watch television too often.
And if the parents look after their children they can switch off the television if a manipulating advert appears.
In the first line, experts say that watching television is bad for the children, for their eyes and their brain.
In a free, but regulated market companies have the right to advertise to any target audience they please, thus maximizing their surplus value.
Why they haven't stopped at children doesn't seem all that surprising considering the strategy they do business with.
This stategy might seem a little ignorant, because many are arguing that children should not be influenced by commercial advertising at such a young age.
Scientific studies have proven that children pick up a lot of information from watching TV, which obviously includes any advertisements.
Cereal boxes now contain superhero figures, every film has its own merchandise and every baby has at least a few corporate toys lying around the house somewhere.
The strategy targets children because they do not generate their own surplus, neither do they earn any pocket money (at that stage), yet their imagination welcomes said smart advertising.
This causes them to put pressure on parents, which causes even more pressure as every parent now has the job of proving to other parents that they buy them toys, just like everyone else.
If they target the parents, far less short-lasting products like toys and gadgets will be sold/bought because it's far harder to convince a parent to buy something if all you have to do is convince a child to convince its parent, which in turn accelerates the speed in which products are consu
Television advertising is annoying.
But is it also annoying or even bad for children or just for older people like us ?
Some advertisings are psyhologically well-organised and as kids, who are easyly-amazed are watching TV as well, it would be a good question if it should be allowed to direct advertiing to kids or not.
In sight of a parent I'd say it should noot be allowed.
If they see the advertise they want to have it immediately and try to get it.
This can be really annoying and also very stressful.
A second point to agree to this statement is, that they always got showed what they don't have.
They may feel sad because they know they can't afford it.
Third, the kids should learn to live with less.
So many spoiled kids don't learn how to deal with money and will have problems when they get older.
But there are also some points which show that it can be allowed but it isn't really necessary.
For example it is the child who decides whether they buy the toy or whatever.
The parents decide and they should have enough confidence to say no if they don't want it.
Also, I think young children do not care about the advertising too much.
They just want to watch their series or films.
They may be annoyed by it as well.
In my opinion, it should not be allowed to direct advertising to young children.
It is causes unnecessary problems.
Kids should not be influenced by advertising.
Otherwise they start to measure themself with other people and with what they have and what they don't have.
Should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) be allowed?
Which advantages and disadvantages are included?
First of all, it is true that publicity affects children and adults in order to buy something presented in the ad.
People often want this specific object, after they've watched an ad about it.
That's like publicity works and that's why it is utilized by many companies to spread their product, even though it can cost a lot.
They invest, because it^s very likely to make surplus.
But, however, the question is, if there should be a barrier in order to ommit commercial influences on children not older than five.
If it is important or nonsense is very causing discussions.
On one hand it's questionable whether those kids really care about ads and their messages/products, even when it's easy to imagine, that they will most likely care, if it's an advertising about toys like playmobil.
But how is it possible to control and manifest such a prohibition?
It seems impossible and at least it would be very hard.
Should televison advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?
The statement is not easy to comment because there are many reasons for and against television advertising.
In the moment I can't say if I'm agree or disagree with the statement.
In my childhood I hadn't watch television for a long time in the day.
My siblings and I played together in the garden.
We played with things in the natur.
At first I will give you some reasons for television advertising directed toward young children.
With television advertising children learn the new things in the world.
They see what it gives for new plays and they can make some specific wishes for birthday or christmas.
The parents can use this wishes as a little present if the children were nice and help in the household.
But they are also some reasons against television advertising.
Children had a bad environement and to many wishes.
They will have everything new and it is very hard to say "No!"
to lovely big eyes from your kid.
Children need to play in the natur with some things from the natur.
It is important that children learn to play alone without the new plays.
I think young children aged two or five should not be directed by television advertising.
It isn't good for them.
They need to life without television and other electronic machines.
Advertising is all over the world and they don't need some more advertising in the television.
Essay Television advertising 

We are living in a time whre electronic thing are normal.
The way how we spend our social life has change in the  last 40 years.
With his statement the question comes up if that is a good or a bad change.
Becouse of that in this essay i will talk about "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Would it be better when young children have not the chace to watch television?
First i will talk about the negativ points when it would not be allowed.
Some moms and dads are really tankfull when they have for instance one hour without looking after their children because they are silent watching television.
Moreover there are also a lot of very useful and interessting scences witch could be very helpful in their life later.
One the other hand exist also a lot of positive points when it would not be allowed.
Firsty we can say that the children in 1888 had a wonderful chindrenhood also without television.
Furthermore biologies found out that watchig television is not good for brains who have not finished grownd.
There are such a lot of things to do in the nature than sitting at home.
In conclusion there are positiv and negativ aspects.
From my point of view the answer is clear.
Children must have the chance to live their live in the nature.without electronic devices.
Later in theit life the computer and the lelefision become a more important role and that is early enough.
Watching television has become part of our daily life.
Most households own a television and most people enjoy watching films, series or the news on it, although every channel has an advertisement break.
These advertisements are directed to many different people.
The subject to debate is about whether television advertisement directed towards young children aged two to five should be allowed or not.
Advertisement for young children can be a good opportunity for them to get hold of what is going on in the world or what's new for them on the market.
They can form an own opinion on what they'd like to play with and if those advertisements are proved, parents don't have to look around themselves anymore, so they'd have more time for other things.
Furthermore, all channels on the television get interrupted by advertisement.
If channels for young children don't show advertisement that is safe for children anymore, parents can't let the children rest in front of the television anymore because they have to make sure it is safe for them all the time.
But with advertisement for children, parents could let the children watch the television while doing other things, for instance the household, which would be a great relief for them.
However, if there isn't a regulation for on which channels those child advertisements should be shown, olderchildren and adults would probably get annoyed very fast from it.
In addition to that, it is not healthy for such young children to watch the television.
Although something might seem harmless to us, children can get scared very easily.
Advertisement for children would promote children watching the television.
In conclusion I would say that I do agree with this statement.
I don't like the idea of children watching the television, especially advertisement as they can get brainwashed easily and aren't able to filter what is good or bad for them.
I would agree with channels for children that are on the television for just a few hours per day, but there are so many other things you can do with your children that are fun too.
This essay will be about the topic of advertisments directed towards young children.
It is a very controversial topic and there are valid points for and against those commercials.
The biggest problem in my opinion is that very young children can't correctly judge if they need something or not.
Because of that they can very easily manipulated.
This is a big problem because companies can design certain types of advertisments to specifically target those age groups.
At this age they can't already realise what they really need and what they don't.
Because of that the children might want something very useless and the parents who want to do their children a favour give in an buy a lot of unnecessary stuff.
On the other hand people say that it is the parents responsibility to not let their children watch television at such a young age.
This is not good for the development of the child anyways.
Also it is the parents who might buy those things for their children, not the children themselves.
This further says that it is the parent's fault if those commercials work on their children.
It would also be problematic to prohibit such advertisments.
How do you prove that an advertisment is specifically targeting children that are below for example the age of 5?
This is very difficult and may lead to big and expensive court cases.
Although I agree with the point that children are easily manipulated and it is not a good thing to exploit that, I don't agree that commercials like this should be prohibited.
In my opinion it is the parent's responsibility to protect their own children from such advertisments.
Every parent has the possibility of stopping this, either by not letting their child watch television or by not giving in and buying unnecessary stuff.
Many people watch television.
Also young children.
When we watch TV, you can be sure, that there are advertising.
Now, the question is: Is it possible to let watch our children the television advertising?
In this essay, I'm going to explain a few arguments according to the statement.
First of all, for the advertisers, children are the best victims.
That means, when a child sees in the television a new toy, and the child wants it, they go to the mother or father and they buy the new toy.
Children can be influenced very well.
For the first contra-argument, I put the argument from above in a negative form: Children can be influenced very well.
When they see something in the television, they want it.
For the parents, it's not easy.
But children don't see only advertising for children: There are many advertisings, that, in my point of view, are critical for children.
For example advertising for cigarrets or alcohol, or maybe advertising with sex.
The children are too young to be confrontate with such things.
In my opinion, the advertising shouldn't be that much.
It isn't a crime to show advertising for children.
But I think, the people should be aware of dangerous things like alcohol.
In generally: Children shouldn't watch so much TV.
It isn't healthy.
The whole system of media is like a brainwash, and children are victims, so we should save them.
First of all you need to specify what adverts directed to children are and when its directed toward children.
Making adverts for products that are likely to be liked by children, are directed toward children but when they are watching TV, any advert is for the eyes of children cause they are watching it anyway.
To not allow those adverts, you need to exactly specify what those are but since it's not possible to effectively do this, forbidding them becomes hard too.
An Aspect of this problem is, that young children that can be easily affected by adverts shouldn't in fact get in contact with them cause parents have the responsibility to decide what their kids should watch and what they shouldn't watch.
And even when they get attracted by something they've seen in an advert, the decision to get it is mostly still at the parents.
In this case, advertisings directed toward young children are moreover directed to the parents, who cannot be influenced that easily.
If you take in consideration, that children in the age of two to five hardly get attracted by pornoraphic adverts, it's not bad for them if they are attracted by things they wan't to play with.
Another aspect that can be problematic when forbidding adverts directed toward children is, that those who produce stuff to play for the childs, they have a disadvantage in competition and can't make publicity for their products.
On the other hand, children at this age actually can be influenced easier by things they see and they learn quicker from them.
So, if an advert says, that the product they have is "the best to play with in the world", it's more likely that the young children believe this, so they are using it for their advantage.
In the end, because adverts that are directed toward young children rarely have something really bad in them, they shouldn't get a disadvantage because they can't make adverts for their products.
The responsibility for the children in this age is at the parents and they have to decide what is good for their kids and what isn't.
Television advertisements have always been very influencal.
That may be fine for advertisements made for adults.
But children can't decide like grown-ups whether they like something or not.
For that reason, it is very controversial if ads for infants should be allowed.
On the pro side, the companies have to decide on their own if they want to abuse children like this.
At last, it is their product and at the moment, there is no real reason for them, why they schouldn't advertise it.
But then, critics say that it is morally wrong to make advertisements for children.
Children are so easily influenced, which means that they only want to sell their product.
It doesn't always be a bad thing though, since companies that only sell products for infants should also have a possibility to advertise them.
But many companies don't care, since it works the best this way.
Another argument against such a law is that influencal advertisements shouldn't only be banned for children below the age of five, but for everyone.
Because nobody really wants to see those ads and they can also have an impact on older people.
Especially old, retired people often fall for those products, because they have seen its adverstisement in the television.
I think it's very controversial to make advertisements directed towards young children.
Those companies often just aim to make profit and don't care, what impact that could have on younger people.
To start things of I think these adverts shouldn't be allowed.
Children at this age are easily influenced and it can make raising a child even harder if it is constantly exposed to "all the cool new stuff that you definitely need".
Imagine if a family wants to raise their child without the use of modern technology or keeping it to a minimum.
Now they're watching a childrens movie that's beeing aired on television.
If there suddenly pops up an advertisemet which talks about a superb new laptop for children, the kid would, naturally, want it.
And now try to explain to your child that these things are completely annoying, useless and a waste of money.
I don't think that it would help.
On the other hand, it can help if you want these kind of products for your kid.
Picking out a gift for a small child can be extremly hard to do.
It would be that much easier if you knew what the kid wants because it saw it in an advert and told you that it wants it.
All in all I suppose it's really about the amount of advert and what is advertised.
You could probably accept it if a new flavour of ice cream is advertised or the brand new Hello Kitty school bag is presented.
But as I've said, all the computers, smartphones and tablets for children are just awful and can destroy a kid's early life.
So based on all I've said now, there would have to be a ban on a specific kind of advert.
The problem is that the modern day capitalism wouldn't allow to give an unfair disadvantage to a part of the market.
Television advertising directed towards young children can heavily and badly influence them, so they should not be allowed.
Or so some people may think.
But does it really influence them and do they really watch that much TV at this young and prestine age?
Child protection is a  very important matter, and in every case politicians and foremost parents try to protect or isolate them from everything that possibly could hurt or damage their tiny heads.
Rightfully so, advertising for a consumer group this young is irritating.
Children are in their earliest stages of development and very fragile.
On the other hand, do children aged 2 to 5 watch even Tv?
And even if they get influenced by advertisements, does it matter?
Every good parent wil supervise the kids' hunger for material consume; advertisements do not work when the target audience has no money, can hardly speak correlating sentences and cries a lot.
Being no expert in either childrens TV or advertising for said age group, I am not too sure if there is a substantual amount of advertising for children that could be banned.
In this case, banning an non-existentual thing does no make sense.
Another important question is, if children aged 2 to 5 really are more influenceable by advertisements than any other age group.
At this stage, why not ban advertisements for everyone?
Adult humans are much more in danger to act the way the advertisement wants, because of the factors money, frustration, boasting and greed.
Advertisements for children surely does not benefit them.
But if we allow advertisements for any other age group, so should they also be allowed for children.
What is important though, is that children should be taught on how to process and react to advertisements directed towards them.
If they can be taught to ignore the effect and make advertisements redundant, then the problem solves itself.
Should the television industry be allowed to influence little children.
In this essay, I want to consider about the influence of little children by the medias, especially the television and if it should be allowed.
That the adults are influced by media isn't a secret.
Whenever you're listening music or watching the news, there's a direction which tells us something about the writer of the music or television program.
So is it even possible to isolate a little child of all the influences of media?
Maybe the different opinions or messages help them to think in different directions and to consider all different views.
In advertisings, the technology industry suggets young children that they need a mobile phone or another gadget to have fun.
On the other side: The parents are free to decide if they're willing to buy them a mobile phone or not.
On the other side, there are programs like "Dora".
Little Dora shows for example the children what a flower is and what it looks like.
But nowadays, there are many programs which show us violence against others.
The child could probably learn that it's okay to hit others without consequences.
In my opinion, little childrem shouln't even watch TV.
They have to play outside with their mates and explore the environment.
I wouldn't want that my child has a phone before they're thirteen, not matter if the other children has already phones.
So there exists no longer a problem if the television influences our children.
With our generations of technology, there's no longer possible to raise our children out of the influences of technology.
There exists the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
It is not easy to say if that is right or false, because it depends to the point of view.
A manager of a toy company sees it diffrent than parents.
At one hand, advertising is good to know the world.
So the children see what there exists, like toys or movies and can start to have an own opinion.
For example, they see a lot of ponies in television.
So a young girl can start loving horses and want to learn horseriding.
She starts to develope an own character.
At the other hand, television advertising can make that all children love the same things when they watch the same advertisement.
So, pherhaps most girls love playing with barbies and had many of them.
If a girl doesn't have a television or doesn't see this advertisement, she's automatically an outsider.
It's easy to make children in this age believe that what they see in television is true.
So, big companies can sell a lot of their products, if the children want their products, and if they don't get them, they're unhappy.
I think it's not bad if children in this age see television advertising, but the parents have to take care, what their children see in television.
In our time, we can't prohibit that children see advertisements.
If they always see advertisement of McDonalds, they start wanting eat only this food and forget that it's not healthy.
And in my opinion, the parents don't have to buy all the things which children see in advertisement and then want it.
They have to keep strict.
Children watch television to enjoy the afternoon or the have good dreams during the night and advertisements just disturbe there.
Cildren do not know how to handl money and they do not know consequenses of the things they do.
Advertisement is influenting children on a level they do not know at the age under five.Children should anyway not watch a lot of TV and if there are advertisements the programs last longer so they have to spend more time watching TV.
because they want to watch a program to the end.Children should spend time outdorrs or playing and enjoy there time with no or just few dutys.
So TV for children should just send a program during specific time slots.
Advertisments are often unreaistic and led to wrong impressions especialy when seen by children because they do not know what you can do and what is unrealistic or imposible.
So childs try things that they should not and would never do if they hadn't watched TV-advertisements.
Also Advertisements are corrupt!
Rich companis can do a lot of it and get more costumers so they get even richer while poor companis can just do a little and will only reach a few people and won't get a lot of money so they stay poor and often get bought by a rich company so that in the end we only heve one or two very rich companis who dominate the market and no other company can rise because the rich ones can lower the price without lossing much while the small one can't exist at the low price.Because especially children don't kniw what other companis exist and when the see a advertisement for product X from company Y they just want product X from company Y and not from company P.
So all in all the advertisement to children makes them wanting things they do not need and makes them spend more time on-screen while the big companis get even bigger and bring small companis to give up.
Illuminati confirmed
Although advertising in general is a rather controversial topic, the discussions usually escalate when it comes to specific fields of advertisement, one of these arguable fields being the advertisement toward children.
Seeing the actual purpose behind advertising is leading people to believe they need these products, it comes as no surprise that advertisements are very manipulative, especially on young, naïve children.
Then again, given we are talking about children, the decision on whether or not to buy the product the toddlers perhaps starts quarrelling for lies with their parents.
What is more is that children will not necessarily notice the actual purpose behind avertising but will rather be fascinated by the variety of colours and shapes generally used in advertisements for children.
This can even evoke positive emotions and spur the childrens' fantasy instead of causing them to want the toy.
Before this topic can be discussed at length, though, there is yet another question which demands a satisfying answer: Why would children aged two to five even be subject to television advertising?
Children in that age are supposed to be playing outdoors or learning to walk before having to deal with the manipulative effects of television advertising.
That being said, I do personally not oppose to advertisements, be that to children or to adults alike.
In today's world, being able to resist the seductive effects of advertisements becomes increasingly important.
Since we know children learn easier than adults, the sooner they get into contact with ads and the sooner they learn to resist them and make choices for themselves without being influenced, the better.
For adult people TV advertising is nothing special anymore.
Most of the people don't even pay attention to it.
There is a wide range from different kinds of advertising from cleaning substances to shoes there is everything.
But the question is, is TV advertising harming young childern from the age two to five?
As sad as it sounds but kids these days even in such a young age are confronted with TV and other technical devices.
Kids in such a young age are in the middle of developing and learning things about the world, how to act, how to speak and so on.
So when a child watches a youtube video for example and suddenly a commercial pops up, the parents don't know what kind of commercial it is.
The commercial shows the child a new toy and manipulates it towards wanting it.
The child starts to beg for it and the parents are in a dumb situation.
Which is a clear pro argument for not allow commercials designed for kids.
On the other hand Parents should guard their children when they are watching something in the internet.
In the TV most kids are probably watching the Kids TV-Channel, where the commercials are adapted to the watchers and so are Kids friendly.
They should teach their children that they can't have everything in the commercials.
In my opinion I think it is a stupid idea to developed commercials directed towards such young children.
I think it is sad that the industry has to target even babies and toddlers to sell their products.
But I think if it would happen the parents should teach their children that they can't have everything shown in the commercial.
Because this will help them in their life.
Because when they get everything they want their whole childhood they learn that this is normal.
And they will get problem in their adulthood.
They could get ,,shoppoholics'' and could drown in their debts.
In the end I would say stop commercials directed towards kids.
     Televison advertising was always a reason to discuss.
One of the things that were discussed for example was anti-advertising.
This kind of advertising isn't allowed anymore nowadays.
Another thing that is being discussed is the television advertising directed toward young children.
The question of this discussion is if it should be forbidden or not.
One of the things about advertising directed toward young children is, that the young children go to their parents after watching TV and say: "You need that, you need that!
", which, of course, is a good thing for the companies, because sometimes the parents are going to buy it.
But there's also another point to look at this.
Advertisements often show something that isn't about their advertised product or they promise something that isn't real.
The children will often believe this and than they have a wrong picture of this product.
Another good thing about the advertising directed to young children is, that the adults don't have to watch it, and they won't get angry about it.
This isn't even bad for the companies, because the children are going to tell their parents about it, and they'll probably find it entertaining too.
Another argument is, that the TV-shows also have to earn money, they can' just 
      In my opinion it isn't really a bad thing to do advertising directed to young children, even if the children get a wrong impression.
The parents should just tell them about it and when they grow up, they probably won't be even remembering this.
Nowadays, advertising in television is a big part of advertising and marketing for companies of any kind.
With television it is possible to reach a big audience and timed at the right moment - for example during a particular show - it is even possible to direct advertisements towards your targeted audience.
This applies for audiences at any age, including children.
Directing advertisements towards children is a clever move, one might say.
Children are easily influenced and get overly excited very quickly.
So for companies that produce, let us say toys, it is a good idea to broadcast advertisements on television channels with a young audience, such as the Disney Channel.
This might lead to a boost in sales and will support a flourishing economy.
From a moral standpoint it is a bit difficult.
Taking advantage of children, who are - as mentioned above - easily influenced, is pretty ruthless.
Children might pressure their parents to buy product that their families do not need or - even worse - can not afford.
But does a ban of advertising directed towards children aged two to five really make sense?
Children from five years and upwards are neither harder to influence (in some cases it is even easier due to peer pressure), nor are they more conscious of what they need.
Also there are a lot more children watching television above the age of five than before, since most of the parents  will not let their children watch television too often, when they are in their early years.
So to conclude I would say that a ban of such advertisements would not really make sense beacuse not that many children aged two to five watch television.
A regulation of some kind would make sense though, because morally it is arguably wrong to target young people who are easy to influence and do not really have a sense of what they can or can not afford or what they really need.
Televisions are something very common in our modern society.
Nearly in every house is one or are more than one televisions.
Everybody loves to watch TV because you do not have to think for yourself.
A lot of businesses use it to make adverts.
The question is: Should this be forbidden for young children?
There are two positions to take.
One is to allow this because as a mother you can put your children in front of the TV and they are happy.
You can do something on your own.
Maybe they even learn something.
Especially series only for children can be useful.
On the other hand there are more arguments that it should not be allowed.
To much TV on each day can damage a brain very bad.
The children do not have to think on their owns.
The get a wrong image of the world.
Even their fantasy can be blocked because they do not think and they never have to invent something during playing in the garden.
Many relationships can not be developed because they do not interact with other children.
At worst case not even with their parents.
The can not get some faith or believe in their family.
How should it work that they can become a good person.
They will have many problems in school.
Even during adulthood.
Another negative point of advertisement is that they give a wrong image of the world.
With advertisement you manipulate the people.
They want to be like the pretty people in the clips, they want to buy the products and even they want to be like this people.
Especially for children it can cause diseases.
For example anorexia and others like this.
They are not very selfconfident.
My opinion about this topic is very clear.
I think young children should not watch TV.
The better are movie on DVD or Blue-Ray.
Because there is nothing else than the movie.
I think a good solution are plays or playing with other children in the neighbourhood.
Probably a Babysitter can help to do something on your own for half a day.
Relationships are very important.
Without a family or frineds you can trust in you are nothing in your life.
If you turn on your television in the morning, you will most likely see a show for kids, like Dora, which teaches children a foreign language.
But as the show ends, commercials start and you'll see ads for toys, dolls etc.
If your kid is watching this with you, he or she might get very excited and will want you to buy the item for them.
But all you wanted to do was for the kid to get some education while being entertained.
Now you ask yourself: Should television ads directed towards young kids be prohibited?
In Switzerland, freedom of any kinds is highly valued.
Freedom of speech particularly, as one can oppose what the government says openly.
Now if someone wanted to air a commercial, they have the right to do so.
By prohibiting television ads towards young children, this would definitely be a violation of the freedom of speech, one of the main values of the western societies.
In western societies, another main value is critical thinking and developing an own opinion.
This has to be taught at an early age, or the kids will not have those skills.
By watching commercials directed at them, they get so easily influenced in liking or disliking something that they don't really develop their own opinion.
They just follow the people and things that seem cool or trendy, but don't try t analyze what's happening to them.
When those kids grow up, they believe everything they hear, they don't think twice about anything.
This is exctly what has happened in the USA where everyone believed all the fake news in the internet, which lead to the election of Donald Trump.
Is that what we want for Switzerland, the election of our own Donald Trump?
For me, the answer is a clear no, and the first thing we can do against this future is prohibiting commercials on television directed towards kids.
They can be so easily influenced, and in the time of fake news and alternative facts, it is important from a young age on to be able to think critically and develop one's own opinion.
Ever since the television first was invented, it has always enjoyed a huge number of viewers.
The new technologie is constantly developping and becoming of great importance to the society we live in today.
One could claim it is supportive and gives us the oppertunity to establish things we couldn't before.
And it is a way to entertain us in a world where nothing else seems to be satisfying enough.
And let's not forget about all the money companys make over a year.
Our children grow up in this technological world, learning to use all these computers and spending most of their time in front of the television.
Is it therefore really okay to advirtise directly toward these young users?
In their first years children learn a lot about themselves and about others.
They see how this world works and adapt to the casualities in it.
It can be good to show them the reality, so they can start to get used to this world.
One way of doing so is to advertise directly to young children as they watch television.
They develop their own opinion about what they like and what they don't like.
Later it will be usefull to have its own opinion so they can stick up to it and get what they want.
And this way they learn fast to seperate important information from less important information.Information that interests them from information that is uninteressting to them.
The children learn how to cope with the pressure of wanting something while not always getting it.
On the other side this advertising could lead to more spoiled kids pressuring their parents to always get what they see in the advertisement on the television.
And if they don't get what they want their unpleased with their parents, while their parents are unhappy about the behaviour of there ungrateful children.
In the length this sort of stressful conversations can affect the familysituation, because it puts the parents under extrem pressure and teaches the children to go on about things they wish to have instead of waiting for their birthdays after a declination.
Not only the parents suffer from the constant wishes they can't always allow, also the children grow more unhappy when they realise that not everthing is just like in the advertisement: perfect and always available.
Another bad sideeffect is that children are too young to seperate reallity versus virtuallity.
They don't recongnize when they are being fooled by one of this promising pictures.
This could lead to false interpretation and naivity for promising offers in the television.
Finally one must say that we should let children be children.
Let them play without being confrontet with our adult world to early.
And this adult world also includes advertisements from the television.
Today advertising is part of our everyday life.
We can`t watch television without being distracted and interrupted by adverts.
For adults these are simply annoying, but when it comes to children it gets problematic.
Children spend much of their time watching television, so it is inevitable that they come across advertising.
They are easier manipulated and believe everything they see or hear.
The parents want to make their children happy and are often forced to buy the advertised products.
For the companies this is a huge advantage, because this means they can sell more products and make more profit.
So it could effect the economy negatively, if these adverts weren't allowed.
But children shouldn't be manipulated at such a young age.
What they see on television isn't how the real world works and it might give them wrong ideas.
They aren't able to differentiate between reality and advertising.
One problem that might occur is how to control the regulation.
It is very difficult to legally fix what belongs to advertising directed toward young children and companies may find a way to outgo this law.
I believe that children shouldn't be exposed to advertising, mainly because it effects their view on reality.
In my opinion the companies should find a way to make their profit without manipulating children.
It would be a relief for the parents and the children.
You could say that in today's society it is important to go with the trend, even with children's toys.
It is early developed wether your child is liked by other or not, which often is connected on what toys they play with.
If a freind of your child has the cooler toy your child wants it too and if you do not buy it, the friend maby does not want to play with your son or daughter anymore, because his toys are boring.
So not buying advertised toys could cause bullying in early age.
But I disagree with this statement, beacuse advertisments directed to children do not have a serious effect on the amount of sold products advertised.
The children aged two to five are not old enough to understand whats going on.
They do not understand that this is an advertisement.
In the end they like the product, but it is their parents who get to decide wether they buy the product or not.
Also children aged two to fie should not watch TV so often, especially not children younger than four.
They hardly learned speaking and understanding what the people say, for example swiss children, who grow up speaking swissgerman until thei go to school.
Mostley the children aged two to four do not even understand the language used in TV as it is in german, not swissgerman.
And if they do not understand it, why let them watch it?
So the advertisments are uneffectful, unless the parents decide to buy the product which isadvertised.
This essay is about television advertising directed toward young children.
It will be talked about if it should be allowed or not.
Television advertising is a common topic nowadays.
There exists a lot of differences in opinion about what should be allowed and what not.
Advertising toward children is a good way to get their interest.
For parents it can be hard to get their childs attention to teach them useful learning games with letters and numbers, but when they see it on TV they often think it's super fun and they often ask their parents to get it for them.
As long as the commercial is appropriate for children it should be considered something positive.
Television advertising should be allowed as long as its content is appropriate for the age of the children and as long as it is advertising something useful.
As soon as it gets to toys or games that a parent doesn't want their 4 year old to have, it shouldn't be allowed to be advertised on TV.
It is important to consider what comercial is shown after or before a TV show.
There should simply not be any comercial about aggressive computer games after a show that is watched by little children.
At the same time I think it is each parents responsability to be aware first of what their child is watching and secondly that commercials aren't always made to be seen by everyone.
Children, especially the younger ones that are only about two or three years old, don't care what they watch.
Often you can turn on any TV program and they'll happily watch it.
Children that young don't get what part is the actual show and what part is commercial in a TV program.
It is almost impossible for a television advertisment to reach young children.
In the end my opinion is that television advertising should be allowed and it's each and every parents responsability to let their child watch shows that were made for that age and to be aware that there can always be advertising that is not appropriate for the age of their child.
There are so many different advertisement airing on television every day.
Every ad is aimed to attrac a specific group of people.
Especially in the afternoon there are various ads that are directed only toward young children aged two to five.
These advertisements are very controversial because it promotes materialism and kids learn the wrong ethics.
That's why those tv advertisements designed to attrac kids only should not be allowed.
Advertisements that are directed toward kids teach wrong ethics to a child.
Every ad promotes a product and makes you want to posess it immediately.
Kids learn through advertisements that material things can make you happy and are the most important things to have in life.
But this kind of thinking is wrong since we should be happy in life without money and our possessions and appreciate our family and friends and other things that can't be bought with money.
Advertisement teaches kids materialism and a wrong definition of happiness.
In controst one could argue that advertisement help the economy.
Without advertisements nobody knew about products on the market and nobody would buy them because through advertisment you get an insight on what is offered on the market.
The companies wellbeing and wealth depend on their sales of the product.
If a company couldn't advertise their products anymore the sales would drop and the company could run it's business anymore.
But a good economy is dependant on companies and competition.
Children at a young age are very easily influenced and fooled.
If they see an ad about a teddy bear the instantly want it.
Adults can be influenced by ads as well of course but the difference is that children cannot understand at this age that you get everything you want in life.
The consequence is that they will cry for the teddy bear as long as the parents give up and finally buy it.
Parenting is very though in those situations because in one way the parents can't stand seeing their kids cry and being unhappy but they also don't want to spoil their kids by buying them everything they want.The companies that are advertising the teddy basically exploit families.
I personally think that advertisement designed to attrac only kids shouldn't be allowed anymore because our children shouldn't live in a materialistic world where everybody needs to possess the better car, bigger house or
There are many advertising in the television which are only directed to children.
Often they want to achieve children which are two to five years old because they are easy to influence.
These advertisings often show many kinds of toys and cool stuff for children.In this essey I am going to discuss if advertising directed toward children should be allowed or not 

I really agree this statement.
Television advertising shound't be allowed directed toward children in the age of two to five years.
I think that children don't need any advertising only to see how many toys there are in this world.
Of cours this is a good way to achieve more buyers for all the stuff that is produced in factories but in fact children don't need this.
In my opinion it is only important that the parents know what there is on the market or not.
Because they know the best what is good for their children and what is not.
In addintion, there are also many people which are poor and can't buy any cheap toys for their children.
In this case advertising directed toward this children won't be a good thing.
Children will be unhappy if they don't get these cools toys from the television because their parents don't earn enough money to buy it.
In conclusion I just can say that is isn't a good idea to bring advertising directed toward children in the age of two to five on television because they don't need it!
Their parents know the best what their children need and what is the best for them.
There are many Television advertisment today, which can be used for making people do something.
They are mostly used to make people buy something.
But there are also advertising whitch aren't as usefull as u think.
Young children are growing up with these advertising and not often are these advertising made for them.
There are different kinds of advertisng.
Advertisment which includes brutallity and sexuallity influent the childs growth.
In many cases, the child will memorise these pictures and perhaps will do something bad with these imaginations.
But there are also good advertisments whitch can help too make young child more smarter.
They are often related to sports ore toys.
Young childrens love to play with toys that are made for their age.
Not to mention the avdertisment for schools.
For me its a good thing to show young children Advertisment.
If I was a father i would have no problems showing these kind of images to my childrens.
As long as they behave and won't do something bad i'll stay loyal.
But when these advertisments will cross the line i'll do something about it.
The problem of television advertising directed toward young children is that in the age of 2 to 5 years the children are often overwhelmed by the television.
It is often too much for the children to take up and even can frighten them because they are easily scared.
Another point is that sitting in front of the TV for more than 1 hour can cause a headache and is not really healthy.
Children in this age should go outside and play in the garden and the woods.
They should play things on their own to learn how to do something without being dependant on this screen.
Furthermore is creativity being lost if they only have to sit and get information without really doing something.
If a child for example plays a role game there are a lot of ideas created and the child has really to think about what it does next.
But if it is watching TV it only has to switch the channel and not really has to think about anything.
If children at this age get used to watch TV there will also be a lack of communication skills.
Because if the children are sitting in front of this screen, even together, they won't have to comunicate or interact with each other, only to decide which channel they are going to watch.
But you can also see a possibility in the early contact to TV: The chilren can learn how to go along with the electronic devices in an intelligent way.
In conclusion I would say that the television advertising for young children shouldn't be forbidden but we should be aware of the problems it can cause and at least limit the hours of watching.
Should television advertising for children be allowed?
Nowadays there are many children who already have access to smartphones or tablets, eventhough they are very young.
Television consume has got advantages and of course also disadvantages.
In the following explanation I try to show you them.
First of all, television advertising can be a good thing, if they show you for example how to behave in society.
When they explain why you should always sneeze into your elbow or why you should always be friendly to people even if you do not like them, they can give the children tips how to survive in their further life.
they would learn those behaviours from young age on, and would possibly behave like that without asking themselves why they have to do that.
It would also be a good thing for the parents, because they do not have to tell them the whole time, how they have to behave, because the aready got drilled like that.
But on the other hand, television consume should not be allowed for that young aged children.
Instead they should be playing somwhere outside in the garden with their friends or exploring the nature.
The children should learn to beschäftigen themself.
Advertsising can be really bad, when they show the children a wrong picture of a average lifestyle, then the children get a wrong impression.
For example they could think that it is totally normal to move into their own house with eightteen and already own a expensive car.
Those habits can influence the children really badly and make their lives more complicated than it has to be.
I think it should be forbidden, because children are too young to handle all those impression.
And the parents should teach their children on their own, how to possibly best manage their future life.
In the society of today, children are getting confronted with new technology without much choice of there parents or even themselves.
Technology is all around us, it helps us in our everyday life, it entertains us after a hard day of work and as such it is no wonder that most households are in possesion of a TV nowadays.
This contributes to the media consumption of young children as they will be watching TV when their parents are doing so.
Many companies have realised this fact and because of that, they saw television as a possible means of advertising.
Most television channels are getting financed by advertising, so they are grateful to companies who will pay them to advertise their products.
Television advertising is based on the time of the day to appeal to the audience who is sitting infront of the TV and as such, advertising targeted at children will mostly be seen in the late afternoon and early evening.
Children look at the world in a different way than us adolecents and adults and that's why it's only natural that they have another understanding of advertisements than us.
For a kid, possesions are a very big deal, so they are an easier target.
If a kid sees a toy in a television ad, it won't think of the price or if there really is any use in buying it.
A kid will just be excited and start to ask his parents to buy it for them.
The parents, thinking a lot more rationally, will probably try to explain to their kid why they can't buy a new toy, they may not have enough money or they may not want to spoil the child.
For a kid, those reasons mean nothing to them and as such, it won't be able to understand it.
Instead, the kid will get angry at his parents and conflicts between them could come up.
That is why I think television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Young children do not yet know what it means to have concerns about money or being spoilt, they can't control their greed yet, which means they'll fall prey to the fun advertisements of companies, promising them joy in buying their product, and small children won't understand their parents and instead get angry at them all over an ad on TV.
Advertising in general is annoying to many people.
The television is fluded by advertisement and takes the whole joy of television.
So I think in general advertisement should be minimanized.
But specifically advertisement toward young children I don't see a difference to the advertisement which is directed toward other ages.
Because I think this is the responibility of the parents that they teach their kids how to handle or how to interpretate advertisemen, eventhough it might be tempting for the kids to react like they are "supposed" to.
It's like all the other advertisements they are designed to make the watcher want to have the things which appear in the advertisement.
They phsycologically stimulate the brain of the consumer to make them consume.
The same with the advertisement for kids the company shows them toys and present them even better than they are with effects which stimulate again the brain of the kid so that the kid wants the toy.
This is economy and like this the economy keeps going like it is now, everyone has what he wants.
But it just shouldn't get out of hand like it's happening today with the fluding amount of advertisement there is today.
Another problem I see besides the amount of advertisement is the kind of advertisement you find where and when.
So what I mean is the advertisement which contain sexual, brutal or violent content which are meant for adults and young adults.
So I think that these kinds of advertisement do not belong on everyday or comercial TV cahnnels at day time at least.
I even think there should be a seperate channel for just advertisements of different kinds or there should be at least a clear trigger warning to the consumer which warns or explains the following content.
I'd say that even for all advertismenet of a similar kind there should be a seperate channel or source where you can find them.
I know that then many channels and shows would't be able to afford their program anymore because the money source of advertisement is then missing.
So I thinkt then they should include their product in to the show the consumer actually wants to watch like they are already doing it in some TV shows or on the internet where many video creators are sponsored by companys which put their product in to the videos of the creators for example.
Beside of the adverdisements just being annoying there wouldn't be any problems, if the parents just teach their kids how to handle these things.
I don't even know myself what the best solution would be, at least for me but it should and will be in a way how I explained it now.
We live in a world full of electrical devices.
They can be very helpful in different situations in life.
In the other side there are the critics and they thhink that that all this electronical things, for example the television, is going to make the people dumb.
In this essay I'm going to write about the statement if young children should not be allowed to watch TV.
At the end of the essay I will write my opinion about this statement.
First of all, I think that a young child has to see with his own eyes the world.
I mean that a child has to see the nature and he has to learn many things about the pupils life.
In the TV we cant't see the world and we can't make our own opinions.
It's like we see something and we don't question about it.
An other argument is that in the television you can see so many things which are  not for a child.
I know that in the tv we can watch for example Nemo a fillm for a child but there are films which are not for a the cilds eyes.
In th eother side the Tv has alsohis good sides.
There are for example documentations about animals or other information sources where a child can learn much.
The child can see the world with all his beauty but the Tv tells also stories about the negative aspects of human being.
To summerize, the TV can help children to protect the world and not to destroy it.
In addition I think it is nice to see a movie with the child, for example Nemo.
I think children love this story and they are amazed.
When they are a bit tired of playing the whole afternoon the whole family can watch a film to relax a bit.
To summarize my arguments I want to give my opinion.
I think that watching TV has negative and positive sides.
In one hand it's going to make the children a bit stupid, because they don't question about anything in the TV.
In the other hand the TV can give us helpful information tounderstand the life.
now i'm going to write my opinion.
I think that it's not necessairy to allowed  young children watching TV.
The young children can watch TV but they also have to go outside to make their own experiences and his own opinion about the world.
In the 21th century, many children are growing up with technology.
They use different devices even they are very young.
The television belongs to the favourite used divice of children.
They are able to watch funny stories about animals which can talk or other fairytales.
But in between the TV programme there is a lot of advertising too.
Huge companies know exactly that children will see their advert for toys or other things like circuses.
Children which see the advertisment are putting pressure on their parents, because they mean that in this world today we have to buy many things or undertake something every weekend.
Unconcioulsy little kids compare each others belongings and are wanting even more and more.
They wouldn't be so in love with material things, when they wouldn't see them all the time.
Advertising on children is a mistake, because it's the first step into Capitalism.
They want more toys and more adventures.
Children will automatically think that they need all these things which are shown to them, but that's not reality.
Things aren't happiness and that is proved.
For example when children get what they want then they will at first be playing with thst toy all the time.
But after a while it gets boring and they are searching for somethimg new.
So children won't be impressed by little things and are expecting way too much.
To say it a nutshell, for sure companies want to sell their products, but the price they pay for losing humanity is even worse and not worth it.
Modern family households have changed very much in the last few years.
It's usual that every family has a television, an Ipad or mobile phones at home.
So there's no way, a toddler doesn't come in contact with the new medias.
The big advertisment companies have discovered this fact.
In order to sell things, they advertise for small children, because the're still in their learning phase.
A childs mind works like a vaccum cleaner as soon they can learn something new.
A product shown in TV will be recognised in store by the young toddler.
It wants to have it because it's related with good memories from the TV.
The parents are then nearly forced to buy the product.
In the end, that's exactly what the companies wanted them to do.
I think that's one of the main reasons why TV advertising on young children should be banned.
Back in my days, we didn't have a TV, so I think I got less influenced then todays kids.
It's a shame, that this is allowed, because small children can't protect themselves from the big influence of a TV commercial.
Furthermore, I think children between this age schouldn't even be allowed to watch TV, because it doesn't improve creativity.
Instead they should play with Lego or with other leisure things that aren't electronical.
In today's world, a world where we are surrounded by technology and media, seeing a piece of advertising at some point during the day is inevitable.
No matter your age, location or language, advertisments are everywhere.
From advertisements on television to advertisements on billboards to advertisements online, it is impossible to go a day without seeing at least a few.
However, it is important to note that since people of all ages are subject to seeing advertisements, whether passively or actively, young children also take in what they see around them.
Problem is, no one ever seems to notice, and if they do, they do not seem to care.
Most children watch at least an hour of television every day, which means that they are subjected to seeing multiple advertisements, some which may negatively affect their mindsets and thoughts.
In my opinion, children should not be targeted by advertisers, and the reasons behind this opinion will be outlined in the following short essay.
Children see enough advertisments.
As aforementioned, it is hard to leave your house without being bombarded by a series of billboards, posters and videos.
You could argue that when children are at home, they are not affected by advertisments whatsoever.
However, this is not the case, for as soon as their parents turn on the television, the advertisements come straight back.
We must consider what influence this has on little childern.
It may make them become extremely materialistic and greedy, meaning they might value the products they see on television and want nothing but to own them instead of valuing what they already have.
Take, for example, an advertisment for a new toy, which a child sees multiple times during its television session.
Most children, having liked what they saw and having seen it multiple times, would most likely start to beg their parents to buy it for them and would become infuriated were their parents to refuse.
Alternatively, if their parents were to succumb to their children's wishes, the children could get the impression that what they say goes and could become used to being spoiled, which would  later in life.
Another reason against targeting advertising towards young children is that is simply does not make much sense.
A child between two and five years old would have to convince their parents to buy it for them since they cannot buy anything themselves.
Furthermore, children are influenced very easily and are very gullible, meaning they will buy into anyhing they see or hear, leading to easy deception.
Who would want to decieve a child?
In conclusion, I believe that targeting very young children when it comes to television advertising should not be allowed, or limited at the least.
Children are already subjected to advertising everywhere else, so why at home?
Advertising has no benefits for small children, so why not just leave it out entirely?
If you would have argued that it would be more financially beneficial for children's television channels, then you should ask yourself what kind of society we live in if we put the finacial wellbeing of a company over the mental wellbeing of thousands of innocent children across the globe.
In this essay I'm going to write about the controversial question if television advertising which is directed to young children should be allowed or not.
First I'm going to say about a pro aspect and later I'm goint to list the negative aspects.
A first point why it should be allowed is because of the economy.
If you show beautiful dolls or trucks kids want them and they beg their parents till they get their toys.
Those Shops can sell their products and the competition between different toy stores can be increased.
On the otherside the environment would get worse because the normal wealthy countries live in overproduction instead of helping other countries with their essential needs.
In addition the plastic toys can't be recycled and especially in Asia they have a big sea pollution problem.
Another  point is that the branding of products costs a lot and you pay more for the branding as for the product itself an example is a perfume of Versace or any other famous brand.
The price of the production of a perfume is one thing but the branding includes foto shootings with celebrities at a nice place, so you have to pay the photographer with his staff the celebrities and the transport to the setting and at least the transport to the stores.
According to the longer list of contras I am against the television advertising for young children.
Anyway I think mothers buy a lot of toys for their children because they want the best for them.
And I wouldn't let my child watch television, because I think that publicities not directed toward young children could pop up.
And a child needs to learn how to spend it's time with that what it has got.
Is it okay to let young children watching televsion?
This is a question on which many of the young mothers and fathers want to receive an answer.
The television is a new invention and the children nowadays are the first generation who grows up with this invention.
But it is very undangerous for young children?
Naturally is easier for the parents if there children are quite and glad if they are watching TV.
But there are other meanings.
Watching too much TV can be dangerous because the children don't have enough mouvement and they learn so much if they are playing with other children in the house or in the garden.
They have to have own ideas and have to respect other people.
If the children are watching TV the whole day, they don't have these abilities because they can determine themselves which programme they want to watch.
But there are also a lot of other abilities like motorical abilities or working with the hands, which children learn if they are playing.
But there are also people who say that it is more secure to watch TV than to play in the garden.
I think, yes, sure it is more secure it is more healthy to play in the garden.
Probably you hit your knee, but you are better protected against infections.
And if I watch the aspect about learning vital abilities it is much more helpful to play with other children than to watch TV.
But in the end it should not be forbidden to watch TV but it should be very rare like once a week or something like that.
I think this is the best method to educate children.
Instead of giving them a TV parents should play with the children, for example a memory or read a book or paint something.
When I siz in a restaurant I often see little kids with an iPad or iPhone, playing a game or looking a film.
The parents sit beside them chatting with friends.
I do understand, that it is exhausting to entertain kids the hole time and the parents need a break.
But is the iPad or iPhone the best way?
I'm just 18, but I think the parents could do it better.
Because there are other possibilities to entertain kids.
An easy way to give them something to do is to let them draw.
Almost every restaurant has paper and pens.
An other possibilities is to bring some books with you to the restaurant.
In this ways the kids can entertain themselves.
As many sientists say elektronic object can have bad consequences like cancer.
So why should we let our kids use these elektronic stuff.
I know kids really like elektronic stuff but parents should definitely avoid the contact between their kids and a television, iPad, iPhone, gameboy and other objects like these.
A two year old isn't interessted in a documentary about bears in Canada or something similar.
So they want look kids series like "Cars" or "Lego movies".
But with this series they don't get useful informations.
Most of these series are foulish.
Kids are so creativ and have a huge fantasy.
We should let them use these.
When they play gamse on the iPhone their creativity and fantasy get lost.
For me there is no argument to support the use of television or other electronic things for kids of that young age.
So I definitely think it should not be allowed to let kids use electronic stuff like television.
Most of the television advertising, which is made for children, has a funny story.
The producers want to make their product more interesting for children.
Most of this products are sweets and have a lot of sugar.
When the kids see this product in a store they really want it, because in television it seems very tasty.
Furthermore parents have problems to tell their kids that they cannot have every funny thing in the store.
In television advertising is also a lot of junk.
In addiction the children can see the same advertising hundred times a day, when they watch television for a long time.
So the advertising can get boring.
On  the other hand kids can see different products.
They can think about the different toys and can decide which one they want.
So they can tell the parents what theywan for birthday and christmas.
Moreover they learn that they cannot have everything and that they have to chose one of the toys.
Obvisously it is difficult for kids ignoring every funny advertising and just choosing one thing.
According to me television advertising for children should be alowed.
Often it is very funny and the producers spend a lot of time and money for it.
The children can see new products.
There are also a lot of products that are used outside.
So children can see that playing outside in the nature could be nice.
Evidently, this is better than hardly watching television the whole day.
When parents do not want that the children want to have everything in the store because of the advertising, they do not let them watch television.
Young children don't really know what it means to buy something, they don't even know what money is.
When they see something in the televison, they want to have it, becaus the people who are using it are very happy.
Children can't think of the future as we can (e.g.
when the toy is broken or when they are too old for it).
Money isn't important to them and they can't imagine what a specific price conectet with a product means, wether it's a fair price or not.
They aren't able to connect all those things togheter.
Young children aren't allowed to buy things by themselves, so advertising directed towards them shouldn't be allowed.
The parents have to buy all the things for them and they have to decide what they want to buy, not their children.
Parents have to do a lot for their children.
The last thing they want is an annoying son or daughter who wants someting unnecessary and expensive.
A reason against this statement would be that the people who make those television advertising have to pay a lot of money for that and that they somehow have to earn money with their business.
It's a good strategy to advertise directly toward young children, because they are easy to convince and nobody can say "no" to such a cute little person.
As we can see are there more reasons to agree with this statement.
It's unfair to advertise towards somebody who can't buy it by themself and who doesn't know the consequences of the purchase.
I totally agree with this statement.
Advertising directed towards young children is like an unequal contract and should be forbidden.
Today many young children watch television one hour every day.
The companys make advertisments since the television came up to the marked to catch more people who buy this things.
The companies have seen that children have a big influence in their parents and if the child hava a desire the parents would maby give in.
So they began to advetise toward young children.
In the TV the children can see a toy that they want to have.
With some tricks, the producers of these advertisments can manipulate the clip on TV with some special effects.
The children can't make a difference between TV and reality.
If they had seen a firestation made with LEGO which looks like the reality, they want to play with this and the parents may give in.
In my opinion the children were manipulated only to make profits in the toy industrie.
So the advertising should not be allowed or shouldn't have some special effects in it.
But I think it's hard forbide the advertisment for children in the reality because there must be a voting about this subject and the companies would influence this votings.
They want to earn more money.
Maybe it would be better if the parents would talk to their children an show them the specialeffects.
So the children could understand how it works in reality.
And maybe the parents schouldn't give in so easily.
But i think that we have other more importaint problems in the world to diskuss and maybe to change than the advertising toward children.
Through the window I see that my neighbour child is a lot of the time in front of the televion.
I questioned myself is this good for this young child to watch so much televison.
This essay will show the pros and cons about letting young children watching television.
( I am sorry for not writing about the actuall theme)

Firstawfull a swiss study in Bern claimed that, in these days a lot of young children aged 5-8 are watching too much televison.
The light and the switching between one picture to another is bad for the evolving of the brain.
The brain has to work so much and process alll these things that after watching television, children feel more hyperaktiv and aggressive.
On the other hand there are people with the opinion that there are many films or documentary which can educated there children.
They claim that young children can learn better with pictures and videos for example about the unversium or about the nauter.
Pictures or videos stay better in mind then just a text.
And as well some of physical or economical or school stuff in a video can be explained much more better or made more interesting for young children.
The crician agree full with that but their opinion is that in the televion that there are so much soaps and other stuff which should be shown to 5 year old children.
Soaps where the world is made absolutely unrealistic and films with a lot of violent and also pornography.
They also require that a lot of partens actually do not know what the children are actually watching when they are coming home form school.
They do not supervise them.
Some people require that today it is importaned for young children that they watch telvesion that they discover as well medias and mabey relazie by themself what is actuall true or what is absolutely not realistic.
As well if parents do not allow the children to watch televison and all of the other school friends are allowed the children are excluded.
In my opinion in every stateman there is a little bit of truth in it.
I totally agree that letting watching young children so much televsion is not really healthy but I think it is aobut the quantity.
There is a lot of really good documentary for young children to learn things about the world but there has to be a supervision of the parents otherwise the youn children may accidentally watch something which is not aged for them.
As well I think it is important that young children discover diffent media to learn bythemself how to deal with them.
So in my view it is everything about the quantity
.
( I discovered I read the sentence wrong) -.- it is about advertising televsion ....
I just had 10 mins left so I just wrote my essay finish I am sorry I am really soory I did not have enough time to rewrite everything so I just left it.
There are a lot different positive and negative points about television watching children: 

In general I think that children in the age between two and five years shouldn't watch TV at this time because at this stage of live it is very important to play a lot outside, for example in the field or forest or to play games which you can touch with your hands.
A lot of studies have shown that kids who began watching TV so early weren't very clever in their future.
The reason for this is that you don't have to think a lot while you're watching a film or serie.
You just have to watch.
Another point against telewatching kids is that they should better read or look at books and pictures in it.
By doing this they have also the possibility to let their parents explain different objects which are still unknown for them.
A third and last argument against "TV-kids" is that if they start watching television so early, they often will have the need for this "activity" in their future.
But there are also some very positive arguments for TV-kids: For parents it is very easy to let their kids do something while they can do their own job.
The two to five years old ones are mostly happy to be in kind of "dreaming world" for some hours.
Last but not least there exists also a lot of films and series where the children can lern something about themselves, their environement and the earth.
Well, at the end I'm still against TV-kids in this age and that's why I agree with the statement.
In the current world, the average persons spends about 2 hours a day infront of a television.
Every 20 to 30 minutes is a commercial break.
Some people use this break to eat something or get a beer befor the actual programm continus, while others wait in their chair or couch until the show or game goes on.
Television advertising is used to influence peoples interests.
In my opinion commercials targeting direct towards young children shouldn't be allowed.
First of all, children are unlike mature people very easy to influce or manipulate.
Using commercials to attract the demand of a certain product could lead to a obsession for a kid, since they aren't able to think critical like adults.
In conclusion it wouldn't be ethically incorrect to advertise direcly towards children aged two to five.
Furthernore, commercials don't give a critical analysis of the pros and cons and aren't reliable at all to product itself.
This can be often seen in car commercials, where it has nothing to do with the car, but the atmosphere you get with it.
Kids can't jugde correctly so it would be missleading for them.
Their expectations are emotions that the product should give.
For example the "Nerf Gun"videos.
The commercial shows an epic fight between to armed groups in a warzone but with "Nerf-Guns"
The reasons a kid buys the product, since it's an atmospere.
In my opinion the children would be disappointed, because they thought that the product can do, what they saw in the commercial.
To summarise, children can be extremly influenced by television advertising.
This leads to a big need to have this kind of product for the kid.
And when they have it, it won't be good enough for the high expectations, which were created by showing only the good side of the product.
Bes
Advertising is all around us.
It`s an important part of economy.
Companies need it to get people to buy their products.
They often advertise on the internet or what`s even more effective: on television.
What if there`s a company that is obligated to get children to buy/want their products, for example a toy?
Should companies be allowed to show their advertises, which are directed toward young children on television?
Everyone is free to do whatever he or she wants as long as its not harming anybody.
Are those advertises harmful for young children?
Companies have specalists, which know exactly how to manipulate a kid, so that the kid absolutely wants to have the advertised product.
They may want for example the toy after they`ve seen it on television, but the parents have the money and can still decide if they want to buy their kid that toy or not.
Televison finances through money they get from adversiting.
Children tv channels depend on that money.
If adverting toward young children was banned, some tv channels wouldn^t be able to exists any longer.
Another question is, if that`s acutally something bad.
Two to five year old children shouldn`t watch tv anyway, it very much influences their intelligence and their ability to learn.
So if maybe there weren`t as much kids tv-channels any more, kids would be more successful later in life.
But we absolutly have to acknowledge that there is the internet, where the kids can have their harming screen-time.
Or also even get to watch adversiting.
So maybe the companies would just switch from television to the internet to make their adverises.
My personal opinion is, that we already have way too many laws and that`s it makes no sense to ban television advertising directed toward young kids.
Everyone should be deciding for their own kid.
If one really doesn`t want their kid so see such advertising, he or she should ban all electronic devices from the ho
Television advertising is a topic which has been well discussed throughout all ages of the society.
Many people are under the influence of ads and many dislike television advertising- If television adverstising is a good or a bad thing is debatable, but there is no such thing as a perfect answer.
Television advertising is key to a well functioning economy of a country.
Billboards and newspapers are also an opportunity for  informing the population of one's country about upcoming and outstanding products.
But it is the television which hasturned out to be most effective.
In a by technology dominated society of 2017, people, even families spend a large amount of their day-time infront of a televsision.
Watching TV whilst eating has become more than just normal, many families don't eat together so each of them can watch their TV-show.
A company is eager to sell their products to as many people as possible.
Therefore classic 'propaganda' and mouth to mouth propaganda are essential for an industry-branch to survive within the growing markets.
By showing ads, people are confronted with the new or old products.
Many may think about the products later on or think of them unconciously, without them noticing.
The best ads are the most annoying ones.
You for exp hear a song or see the beginning of the ad and already know which one it is.
You think ugh not this one again, but that's the best reaction a person can have.
Now the company knows that the ad is like 'branded' into one's brain.
Ads are expensive, but bring in more money than they costed.
A world without adverstising wouldn't work.
And a TV-station simply cannot control how's watching TV.
so ads for kids can't be removed easily just like that.
Ads, the word already reminds one and all of annoying theme songs and too much information in a too short amount of time.
So the question is, are ads necessary?
For older people yes, but for younger people, especially kids, no!
Kids often watch TV as a treat rather than to waste time.
They get promised that they are allowed to watch TV after homework or playing outside.
Children, especially young ones, watch kid shows as cartoons or animated movies.
These channels are not the place for ads.
Why would one even think about placing ads on a kids-channel as Cartoon Network or Nikelodeon?
No adults watch these channels, so it's even a waste of money placing ads there.
Kids at an age of 2-5 years old shouldn't be manipulated at such an early stage.
That ads need to be placed for adults is self-explaining, but channels which are only there for entertainment should be totally ad-free!
My personal opinion is that channels ,where the producers know that it is directed towards children only, should be aware that ads aren't very effective and that they should be banned.
In a general statement, ads are essential for the survival of an economy because withoit ads the cycle would not work the way it does and needs to!
And I recon that companies are really wasting their money because how many 2-5 year olds can actually memorize the things they see and recall them at an age of 9 or 10, when they are then able to buy things?
Television advertising directed toward young children - should it be allowed or not?
First of all it is important to seperate the differnt kind of television advertising.
Different channels show different types of advertising.
Therefore it's in the responsibility of the parents wich channel they let watch theire children.
During the day there is less danger for bad or scary television advertising.
But in the evening the advertising often change.
For example a channel shows a trailer of a scary movie.
Advertising like that makes young children full of frigt and fear.
And they often get nightmares.
So like I sad before, the most important point is the kind of channel young children watch.
Channels made for yong people, like Disney-Channel, show advertising made for young people!
In this case theire is no danger to let young children watch these kind of advertising.
Because of this my opinion is that television advertising directed toward young people should be allowed if the parents controle the situation.
If they don't watch theire children and let them alone with the televisioncontroler it should not be allowed.
In real life we can't controle the responsibility of the parents therefore I can only hope that the parents always have an eye on theire kids.
First we should have a look at the word "advertising".
I think there are differente types of advertisements.
For example advertising for violence films and games who should not be watched under 16, should not be directed to young children.
They may get impressd of shooting and then in kindergarten they forme weapons with their fingers or take a brick and gunpoint at other children.
I think the chance that they get aggressive later on in their life will be bigger than children who havent watched that type of these  advertises.
My oppinion is that if you let your child watching tv where the chance is huge that they see something for what their too young, you should sit next to them and give them the feeling that their not alone and that theres someone carring about them and their reaction about the advertising.
On tv there are channels especially made for children.
It has some stuff that is addapted to their age.
I think that they should only watch these things, so they wont get confronted with things not made for their eyes.
If we talk about the sesonal advertising, I cant see any problems.
For example before christmas there is shown a lot of advertising for kids.
These advertisings are especially made for kids to make them desire the toy shown in the advertisement.
Of course after seeing the advertisement the children want it really badly.
But then its your job as a parent to say no to them.
Eaven if its hard sometimes.
But with saying no they learn that in life you cant get all your wishes.
At the end of it, I would say that as a parent you should really think about what kinde of advertisement you want your child to see.
And if you let it watch a non especially childrenfriendly channel, you should really sit next to them.
I wouldn't say, that television is just bad for children, it really can be helpful sometimes.
I think you can learn a lot about some documentaries about a specific topic.
But the problem is the age.
With an age of two to five you're not able to understand these documentaries, so it has some TV programs for young children.
But they're so stupid sometimes and I think in this age you shouldn't watch TV already.
It has many things a child could do, like playing outside with their friends, reading a book, playing with their toys or doing something with their parents.
With an age of five I would allow my child to watch TV at the weekend if he wants to.
But not everyday and just with a time limit.
Maybe thirty minutes on a rainy sunday.
I can't understand how so many parents let their children watch TV during the whole day instead of doing some acitivities with them.
I think the parents are sometimes so tired from the whole week, when they worked everyday from nine to five and they just want to relax a few hours, so the best way to keep your child calm, is putting them in front of the TV.
When it happens not that often and not that long, I think it's ok but only at an age of five, I think two or three is really too young to watch TV.
They can barely talk, so i'm not sure if they really understand something.
As a parent I also would look what kind of things my child watch on TV, not everything is that clever for a child at an age of two to five.
So my last words I want to say, is that i'm not really into letting young children watching TV, but I think the time makes the big difference between the good or the bad.
At first, young children, especially in the age of two to five, shouldn't watch television, because that's not so good for their health.
They will grow up and it's not good for their eyes.
It's also not good, because if they always watch TV, they won't go outside playing with other children from the neighbourhood.
So why should television advertising should be good?
Young little children shouldn't be there to watch it.
They could also get influenced by the television and they admire the person in the TV or they want to be like them.
They also could get the wrong idea of things in the world, which isn't good.
They should learn knowing the world by their own experiences and not from the TV.
It isn't the TV, which is always right.
The good thing is, that they can learn something from watching television.
They can learn knowing what they want and persuading their parents to buy the things from the TV.
If the parents do, what you want, you hae them under control and that's difficult to manage.
You can learn it in the young age, when you're still little and sweet and nobody can say no to you.
If the parents let them watching television because they are annoying, they will see the television advertising and it's good for the market.
Many parents let their children watch some things in the television to be quiet.
It's also good for the parents.
The parents know, what they want and they don't have to ask them all the time or find out on their own.
It's easier for them.
In my opinion I agree with the statement above.
Television advertising shouldn't be allowed towards young children.
It's just not good to influence such little things, nearly babies.
They should go outside to let them play in the garden or on the playing field.
They can do television advertising if they want, but I hope nobody sees it, because they are outdoors to do better things than watching TV to see it.
Todays generation already grows up with electronical dewices.
Young children watching TV gets more and more normal and if you haven't seen a TV show with the age of four you're not "normal."
But should those TV shows especially made for children (aged two to five) really be such a big part of those young people?
Thodays television program does not just adress older generations.
With it's TV shows direct advertised toward children such as "Dory the explorer" children are thorn towards the television and want to watch like adult do their own TV show.
Isn't it wrong to make young children watch TV?
On the other side especially Dory the explorer is a program in which the yung children learn something and actually have a role in the TV show.
They are asked to "explore" the world with Dory which wants them to say things out loud and gives them exercises to do.
So you could argument that it is not just bad for children to watch TV.
Also children in their young years have a lot to learn and the Dory the explorer teaches them.
They often tend to just beliefe what people teach them as the adults or in this example the Dory tell them.
But can they really just beliefe what Dory teaches?
Shouldn't the parents, teacher and other people of an older generation be teaching them how to live and not a TV program?
Also parents often place teir children in front of the TV so they have got more time for themself.
The television calms teir children and the adults don't have to take time to go to a park or do other activities with them.
It could be sid that today children do not learn about importen aspects of life because they just sit in front of the TV but instead my little sister (4 years old) knows a lot more about how for ecample a tree grows.
When i was 4 years old i did not know things like that but i used to play on those trees.
IN my opinion young children got enough time to learn when they go to school and should not be forced to approve such knowledge at such a yung age.
Also they got enough time to watch TV later on in life and should enjoy their yung years in nature instead of infront of the TV.
They should actually explore the world and not just watch Dory the explorer exploring the wordl.
Television advertising wants to influence people and show them things that doesn't have to be reality.
Adults and teenagers have learned enough in life to know the difference between reality and fiction.
Young children have got the problem that they aren't able to difference these two things because they are still learning about what reality is.
If young children watch television advertising, they get influenced by things that are even able to influence adults.
The children believe what adults or children on TV are telling them.
So if the men or child on TV tells them they need something (that's what television advertising is all about), they believe him and think this thing is importent to live.
On the other hand television advertising directed toward young children is important for the marketing of these things.
If parents doesn't want there child to get influenced by television advertising, they shouldn't let them watch tv.
Children aged two to five shouldn't watch television not only because of the advertising.
Televsion becomes something like virtual reality for them.
It's like an other world.
But the problem is that young children can't difference the real world from the world they see on TV.
So in my opinion you can't disallow advertising television directed toward young children.
If there parents don't want there child to get influenced by things the child can't difference from reality, it's their own decision.
It's not prooved that television advertising deal damage to childrens knowledge about reality, but it could have an influence.
"Television is not good for young children."
That common saying may contain some truth, however there can be programms with learning effect.
Firstly, the television can look after the children.
More and more, both parents are working, as a consequence they can not look after their kids.
Often the parents bring their children to an organisation where builded people looks after their kids and they can play with other children.
However, some parents work at home and they have not to pay the organisation if they set their child in front of the television.
As a result, they can do their work calmly.
Secondly, special programms can contain learning effects.
For instance, the children learn to count or to memorize, or how to treat your friends.
So there can be moral learning effects, too.
Nevertheless, too much televison is not good for children.
Moreover, children should not watch dangerous series as a consequence they could not sleep well.
In conclusion, Television advertising should be allowed to children, however the question is what they are looking and how long.
It should not be an every day activity and they should
Nowadays almost every household has a television and other electronical devices that provide us with entertainment 24/7.
The constant accessability of those devices make us rather lazy and dependent.
We forget to be creative ourselves.
A big part of watching television are the commericals that disrupt the viewers TV shows.
While most adults can differentiate between what they need and want, children struggle to do so.
Therefore the question arises if advertising should be allowed to directly target young children.
If young children learn that they can't have all the stuff on TV and learn that it is only tactics from big corporate firms it shouldn't pose a lot of problems.
Children should learn how to deal with all this media from a young age on so they can handle it when they're older.
Parents should make them understand that the hard earned money is better spend on things they really need.
The problem I see here is that not every 5-year old will get this kind of message since they don't have the ability to critically question the message of the advertisement.
They probably see something they want and feel the urge to satisfy their needs.This scenario can be well observed in supermarkets when little kids throw a fit because they won't get what they want.
Another reason that speaks against commericals targeting such a young audience is that puts a lot of pressure on the parents.
The kid , being angry about not getting those toys on TV, direct their anger at the parents.
In general I think it is not very wise to let the kids watch TV on a regular basis.
It rather should embrace the free time for being creative and productive itself.
Being creative also satisfys them in a even more rewarding way.
In conclusion I must say that Im against advertisment for childeren especially because they can't handle the situation apropriately.
On the other hand I support that they learn how to deal with media since it follows us everywhere.
On the one hand it surely isn't a good idea to  use television advertising toward such young children, because at that age you aren't able to judge the situation properly.
Children often don't have a proper opinion yet, because they leak of experience.
That's why they often take the statements as they hear them without questioning them critically and give them theire believes just because they don't know it better yet.
In consequences the children could get influenced in a bad way by advertisng they see in the television.
Secondly, it's essential to see that one's childhood plays an important role in the construction of a Life'a basis.
The way you grow up and the particular influences like for example family and friends have a strong impact on who you're going to be as an adult.
So if you get wrong ideas of the world or you learn to set your priorities in a bad way as a child it can hount you in the future.
Even if your environment is able to build a contrast to the capitalistic advertisning a child is confronted by the TV, it's better not to underestimate the power of it.
On the other hand it seems important to me that parents see theire duty of having children by protecting them from bad influences like that in a healthy way.
Even if the advertising clearly isn't a good thing but for economies, it really is part of a parents exercise to watch after theire little children.
On conclusion, I'm clearly opposided to advertisnig which are directed toward children.
It isn't human to use a childrens good belief to rise the capitalism just more.
It's essential to protect them from bad influences like that and I'm persuated that an enterprise with good intentions wouldn't even think about using advertising that way.
Telivision advertising confronts our whole society on a daily base.
Thereby the television advertising is directed toward nearly every group of age.
But I think there must be some kind of age limitation for the two to five aged children.
We should not let the advertising industry use the children as objects who generate money for them.
It is also not smart to let those industries have such a big impact on a child's way of thinking.
It is much more important that the parents themselves take care of how their children are going to think about certain topics.
To give an example: A television channel makes an advertisement for a new TV show that is directed toward young children.
Now the children watching this advertisement will be excited about this new show and eager to watch it.
The children will think the most entertaining way to spend time is watching television.
This is just a possible scenario of what the children will think but still it is important that we do not let the children think that television is the only thing that matters.
Because children should spend time outside
This statement depends a lot on what kind of advertisement ist ment.
In general i don't think that advertisement ist something bad, because without it we wouldn't explore new products, which could help us much in the everyday life.
Also children could see something they would love to play with.
For examle in
christmas time the TV is completely crowded with advertisement for things to play with.
A startup company, which has it's focus on toys for children, would have no chance without the advertisement on the TV.
The negative side of this theme ist thet the opinion uf a child is very easy to influent.
The consequence of this is that all the companys produce advertisement to make the children want this specific toy, which is the very best and is just a must have to be one of the cool one's in the class.
So these children all watch TV and see this advertisement.
After that they will ask their parents all day long, if they could have one of these.
The parents may resist at the beginning, but the longer it lasts they will buy their children this toy, even if its complete rubbish.
Another negative point is that on childrens'  programm there isn't just advertisement for children aged two to five, but also more violent advertisement for older children.
So these children get in touch with violence very early ( for example advertisement for a new airsoft gun).
At the end of this essay i think children aged two to five sholdn't watch TV at all.
But if they do, in my opinion if the advertisement  isn't violent or shocking it should be allowed, because also the adults get manipulated through advertisement without beeing aware of it.
Essay: Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Children love to watch their favourite tv-show on television but the advertising between the shows is in most cases unsuitble and just disturbing.
Firstly, many advertising spots are about pruducts which adults or teenager would buy and not toys or something children would like to see.
They have no idea for what are the producs for and so the advertising makes no sense.
Secondly, children often believe what an andult said without doubt.
So they also believe what the advertising says and that is often overacted and unrealistic.
On the other hand, young children will not know the topic of every single spot after they switch off the television.
Furthermore, advertising is made for manitpulate people that they buy a product.
Children are easier to influence and they believe every nonsens which the advertising says.
So it is dangerous to give the children wrong knowledge or destroy childrens imagination.
In conclusion, I have to agree with the statement.
But in my opinion such young children should not watch television at all.
It is just unhealthy and children tv-shows are mostly trash.
But at least it should e prohibited that there is advertising on children channels.
Should we ban ads for kids in TV?
We all would rather like to live in a world without advertising, but if that would be the case, we wouldn't have any money for the entertainement we crave for.
But with children, especially young ones, we have the problem, that they can be easily manipulated.
So the trivial answer would be to just ban ads directed towards kids, but is this better?
The entertainment branche would loose the money and therefore the interest to produce quality content for children.
The consequence would be, that there will be none or bad television for children and that's not the aim with this ban.
Also this ban would only affect the television, but what about other media like magazines or the internet, where there can still be advertised towards kids.
And since we live in a capitalist society the television would get less popular and the problem will just shift to other media.
We could argue, that it is better if the children don't watch any TV at all or that kids these days don't watch on the classical TV screen and rather are surfing the internet, but that's beside the point.
My opinion is, that we shouldn't ban all advertising directed to children, but regulate it stronger, to prevent from biasing the next generation.
Hello and welcome to my essay which is about whether advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not.
I think at the moment there is to much advertising in general.
Especially on television there is so much advertising that it is annoying.
ALso I dont understand why there is advertising anyway since almost nobody watches it.
When people see that on the television the programme stops and adverts start playing they mostly go away anyway for example to pee.
I think television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed, spare atleast the young kids from this.
It really worries me how much today's world is only about money where even ads for small children are produced.
Small children might see something that they like in the ads and force their parents to buy something totally unnecessary.
Also i don't even know if small children aged up to five watch so much television that it does make sence to make ads especially directed towards them.
So in conclusion I agree with the statement "Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed".
First of all advertising is something that people normally don't like.
Second, many people don't watch ads anyway since they just use the ad-time on television for a break.
And my last argument is that I don't think children aged up to five watch enough television that ads can actually make the children think about something.
I think that it should be allowed because it can't possibly have to many bad consequences.
Even if those children are allowed to watch television at that young age, it doesn't imply that they'll be able to buy those things themselves.
For me it's more a question of how educated the child is.
I personally think that children aged 2 to 5 should not be allowed to watch too much tv but only movies adapted to their age.
If they'd still have that healthy childhood that I had, they wouldn't be watching tv anyway so the advertising would have no effect on them.
But now supposed that times have changed and young children are watching tv and therefore are affected by those advertisements, what is the bad thing about it?
If they see a toy they like and the parents agree to buy it, everyone is happy.
Because given that the parents would buy toys for their children anyway, why not buy them something they actually want.
Also as a child I remember reading those magazines with all those toys inside them.
So even outside the tv children are already exposed to advertisement.
And I have to say that I actually enjoyed it when I was little.
Although I wanted almost everything that was inside that magazine, my parents obviously couldn't buy me everything so I had to decide on just a few.
Looking back I think that I learned two important lesson thanks to that experience: that I couldn't have everything and to enjoy the things that I had.
Because were is the fun in being able to buy everything and not even have to work for it?
To conclude I personally thing that being exposed to advertisement at a young age is not much different than when we are older, it only gives us suggestions what we could buy but in the end we can decide for ourselves.
In our days the products which are sold in the daily market are also seen in the television.Not only television publicity but also the daily mail or poster who are seen in the city are ways to support selling diffrent products.Television advertising  is in general the easiest way to sell a product.But it takes a lot to make the perfect publicity.You have to think about a slogan which is easy to remember so people have this slogan on their mind if they think of that specific produtc.So the positive sides of television adversiting ,no matter which age class, are that the procuts are seen more often and with a good slogan the prand and the name of the fabric get memorised faster and more easily.
On the other hand, why should a brand make television advertising for children who are not even ceapale to buy this product?
Their parents are the ones who buy the procut in the end.
Something that also needs to be said is that not everybody watches television.
So if the procuts for children are only seen in television advertising,not only some parent aren't going to buy these procuts but some others don't even know that these products exist!
So in conclosion I personally think that it doesn't matter for which age class a publicity in television is made, it is a strong way to sell a product.
In fact it is easier not only for parents but for everybody to watch television so you get a little bit an idea what is popular on themarket in the moment.The only thing you have to do is lay down and watch tv and if you find something intrestic you know exactely where to go and buy the product you want.It is an easy way to avoid the long shopping hours in the city.
Thank's to television advertising life get's a little more comfortable.
I disagree with this statement because it's impossible to forbit the television advertising for children aged two to five.
If the parents let the children watch television they can watch advertising.
So I do not understnd why I should write a essay about this topic.
Children can not learn very effectiv by watching televioson so this wont be a problem for them.
And if they are stupid in the futur and ruin theier life, this will be theier problem and not my problem, so I don't care.
It's impossible for the state to controle every single houshold if a children under the age 6 is watching a television advertising.
If they will forbit the television advertising they also should forbit the advertsising on the streets, radio, airplanes and others because if children were on the streets with theier family they see this avertising too and noone says something.
This would not make a lot of sense because if teleadvertising are not good for young children then the other advertising won't be good too for them.
So I do not understand why I have to write about this topic because there aren't good points for or against this topic.
My point of view is that there are no reasons against the television advertising for children under the age of six.
Also advertising can be good for young children because young people can learn better the older people.
So if they see advertiing in the television as an example about condoms they will know in the futur that they will need one to be save.
As an other example chewingum so they won't smell bad if they have a date or a conversation with someone else.
So there is a positiv aspect for television advertising.
For me there are no reasons against it.
I'm definitely against direct advertisement towards young children.
If little kids see advertisement for a toy, they think it's cool just because they saw it on TV.
Which leads to them wanting to buy it.
But if a toy is shown on TV, it doesn't automatically mean that it's "better" or that each and every child should own it.
It only means that the company, which produces the toy, spend a lot of money on the ad, but if that means that kids must own the toy is questionable.
This leads to the little kids becoming materialistic at such a young age.
Young children shouldn't have to worry about what they should buy to be "in", but instead  buy the toys whith which they'd like to play.
The kids begging their parents to buy them a certain toy can also lead to unnecessary feuds at home.
To conclude my point, I'm of the opinion that the governement should officially forbite advertisement towards young children, so that they don't grow up feeling the pressure to buy stuff, they wouldn't normally buy and that they don't already step into our materialistic society at such a young age.
television in general shouldn't be allowed for small children, since the content can be very manipulative especially advertisements and even more if the content is directed towards these small children on purpose.
If small children start watching television with a time regulation given by their parents the whole thing can be kept under control.
But if the children start watching TV  for consecutive hours,days or even weeks I think it's not good for them.
On the one side the children could lack in evolved social skills if they are at home all their spare time.
They should really be out in the nature and making friends, trying to work in groups and again learn how to socialize themselves.
On the other side they probably miss the life-lessons teached by being outside and exploring all the stuff around us.
It is lso proven that TV is highly addictive especially for young children therefore parents should give their kid a limit in watching TV in order to prevent an addiction from happening.
So in conclusion of the before mentioned points one could say that I clearly support a ban for television advertisement addressing small children.
But I don't think these advertisements have an tremendous impact on the life of the children since they are not able to buy the stuff showed in the TV but I think it could make TV more attractive if during the breaks of some series the advertisement is addressed to small children, what again leads to the points mentionend above.
this study is senseless in my opinion
Today many children want some things like toys because they saw it in an advertising between two series on the kids channel.
These toys aren't things they really wanted to have before and for sure don't need.
But because it was so well shown in the advertising, they think the toy is really cool.
Therefore it would make sense, if the advertising is forbitten on kids channels.
The first point is that they really don't need all the stuff from the advertisements.
If the kids see an advertising, they think that they couldn't live anymore without having this toy.
They imagine how cool it would be to use it.
But as often, the toy isn't that great in reality as it was in the advertisement when the child actually gets the toy.
It is a waste of money for the parents and the kids are sad because it isn't what they expected it to be.
Of course you can say that the advertising shouldn't catch the kids' atention.
In fact it should be a lecon for them that they can't get whatever they think would be cool.
It should be the parents' task to teach the children, it is important to learn to not get everything.
But they can learn this lecon of life in an other way.
For example seeing another kid's toys.
The kid really wants the toy too but the parents say no and learns how to deal with not getting everything they want.
As my conclusion I think it would be good if the advertising on television isn't allowed for young children.
It shouldn't beallowed to advertising directy to the you children.
Because the children in young age should not watch TV.
They are young and have to do other thing like to play outside with other children.
If in the TV would be more adtvertise which are directed toward to the young children, they would support that children watch TV.
In the aspect of the socialism and for developping of the child it would be unhealthy.
How it can be healthy to sit in the front of a TV and watch them all day long?
Neither for the children nor for the adults.
Otherwise it is the job of the parents that they look how many their children consume TV.
So if a child with 4 years watch to much TV so has their parents to stop him and not the marketing of something.
Even the marketing try to advertise directly the children, they can't influence it a lot because the children can just wish something and not walk in the next supermarket and buy himself somthing what he saw it before in the TV.
The parents have again to say if the play or what else is sensful or not and have to choose if they want to buy it them child or not.
So it would make more sense when they would adevertising directly the parents, they know it better and when they are parents for first time, the will try to make avertything perfect for their children and buy more thing as it needs.
In conlucsion it should not be allowed to advertise directly the children.
It is unhealty and does not make much sense, it would be better when they would advertise for the parents.
Advertising

Advertising is the driving force of economic growth.
Without advertisments our economic system would not work.
And television is one of the most important medias to find access to the majority of consumers.
That's why there should be no ban for television advertsing, even though children are the spectators.
Many people say that advertisement for children is manipulating the childhood.
Parents, who want to protect their children from this  manipulation should generally not allow them to watch tv.
But they have to keep in mind that television is not the only source of advertisement.
The whole enviroment is carriying advertising objects, such as brand signs or posters on streets.
Protecting children from all advertisements is just not possible in the 21st century.
The new-age capitalistic system has brought wealth and power to many countries.
One key to this success was undoubtably television advertisment.
It was and it will remain one of the most popular and most direct media of communication from seller to consumer.
And without this kind of communication there will be no economic growth.
Ptotcting children from all advertisements is not possible in such a globalised and media- dependant world as ours.
If parents don't want their children in the age from two to five to be exposed to telecasted advertisment, a ban is not the solution.
In my oinion, they should not allow them to watch tv.
This does not mean that their children would not have any contact to any advertisement, but they would be protected from the most popular and therefore most influencial type of advertisement.
We are living in the era of technology and media.
The internet has grown huge and we depend on technology no matter if we want to research, need to find a place we do not know, or just want to watch some movies or series.
The children growing up in this era are as depended on the media as everyone else.
You can see many children with an iPod or an iPhone and they even posess an own laptop.
No wonder they spend so much time on television.
There are series made for children, to make them learn things.
With that comes the advertising of toys to make children buy it.
Adults might think that you can not use advertising on children, because that is pure manipulation.
Advertisers know how to make people want to buy their products, simply by using AIDA.
They might want wo protect children of this kind of manipulation.
However, even though they manage to protect them now, as soon as they get older they are going to watch advertisement and are going to get manipulated nonetheless.
On the other hand: how are you going to sell products for children without any advertising?
There is going to be a decrease of profit if the refineries lack advertisings.
They earn less money and they might need to close because they can not afford the producement.
The more refineries need to close, the less toys are going to be there for children.
What are they supposed to play with?
My opinion is that there should be advertising directed toward young children.
I do not think that it might affect the children.
And even though you prohibit advertisments for children, there are still going to be some directed toward young adults and adults, which the children are going to see as well.
These might manipulate them as well, so why only not allow advertisings for children?
I think that if you want to not allow it, you need to prohibit advertising in general.
I believe, that there is nothing, absolutely nothing good about advertising directed toward young children.
Which means, I totally agree with the previous statement.
The televisions, the newspapers, the socialmedia, everything manipulates us, to doing or being somethig, we don't really want to do, or be.
Day for day all these sources make us think that we need something,  that we need more, that we need everything that's being advertised, just because everyone wants or has it.
But maybe if there wasn't any advertisement about that thing, and if not everyone wanted it, then we wouldn't want that thing at all.Then we wouldn't even look at that specific thing whilst walking by a window of a shop.
I believe children, have got a whole life ahead of them, full of being manipulated by the social media, the televisions and all the advertisment in it, so I ask myself, why can't the world just let them be children, for as long as possible.
Children, who can enjoy their childhood, not needing every toy, that's being advertised in the television, not needing as many things as we adults need and want all the time.
Why can't the world let children be happy by simply spending their time in nature, playing traditional games such as hide and seek.
Why would the world want a three year old to play Super Mario on a gameboy, rather than to be outside, on a playground, in the real world, with real people.
Why would the world want a child to feel that constant pressure of needing to be trendy, needing to be cool, by owning specific things.
We're all carying such a heavy weight around with us, caused by all the things we own.
We're not free anymore.
We can't just go and travel around the world, or move from one place to another, we are trapped in all the things we own, all the things we can't just leave behind and that is a constant responsability.
Let's let the children enjoy their life without that responsability for as long as possible.
Let us give them that freedom.
They deserve it.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Advertising has always been a big part of society, if back in the day or nowadays.
There is a constant convrontation, it doesn`t matter if you`re outside, in the internet or just watch some TV, we find it in all sorts of media.
Also advertisements are espeacially made to adress a certain group of people for example age group, gender, race etc.
We live in a world, there we have already advertisements for our youngest generation, children aged to five.
Is this even worth the money?
How much can a toddler actually already understand?
The companies creating those advertisement definentely see the potential of manipulating a child into wanting something it doesn`t need.
A young child is innocent and naive and can`t read out such propaganda.
But not every advertisement must be seen in a bad way, for example advertisements which are made to motivate children to eat healthy and do sport activities can surely be helpful and have a good cause.
I disagree with that I find it justified to manipulate a human being through media, it doesn`t matter if it is about children or adults.
But we will never be able to make a total cut with advertising directed toward young children, but I personally think that money invested into advertisement which rather addresses their parents would be a more valiuable idea.
The television is present nowadays more often than ever before.
Not only parents are watching regularly TV but also children in young ages are getting used to it.
One thing that always has been present in the TV are advertisement, but they used to be adressing older people and not young children.
But these young children are easy to influence what's used by the companies.
The question is weather televisionadverising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Even though there are many ways of advertising affecting younger people there should be some restritction to protect kids from unneeded infuence.
In their young age they are developing themselfe realy fast but also get influenced realy easily.
Thats something which shouldn't be used for the profit of your bussines or to get extra atraction.
They need time to determin themself and find out what they really want.
Of course we are talking about children in the age of two to five years, who aren't going to decide realy importent things.
But when I look back to when I was young, I wasn't playing with any electric devices or had the newest stuff.
I was happy with the things I had got.
Todays society, not only the young ones, are only happy with the newest devices on marked and there is no need to help this feeling already in this young age.
These are the reasons why I'm against advertisment directed toward young children.
A lot of people say watching television has a bad influence on children.
Especially the advertisements between the programms could harm the children.
Television advertising directed towards young children is not that effective as advertising towards adults.
The main reason for this is the point that children can't buy their own stuff.
In the end the parents decide what they want to buy.
So for this reason, advertising should more target adults than children anyway.
But the thing is, that without the advertising the children wouldn't notice the product, because they never go shopping or read magazines.
So the only media where the companys can place their advertisement to reach their target is the television.
However, the television advertising makes the children believe, that they need what they see.
So they start begging their parents for it, until they get it.
This is good for the product, but the parents won't be that happy with it and the children, who probably don't get what they want, neither.
Where it all boils down to is that we just get spoiled children, with too much toys, who can't be satisfied anymore.
And for this reasons, I figure that television advertisements targeting childern should not be allowed.
In this essay i'm going to write about the question: If television advertising shouldn't be directed toward young children.
First i'll mention some agreements.
After that i'll mention som disagreements.
At least i'll give my personal statement.
Well to be honest i'm not the bigest fan of watching television.
But I think in our time electrical devices, including television, are playing such an important role in our life.
And because of this i think it's important to learn how to manage white those devices.
Now i'll tell some advantages of watching television advertising: children are fascinated, the get new ideas and sometimes they can learn something.
Now i'll mention some negative aspects of directing television advertising toward young children.
In some television advertising they are showing very stupid and crazy things.
Young children  believe everything and because of this they believe everything what they saw on tv.
My opinion: I think that it's very difficult to prohibit watching television advertising toward young children.
Because on every chanel are television advertisings.
I think it's the parents job to prohibit their children some chanels ect.
All in all i think that watching television isn't
The questsion whether children between the age of two and five should or may be exposed to advertising is to be discussed in the following.
A argument of the pro site is that a bann of children advertising would mean less promotion for toys and other commodities for which children are potential buyers.
This would lead to a lower demand in these commodities i.e.
thes firms generate less surpluses.
For example if McDonalds can't direct their advertising towards small children, the brand will be less popular in this age group.
A argument of the opponetns is that directing adeverts towards chirldren is bassicaly equal to brain wash them.
Since they are very easy to influence and eager to imitate their templates.
They can't realy cope whit advertising because they aren't conscious that it is only an advert.
They take it for real and respond to it by wanting to get the promoted product.
In my opinion there aren't any good reasons to not ban advertising for children.
The economy must not interfere whit the psyche of humans especially children i.e.
brainwash tehm.
Further brainwahsing people creats only an unreal increas in the demand of certain products which leads Adam Smith's invisible hand astray.
For this reason I am for a ban of commercials directed to chirdren.
Many young children get confronted with advertising while watching television.
Wether this should be allowed or not is a controversial question.
In this essay I'm going to present some aspect in relation with this question and in the end I'm going to present my personal opinion.
It seems totally normal that we watch advertisments on television so why should it be bad for children.
First of all most of the children don't understand some of the adverts, this can be considered good or bad, for example when It's an inappropriate advert for children they might not mind the advert or and that would be a negative aspect, they go question their parents and theydon't know how to explain the inappropriate content of the advert to a young child.
Let's now take a look at "normal" adverts like for example about some toys for kids.
Advertising is an established part of the "televisonal experience" and children might even learn something watching them.
Why shouldn't the children see what kind of toys exist and which they could might wish for their birthday or something.
On one hand Out of the view from companies who sell toys those adverts directed to young children are very important as they are potential costumers.
On the other hand there is some sort of manipulation of these kids and they want to be part of this society of consumption.
Furthermore they might get an illusorical imagination of things, as there are a lot of adverts which for example show toys who come to life.
In my opinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed for young children, as they are manipulative and create a world which does not exist.
On top of that these young kids get introduced to a society of consumption which is n't good
It is a well-known fact that at the age of three, children get extremely exploreous and start to discover new things.
It is a phase in there life where they catch up every movement around them and try to understand or imitate it.
That's also the point where eduaction starts to be important and useful for small children.
But what happens if their mentalities get influenced by television advertising telling the girls to love princesses and the boys to be into pirates and adventures?
Advertisement often has eyecatching pictures and rememberable slogans which appeal to our younger generation.
Once they see an interesting advertisement, they'll remember it because of that.
Hence, they don't really get attracted by the message that comes along with it (like "this new pair of shoes will make you look cool"), but with its noticible surroundings such as the background music, colors or protagonists.
In that case the youngsters aren't really affected by the advertisement itself.
On the other hand it is important to give the children an idea of forming their own opinions and discover their interests.
You should rather let them play in the garden than placing them in front of a television where they get informations through pictures and stories.
A small boy learns much more things if he tries to build a wooden castle in the forest with his friends than seeing an advertisement telling him how amazing the new play-castle is he could wish to his next birthday.
So actually the parents shouldn't underestimate their responsabilites.
In my opinion it doesn't have to be strictly forbidden, but parents should get aware of the advertisement their sons and daughters are watching allday and based on that they shoud decide on their own if they stand behind such influence by television.
On one hand it is certainly not the best idea to let young children watch television allday
Television advertising towards young children plays a major role in modern society since already the youngest and most volnurable of us are being adressed by major companies in order to make them want something or a state wants them to think something.
This could be a problem for the children, if they are "brainwashed" with views that a company or a state wants to distribute.
Therefor my opinion on advertising towards young children is, that it needs to be regulated so the children aren't brainwashed with for example political statements that are hidden in the ad.
On the other hand I think adverts directed towards children could be a great possibility for giving children something that they can think about and while doing that, devoloping their thinking capacity at a very early stage.
This means, since ads are normaly very short, they give the children something that they can think about or discuss with their parents afterwards.
In my opinion, advertising towards young children should be regulated but if done right, television still has a big potential that should be used in the future.
Well at first i have to say, that in the age of two to five i did rarely, or not watch TV at all.
There were already many situations in my life, when some friends of mine told me about that one old series or that one old film that you should have seen and whenever i tell them, that i haven't seen it they are shocked.
They say things like ''how can you not know it, didn't you have a childhood?''.
Yes I had a childhood and yes it was a good one, even without television.
I truely believe that their is no advantage in allowing your child to watch TV all day.
I even believe that it can cause harm to the child and his intellectual devellopement.
By watching things like Sponge Bob your child does not get any benefit, i even think that it can get a little dumber by watching it.
Well probably not dumber but I'm shure it gets another sight to the world, it maybye believes in the pineapple house and that squirrels can live under water.
But dont get me wrong, I like watching TV and I am not completly against allowing to your child to watch TV but please be careful what series or film is on.
There are beneficial series that share information and knowledge to ''the little ones'' but please be careful with this cartoon type of things.
And when you don't want to be that strict you can be careful with the time your child is spending on watching TV.
I remember that I watched this one series that was on every sunday morning.
We always watched it with the hole family because it litterly is interesting, even for adults.
It is called ''Die Sendung mit der Maus''.
The principe of this series is, that children can write letters with questions they have, like ''what is a lollipop made from'' and then send it to them.
So every question will be answered the next sunday by following the way of a lollipop from the verry beginning.
So to find an end, there is a beneficial way of watching TV for your children but you need to set limits and rules or even forbidden movies and series and you need to keep an eye over your children.
A true childhood for me is still to play outside in the sun with the children from the neibourhood and having a good time, without TV.
We are living in a time of many differents ways of communication.
Children, who are watching TV with their parents, get influenced easily by the huge amount of adverts on TV.
But we have to question the authority.
Shouldn't your child get educated and influenced by you, as a parent?
Television adverts can be a helping hand.
While your child gets to know television, advertising and fun at the same time, specific adverts are nothing but support in your daily life.
Of course, not every advert should be watched when you're a child, but specific advertising can help in the learning process, whether it's the spoken language, the grammar or the way of talking - your child can see and hear and learn alot.
Over the two channels seeing and hearing, more information get's provided.
Letting your child watch TV can also be relaxing for you.
Your child is having fun, learning at the same time and you can lean back.
Sound's perfect, doesn't it?
On the other hand, you are the one who cares about your child, who wants your child to learn about the important things in life.
And when there's a anonymous voice in TV talking to your child, trying to convince it to do something or trying to show a specific opinion, aren't you failing in doing your job?
And here we have the worst case: adverts are for the normal, classic child.
If your child has any problems with learning, it might won't get the message behind an advert.
I'll start worrying and maybe won't even understand what the person wanted to say at all.
Then it's again you, who has to do all the work.
To conclude, my personal opinion is clear.
Nothing is better than the communication between a parent and it's child.
People on TV are to far away, and often exagurate their subject.
There's no emotional connection and the amout of information is huge.
A child learns infinite without TV, and will watch enough adverts in his life.
Watching TV shouldn't start when they're young.
Television advertising is a big part of our wold today.
Everyone has been tricked into buying something by an advertisement, especially when they were young.
It is a typical situation; you see something on television that you really want, and you ask your parents for it.
If they say no, it`s a huge disappointment.
So the question is: how young is TOO young to see advertising on television?
Well, there are many reasons why television advertising directed towards children aged two to five should not be allowed.
It is a kind of brainwash, convincing someone that small that they want something, creating an artificial desire designed by professionals, directed towards children who have no idea what it really is.
It seems cruel, to play with a two-year old`s brain in the way advertising does.
A child needs time to play, to learn what his or her likes and dislikes are and most importantly, to learn the difference between "want" and "need".
Showing a small child an attractive ad for a product makes them want it, more than anything in that moment.
While it may be good marketing of the product, it is not fair to take advantage of a small child`s innocence in that way.
As always, there are also reasons why it should be allowed.
Just because someone is young, doesn`t mean they shouldn`t see what life is really like.
There are advertisments everywhere, not just on television.
What's the difference between seeing them on posters on the street and watching them on TV?
Also, it is the parents` responsability to care for their child and make sure they don`t see things that aren`t good for them.
The people who make the advertisements are just marketing their product, and what is really wrong with that?
If a parent doesn`t want their child seeing the publicity, they should monitor them.
There are good reasons for both opinions, but I personally think that the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed" is completely correct, for many reasons.
First of all, children aged two to five should not be influenced in that way, when they don`t realise the advertisements are meant to persuade them and talk them into annoying their parents until they buy something.
It isn`t human to take advantage of someone that small.
I also think that with each generation, we are becoming more and more addicted to media and smartphones.
So yes, parents should be monitoring their child`s usage of electronic anyways, but that doesn`t mean that it is fine to allow advertising directed toward an audience that young.
A two to five year old still needs to learn that you can`t always get what you want.
Life is hard enough as a parent, without their child screaming that they want a toy or a goldfish every five seconds because they saw it on television.
Television has changed a lot in the past decades: While it served mainly as a source of entertainment for many years, there are channels today that seem to consist more of advertisements than of actual content like shows or films.
What kind of product or thing is being advertised can differ a whole lot, depending on the time of the day and the channel: from beauty products to cars and, especially on the kids channels, toys.
The latter is seen as rather problematic by some people, which creates the question: Should advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?
What could be considered as a disadvantage is the frustration of children of families that aren't too wealthy.
In such a young age, children often do not have the kind of feeling for finance that would be necessary to understand why Mommy and Daddy won't be able to buy the toy that the girl from the TV has got.
Lacking comprehension from the child's side can lead to frustration on both sides.
Other than that, there is no visible reason why advertising could harm young children.
It could actually serve as a source of eduacation if you look at the advertisement from another viewpoint: Watching all the little clips of toys that are marketed as "a must for every little car-lover" or "your girls new favourite toy" could help the children form an own opinion and, even more important: it can teach them a consciousness of knowing what to really believe and seeing what is just bogus.
Surely, the young kids will not be able to really differentiate at this age, but the sooner a human being is confronted with a new situation, the longer it has time to, and the better it can adapt to it.
Considering that the confronted children are at still at such a young age, they also won't be able to earn their own money,hence they can not buy all the things they see on television, even if they want to so badly.
The decision is always with the parents and I would claim that they are experienced enough to know that not everything you see on TV is to be believed.
Considering all these facts I see no point in forbidding advertisement that is directed toward young children.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
In today's world advertising is an important role.
We advertise almost for everything such as a specific product, a shop, television, brandd and so on, but should there really be advertising directed toward young children.
Some parents find it dangerous or not good for their children, other may think it's good for the children.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed because the children don't even know what they are doing.
I mean children aged two to five are not all aware of what they are doing, often they just do what their parents tell them and want them to do.
If a children wants to beinga advertising spot it is fine, but if they don't want to be in a spot and they just have to do what they are told to they shouldn't be doing it.
It is okay if the advertising want to get the attention of a child,for example there is a lot of advertising for children in connection with playmobile, lego, nerf and so on, if a child sees how good the product looks in television the child wants to buy the product.
Otherwise advertising toward young children can also bring the children to a good idea.
For example, Marc is watching television and suddenly he sees a advertise that shows a new nerf collection.
Instead of thinking that he wants the new nerf he has an idea that he could make his own business with nerfs.
And build the world largest nerf business with new product.
Of course it is just an idea, but it helps the children to improve their own fantasy.
On the other hand children get involved to the mediaworld way to early, if the television advertising is directed toward young children.
It is way too early for the children to get involved in the world of the adults.
What I mean is that it is much better for children to be in their own non media world and explore the world as it really is, not as how the advertising is telling the children.
Children should play with friends and play outside as long as they can, because if they get older they get automatically involved to the world of advertising.
As a conclusion I would say that it is really important to let children be children.
It shouldn't be allowed to advertise directed toward children, because it changes the sight of how the children see the world and they get i
Television advertising  directed toward young children should not be allowed

Television is full of advertising, often it takes as long as 5 minutes until a film continues, way to long.
Altought it's sometimes quite interesting to watch the funny advertising  clips for example those during the Super bowl, they are usually annoying and distracting.
Televison advertising is very important to finace the television and is a great help for companies to get known or present their new products.
Of course we would all prefer to watch a film without  being interrupted every half an hour but advertising is simply necessary for the televison companies.
Sadly there was created an economic sector for advertising toward very young children with terrible results.
When children go for the first time to school they know around 300 brands which is nothing a 5 year old should know.
In theory advertising would not be that bad, because it depends on the product if it is.
And there the problem starts.
A child cannot know if the product is good for him and nearly always it's bad for him.
For example the unhealthty food that is advertised which will lead to and unhealty nutrition in the future which will also cause problem to the heahlt care system.
I belive that televison advertising toward young children should be forbidden, because it gets them on the wrong path.
But I don't think that it will happen any time soon.
The Interests of the companies are just to big.
Arguments: I disgree
I think that children shouldn't watch a lot of television during that age anyway because they should play with friends and be social and enjoy their time.
But if they watch Television I think that during that age they should rather watch shows with Crafts and "Do it yourselfs" without any advertisement so thats they or rather their parents don't have to buy a lot of expenssive stuff from the advertisment.
And also because kids kind of want to have everything that they see it can cause some sad kids which don't get everything what they want or what they wanted as a present.
A lot of stuff from advertisments is very expensive because most likely big brands like for example Lego or Playmobil do the advertisements and because of the price some parents may not be able to give their children what they want.
Another possibility may be that if a child gets a gift for lets say their birthday and they are happy but then they see a brand new adversisement they may want the thing which is advertised and aren't happy anymore with their "old" gift.
Arguments: I agree
I think around christmas time or the birthday advertisements can be a great way for parents to see what their child likes and what it wants as the next gift because with that way the parents don't have to go around in the whole city for finding a fitting gift.
My final oppinion: 
I thing that it isn't a good idea to spam young children with a lot of advertisement because even on the "adult channels" like RTL or Sat1 it can be very annoying to always have to watch the advertisments so why should these kids have to watch that stuff when they just want to enjoy their show on their channel.
We are use to see advertising everywhere.
Our society is consum driven and tries to make money of of anything.
But is it moraly supportable to advertise towards young children?
On children's television channels are the commercial break as long as on channels directed towards adults.On one hand young children can not understand the concept of money (at least not utterly).
And even less how capitalism works.
So it is not fair to target children and make money of their parents.
On the other hand they have to learn that they can not have every toy or everything they want.
When they are grown up, they have to be aware of that and they have to know how to manage money.
And they need to know there way around our capitalistic society.
This lesson can also be learnd in kindergarten our other places, where they interact with other children.
They might not have as many toys as others have.
Altought they might get confronted with com 

I can ethically not support the television advertising directed towards young children.Eventough advertising towards children should be allowed, I think the age up to five years old should be excluded, due to the fact that they can not understand the concept of money and should not be confronted with the capitalistic greed.
In the future it schould be prohibited to target advertising towards young children.
I personally think tv advertising should not be allowed at all, so I obviously also think it shouldn't be allowed, when directed at young children.
The problem with television adverts is how constant they are.
We don't have time to prosses what we have seen, because the next advert is already being shown.
With young children this, I think, is even more extrem.
They see a toy they like and people having a good time with it and then it's gone and a different toy or game is being advertised.
Who wouldn't want a toy that works perfectly ( toys always work better on Tv) and people have a good time with?
Children don't have the same abbility to overthink things and see behind what is being shown to them, as an adult does.
This is a part of childhood and it's part of what makes children have a great time, living in a bit of a dream world.
But it should not be exploited by firms advertising there products, making the children want something and feel like they are missing out on something if they don't get it.
Besides that, children at that age can't buy anything on there own anyway, making the original idea of the advertisers even worse.
They count on the children wanting something and then going to ask there parents to buy it.
meaning they don't advertise to thepeople they end up getting the money from, but to the children of those people, there loved ones.
Television advertisments that are directed towards children (2-5) are mostly about fast food or toys.
They always run to their parents after they saw such an ad because they want that toy that they give you if you buy a happy meal in McDonalds.
Television advertising directed toward children should be more controlled by the government, but not completely removed.
Advertisments can be different things and can change the feelings of children in different ways.
One has to  difference between these different kinds of ads because when the right ads are directed toward children, why ban them?
The advertisments of FastFood chains, like McDonald's or Burger King, should be most likely banned because they mostly appeal kids.
But is this appeal a good one?
An interest a parent wants his child to have?
Most parents only take their kids to places like that to make them happy.
Every kid wants that super cute Pokémon in the HappyMeal which makes fun noises.
These companies are so smart that they "connect" with the children over the ads to make them love their toys so much that they want to come back again and eat there.
This is a bad lifestyle which can make a child unhealthy in many ways like obesity, diabetes and many more.
These kinds of advertisments should be banned.
The situation with the toy industry is somewhere in between.
They try to connect with the kids over television as well, but it doesn't harm them to have that cute puppy stuffed animal which can move its head.
The only harm there is in the parent's wallet.
But also if there is too much advertisement every time a new toy comes out a child can get obsessed and always wants a new one because the other one is so from yesterday.
These advertisments should be contrlled but not completely banned.
The advertisments that include information about health on the other side should be pushed to be shown and make the kids realize what a helathy lifestyle actually is.
Most kids of that age don't care about health, abviously they're too young.
But the companies could at least use conter arguements not to go to McDonald's without telling the children directly.
Small inputs to a "healthy lifestyle" should be given from a very young age.
And in our time periode how would it be easier than educating the children over the television.
Obviously every kid has their favourite serie on Disney Channel or elsewhere.
Just put a little ad in between the episodes and they might not be really interested in it but the more it's showed the more it can influence a child's life.
It shouldn't be life chaning things but step by step.
The television advertising for young children should be overlooked for a perfect balance.
It is hard to know where the cut should be made of which advertisment can be aired and which can't, but if the government or a single Television Channel starts the movement towards the "good" side there will be ideas of what is "good" or "bad" and soon there will be the right amount of "good" ads to overshadow the "bad" ones.
Nowadays there is a big discussion about the television advertising beeing in a direction towards young children.
In the ages two to five there is much room to get influenced by any external source of information.
That makes the discussion about not allowing the television advertising directing young children debatable.
On the one hand I want to mention the fact that the television advertising is known as a big propaganda like influence for all the people no matter what age.
That is why it is extremly important that at least the youngest ones have to be protected by this influence and that they can develop their own opinion and not the opinion they have to accept by the television advertising.
But on the other hand there is also a responsibility by each parents that they can find a good way to handle the fact about the influence by the television advertising.
That is why it is essential that the parents look after their children and protect them.
Another argument against the television advertising is that the fantasy and the imagination of a young child will souffer when they are watching too much television advertising.
That is because of the stupidity with which the companies try to catch they young children.
As a conclusion I think everyone can make a case for both sides but for me it is clear that I am totally against the television advertising directed toward young children.
For me the most important argument is that the childrem would get influenced by this television advertising too soon in their lives and that they have to build their own opinion befor they get manipuleted by this strong but smart developed system.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Concerning the "shopping behaviour" children are equal to adults.
If they see something cool they want it.
Television advertising directed toward young children uses this.
But in some cases it seems to be more like a misuse.
According to this therer's the question if this kind of advertising should be forbidden.
When children see the adverting in the TV, the parents can't influence what they see.
So the children generate wishes and the parents have no idea where they come from.
The problem here is the fact that children see so much different things.
The result is that they want everything they see there.
They don't learn to see those things with their own eyes but only through the eyes of the seller.
The most frequent sentences are for example "You should have it" or "Get it now".
The sellers calculate with the grace of parents buying what their children like to have.
In this case it is a kind of misuse and should not be allowed.
But it could have also o a positive effect: If children see the advertising parents can act and show how to get on with that.
So the parents coud prevent their children.
In this case it's equal if there is Television advertising directed to young children or not.
I think this sort of advertising is not good at all and not helpful.
But I think the parents should also take care of what their children watch and not let them watch anything on TV.
And if the children do not watch TV all the time, which seems to be another problem, the television advertising directed toward young children would not be a problem because they have not so many possibilities to watch it.
When I think about television advertising directed toward children aged two to five I think about adverts for toys.
The purpose of these adverts is to awaken the interest in these children for asking their mommy or daddy to buy them these toys.
So they begin to want to buy things at a very young age and crave for material things.
The idea behind this may be that companies want to integrate people into the economical system already at a young age so they learn how to have the need to buy things and therefore will contribute to the constant cicle of production and consumption, which keeps our economy going.
However at a young age we do not understand how to handle money, so we obviously always have to ask mommy and daddy to buy these toys for us.
This shows the importance of the parents in how they respond to the children watching these advertisements.
If they constantly buy you all these toys we get used to living in a world of overconsumption and the constant craving for material things, which is good for the economy to bloom, in other words, we carry a major importance of the contribution to the economy.
If we would not watch these advertisements, what so ever, I do not think it would make that big of a difference, to be honest, because when older people who didn't watch much television at a young age will consume as much as people who did.
So conluding these last statements I do not see any reason why television advertising should not be allowed for younger children.
In the media we can hear from time to time that the consume of television is not good for the developpement of young children.
One thing which can influence the developpement of a young child could be the television advertising.
For the companies who launched the advertising campain young children are an ideal group to influence.
The children haven't a basic knowledge about a product and because of this, they are easy to manipulate.
After the television show, the children tell their parents what they have seen and in the ideal case the parents buy the product.
But it's clear that some psyhologes observed this developpement very critical.
This is positiv for the industy because more products were bought.
But some psychologes are very sceptical with this developpement.
The young children were very easy to manipulate.
A child who is under five years old can't built his own oppinion about a subject, and can't wage the pros and the contras of the product.
The child believs all, which the advertising has told him.
In my oppinion is that television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed, because in our time a big part of the parents are working during the day.
Because of this the children are watching television without a adult person who explain the advertising to the child.
For this reason the children are easy to influence.
In my oppinion it's nut just only the television industry who have to change theyr programm.
Also the parents should suport the children when they watching television.
Essay 1¨

In the following lines you are going to read about specific reasons according to the topic statement, For example how television could cause an addiction and why you should not let a two to five years old child watch television.¨

Firstly your child could miss an important part of his life if it is watching television all the time.
Especially at the age of two to five years a child learns a lot of things.
They start to ask questions and discover the world.
If a child sits in front off the television all day long, there will not be much time left to learn new stuff.
Often they start so see television as a reality and therefore they are going to have a problem later on.
According to the argument from above, children are not going to spend a lot of time with friends and other human beings.
They are just going to sit in front of the television and do not do anything.
However, it is important to have social contacts and not to get isolated.
If a child is watching TV at that age, the risk is getting bigger and bigger.
Lastly we all know that watching television too often could cause an addiction.
Lots of human beings are addicted to TV.
Especially at a young age you should not watch television too often, It's okay to watch TV but you should not spend too much time in front of it.
Therefore you minimize the risk of getting addicted.
In my opinion you should allow your child to watch television, but you should definitely have rules.
For example: "Not more than 30 minutes a day".
It is important to not let the TV educate your child, you should do it yourself and show your son or your daugther how beautiful life can be.
Television advertising targeted at children
In today's media and in television specifically, advertisment is omipresent.
For not government funded networks it is the primary source of income and they have to rely on it.
Institutions that belong to the government have to obey certain rules and either don't show any commercials, like the bbc for example, or have to clearly mark the start and end of an ad break.
Whereas private networks can incorporate advertisments even inside a show or program and also on childrens channels and in childrens shows.
I don't think this is appropriate for young children for the following reasons;
Young children can't destinguish between fiction and reality very well yet and also if the ad seems to be part of the show they might be confused and think that it is very important for them to have a certain product.
Because children are usually much more easily manipulated than adults, if a character on tv tells them something is a nice thing they will believe it and probably wanting to own it.
And many children will not stop terrorizing their parents until they will buy it for them.
Of course the products and their ads are specifically targeted at children and cleverly made to appeal to children, which I think is wrong and exploits how young children easily believe anything adults will tell them because they don't now yet.
I don't think children should even be seen as a target audience as they don't earn their own money yet and in particular young children who most of the time also don't get money to spend on things from their parents also because they can't judge what to buy correctly yet.
In conclusions I think regulations have to be introduced to protect children and their parents from the bombardement through advertising.
As television consumption is becoming increasingly popular even with young children, marketing campaings aiming at young people aged two to five have recently been gaining importance.
Debates on whether or not such advertising toward children should be banned are common.
I would like to show why general prohibition cannot be the solution.
Between the age two and five, children are learning, but are not yet able to assess difficult issues.
Thereby, marketing campaigns can pose a severe threat towards child development, as children are directly faced with advertisements made for them.
As a matter of fact, the children's development will be altered by direct advertising.
As people are confronted with advertising from a very young age, there is a threat that even grown-ups could get difficulties dealing with marketing measures.
Studies have shown that particularly on the internet, many people cannot reliably distinguish between information and advertisements.
As marketing becomes normal already from an early age, the risk of adults being very easily influenced rises.
However, it is the more sustainable solution that children should learn to deal with advertising instead of trying to shield them.
In the adult world, advertising is omnipresent; by protecting children from marketing campaigns, they will probably struggle dealing with such as adults, which would in turn pose a threat towards society.
Banning advertising seems highly critical, also from a very general point of view.
From a liberal perspective, it seems absurd to ban advertising, which is highly demanded by the economy.
Even as one might argue that children should be extraordinarily well protected, it must be stated that advertising as such is not dangerous.
What can be problematic is people, adults in particular, who are unable to deal with marketing measures.
Training children is the easiest and most reliable way to avoid later issues.
In today's television, advertising is a fact and will most probably persist.
People unaware of the risks of advertising can pose a threat towards society, especially in democratic states where the people's will is decisive.
Educating children is the best solution for skilled adults.
Shielding the children should not be aimed at.
As an addition, schools might start dealing with advertising.
This way, the children, who have already been exposed to advertising, will be provided with the tools needed to reliably deal with advertising.
I think television advertising by young children is a problem in our society today .
On the one side it shouldn`t be allowed, because children are weak about they`re opinion and character.
So it`s very easy to influence them.
SO if they see something in the Television they believe it.
In they`re world lies don`t exist.
Caused by that the companys use the children as perfect victims.
That`s a big problem for families.
So they`re children believe the Television more than they`re own parents!
That`s incredible!
On the other side in todays economics with no limits, why should this be forbidden?
If a family has a problem with that they shouldn`t allow they`re children to watch Television, easy solution.
But can you todays children taking the Television away?
They`ll watch it anyways, with friends, at school.
It`s a difficult situation.
Is money more important than the humanity of our next generation?
Do companys which pay taxes have more influence and are more important?
I think that are points which we should make clear and discuss about it.
In politics, with families, with schools, Kindergarden etc.
And after discussing these points we can talk about the real problem and find a solution.
My opinion is that it shouldn`t be allowed at all.
After the age of five you will have enough time for Television advertising for your potential clients.
And at this point they will have they`re own opinion.
So why already start that earrly?
Television advertising helps the companies to find new consumer.
This is good for the company and can be good for the consumer aswell, because he/she gets a product they may or may not have wanted.
The problem is when you direct it to the children, espetially the young ones around age 5 and older they don't know yet what is really naicessairy and what not.
They can be easely influenced.
And those comercials are very often filled with sterotyps just like girls have to play with dolls and boys with cars.
This leads young childeren to think that they are only allowed to play with those typs of toys.
But comertials for two year olds are quite stupid.
I don't believe that they really get what the commercial is trying to say them.
Children learn best when they see a person speak that is right in front of them or when they can touch the object and look at it.
This are things that aren't possible with videos.
And when they get older they start to know okay the sound and the picture of the video belongs togheter.
And then they are easely influenceable.
But those are for me no reasons why you should forbid the comercialsfor two year olds.
The parents can easaly control how much and often their child watches TV.
So they control if the child sees those adverisments or not.
And companies need to sell they're product aswell and advertings them is a pretty good way.
And the adverises for two year olds are most likely designed for their moms.
And they should be able to decide if it is relevant or not.
The advertisments I would ban are those who are directed to the older children in the age 5 to 10 because they are the ones that the parents let watch TV on their own for an hour or two and the ones that can be easaly influenced because of that.
I think it should be allowed to direct advertise toward young children because when you advertise to children they always have to ask there parents in order to buy what was advertised.
So the question is if it should be allowed to use children so that they annoy there parents till they buy what they want.
But as long as the product advertised doesn't make any harm to young children it isn't different to make advertisment to older people.
The goal is always to sell them someting they don't really need or they didn't knew they need it.
But when you advertise to young children you always have a second instance that decides if the product gets bought or not.
As stated before I think it shouldn't be allowed to advertise to young children when the product advertised has any negative effects for young children.
For example products with a high sugar concentration.
But in general there's no real reason to not allow advertising toward young children.
I agree.
Why?
Because it destorys the children's brains.
Every time they watch television ads, they scream and shout.
"Mom, Dad, buy us this or that" "No son, you have no use for this stupid shit", is my usual answer.
Those Dudes that produce the ads are usually loosers in my opinion.
All they care about is the cash they get.
It doesn't matter how weird and pointless an Ad for children might be, aslong as they get their beloved money, the're happy.
Now why do I agree with this?
Because I watched lots of television back in the day.
And I'm fucking mental!!!
Bi-ba-bop.
Every time I see a rainbow I immediately think of Skittle-shitting giraffes.
Like is that normal in any way?
Definitly not.
Thats why I wanna start a petition to take down those money-hungry sharks.
I'm gonna sue them for every penny they've made with the selling of their useless products.
Well, anyways where was I?
Usually im really calm when it comes to things like these.
But we gotta protect our little babies right?
We don't want them to have square eyes after all.
Also.
Why is it forbidden to make Ads for Alcohol, now nobody cares about Ads for icecream?
I mean it's not like 1/3 of the population is already overweight?
But who fucking cares?
Children that are obese aren't affected at all later on in the life am i right?
Ohh nevermind they are.
Most of any diseases have something to do with being overweight.
Heart failure, problems with your joints later in life, breathing problems, even things like getting bullied, because of their weight, are just some of the things you're going to encounter when watching Ads!
Definitly those things should be banned from TV.
For sure.
No other way is possible, to save the world from drowning in rainbows and giraffes.
And icecream.
What is the goal of television advertisements?
Enterprises want to get new customers, which buy their products, with it.
Because this is influencing the peoples that are waching them should it be forbidden to show advertisment directed toward young children?
Young children (aged two to five) do not think that people have bad intentions and because of this they are easily manipulated.
On the other hand such young children will not completely  understand what is happening in front of them and if they still understand what they see they will not be able to remember the advertised product for long.
Also, they aren't able to buy things by themself.
The most parents are not willing to buy a product just because their young children tell them that they saw a thing on the television which they definitly need.
To conclude you can say it is not needed to make a restriction for advertisment directed toward young children.
First of all they most likely will not understand what is happening in the advertisment.
Secondly, it is not worth for companies to make advertising for young children that are not able to buy the companies products by themself.
With this there will not be many advertisments for young children in the television anyway.
Television adevertising shouldn't take to young children.
Because they don`t understand what it`s meaning.
It`s the same when you go in e shopingcenter and somebody want to buy a little children anythink.
I think also that is not very intelligent from the advertising maker because they don`t understand what the advertising mean.
I think when people begin to sell little chilrden anythink is this stupid.
I think that young children don`t watch alot of Tv.
But the next generation is to play with an Iphone or an Ipad.
And when you make ther an advertising little children touch this App or something like that and by it but they don`t understand that they spent money for that.
Why you want to speak to her children they can`t spent money you must speak to her parents.
But at the Iphone and Ipad is this possible.
For me it`s ok when you make the advertising simple that all can understand the advertising but take not directly to young children.
Because alot of the product are very bad for little children but the companys want to make money and that is not ok.
Should Television Advertising for Children be allowed?
As soon as we turn on the television we will see a lot of advertising.
They all have the same goal: to make us want to have the product.
But that doesn't work everytime, because as soon as we know the price we start to think if we really need that product.
But there is one group of people that cannot decide if they really need the product or not: Children.
When they see a new toy on the television, they are very easy to manipulate so they just want everything.
So the question is now: Should television advertising directed towards children be allowed?
In the following text I will explain why it should and should not be allowed.
First the counter arguments.
Children cannot decide if they need a product or not, so they would be manipulated very easely by the companies and the parents would have to pay the price for that.
It is very difficult for the parents to work against the advertising for children.
To completly forbid the children the television cannotreally be the solution for that so the better thing would be to not allow television advertising for children.That are the reasons why it should not be allowed to manipulate the chlidren with advertising.
I will now explain why it should be allowed.
Firstly, television advertising for children gives the companies an opportunity to make money.
This is especially important for companies which sell toys because how else would they inform their custormers what new product they have.
When the companies sell more product, the state gets more money and that will help our economy.
Another argument is that it should be the task of the parents to look after their children and buy them or not the things they want, and explain why they do so.
It should be the parents who should discuss with the children if they really need that product.
That are the reasons why it should be allowed.
In conclusion I would say I think it is better if television advertising for children is aloww
We all know the feeling, when we are watching an exciting movie in the television and suddenly it gets interrupted by annoying ads.
But when we were children, these ads were very interesting and we got really fascinated by them.
They tried really hard to motivate a young child to buy something.
Is it correct to make a child, which cant even make their own decisions, buy something?
At first I have to say, that these ads can be extremly manipulating.
They just show the positiv sides of the product and they never tell you the whole truth about it.
When we are grown-up, we know that we shouldn't believe everything, that we see in the television.
But children often do.
They don't know the difference between an ad and the real life.
Because of that ads directed to young children are very maipulating.
On the other side I have to say, that children should also have the right to discover new toys and games and to build their own opionion about them.
And an easy way to do this is watching ads on the television.
Many amazing toys, that I had when i was a child, I discovered by an advertisment.
In conclusion i have to say that I think eventhough ads can be very manipulating for young children, they should stay allowed.
One reason is, that childrens should also be allowed to discover new things and the other reason is, that at the end, its anyway the mother or father, that has to buy the toy.
Often people think that televison is not good for young children.
That is why parents or older person argree against a television advertising directed toward young children.
However there are also people who support the TV consum by children.
In my opininon television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
There are a lot of arguments for this.
Firstly I want to mention that you can learn about many subjects with watching TV.
It can be a basicly part in children's education.
Yet there is important what kind of series or films or documentaries you watch.
I think that there are a loot of channels which are really useless for a children.
For exemple according to my opinion "Sponspop Schwankopf" is really useless as education.
Because you learn nothing important in this movie.
But there are also other chanels or series which are good material for education.
With education I do not mean only the schoolary part yet also an social education.
For this part TV delivers you a lot basic social morals.
To make en example we can speak about series like "five friends".
There are lot of hidden scocial education.
To explain that we can use the example of doing something togehter.
They
Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
This is a question which I asked myself a few times when I used to watch television.
Advertising in general is quite an interesting phenomenon, in which the viewer is convinced through image and sound that a certain product or way of living is more beneficial or more practical than what they already own.
Some people even call it a minor form of brainwashing.
So should it be acceptable to put children of a young age under the influence of advertisement?
Of course advertisement is needed for a product to sell well.
If we didn't advertise it, how would the general masses even know it existed?
Through advertisement and thus selling the product, capital is accumulated, and so more of the product can be made and sold, and this goes on until there is no need for the product, or a better version of it has been developed.
This then furthers our economy, which naturally is beneficial for the citizens.
However if children get to see advertisements which have been specifically made to make them want the product, for example by integrating a famous cartoon character and lots of colours, they will want to own the product, because of how it is presented to them.
This wouldn't be as bad if the children payed for those products with their own money, however in the end it will be their parents who will have to pay for it, since the children have no sustainable way of money income.
The money is not the only issue.
It is known for a fact, that children are more easily influenced by their surroundings than grown up or fully mentally developed people.
This means that they are more prone to believing in what the advertisement tells them and so they are drawn to it, and wanting to own it, eventhough they don't really need it.
This is of course also another aspect of growing up: knowing what you really need in your life or what you would just like to have, just for the sake of owning it.
It is quite difficult do decide if advertisement directed towards children is good or bad, since the market for toys and various other goods designed for children is being boosted and improved due to funds, but at the same time, children will have expectations of what they need to own in life, which in my opinion, is not an ideal attitude for a five year old.
This is an especially hard question for me, since I haven't actively watched any TV in about eight years, and in generall I'm not very exposed to advertiesment in my daily life, and if I am, I do not care much for them.
If we can prove that advertisements subconciously alter our ways of thinking about an object, I believe that there shouldn't be such a thing as advertisements directed towards children, since they aren't yet capable of making thuroughly thought through decisions.
If children are exposed to advertisments too much, they might even get used to someone telling them what to buy or what to do, which might ultimately lead to them not having as much innovative thinking.
If you put children in front of a tv its not good itself, but if they watch advertising it's even worse because they get influenced by it.
We also get influenced by advertising but as adults we can differentiate between good and bad influenc and can decide more on our own if we want us to get influenced by something or not.
If a child watches advertising it just can't decide anything, it gets inflenced and maybe it gets influenced for the hole life and will stay loyal for all his life to the product it saw at young age.
Television advertising is really ennoying for us adults but for children even more.
When they want to watch teletubbies or learn from good, intelligent televisionshows like spongebob and then this terrible advertising sequence is popping up.
It's also really annoying for the parents who have children who always cry because they want the product they saw in the television.
So what do we learn from this now?
At first advertising in television towards children is really bad for the children because of the huge influence on them.
Second the television advertising makes the children dumb because they cant watch more intelligent things at the time the advertising is running.
Third it's very annoying for parents when children want products they saw in television advertising.
So in my oppinion television advertising towards children should be forbidden, otherwise our society will break down sooner or later because of too many television advertising damaged children.
Television is a media that's used by many peopele in their daily life.
People of every age watch television and enjoy the entertaining factor of the telly.
Because so many people use the media, this is where advertising comes in.
Television is an easy way to reach many people at a time with just one short advirtisement clip.
For companies it's obviously a good way to promote their goods.
But is it also a good way for consumers to learn about those goods?
Is it healthy to be cofronted with new and apparantly nice goods everyday, especially for young children?
Children of the age between two and twelve can be easily manipulated.
If they see something on television, is it a new toy or something to eat, they want  it immediately.
It looked nice on TV, they want to have it.
It's not in the mental capability of young children to differenciate whether they do or do not need the "cool new thing", they just saw in the advertisement.
This is why toy manufacturers like Lego or Playmobil strategically place their ads on special channels for kids or during a streaming time of kid-friendly content.
Because of that strategical move they can reach a lot of children and confront them directly with the new good they would like to sell.
A lot of children immediately feel a lack if they can't get the good they saw on television.
This happens over and over and with every new good they like and don't get, this lack gets bigger, eventually making them unhappy, maybe even sad.
Therefore it would be a very good idea to ban advertisments directed to young children.
With a ban like this a lot of problems would have to be faced.
Who decides which ad is directed, especially to young children, how can companies who manufacture goods for young children sell their goods without advertising for them, and so on...
For me personally it seems like no company would ever give up their opportunity to advertise their produced good.
The same counts for companies who manufacture goods for children.
It would not be fair to ban their ads, just because the audience they are directed to can't differntiate whether they do or do not need the good.
It would lead to a major disadvantage for the company and that's not fair.
Me personally i think it lays in the hands of the parents to communicate with their kids and tell them what they can and can not have.
There is no need for an advertising ban on children goods.
In today's world television is omnipresent and there's almost no household without at least one TV.
Companies have made use of that by advertising on television as much as possible.
We often see advertisment directed towards infants.
It is known that advertisement can influence people, especially young children.
But should we really, in a free society with freedom of opinion, forbid advertisement that is directed toward kids between two and five years old?
As a matter of fact, we can say that young children are very influencable.
We can for instance see this with kidnappers.
They offer kids sweets or promise them puppies or kittens.
The kids just have to hear one of these words and all they can think of are puppies and kittens and sweets.
Almost without thinking they will follow the kidnapper.
You could thus argue that a similar thing happens with ads.
The infants will hear the advertisement and they will accept them as truth.
It can blurr or even fake their view of reality.
On the other hand we live in a free society, where people can have their own opinion and even spread their opinion.
We see this all the time with demonstrations, banners with political messages, satirical cartoons in newspapers and so on.
So why shouldn't companies be allowed to direct their advertisements towards younger kids.
It is the parents' duty to make their kids "immune" to these kind of advertisements.
With their education they should prepare kids for situations like that and they have to say no if a kid wants this stupid product that was advertised for.
To conclude, I think that you cannot forbid advertisement that is directed towards young children, because it is part of our free society to spread your opinion.
Companies should be able to make use of this.
I think that it is the parents' responsibility to prepare their kids for situations like that, so that the kids aren't influencable so easily.
Young children are not able in differentiating what they really need and what is good for them from what is not useful or fun at all.
Neither are they able to decide if buying that toy is worth it regarding to the quality.
On the other hand children have to make their experiences in life and first of all learn so many lessons in advertising as well.
Kids aged two to five cannot really get what is said to them in television.
What happens only is that they are like: "Oh I really want that".
Children these days are watching TV more than they are playing in the woods.
Making them seeing all these things like toys, movies or something which are showed off in the best way possible would make the situation worse.
They may even spend more time in front of a display.
But because of that trend that young kids want to watch more TV marketing functions on television.
My personal opinion is young children may should not be confronted with direct advertising.
We live in a time where marketing works like that.
I think it is the responsibility of parents to protect their children from possible danger on television and internet.
As long as television advertising is not too much and manipulating it is alright with me because our system works that way.
The question of what is too much is hard to answer but I really think parents of their children are responsible for what their kids watch.
Advertising towards small children: A blessing or an immoralic way of influencing innocent people?
On one side, on the side of the commercial industry, advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) is a blessing.
It's so easy to influence small children and for them it's very easy to influence their parents.
This gets clear with the following example.
The producers of an advertising will show a product in an mostly unrealisitc way so that the children get seduced to wanting this product.
The children will talk to their parents and their parents will buy the product for them because the children are so fascinated of it so that they won't stop asking for it.
This example shows that commercial enterprises and product manufacturers can make a lot of money with advertising towards small children.
On the other side it's a immoralic business.
Small children aged two to five aren't able to think about a product properly.
They just want it if they like it or if their friends like it.
They know nothing about the circumstances in which the products get produced.
The manufacturies that are mostly in China employ a lot of people in bad working conditions.
On top of that, commercial towards small children just increases the amount of resources that we use because there's a bigger group of people that gets affected by advertising.
I think that this way of advertising is a sort of immoralic business since small children are innocent and just don't know enough about the backgrounds of the products that they want.
But otherwise it's also the parents that produce these advertisings and parents need money for their children.
And in the end it's in the hands of the parents if their children can consume advertising or not.
Every time our kids turn on the TV to watch their favourite show, it is likely that the screen is showing advertisements, because it was turned on as the requested show has not yet begun.
In that very moment, those unexperienced, almost naïve minds, are exposed to whatever is happening in front of them.
Whether it's an ad for a new toy, a kids magazine supscription, or some kind of candy, the children suck up all the information they are being told, without questioning the content.
Now, is it a good thing to allow companies to advertise their product in front of such a young audience?
The reason why I'm against advertising on children's TV channels is because on one hand, children are impatient.
They can't wait for "ad breaks" to be over, so that they, for example, can see their favourite superhero save the day.
And if advertisements roll a lot, the child becomes annoyed, upset, or angry at whatever it is watching.
And that anger often enrolls on the child's parents - which brings me to my second point.
On the other hand, it's not the children who are paying for the toys, it's the parents!
If a boy goes grocery shopping with his mom and he sees this brandnew LEGO dumpster truck sitting on a shelf, just waiting there for him to choose it, buy it, take it home with him and have a happy day playing with it, the boy's thoughts partially implied by TV ads he had seen about that truck prior to entering the store create a stressful situation for both the parent and the child.
Having seen the published ads on TV, the boy knows all about the trucks cool features, such as remote control.
That is giving him a wider range of arguments he's able to use against his mother, who is just trying to buy the ingredients for tonight's vegetable stew.
The last thing she wants is a crying son, but not being willing to buy him another toy to lie unused inside his oversized toy box at home makes for an excellent base for an argument, whose possible endings most people know already.
The mother either buys the toy and is upset about her unnecessary expense and her son's misbehaviour at the store, or she doesn't buy the truck and the disaster becomes even more horrifying for her: Having her son screaming, crying and yelling at her about the "unsuccessful" shopping tour makes other people look and stare at her, the "unresponsible mother, who is not willing to fulfill a son's wish".
Eliminating advertising for kids on TV would not only make sense for the children, as waiting times for their favourite series become shorter, but also bring relief to the parents, because they would be able to avoid certain stressful situations throughout the daily life and they wouldn't have to fear about their children watching content inappropriate content for their age.
In addition to that, the family budget would have more room for the important things like food, home improvement or holidays, rather than spending a lot of money on toys and such.
And anyways, isn't there enough stress for the parents around Christmas to worry about what toy to buy for their beloved children?
Should Television adversiting direted  toward young children not be allowed?
We all know that the medias inclusiv the TV an enormous power has.
Every person who`s watching TV can say it has no impact on him an lie with that statement.
In fact it does have.
An perfect example are the news in which we get constantly betrayed and lied on.
We could argue that every family should look for themselves and it is not the problem of the state.
For the state is it great if the kids look TV because so has the state a bigger affect of the youth and can more easily give the kids morals which are positiv for the state.
It is clear that we have a lot of privat TV and so this factor with the state goes away.
The private Channels often do exactly the same for example learn the kids also morals and behaviour from there.
So the parents should look for the kids and not the TV.
On the other hand can kids learn a lot from the TV if they are watching shows with a learn basic like the Animal Channel or the show Galileo.
If the children look  TV with a good content it could be great for them.
In my opinion the state should not force us to not let our kids watching TV.
I think every parents are free when they want let or not let their kids watch TV.
I personally would let my kids watch Tvbut not too much and most importantlynot manipulated thing likethat with the chips imp
My essay is about if it should be allowed to direct televison advertising toward young childern (aged two to five).
I'm going to writte first of all my contra arguments and afterwords my pro arguments.
I tought about the statement and all I can say is that this is already happening in these days.
If christmas is coming closer, the weather is getting colder and the nights are getting longer the televison is full with advertisings.
If I think about it, the advertisings are mostly directed to young childern and teenagers.
But why is the televison full with Barbie and Cars spots?
I belive due to the rising cosum of this wolrd the market is looking for new and easier cosumers.
And childerns are really easy to confince.
A pro argument is that the childerns can easy tell their parents what they want for cristmas or birthday.
The television in the most homes are in the power mood for a long time and this every day.
Luckly parents can jsut say no, and the childerns won't get their Barbies or Cars game.
So it might can be allowed to direct advertising to young childern due to teh fact that the paretns have to say yes ot no.
My pro arguments are that in this exathurating consum of today, we have to look that the youngest people shoudn't get forced to cosume, but if you tell them that they have to buy everything they will get use to a consum in a capitalism way.
Also childern in this age are to young for being sure if it's a right or wrong thing to want, what's in the advertisings.
So my opinion is clearly that it shouldn't be allo
The topic if televiosion advertising directed toward young children is e very controversial topic.
It gives several positif asspects but also various negativ aspects.
The first argument for the televsioin advertising is that the children can learn how to use the television in de right way.
Also a big plus is that they can make experiences about the advertising in general so they also ahve to see that the parents won't buy them everything out of the advertisement.
For the children it is now easier to know waht they want for the negst christmas or their birthady because they see what kind of things it gives like a new doll or something like that.
It gives also a lot of contra arguments to the advertising toward the young children.Firstly it isn't good at all that children in the age of two to five are in front of a televiosion.
This because it is biologically proofed that learning process of the children will get slower and out of that the most of them have problems with their intelligence and the school later in their life.
With the advertising will get the children more addicted to television because they want to know what new items it give.
In fact of that they won't be that much outside and they will pass their childhood in a room in front of a TV.
Advertising at all isn't good for the family life because some of the parents coulnd't buy every new playitem to their child and mostly the child can't understand it and will get very angry.
Also a negativ point is it that the children won't play with their old tings like an old lego set, no they want the newest one and when they get it they will play for one or two weeks with it and afterwards it gives a new one and they want to have that one.
So in the end the families lost unneceserally a lot of money,  had a lot of fights and have a lot of playitems that nobody is using.
So I'm definitly against the television advertising directed towards young children.
firstly my opinion is that they shouldn't watch TV at all in that age because they can do such beautiful other things than just hang in their rooms watching TV.
It is also very dangerous for the children when they see all the new things and they can't get it so when they are for example in the kindergarden and they don't have the newest thing maybe they will get mobbe and that in such a young age and because of all that negativ aspects and that is givesnot really many reasons for it I'm against television advertising directed toward young children.
So I agree with te statement in the exercise
Advertising is very controvertial topic for some people, espetially directly towards young children.
In this essey I am going to write my thoughts about it and come to my own conclusion.
First what is advertising all about?
Addvertisements are shown in the televivion to promote an article a company wants to sell.
Companies tell you how good their product is but you never know if that's just a hoax or real because companies want to sell their goods and make profit to keep going.
In my age - I'm 16 years old - I know that companies want you to sell their product so they pay to show it on television.
But here is where many people start to get sceptical about it when young children are involved, children mostly  aged two to five.
A fact about children is that they don't know as much as we do about the "world" and can be very naiv.
Which means if there's someone in the add telling how good something is in particular products that parents don't want their parents to have due to their oppinion about the product knowing what actually is behind it.
However children can't realize that and believe what they're told on television so they want to get the product and start crying to get their toy or whatever it might be.
As well they will start to become a picture of the world that might be unreal just because they are told on television

But if we are ralistic then I think that it is pretty exsaturated that people want thet direct advertising to children is forbidden.
if parents don't want their children to see those adds, don't even let them watch television and how do those people want to achieve to not let children watch televison.
it's hard to only let adults see the adds, so my oppi nion is clearly that I think it's unrealistic to not let children watch them.
Advertisement directed toward young childern is rather manipulative, since they will be excited about the bright colors that are often shown in such advertisments.
They will often ask their parents to buy them whatever new product they saw in the advertisment, and they will often get it as a birthday or christmas present.
This, of course, is helpful for the companies.
It must be effective, since if it was not, there would no longer be advertisment directed toward children.
Parents will spend money, which helps keeping the economy going.
On the other hand, children can easily be manipulated.
There was a study in which they were shown a short video clip of an evil clown being beaten up, and as a result, the cildren would later try to hit a person distinguished as clown.
Apparently, avdertisment seen in television might cause damage to a child's mental health, especially if it contents violence or usage of strong language.
However, parents decide what they let their children see.
They should be capable of controlling how they rise their own children, what they buy for them and what is not acceptable to show them.
Parents can turn the television off at any moment.
Also, advertisments only seen once will usually not cause damage to a childs development or mental state.
Content must be seen over a long period of time in order to cause such problems.
Again, it is the task of their parents to control that.
Still, children will sit in front of the television longer, waiting fo the bright colors and exciting sounds to come along.
Furthermore, talking of their parents, those will not be too amused about their children asking them to buy whatever new product they saw on television.
However, again, this is in control of the parents.
They should be able to control what their child sees and the should be able to refuse to buy whatever product their child wishes for.
Additionally, children will watch more television anyway.
There are enough shows they can be excited about, for instance disney movies such as "The Beauty and the Beast".
In my opinion, advertisment towards young children should not be forbidden.
However, parents have to be careful about what their child sees at a young age, especially when it comes to violent content or similar.
Nowadays I see more and more children with smartphones and iPads.
At home they are confirmed with television.They can not go outside to play with friends.
The technic is nowadays a part of society.
The children of this generation have an issue.
Television is a particulary part of our society.
Important news all over the world arrive us with TV.
We get an overview of the situation of the world.
And this is important for our education.
But in fact young children do not watch news-shows.
They do not watch them, because they do not understand.
In my opinion this is okay.
But exactelly in consequence children watch television shows without niveau.
And this is the way I see it a gigantic problem.
Moreover they watch silly and stupid TV-shows without any education.
I am agree with this statement, because think today in television we can see so much stupid things.
In this age children shouldn`t see things like this.
I mean sure in television you also have some programs only for the kids but for kid in the age from seven to eleven or something.
In the programs for adults or teenager they are so many things which aren`t really good to see for small children, for example some pornos or war-things.
Because I think small kids maybe do not understand what they say in the television but they can see the worse pictures and I think maybe it could be that they understand this pictures.
Maybe not everything should not be aloowed, because there are also cute things in television who are really okey for this age and this series for kids are often really short only ten minutes or something like that.
Maybe this kids series they can help the kids to speak ot some easy words or learn some easy things.
In a other way is my opinion that children shoud know what happens in the world, I think if a child is maybe fourteen or fifteen, then it is old enough to understand some difficult things,but not in this age.Since we have this television and computer and mobilephones so many kids can watch TV how long they want and what they want.
But if you are a small kid you do not know what could be good for you or what you should not see in this age.
Sometimes i am really shocked what so small kids are able to do or have.
If you are a kid you should go out with the kids in the forest, it is not important where but you should go out with the kids.let them play outside because the nature is much better than some advertising or programs in the television.
How I already said I think it is okey if children are able  look sometimes a short clip or something in the TV, but not so often.
Because if a family has a TV at home and the parents watch every evening TV, you can not say to your child that they are not able to look sometimes.
As I was a child we did not had a television at home an I had t played outside or make some puzzles oo something like that.
The statement I write about in this text is: "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed".
And I fully agree with that statement because these advertisements are often shown on TV-channels that are for kids and a lot of kids are watching these channels.
Of course it makes sense for the companies to show their advertisements on one of these channels because they can direct it to the right buyer-group.
But that's the problem, are children really a serious buyer-group, who can go to the store, make decisions what they really need?
No, they mostly can't.
In fact they wan't every single product shown in the advertising.
So they will run to there parents ask them to get it and if they won't get it, they will be sad and also angry at there parents.
But on the other hand they should learn, that they can't have everything in life and that the job of advertising is to get you to want to buy this particular product.
They should learn that advertising isn't always the truth and can be misleading.
That's the positive point about the advertising that is directed direct to them, because they can learn that early in life and will not be confronted with that, when they will be older and the advertising will be directed again direct to them, but not to a kid but to an adult.
So I think it shouldn't be allowed to advertise directly to children but the impact of the children depends on them and there parents.

My personal opinion about this subject is totally irrelevant, because absolutely nobody cares about it and i can't do shit about it.
But because I'm already here and can't do anything else before the time is over i will just write a little essay about  this subject.
In this time it is very common to use television advertising directed toward young children.
This method is very effective when used on children television channels.
The little kids see the ad between some shows especially for kids, and beg their parents to buy them these toys or other stuff.
These parents want to make their kids a pleasure and buy the these things.

Should advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?
A lot of children in the age two to five watch a lot of television, and the television industry know it, so the put on special times some advertisings for children.
I think its not that bad, because parents know with such things what thier children want for christmas or for they birthday.
On the other side there are also a lot of useless things in this advertisings or things that are realy expensiv and because it was on television, they want it.
That is not very good, because there are also people that can't afford thes things.
Of course the people also have responibility for their children and if they don't want that their children want a lot of expensiv things, they have to look at their own, that the kids don't watch these advertisings on TV.
I think for this it is too late, because these toys advertisings are extreamly popular on youtube ond other social media, that it don't depend it there is also advertising on television.
But these advertisings also manipulate the children a bit, because on these advertisings only a few things are shown and they are shown in that way, that the kids think ist the best toy ever, and the toys are often diffrent, than in the advertising.
In my opinion there can be advertisings on television, because there are a lot of other channels for children, that don't show a lot of advertising and also its everywhere on the internet.
In some cases its also usefull for the parents to know what their children want.
Nowadays we live in a world where publiciti has a enormous influence at us.
We have to protect our children in every situation.
As an adult you can build your own opinion, but as a child between two and five years old this is not possible.
So do we have to protect our children from televison advertising?
On the one hand, this should not be allowed, because we would manipulate our children.
In this age you have to learn to build your own opinion.
In my point of  view young children would just think what they hear and do not think about it.
They would just accept it.
As well in publiciti they just tell us the good thing and show us that everything is perfect.
This would not be fair and would not help our children for their future working life.
On the other hand, we should let decide our children if they want to believe in that or not.
I do not think that televison advertistment would harm the children.
Today we live in a world where everyone has a mobilephone or a computer.
So we would just prepare our children for the future and show them that the media is a big part of our life.
Little kids are better when they see something than hear it.
So with advertisment on the televison children would remember it better and would learn as well something.
To sum up, I think televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I agree with this statement because I think that in this age they should learn to have their own opinion and are to young to be influenced by the media.
Kids should enjoy their growing up and they should not be attacted by the media.
This are all reasons why I am against televison advertising toward our children.
Do not let the media take so a big part of our life, just let the children be young kids.
Everybody knows the struggle: You`re watching a movie or a serie on TV and get interrupted by avertisements every 20 minutes.
Then you swap the TV chanel to watch something different because you don`t want to look at advertising stuff for longer than 30 seconds.
In this essay I want to tell you what I think about TV advertising, especially when it`s directed toward youn children, First I want to say that it`s not an easy thing to talk about television advertising, because in this topic there are a lot of different opinions.
In my opinion it depends on what the advertisement is based.
If it`s just to show the newest car and the coolest shoes there`s nothing to critisise.
On the othere side there are plenty of advertisements for alcohols and other things which absolutely shouldn`t be seen by children in the age of two to five.
Last year I`ve heard about a child who had seen an advertising for sex toys, just because he swaped to the next chanel.
Please don`t misunderstand me, Television advertising isn`t always something bad.
I think it`s just impossible to control what children nowadays get confronted with.
If they don`t see stuff like alcohol, porns, drugs or voilence etc.
on TV, it`s somewhere else.
Last of all I want to say that Tv advertising can help you to find out what is new on the market and to get inspired by ideas.
Especially in time of christmas or easter the chanels are overfluded with advertisement.
This can be a help for children to find out what they want but it can be very stressful for their parents.
I think that`s not as worse as sex toys, alcohol, drugs etc.
The question, if direct advertising towards young children should be allowed truly is a very controversial question.
It shurely is a widely discussed and important topic with good arguments on both sides.
On one hand there is the freedom of market economy, which ensures companies to have certain rights and to advertise for their products as widely as possible.
They are dependant on a certain amount of sales and need enough income to continue providing their product and paying their shareholders and employees.
On the other hand children (especially aged two to five) are extremely easily influenced.
Do they have to be protected through law or are parents responsible for what their childen watch?
Are parents able to always watch over their children when they watch TV?
Or should they just let the advertisement get to their childrens brains but try to keep their kids under control on their next shopping trip to "Walmart`s"?
In my opinion we should protect our children from threats like these.
Letting big companies screw our helpless childrens minds is cruel and can`t be toleratd any longer.
We must rise and take a stand against this worst form of capitalism the world has ever seen.
There hasn`t been this amount of psychologic violence since the end of the second world war.
A battle is raging around us but we seem not to see it.
Or don`t we want to see it?
Because we are part of the system...?
Television advertising towards young children leads to pressure on the children`s parents because it gives children incentives to want a specific product which is maybe not financial possible to buy for the parents.
On the other hand advertising can be pared with moral aspects to teach and to create a better understanding and look for the world even though the targeted group is very young, growing up with commercials can influence a child positively.
It is often seen as unmoral to target such a young group because they don`t have an own opinion yet and they are not able to distinguish information correctly.
Therefore you could change the developement of a child with advertising because the child does not know that it is just for commercial reasons.
Although there are risks the toy industry is booming and creates a lot of jobs and strengthens the economic situation, especially in countrys like china where the production is less expensive.
In my opinion commercials targeted at young children should be forbidden, when their goal is to manipulate the targeted group.
It should be allowed to advertise in the toy business but not to set the goal to manipulate the children and create a need.
For me, there should be more controling and testing on effects on children.
This would help to rate and show the companys what risks there are and create an more sensitive understanding.
In my opinion a child aged two to five can't decide if an advertising is especially directed towards them.
A child has to learn that it can't get anything it wants.
For sure, the advertiser wants that the child goes to his parents and tells them that they want to have this thing that it saw in the advertising, but for me that's no reason not to allow it.
But yes, i think it can be ennoying for parents when their children do this, but it can also be a good point for a good parenting.
When I was a child I was bored from advertising neither, so I think they didn't influented me and I didn't ennoyed my parents too.
However, I don't see the point to direct advertising toward children aged two to five, because they are too young.
I think it's worse to direct advertising toward children aged seven to twelf.
In this age the children understand what they see in the advertising and they are more influentable.
But this isn't a reason not to allow them.
Another problem is to decide which advertise is directed toward young children and which not, if advertising directed to young children would be forbidden.
In my opinion it isn't decidable to say if an advertise is directed for children aged five or for children aged seven, so it would be very difficult to decide if the advertise should be forbidden or not.
In conclusion I think it may not be good for some children that companies trie to influent them whit their televison advertsing , but it cant be forbidden because it would not make much sense and would be pretty difficult to say if the advertise is directed to young kids or not.
Everytime we watch tv we see advertising.
It is used to promote products.
The product should speak to some kind of people that should be interested in.
For example if the commercial promotes cat food, it should get cat owners to buy the food.
Advertising is used for people any agebutt is ist really necessary to advertise products for kids?
What speaks for it, is 'why not' if it's child-friendly?!
Children watch tv anyways.
The advertising industry might get a lot more money because they speak to a new group of people.
Children can see new stuff that is on the market.
But on the other hand, children shouldn't be influenced in that early age.
They can't buy the products they see in tv, their parents would have to buy it.
If they understand the content is another question.
First Children shouldn't watch tv too often and second tv is not the future of the entertainment industry.
Advertising is often not even looked at, because it is so annoying.
I don't think it is a good idea because it is a waste of money and time.
To try to convince some toddlers and children of a product is ridiculous.
They can not buy the product by themselves.
With all the mobilephones, tablets and computers you can watch television everywhere and evertime you want.
Especially young children are likely to watch more and more televison as their parents often work full time and don't have time to play with their children.
But with all the television there is also television advertising.
It's something no one really likes, but you can't watch television without seeing a television advertising.
Often there are always the same television advertisings and without knowing the advertising is saved in your mind.
Young children tend more to save a television advertinsing in their mind, if there is a cool toy or something they would like to have.
So if the children go shopping with their parents and they see this really cool toy from the televison advertising they want to have it.
With adults it works the same but probably instead of a toy it's a new computer, a new hair curler or a caffemachine and when we see this new product in a shop, the chance that we will buy it is higher when we have seen the television advertising.
I think this is like brain wash but thats how everything works, the companys need a way to present their new products and without television advertising the television company couldn't survive.
I really don't like all these television advertisings and I also just bought something because I have seen it in the television, but thats just how our society works.
Everyone who has watched TV atleast once should know about commercial breaks between the episodes of scheduled programm.
These advertisements range from food to toys to shampoo for one's hair.
But some people started asking: Should we show those adds to little children?
In my opinion, we absolutly shouldn't.
One of the core reasons why we shouldn't is because young children are not protected from manipiulation.
They don't know wrong from right, they don't know good from bad, young children pretty much believe everything that one tells them.
Many commercials work in a way that exploits this weakness of small children: They show a happy family enjoying a sugary snack or a child who couldn't be happier with his new toy that his parents bought him.
None of these commercials show any downsides of the advertised products or unhealthy side effects that they might bring( and quiet frankly, why should they, they're trying to make money).
As said before, young children will believe what they are told without questioning the information.
If a commercial tells them that the new toy will make them smile and bring untold hours of fun, they will not question this information for even one second.
In short, commercials influence children who do not know any better and might lead them to some bad choices with their toys or food.
Another reason why commercials should not be shown to young children is because parents do not have any control over them.
While they can look up the shows and movies on tv, be it with help of the internet or the papers, and when what is playing, commercials aren't shown in the program.
Imagine a mother letting her child watch a kid-friendly show, like "Sesame Street" or "Dora the explorer" and just letting it sit there while she cooks lunch or cleans the house.
And then, suddenly, during the commercial break the kid is shown an advertisement for the newest ego-shooter or another brutal videogame.
Loud noises, gunfire, blood and death, those things will scare a young child and maybe give it nightmares for weeks.
And all that because the parent thought that they could do their kid some good by letting it watch "Sesame Street".
And is the parent really to blame?
Adults, even those with children, have a life of their own, have chores to do and sometimes need a small break from their attentionhungry little miracle.
They can not constantly watch over a small child and can't control what's shown on TV.
So in my opinion, it's a smarter move to show commercials then when smaller children probably aren't watching and leave them out from the kids programm.
In conclusion, i think showing adds to little children is a very bad idea.
It could influence their young minds or traumatize them for a while, both things that no parent wants.
Today every management needs to do some advertising to make their porducts more attractive and to make your that the product is wellknown.
For exempale if adverts are shown on televison, adults just skip the channel.
But young children are fascinated by the products and they want to have one.
Exempale given: In an advert a new toy is shown, and because it is so colourful the young child wants one of these and starts screaming until it gets one.
Some parents just buy it without thinking about it.
But isn't that selfish and disresponsible of the producer and the whole management to manipulate the kids?
Should advertising on the television, which is directed toward young children even be allowed?
In one way it's scary that adults and kids can be manipulated that easily.I mean adults and teenagers are old enough to decide if they want to buy it or not.
But children are to young to understand and they can't help themselves.
So you could say that they are vicitms.
Producer use children for expanding their products.
So i think that it shouldn't be allowed.
They can direct toward adults and older children.
But on the other hand, there isn't just advertising on the television.
There are screens and other devices which show adverts.
So just by not allowing advertising on television directed the young children the thing isn't done.
The kids wan't be much safer.
To end up you can say that producer are looking forward to expand their products and to make profit.
I think that it it would be a step forward when televison advertising toward young children were forbidden.
But it wan't change much.
There are adverts everywhere and the producers will find an other way to get the attention of the children.
Yes, i totally agree with this statement, because if young children watch television, they shouldn't waste time with advertises.
I think that children shouldn't watch TV all day and if they do, they should be concentrated on the informations that they learn with the things that are in the TV.
They're uninteressed in advertises and maybe the children can't even see the difference between real TV and advertises.
Young children want to learn things, they're curious and want to learn and understand everything they see and if they watch advertises, maybe the children's growth gets slow down.
Another point is the regular TV, what I've named a little bit at the beginning of the text.
Young children to the age of three should nearly never watch TV and children between three and ten should have the permission of the parents if they want to watch television.
The consume of medias is a problem that nearly every mother and father has.
If children watch TV, they should learn something about the world and how things are going.
If they have to watch advertises, they might unsee the important things.
Advertises should be only for young adults and adults, because these are the people who have money to buy the things in the advertises.
That's another point in this statement.
Young children want everything that they see, if it's in real life or in the television.
And if they see a toy in TV that looks funny and the woman that representates the toy looks also very friendly, they want it.
The parents couldn't and shouldn't buy everything their children wants, but children don't unterstand it, when the parents say no, because they are too young for it.
Everyone knows how fast children are intrested in something.
In my childhood I always wanted the new Nerf gun to play with my brother.
I first saw this super technology gun in a television advertisment.
But as we got the super new to play with we quickly realised that the gun itself isn't any good or exaiting, maybe the television tricked me in believing of this super new toy.
And that's the topic of the following essay.
Should television adverstisingtoward young children not be allowed?
Let's start with the positif arguments.
Advertisment for children between two and five is good, because they can see new things and get exited about it.
Through  the advertisment the children learn new things can explore the world and maybe get an insparation really early on, that effect them in their decision in life later on.
Maybe Lang Lang the popular pianist wouldn't have gotten a pianist if he hadn't seen the new playable piano for children with different sounds and only few keys in an advertisment, when he was a litte kid.
Maybe Messi the popular soccer player wouldn't have gotten a soccer player if he hadn't seen a new soccer ball in an advertisment.
This all has to be considered and can be important for a lot of people.
The negatif arguments are far more superior.
If all is considered most of the television advertisment tricks little naiv kids, who hasn't developped a selfcritic thinking, into buying stupip things.
First they are really exited and happy that they got a new toy ever other child has, but in the end they just use it once or twice and then they throw it into a corner and never play with it again.
The children get manipulated by the advertisment, which are organised so every child wants the thing in the advertisment.
There are huge parts in industries, which are specialisted exactly to manipulate the advertisment.
And that's not correct at all and in any case the children are most effected of it.
And the problem here is, that the child's parents don't teach the child, that this exact thing isn't good.
Yes maybe the parents are the howl problem in this case.
Sometimes the child is also under pressure, because every other friend of his has this new toy of an advertisment new-launched.
So he wants it too and would be really sad, if the parents just say no.
From my point of view, I think advertisment is bad and is really bad for young children.
Like in the introduction my brother and I got tricked by these companys a lot.
I learnt to think twice about things I see in the TV and stopped hyping everything up.
My brother on the other hand has still the behaviour of always wanting something new and he still gets tricked by advertisment.
It's not just a problem for the children it's a problem for all the people with a TV.
In my case, I can't get fooled anymore by these companys because  I stopped watching TV along time ago.
In my opinion every one should stop watching TV because in 90% of the content is just rubbish.
But this is just my opinion and I also think that the advertisment's influence relise heavily on the people and not on the the advertisment.
Often on children channels they publish advertisements for toys or games, which seems logical.
So I think every person remember such a situation in his childhood, where you see something shown in the TV you want to have.
On one hand I see the positive aspect for the company who sells these toys for children, because after the children saw these toys, or even worse they saw other children in the advertisement playing with these toys, they want to have it emmediately.
So they put it on their list of wishes for christmas and the parents will buy it.
And thats the way the companies make their profit.
But on the other hand exactely this example shows us that children get spoiled more and more, because these advertisement put them something in their head they want to have and they will get it.
So the advertisements on TV support this scenario.
Another negative point is that cildren in this age arent able to analys or even think about the consequences.
For example the price or how usefull it is.
They just want to have it.
So in conclusion in my opinion its to early for kids aged two to five to handle a situion like that in the right way.
It would be more intelligent to show them more of their series they want to see.
But unfortenately nowadays it the other way round.
They show even more and more advertisments than the real program of the channel.
So I think you shouldent stop every advertiment but minimize it.
"Television adverising directed toward young children should not be allowed."
This statement may shock some parents because they do this all the time.
But is it really bad?
One opinion is that it is.
It is not so good for especially young children always sitting in front of the television.
It could have bad issues to the creativity of the child.
But it can be productive as well because the children could learn and see things through the television that they would not see in reallife at this age.
Another opinion to this statement is that children should learn, even in young years, to deal with technique so they will not have problems to understand how the modern world works.
But they also do not know a world without televisions and stuff like that.
The children can no imagine that in the past nobody had a television or that even today not everybody has it or even knows what it is.
And a last opinion that is also my opinion is that parents will not do things with their children, as example go out to see somethig or to a parc, they just let them stay in the house and watch the television.
I find it terrible that the parents of today just let their children watch the television when they cri or when the parents are to tiredor are not in the mood to do tings with their own children.
For many of us watching television and therefore seeing all kinds of commercials is part of our daily routine.
Some are allowed to watch TV starting at a very young age and some are hardly ever aloud to watch TV at home.
Despite the fact that the children, aged two to five, probably don't really understand what they're watching, many commercials are directed towards them.
So haow do these influence them?
Should it be allowed?
Most likely, many of the commercials directed to young children are about toys, games or about some sort of drawing/art utilities.
As mentioned before, the majority of these children won't quite "understand" what they're watching and just forget about it a couple of seconds later.
They don't only watch commericals, they're merely shown between series or movies, like Sesame Street or Barney and Friends for kids at that age.
One bad influence could maybe be that they'd see all this neat things on TV and constantly ask their parents to buy them for them.
For example a little girl sees the newest and greatest Barbie on TV and begs her parents to buy it for her.
Howevery her parents can't afford to buy and don't want to have yet another toy because she keeps asking for another one every other week and it's hard for her parents to say no.
After begging for this new Barbie the parents give in and buy it for her - and that's exactely what these commericals are for, it's exactely what they want you to do.
This is how these toys and games brands make their money.
Every child wants the newest and coolest toys and keeps nagging their parents to buy it for them, and so most of them do.
People thnik these commercials have no impact what so ever on these young children but finally they make a ton of money out of these "harmless" commercials.
So to answer the question, if I agree or disagree with the statement: "Television advertising directed to young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
", I don't completely agree.
Yes, many of the children constantly ask their parents to buy them these new toys but I don't think there's any harm to that.
Of course these commercials are just there to "take your money", but that's like that everywhere.
So I don't think there's any harm done to these children
Nowdays, a lot of people can't imagine their life without a television.
They watch films, series, news, sports etc.
But there is also another thing that is on the TV, everyday and not loved by everyone: the advertising of different things.
Toys are advertised in this way very often.
But is this a good way to make parents buy stuff for their children?
First, children are very naïve and mostly want to have the "coolest" toys.
When they are watching television, for example Teletubbies, and between two episodes an advertising for a new Barbie appears, the little girls will probably get mad about it.
Eventhough they know that they have enough Barbies in their room, they still want to have the newest things.
And another point is that these television advertisings are formed very unfairly: "Only if you have this special Barbie, you'll have fun!"
But still, the children should learn that they can't get everything just because the television tells them to buy it.
The parents also play a big role in this subject.
If their daughter asks them for the Barbie, they should be able to tell her no.
Children need discipline and that is a good way to show them.
Another good point for television advertising is that children can decide, what they would like to have and what they don't want.
So if someone asks them what they wish for christmas, they can easily give an answer.
It's also a help for the parents: they'll see what their child likes and wants to have, so buying a present isn't that hard.
To sum things up, television advertising can have bad impacts on the children, but it's the task of the parents to show them what is essentiel for life and what isn't.
Children should see, that they can't get just everything they see and that toys shouldn't be their main thought.
It's important to learn this, otherwise they'll think like this for their whole life and the older you get, the harder is it to just get everthing you want.
And advertising things can be helpful for the child and parents when it comes to presents and what the child wants to have.
y
Why do big companies produce television advertising which is directed toward young children?
The answer to that question is quite easy - because they know that the parents let their children watch the television even at a very young age.
The problem, as we see, are not the "big, bad companies" who generate needs who did not exist before but the parents who are way too bored of their children to spend time with them and for whom it is way less difficult to just let their "beloved" sit in front of the TV.
So why would we forbid the advertising in a media which should not even be counsumed by young children?
Why would we blame others for the faults which the parents make themselves?
Because it is way easier to search the responsibility and the fault for our own mistakes at other people.
A big capitalistic company without face - that is an enemy which everyone would see as the responsible one, the one who wants to let our children become rotten and who try to convince our children somehow to buy more stuff or something like that, but even if that were the case, who has got the money to buy things?
The parents, not the children.
If a child tries to get something which it has seen somehow in the TV or the adertising or the media or whatever, it still has to ask their parents.
But it is not the fault of the people who produce the advertising that the parents are way too weak to say no to their own children who are not even old enough to go to school.
In conclusion, we should bloody stop to always make big problems up which are our own faults and to understand that we - if we want it or not - still bear responsibility, especially for those who should be under our protection.
And even if not - the world's population - or the majority of it - suffers from that many problem at the moment such as right activists, so-called "pro-lifes", Trump, hunger.
War.
Homophobes.
Rapists.
Pedophiles.
Murderers.
Diseases.
Why do we even have the time and the power to discuss that shallow questions?
Because we live in a country who has too much money to even know how it feels like to have real problems.
But yeah, it is way more important to spend time with the "television habbits" of our children in a country where our problems get created by our own wealth.
So here arethe solutions: Get your fucking shit together, do not let your children sit in front of the TV for hours and hours each day, teach them how to think critically and do not let them dictate what you should buy or not, because in the end, you are the parent, the child is only the child (if you are unlucky it is probably your own) and as a person of authority it is your choice what to buy and what not.
Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because they are not able to buy things themselves.
Parents are verantwortlich and can deside wether they should buy the stuff or not.
Maybe the children disagree with the opinion of their parents but it`s in charge of them to ceep their children calm and raise them right.
Advertising is more dangerous for adults.
They normally have noone to set them rules and they fall more often for advertising.
I think there should be more tv shows without that much advertising.
Advertising in breaks is often built up right for the persons who watch a show.
For example: when you watch gntm, the advertising is about make up, zalando and skin care.
When you watch a james bond movie, the advertising is about mens shavers and parfumes.
I would say that childrens advertising shouldn`t be banned because their parents can deside if they buy something.
The minimale bearbeitungdauer is way too long!
In this times where we have many new electronic devises it is important to learn how to use them in a way that it does not damage our society.
For exemple television advertising must not be allowed toward young children.
In the folowing I will  explane why this is my point of vew.
I will start by looking at the positive thing of television advertising toward young children.
First of all there are many children who want to see advertising at the television because they want to know which are the new toys they can whish theirselves for exemple for christmas.
An other point to look at is that many television chanels only exist because they do advertising.
Many marks pay a lot of many to appear for only few seconds in the television.
If that would not bethe case many channels would not exist and I do not think that the children would be happy about that.
There are of corse also same negative points of televison advertising.
Children in such young ages can be manipulatet very easily and many companies do that to make money.
Many children can not decide what they need and what things they do not need and so they want to have everything.
This is a bad thing because when they become older they can have same serious problems.
An other key thing to think at is  that in these times the amount of advertising in television is really high and so it hapens that a there is more advertising than for example cartoons.
To come to a conclution I think that advertising toward young children should be banned because they are so young and they can be really easy influencend.
Due to the technological development  in the last decades, the possibilities and varieties of advertising have rapidly increased.
Companies can target their customers more directly, more precisely and more efficently.
Out of all kinds of advertising, television advertising has been playing an important role in sale strategies since the very beginning of telvision.
The big advertising companies have not missed out the fact, that there are more and more children friendly channels on telvision.
This opens a whole new world of opportunities for advertising: Know companies have not only the possibillity to influence their costumors to buy one of their products, they are now capable of 'raising' their future costumers.
Television advertising directed toward young children must be strictly controlled or even not allowed.
Young children are very easily influenced: Their brain is still in the beginning process of development.
In addition, they are not yet capable of recognising an advertisment, the tend to believe what they are told.
This is why televison advertising has to be treated carefully: Children are very vulnerable to the companies' suggestions.
And those companies have only one interest: to increase their sales, by any means possible.
Telvision advertising is such an issue, because the children are often alone in front of the screen, with no adult to explain them what they are seeing.
A very good example is the HappyMeal: McDonalds tricks young children to consume more fastfood by advertising their HappyMeal which includes litte toys.
Little children are very liklely to fall for this trick, although the consumption of fast food has been proved to be unhealthy.
Finally, television advertising must be controlled or forbidden - we do not want our children to grow up a customer.
This question is of course a very difficult question to answer.
My opinion is, that this kind of advertisment towards young kids should not be allowed.
Children between the ages of two and five are not able to question things they're told.
It's impossible for them to build their own opinions and to see through marketing tactics.
In other words: children are manipulated by companies at a very young age just so they can make a higher profit.
This is not just an ethical problem our society produces, but also a problem the next generations will have to live with.
I'm sure the companies that use these sort of tactics make a higher profit.
But one can't just blame the companies, the parents are just as guilty.
Parents decide wether they buy the things the children want or not.
They are the ones who have to acknowledge the fact that their children's naivity is being abused and then decide in their favour.
Parents should be aware of those dangers and tactics marketing managers use so they can protect their children until they're able to make an opinion for themselves.
I agree with this statement, because I think young children could get irrealistic views of the world if they watch advertisements in TV, for example like the one in which a person tries to stick their thongue into a ventilator just because he`s bored, if a children would watch this, it might would also try it and this could have a bad end.
For us, the television advertising is about unimportant things and just boring, but no one really knows how it affects children, the stuff they see in TV could be really important for them and if they see those things it could affect their thinking.
In general, the children are easily going to believe what is said in those advertisements because they can`t make a diffrence between what is real and what is unreal and just acted for the advertisement because every child is kind of naiv.
It could be that they react totally excited about a product they`ve seen in an advertisement, which isn`t as good as they thought it would be when they finally get it and then be extremely disgusted and sad?
Television advertising tries to makes us buy things we see in there.
I think it isn`t good for children, especially if they are in such a low age, to see all those things they could own in an advertisement, because they going to want them as soon as possible.
In my opinion, we should concentrate on the things we have and learn the children to be happy about those things and not get them to want everything they see in those advertisements.
I`m against television advertising toward young children because it could affect their thinking.
What I have to say first, is, that it heavily matters on the way and type of advertisement.
As soon as a kid turns on the television, the are loads of different influences that flow into the childs subconciousness, without even knowing it.
There is a clear difference between toy advertisement of the newest LEGO or barbie product, and for example advertisement for guns and weapons.
A difficult question to this statement appears: Can the children make out the difference between these two advertisements?
From my point of view, a child cannot handle these influences, on one hand because it is too young to understand it anyway and on the other hand because it cannot even buy it.
So, how should a kid which is only two to five years old react to its environmental demands?
The most difficult part of this statement, is that the children are getting influenced and they cannot understand it.
If I was a child, how would I handle this?
Would I just go to a shop after watching television, and buy the latest computer?
I guess the answer to this sarcastic question is obvious.
But then the question arises: Why do they then make this advertisement if they do not get new clients?
Foe me it is clear, that the easiest way of going onto a childs mind is by influencing their subconciousness.
When they see advertisement, even though they do not react to it, it clearly changes their way of thinking over a long period.
Now, back to the question, should it be forbidden, to show children, aged two to five, advertisement?
I think it should not.
There shall be programs which are only for children, where the advertisement is made for childrens eyes and ears.
With that, a kid can stay a kid and is not forced to see things, which it can't handle.
It would be easier for sure, to just forbid all the advertisement directed to kids, but what if their parents watch television.
They will sit next to them and also see it, So there is no perfect solution for this discussion, but stricter regulations can help to ensure the childs mind.
At the end I have to say, that when I was a child, I also watched television, and as long as you watch the children programs, there are no heavy advertisements.
In my opinion, it is already handled quite well, so there is no need for a big change.
Advertising is a must nowadays.
Everyone does it ,even the smallest shop, if they want to have costumers.
On tv adults and teenager get annoyed when their favorite film is ruined by a tv comecial, but one agegroup does not get annoyed by it,kids.
Kids are easy to be manipulated and thats exactly how many companies earn their money.
Whenever a kids sees an add for a specific toy, they want it.
Usually many of them cry and beg their parents to buy them, what they have seen .
We one would analyse those tv avertisment , on could see how many steoreotypes are in those comercials.
Kids from this generation grow up with the thought of being and buying the things, that girls or boys their age should be or buy.
Televison advertising towards kids between the age of two to five are in my opinion both good and bad.
On the one hand kids and parents can learn about new toys that come out.
This is really helpful for the parents,when for example their kids birthday in soon and they don't know what to get them.
Some of the new produced toys are cool and really handy.
On the other hand kids get manipulated by the stereotypes.
The companys often create comercial that would capture the kids heart.
Girls get pink Barbies and boy get cars with a machine gun on top.
The kids then start to want things that are usually for their own sex.
Girls only want barbies and boys want cars, because of those comercials.
They see those kid actors on the tv who should represent the typical gril or boys, with their typical toys.
For example, my younger sister who is know 4, loves cars and also has some dols.
In school some kids say that she is not acting like she should , as a girl because he likes cars.
All those kis start to judge at a young age because after their show end the add starts, without them knowing.
Parents also suffer from those advertisment, because they realize late that their kids were raised by stereotypes.
To sum it all up, I think that television adversting should not be banned for kids (aged two to five), if the companies start to use adverstinsment without stereotypes.
Girls and boys could play with car ,if only they would let them.
That would help the world to stop stereotyping each other and me us more accepting.
The media nowadays has huge power.
In almost every household there is a television, a smartphone, a tablet and a computer.
We are surrounded by these technologies and have contact with them every day.
Of course, companies are going to take advantage of that fact and try to sell us their product by advertising it as much as possible.
Especially the television advertisment has a big impact, because there are a lot of advertisment breaks.
Since many young children aged two to five are watching TV and in these young years believe everything they are told, companies will try to influence them as much as possible and direct the advertisment towards them.
Therefore, the question comes up wether to allow television advertising directed toward young children or ban it.
There are reasons for and against the ban.
Firstly, children aged two to five are easy victims when it comes to believing what they are told.
They believe everything they are told, because they do not have life experience and, therefore, do not know that they could be lied to.
Since they do not have enough experience to think about wether something is right or wrong, they should not be exposed to television advertising.
Secondly, the uncouncious is taking up a lot of information without us knowing it.
Children that are watching TV therefore take up all the information they are told or they see by the advertisment in their uncouncious system and are influenced later on by it.
Television advertising directet to these young children schould be baned for this reason.
Thirdly, the companies have a right to sell their product.
Therefore, they should be allowed to sell it to whoever they want.
Every person should decide for themselves wether to buy teh product or not.
That is a reason to allow television advertising also toward young children.
All in all, there are more reasons against it.
In my opinion, it should be baned.
Young children should be protected since they can not protect themselves yet
Television advertising is a mighty  of companies.
They use it to gain the attention from customers and to raise needs in them the didn't knew they had before.
Pretty much every company uses them.
Young Children can be manipulatet really good and I think this statement is grounded in this fact.
But I would say that young children can be manipulatet really good but that older people can be manipulatet really good als well but they don't want to see it.
For example:
A young boy sees an advertise on television and likes what he sees.
He goes to his parents and sais them that he wants to have this.
A mature man sees an advertise on television and likes what he sees.
He doesn't go to his parent but he keeps this thing in mind and later when he walks through the store he tends to buy it.
A young child doesent has the money to buy stuff.
So it can only go to his parents and ask them for what it wants.
In my opinion parents have the responsibility to look for their child and to decide wether something is good for it or not.
So it lays in their responsibility to be able to say no.
I would say it should be allowed like every edvertise for other ages is allowed.
If it would be banned, then all the others should be banned as well.
    From the passed century, one of the most used inventions in western societies and elswhere must be the tv.
This picture-feeding box has gained a cultural status to the point that almost every household owns at least one.
What started mute and with black and white images evolved after a long time into full HD flatscreen television.
But something that didn't take an equally long time to settle itself among the standard program were avertisements.
The question now is wether or not such ads are appropriatly viewed by the younger generation of tv-watchers.
Television can turn out to be useful for unexperienced parents, because when such parents have trouble to find a timetable that includes watching the baby seven days a week as well as enjoying their time off and doing their work, they put the child in front of some children show.
The child will most likely stay there and the parents can enjoy some time off.
Should tv get forbidden for children of the from two to five, this can't be done.
Furthermore, the people behind the ads can too easily make use of these children being still young and naive.
They can take a certain toy and make it seem extremely fun for the targeted audience and suddenly the child knows what it wants for christmas, eastern, its birthday and whatever else.
Watching tv in general bad for the development of an every child's brain, that alone could be a reason to forbid tv at all.
And like that the answer is met.
Such a young audience is way too young to be set out to manipulative advertising that wants their parents money.
And in my opinion, children that young shouldn't watch tv
There are many pro-arguments for this statement but also a lot of contra-arguments, so its necessary to look at them.
Without a doubt, its not good when people watch TV too often, so that they are every minute in front of the screen.
Its necessary to controll the amount of time you spend to watch Television.
Children aged two to five cant really regulate the time so that they could spend a lot of time in just staring into the screen to watch cartoons.
They could become a very bad Televison habit, so when they are older they cant get away of watching TV.
The worst case scenario is that the human dont even leave the living room and dont really care about the own health.
In the other point of view, its important to watch Television to learn about the technology.
We are in the 21. century, so technology is a huge part of our life.
a TV is nowadays a basic thing in a house or an apartment.
We have to deal with these things because its ussual today.
The earlier we learn about these things the better we can handle these kinds of stuff when we are older.
There are many kids series whre you can interact with the cartoon caracter, to learn the numbers for example.
They can learn a whole bunch of stuff while watching a listening to these programms.
In my opinion it Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, because I think its important to get in contact with the technology in the earlier years.
Like I said, there are many good learning series for kids.
But the time should be regulated, so the children dont watch TV too much.
I think about a half a hour a day shold be ok.
Young people are in a stadium, where they are growing.
All the parts of their body is growing.
If the child looks television in his first tree years, that has a negative effect for his growing, his eyes etc.
If the child does not look television in his first years, everything is good.
There is a reason, why a lot of people aren't agree that children can watch television when they are a baby.
In the first years, the child should think and imagine in his own why and shouldnt look television.
If the child looks television, he does not have to think.
Thinking on his own way is a good exercise.
If the child looks television he loses important time.
In this time, he could play with other babys which is more important than watching television.
when i have a baby, my baby isn not allowed to watch television in his first tree years of his life.
In this time, he should look on pictures of a book or should play with soft balls or something like that.
In conclusion i am agree that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
To ban all television advertising directed to children this age you would have to prove that such advertisement harms them.
Otherwise I don't see a problem why it shouldn't be allowed.
Children that age are already able to watch television and understand what is being shown.
There are many shows on TV directed towards children aged two to five.
Of course advertisement is a bit different than kid's shows but the idea is still the same.
Especially when the advertisements look just like or are even about TV shows for young children.
Although the children cannot purchase the products shown in the commercials themselves they can ask their parents if they are allowed to have it.
Many may argue that airing advertisement for kids can be annoying for parents and spoil the children but I don't see how this does any long-term damage to the children.
The commercials should be reviewed by experts so it is made sure that they are acceptable for children.
As long as the advertisements do not promote bad things for example violence I don't see a problem with them being shown on TV.
They could even promote toys with learning effects.
I think television advertisement should be allowed as long as it has been reviewed.
I do agree with the following statement even though I do not think that so young and juvenile kids would understand the television advertising.
They are too young to know what they want and they would not realise that people just want to sell things.
But they do not know what is important in life.
They have no idea that they will not need the things the may want now in the future.
So tv advertising would catch them.
Kids do have too many things and plays anyway.
They do not need hundrets of plays.
They can not use everything at the same time.
Parents and friends should not waste so much money on toys just because they can not tell their kids that the things they have seen in television are not necessairy.
In addition to that kids should not watch so much television in that age.
They also should not have got so much money to buy things with.
In that age the kids should be playing on the street with other children.
The parents who are going to buy the stuff they have to buy should see the advertising, and only them.
Childs are not mature and wise enough to decide what they really need.
They may react angry when they do not get what they want.
This problem could be solved if they were not seeing the television advertising.
"Get away from the television, Sarah!
", "It's not directed towards children aged 4, Thomas!".
Sentences parents often use whilst their children watch television.
But meanwhile, with the brightened up technologies nowadays, there are a lot of parents who teach their kids the controvers.
Sentences like: "Watch, and learn."
or even "Get yourself infront of the television and be quiet for at least an hour."
In the following main part I'm going to discuss this theme a bit.
Watching television is a much more complex theme nowadays than hardly ever expected.
Whilst watching television we are able to receive informations.
We are even able to learn something such as cooking, baking and much more.
There are even kids-shows, especially for teaching some life-skills, rules or how to draw an elephant for example.
Whatever it is, it is sometimes useful.
But if parents let their children on their own, their able to switch the channel and watch a crime scene or whatever.
So I think it's important that parents watch after their kids.
Watching television also depends on the duration.
Eyes of children are still learning, and could get "injured".
So parents should set up a time-limit per day.
But in the end it's everyones own choice.
In my own opinion children aged newborn to five shouldn't watch televison at all.
There are so many more intelligent activities to get done.
In the first five living years children are able to learn much faster and much more intensive then ever after.
We should teach them to speak on our own and not by television, in our own words and technics.
We should show them as many animals as possible, for example in a zoo.
We should show them our beautiful nature and fresh air.
It's all much more important than showing them how to turn on a tv.
In conclusion; everybody has to find their own balance between their kind of teaching their kids, and however they should grow up.
Nowadays many children like to spend their time in front of a television or like to watch something with their parents.
It's normal that while you are watching a show or a movie an advertising shows up.
There are many advantages and disadvantage of television advertising, especially for young childern in age of two or five years.
But are advertisings in the television bad for young children?
Should our country permitts television advertising towards young children?
Let's explore the pro and cons!
First of all, let's take a look at the advantage.
Television advertising is a good way to show the children something new.
So the children can see new things and are able to learn something new.
On the other side, there are also disadvantages.
When a advertising shows up, it's mostly an advertising of toys and dolls and other stuff children likes.
The children are young and really likes to play with toys and also wants to get the toys they are interested in.
So the television advertising gives the children the opportunity to discover new toys and so the have the urge to get this toy.
Because parents like to make their children happy they buy them new stuff.
However, in my opinion children shouldn't generally spend their time in front of a television.
The advertising is also bad because it influences the children and so the have the urge to get some new toys.
In a way it manipulates the children and grows the desire to have some new stuffs, which not all parents can afford.
Children in this age do like watching TV.
But they don't know if it's good or not.
And that depends on the programm they watch.
There are huge differences between the series.
I wouldn't watch horrorfilms with a five years old child.
But I think they can and should watch programms like "Sandmann".
Or in the age of five or older they can watch series which teach you something.
But that's nothing for a two years old child.
The most impotrant decision the parents have to make is the timeperiod in which their children are allowed to watch TV.
A young human being shouldn't watch TV for a long time in a row.
It's better for them to watch several times a day but always just for an half an hour or less.
It also depends on what the children do when they are not watching TV.
If they are outside playing it's more normal that they are allowed to watch TV because they did enough sports and they had fresh air.
But if they are at home during the hole day to play video games or something like this, then it's not healthy for them.
Maybe the parents don't realise it when their child is that young but I would say that it can effect the life of a child.
An other problem is that the children can relax while they are watching TV.
They didn't do enough sport during the day and that's why they aren't tired at night.
So they can not sleep that well and that long.
My opinion is that children can watch TV.
But it has to be a programm for children and it needs to be during a realistic timeperiod.
And the most important point for me is that every child needs to go outside to play to have a healthy life.
The parents need to have keep the controle over the TV and the programm which their child is watching.
Should television advertising directed to young children be forbidden?
In this time, children of young ages already watch television.
Mostly because the parents want to have a "quiet minute" or the kids just cry or scream to get what they want.
When they are watching tv, often nobody is supervising them, so they get in contact with everything which is showed.
Days later they maybe want their mom to buy this delicious chocolate snack or the talking doll, which the advertising showed in the best possible way to impress children.
There are even psychologist, which are looking for this best way.
Children in this young ages are very naive; they don't really care about the prize, the healthiness or the usefullness.
If the other child in the advertising has fun with it or if it says that the chocolate snack is very yummy, they spontaneously feel the need for it.
As a consequence of that, they are the best audience to merchandise something.
But is that fair?
The people should be able to do their own decision about buying something or not, but children aren't really able to do that.
On the other side you could say, that the parents do the finishing decision, even if the children are praying to get it the whole day.
Additionally they are responsible of their children watching television.
If they let them, they have to be aware of what is showed and they have to handle the consequences.
In my opinion, it wouldn't be correct to forbid to show such advertising.
Advertising is the most important way for the industry to sell their products.
If they are clever enough to find the best way to sell as many products as possible, they should have success.
When parents decide to let their children watch television, they also decide to let them see the advertising.
And if that influences their children's wishes, they have to be consequent enough, to not buy it, if they don't want to.
Should television advertising toward young children (age: two to five) not be allowed?
Children in the age two to five are easy to influence.
Especially through such strong media as the television.
Kids at this stage want every object the TV ads show them, because it is set in scene perfectly for the demands of such young humans.
This is because the kids associate the toy with the show they are watching before and after the ads.
They think when you're a fan of, for example Bob the builder, you gotta have this toy that always comes before the new episode.
Therefore many people think TV advertising  for kids should be forbidden.
I certainly understand this view, but I also think that it would infringe the capitalism and the free market, if TV ads towards young people were forbidden.
(nice conditional there, isn't it) We have to ask ourselves, whether we want to save the children from being easily steered by big companies, who just want to make as much profit as possible, or if we want them to make the profit, because maybe we can directly or indirectly profit ourselves.
Maybe the father of a child, who wants the new toy from the TV ad, works for an advertisement company and just because the TV spot runs everyday he can make his boy happy and buy this cool new toy.
I partly agree.
Whenever discussing a topic, it is not enough to simply see it as black and white.
For finding a solution that is best for all, we must consider finding it in none of the extremes, therefore the question asked can not be accurately answered, not by me and probably not by a higher percentage of people.
Nevertheless, I will try.
Television is a media that can be accessed by most people in our society, but unlike with other things, we can choose  to see, or not to see what we want on said media.
Of couse, children that are aged between 2 and 5 years old,m do not, or only partly have the abillity to do so, but it lays in the responsibility of their parents to show them, or not show them the content that appears fitting to them.
It is also their responsibility to only let them watch television for a reasonable time period.
Adittionally, children of that age do not have acess to oney, which disables them to buy the advertised things, this also lies in the responsibility of the parents.
To evaluate what, and what not to buy, and to teach teir children that they do not need all things.
On the other side, It may be rather bad for the developement of the children, if from such a young age, the necessity to buy things is pushed uppon.

Today most of the families own a television.
Lot of people watch TV to relax after a long day of working.
But just as adults, young children like watching TV too.
Often there is lot of advertisements during the breaks of a movie or a serie.
The advertisement producer use this to show children nice advertisings of various products.
Therefore, should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) not be allowed?
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
The first reason is that it doesn't make a difference if there aren't any television advertising directed toward young children anymore.
The world of today is full of advertising pictures (plakats) and some websites have lot of advertisings.
In addition, in my opinion young children are often bored about advertisings.
I know from my childhood that I was very bored about television advertising, even it was about chocolate or barbie dolls (which I really liked).
So children don't even look precisely at the advertisement.
Also, young children learn how to react to advertisements.
Advertisements are not just unuseful, they show us new things and learn us to be critic with everything in the world.
In conclusion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, beacause it doesn't really make a difference if it were not be allowed, in the world there are lot of advertisings and they aren't really interested in it.
But in fact it isn't that easy for a child to learn to be critic with the world, especially when nobody told him that he should be critic with it.
So maybe, a bit more interesting question is how to learn children to be critic with advertisings.Maybe the school could teach i
Television advertising, wich is directed towards young children, should not be allowed.
Television advertising is actually a very smart thing.
They are made in a very smart way to make you buy things, even tought you probably do not need them.
Especially young children are very naive.
One can manipulate them very easily.
Young children do not know anything about smart shopping, about what to buy and what to not buy.
When a child sees a toy in a televisions advertising, it does not think twice.
The child does not make any toughts about the use or the quality of the toy.
A young child probably does not even understand words like quality and use.
Television advertising has no other use than making people buy things.
It does not show one anything usefull.
Television advertising is using young childrens naivity.
The people who make these television advertisings know ecsactly that young children would want to buy anything they see on television.
They know that as soon as a child wants something, it is going to annoy their parents till it gets what it wants.
And the parents kind of do not have another choice, than to buy their children what they want.
So moraly it is not okey to use the naivity of a young child.
And most improtantly television advertising is a huge way of propaganda and also a huge waste of time.
People and young children are forced into watching television advertising, because the television advertising always shows up in the middle of a movie or tv show.
Personally, I think television advertising towarts little children should not be allowed, because it is not fair or right to manipulate and trick them into buying things.
I agree with this statement because I think that media in general influences children at a way to young age.
A good example to show this are gender and body images.
Seeing all these beautiful people in commercials can tell children a complete wrong opinion on how to see themselves in comparison to others.
Children can't see the difference between real life and television.
They are easy targets for marketing companies because of their not knowing what is real and what isn't.
Marketing companies have made this to their use with influencing young children to make them want something or to let them have their opinion about certain things that they will want to have or are tellingin the future.
For example a child doesn't care much about its body and how it looks put as soon as children are in puberty they start questioning if they're pretty or tall or skinny enough because the have had all these images on the television.This can lead into depression or mental diseases like anorexia or bulimia.
You could say on the other hand that children are anyway not supposed to watch television at a young age but if their is a lone mom with a fulltime job there isn't always timeto entertain your children and so at a lot of households tvs are on the daily routine.
It is also that children are represented very badly in tv commercials in gender aspects.
Girls always wear pink and red dresses and have bows in their hair and are supposed to put on make up on a barbie's face.
Boys on the other side are wearing blue and playing with playmobil dragons and knights and have their little racing cars.
Children should be able to play with the toys the like and not with the ones for their gender.
But most of the time the children just get their toys from their parents, which have been influenced by television and media as well.
So in the end there is not much you can do exept trying to explain to your child how the real world is working and telling them to listen to themselves and not to anything from the black screen.
I don't think it's correct or even acceptable of medias trying to influent the mind of such young children since they can't understand what's happening on TV and why they're being showed those toys or the other stuff that seems to be really awesome to them.
The only thing they know now is just that they really want to own what they saw on TV and if their parents wont buy them what they want they will probably get sad about it.
This could possibly lead to a dissorted way of their consume-behaviour later in their lifes.
So it would be the right thing to stop allowing television advertising directed toward young children, wouln't it?
On the other hand I think it comes down to be the parents' responsibility to look after their children and I also don't think it's alright that such young minds who can get influented so easily should spend their time in front of the television since they should be playing outside or with their friends and family.
Furthermore, watching TV this early can easily lead to an addiction towards TV's and Smartphones and gadgets like that when they're a little bit older since those are things that comforted them ever since they were little.
In conclusion, I don't think that television advertising toward children should be forbidden or even illegal.
I reckon that children this age shouln't even be watching television.
Because if the parents won't allow their kids to spend so much time watching TV anymore, there won't be anyone left watching all those commercials.
Television adertising is a normal thing in our society.
But should it be towards young children?
The opinions are different if it should be allowed or not.
Why should you have advertising for anyone else than for these kids?
And why exactly during this age?
If the product is for this age you have to advertise it in this group of children.
They have to see it and not the children in other ages because they maybe can't relay to that anymore.
Critics say that the parents should see the advertise because they are the ones who have to by the stuff.
So there isn't the need for the adcvertising because the kids are to young to by susch things.
If the children see the product, for example a teddybear, they always go to their parents and ask for it.
Maybe it could stress them and it is nerving.
Lastly, the kids during this age should not sit in front of the TV that much.
It is not good for them.
They should go out and see the world.
I think, as a mother of a child i would be against television advertsising but as a person who tries to sell things for the children in this age I can understand, that it is important and it should be allowed.
Television advertising directed toward young children is a controvers topic.
As it is proved, that young children are more capable of learning new stuff quickly, they take every new information or advert like if they were a sponge.
Because of this ability, it is very easy for television advertisers to convince young children towards getting their new toy or something else.
Furthermore, a lot of parents don't have the control on the time their child is sitting in front of the television as letting them watch TV is an easy way of keeping their child quiet.
And children just stay watching TV if they don't get interrupted.
Thanks to this, it is very easy to influence the children threw an advertisemt.
But how should young children be informed on new toys, films or new outdoor activities?
Television advertisements have become very popular in recent years due to the long time of people spend watching television and the abilities of the television beeing pictures with sound.
If young children won't be informed by new stuff over the television, threw where then?
They mostly don't own a smartphone and are able to check on new releases immediately.
Television advertisements for young children is in that sense a superb way of them getting new informations.
In my opinion it depends on what is advertised for.
If it is just a new toy, a outdoor activity or even a new way of expanding their horizon advertised for I believe it can be a outstanding way of advertising.
But as soon as the advertisement is manipulating the child in the slightest, as maybe an advertisement towards a political party or, as I like to call it, "adult stuff", television advertisements aren't helpful for young children and should be forbidden.
As I mentioned in the beginning, television advertising toward young people is a controvers topic and even I don't have a clear opionen as "yes" or "no".
Television advertisisng directed toward young children

Most television advertisements are directed toward adults, so they will go to the store and buy these things.
Although we do somethimes tend to get inflouenced by these advertisments, most of the time we just ignore them and hope they are over soon.
However can young children do the same?
Having your children see television advertisments could save some time, because they have already seen what there is to buy and would not still have to look at everything in the store.
At the same time, it might make the children more annoying, since they might not be able to ignore the advertisments and get inflouenced by them and want to have the things they advertise more than if they would only see the packaging in the store.
It also helps not having to explain to the children what a certain thing does, because they have already seen the advertisement and know what the toy, or whatever was advertised can do.
Personally I believe that television advertising should be allowed, since it is another way the children learn, that they cannot have everything they want.
Plus they learn to ignore the unuseful things in life like for example advertising.
Television advertising is growing.
Nearly every day a new serie come up.
And sometimes they are directed towards young children (aged two to five).
This leads us to the question of the essay.
Should television advertising towards young children be allowed?
To answer the question I will use a new question: Are the children aible to realize that the television advertising is directed to them?
I think in the age of two to three the children would not get this.
They are too young to realize that this kind of advertising is directed to them.
I mean I do not remember that I watched TV when I was three years old.
But I remember that in the age of four i watched Teletabies.
So I think we can say that the children till the age of three do not realize that TV advertising is directed to them.
So for this age you do not have to ban television advertising.
But for the age from four to five it is diffrent.
There I think you have to ban it because in this age they make big developpments and TV is not helpfull.
And if the television advertising is directed towards them, they will want to watch TV again and again.
For example: There is this TV serie Sandmännchen.
I watched it sometimes but I remeber that some of my friends watched it nearly every time.
They have to watch it to be aible to go to bed.
And this fact does not help in your developpment right?
So in the age from to five a ban makes sense.
Finally I want to remark that watching TV in this age (from two to five) can cause brain damages.
Because the sound and the picture are not at the same time.
And for the kids, who have to learn the language it is very important that the sound and the moving of the lips is at the same time.
Otherwise they can not learn the language as good.
So I think in generally that it should not be allowed to direct TV advertising towards young children.
In conclusion, I think that children at the age from two to three are not aible to realize that the advertising is directed towards them.
But the children in the age from 4 to 5 get this and it eeffects
One reason for that television advertising should not be allowed is, that the children learn diffrent words.
When the young children watch TV, they make something what support the brain and they learn diffrent things about the world and what's  gat the moment.
But in contract, when the young children watch TV, they learn words like diffrent cars, Nivea or others...
This words don't support the childrens communication, because in one way they learn words, which aren't necessary in this age and in an other way they learn an other language.
For example the swiss childrens are watching TV in an other language and so they don't learn swissgerman.
And so, the children speak a language that isn't only one language, but a mix of maybe two ore tree.
In case of this they say some words german and some words swiss german.
In an other view, this young children should go outside in spite of watching television, because in the nature they learn more than in front of TV.
A next point is that children from two to five don't understand what the peopel in de advertise say.
Maybe the children learn words and things, which isn't useful or maybe things and words, that are not allowed in our "world".
An next thing is that this children could make something with other childrens, witch has the same age like them and so also the same niveau.
This would more support the growth of their life in case of watching movies and advertises.
I think that television advertising should be allowed, because this young humans don't unterstand all this things and I think that in this time, in there they watch Tv, they could make better things, like going outside or make somethings whit other childrens.
Should televosion advertising be forbidden for young children?
Every day we see television and we have fun.
Would it  we learn with TV

A reason, why televison advertising should be forbidden toward children, is that children should have a good relationship to their teacher.
The most important reason, why advertising should be allowed toward children, is that they like watch TV, so they can learn better.
This little text is about my opinion about the statement that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
I totally agree with this statement, because children at a very young age don`t know what is good or bad.
They cannot decide what is better for them or worse for them.
Even the law says that children under the age of 8 years cannot be punished from doing an illegal action, because they are to young to judge.
The adverts show funny or happy thing in connection with the product in the advert.
So children think that this product is good and they want to have it.
However I think that this will never happend, because you cannot control what young children see.
In the internet children can search and find what there want, because there are no age restrication.
That is a big problem and a reason why television advertising directed towards young children will never be banned.
Even on the streets and big cities are filled with adverts.
Not all are directed towards young children but also the adverst for adults can influence young children.
All in all I demand the government to not allow television advertising directed towards young childern, because of the reason that childer at a very young age don`t have a judgment about things being good or bad.
So today we have commercials about everything for everybody but is it correct to make commercials for "young childrens"?
I mean it isn't allowed to make commercials about ciggarettes and tabaco bacause of the children so why should we make commercials only for children?
I agree the whole television/commercial industry are doing a litle bit of "propoganda" for there products or TV shows', wich penetrade your way of thinking about things, but young chidrens aren't very sensitiv about such things.
But how often are commercials directed to such young childrens?
I mean every commerical on channels like nickelodeon or super RTL are directed to children and whats the problem about am LEGO commercial?
Maybe they need to know wich playmobil they're going to wish for their birthday.
Clearly they could go to store but parents woud never let them go alone and maybe don't have time for such things.
I personally can't imagine a scenario, wich such commercials could harm or influence a child.
In my point of view it isn't the young children.
No.
its the children between 10-13 years because they start to think and refelct thing they see.
they haven't enough education to analsye things.
So I don't have point why they should prohbit avertising to young children.
More and more young children are sitting in front of the television.
They are looking their favorite serie or film, after 20 minutes the first 10 minutes of promotions starts.
A little child with his mother in a supermarket, he sees a big green toy, mother i want this toy!
And what a surprise the toy is sale just 99.99, but just for a week.
So the effect for the young children in front of the television.
who also likes the toy is that he quickly will have this toy too.
First of all in the age from two to five children are very effected from the sociality, if they are advertising directed from the televison, they start believing what they say.
When the television shows that we all have super power and we all can fly, we just need to put out theit arms, they do it and then fall down.
It should be the work of the parent how they grow up their child and not from the television.
Secondly the television has a big influence on youn children.
When a child sees something that he likes he really want it, that could be a big problem for they parents.
Maybe they haven't so much money to buy every week new stuff for their children.
But when children don't get what they want, they are sad and agry.
Thirdly in this age children shouldn't be advertising directes from the television.
They are in age where they should go out to learn, play with other kids.
This experiences are more important than stuff from the television.
They should make their experiences by them selves and not teached by the televison.
For these reasons i'm agree that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowe
Electronic rules the world.
More and More people are connected to electronic stuff such as the mobile phone and television and can't live without it anymore.
By now children, aged two to five, are on the television every day a couple of hours.
But should we really allow television advertising toward young children, aged two to five?
There are a couple of reasons why this shouldn't be allowed.
For example it is proofed that through too much television people can get dumber, because they forget to do important things like reading or learning and thi is a problem.
The most Important argument is, tht these yong children don't need this yet.
childhood is a time where you go out with friend and have fun and play ball or something else.
Not about staying at home all day long watching television.
Childhood is an awesome time so don't take this away from your kids!
On the other side television can improof your brain in a good way.
Through television kids have more ideas how to do something and it can also improve their knowledge, depending on what they are watching.
Galileo for example always shows very good stuff and you can really learn from this.
My personal opinion it's, that kids that age should be allowed to watch television but not more than half n hour per day.
Maybe one hour on the weekend.
I think it is important that those kids need to learn first how to grow up without this stuff.
Electronic stuff will come into their lifes early enough so let them enjoy their chilhood without electronic stuff such as television.
yes I agree with this statement.
I think the social communication gets lost with the television.
I think it is very important for a children to play outside or searching friends.
You can't do this while watching television.
It could be very stressful for the parents to seperate the childrens from the television.
I think a children gets influenced very easely.
So it is very problematic when the children gets influenced by the television.
I think also that to much television are damaging the eyes of the childrens.
So if televesion advertisising directed toward young children did not exist, less childrens would have problems with there eyes.
So in conclusion I think that it should not be allowed to advertisise television directed toward young children because of the bad influence it can have on the children, the problems of the eyes that can produced by watching to much television.
Television for young children

In this essay I will explain some reasons why young children should not be allowed to watch television an at the end my personally opinion to this important subject.
Nowadays a lot of children, aged two to five, often watch a film with their family in their young life and waste a lot of time with movies or series.
They can also go out and play with their friends or do something else but not watching television.
It is not good for the brain generally.
The concentration will not be there in the school too.
This can lead that young children can not get good marks, so their future will be in danger.
A very worse time is coming to them!
Antother reason is that this kids do not have the motivation to do their homeworks, make new friendships or even help their mother to do the household chores.
However, I find that children should not be allowed to watch television in their young life.
Although I have also wasted a lot of time when I was young.
My parents did not take care of me and thought that the television was good for children.
They let me always to do my own thing what was definitely a fault!
I learned for my life that the television is abad idea for young children and I would never to the same thing to my kids in future.
I want that my kids should have good marks and study for themselves, and not ruin their life with television.
Nowadays, television has become to a need of todays society.
It is used for entertaining, for Information and also for advertising.
Television advertising is directed more and more toward young children.
But should it be allowed to direct television advertising toward such young children?
First of all, children in that age do not know yet what they really want and need.
They want all of this stuff they see in advertising.
This is all a strategedy of the companies to force the parents to buy their children what they think they want.
They use the children to gain a lot more money.
This could be seen as unmoral.
On the other side, today it is all just about buisiness.
Where would we be without it?

Essay

In this essay I write about television advertising directed toward young children.
I will explain some pros and cons to the statement, which was given us above.
In my opinion there is nothing wrong when young children watch television.
I think when they want to watch their serie in the evening to slow down it is a good oppertunity to show them how to come along with the new medias.
Nowadays watching television is maybe the most normal thing.
It is copmarable with other things which where unacceptable for children a few years ago but now have got a normal thing.
But I am glad, that I could not watch TV al the time when I was young.
Because I think children learn more in the real world and it is important for children to play a lot an have friends with whom they can have adventures.
Also watching television in asbolutely not necessairy.
Especially not for children aged two to five.
They have to learn that the life is not about TV stars and shows but more about friends and living its own life.
If they are to often confronted with such things they can get aggressive and unsociable.
So my own children will have a fix, short time when they are allowed to watch what is good for them.
In conclusion watching television has both pros and cons.
In my opinion it is more about the question how long and what they are allowed to watch.
Nowadays, you find a TV in almost every living room and often also in the bedroom.
Instead of going outside and playing with friends, they rather sit inside infront of the TV and watch some stupid series or play a game.
This makes it very easy for concerns selling toys to directly place their adverts in the children's head.
I guess almost every parent was at least once confronted with the problem, that the child wanted to have a certain toy and it didn't get it.
But is that the fault of the concerns or are te parents itself to blame for this human-caused problem?
It is proofed by many studies, that TV adverts influence and this is not only a problem of the adults.
Also children are influenced by TV adverts and this causes a new level of social inequality.
I mean, if your child goes out with friends and this friend has the toy every child always sees in the TV.
It becomes kind of the "must have" for children.
And if you as a parent don't buy this toy, the child only knows because of TV adverts, in the worts case, the child will get bullied just because it doesn't have this toy.
And this for, from my point of view, a very big problem.
But on the other hand, can you really say that the concerns are to blame for this.
Isn't this problem caused by the parents and that they never have time to play with their children.
It's easy for them to sit the child in front of the TV.
So I think, before you start judgeing others for their work, you should wonder, why it even got this far.
If the parents would go outside with their children and play with them, they wouldn't watch TV so often and so, partially the problem is solved.
Another point I'd like to bring up is that nowadays it's the only efficient method to bring toys to the children.
How else should the concerns show their new products if the children are always inside and only watching TV.
If you really think about it, you can't say that only the parents are to blame for that nor can you say, that only the concerns are to blame.
It's like the cicle of the devil.
As far as I can say, you should not forbid TV advertising toward young children.
For me the best solution would be, if you reduce this kind of adverst and instead start working with the parents to show them, that it is important to play with their children.
Towadays we have become used to seeing advertisements everywhere, especially on television, and as adults we are aware of their abilities to seduct one.
But what about children?
Considering their limited comprehesion of the objective of advertisments, should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
First and foremost, a child does not have the ability to understand that advertising is just a means to sell a product and can therefore be strongly influenced by advertisements.
Advertisments usually instill the notion that one cannot be content without a certain product, thus resulting in the child beig unhappy if it does not obtain it.
Another argument agaist television advertising is that children are being conditioned to aquiring a consumtionist's life style, where having a few toys is not enough and children keep wanting more of what they already have.
It is this mind set that is destroying our environment and is being supported by advertisments directed towards children.
Moreover, recent studies have shown that the average child watches one hour of television a day, which prooves that especially advertisements on television can have a huge negative impact on our offspring.
All in all, television advertisments directed toward children can influence them strongly considering that they are easy to manipulate at such a young age.
Advertisments can lead to a child's unhappiness and have a negetive impact on our environment.
Yesterday my parents and me metted  a friend  from us in a cafe.
So we began to speak.
The person said it should not be allowed to give the young children so much of television advertising .
My mother tought different and then they began to discuss.
Should television advertising to young children be allowed or not?
There is always advertising in TV.
There is some for old people and theres some for young people.
The guy who wants to sell the things they produced realised that children are easy to manipuate.
So the children wants to have these things.
There are many people who think, that this is bad for the children but the children are growing up and they have always advertise in TV.
So if the children begin wth it young they have later no problems, because they know how to life with it.
On the other side could children get manipulated by this and this could be bad for the mental growing of them.
But if the parents look for their children and do not let them just in front of TV this should not be a problem.The children could get real damage from this and get many sicknesses ot this.
By the time i was in his age i looked as good as never tv.
I think the parents should play with theyr kids or give them real things to play with it and do not let them sit in front of tv.
So the childs have not a advertising problems.
Then these children who have this problems would have other mental problems because theiy parents.
So the key are the parents.
The modern television, the gateway to all our daily information that we use almost everyday.
Wether it is a drama, movie, new or documenteries, we can all agree on the television can open our eyes to new horizons.
In spite of that, should we allow our young children exposed to televion advertising ?
In my opinion, young children should not be exposed to television advertising as if mind corrupt their innocent minds with inapporiate content.
The reason is that certain televiosn advertisiments might display inapproiate messages such as exploiting the bodys of women and dangerous acts that the children might follow.
For example, children might saw an advertisement showing men doing rock climbing, thus prompting him or her to immitate their actions and ultimately hurting themselves.
Secondly, children watching too much television and television advertisment might get violent when they grow up as some television commercials depict violence as something cool and manly to childrens.
They might end up growing up with that mind sets and grow up, becoming a bully in school as they think that the act of bullying is the sign of manliness and cool and others might think of the same way.
Thirdly, young children should engage more in physical activities as play with their friends as that helps the childern to learn how to socialize with others better.
Also, due to childern constantly sitting indoors watching televion, their health might degrade and might lead to obesity during a young age and might unable to sociallize with others in school well.
Furthermore, due to more television commercials showing taking drugs or smoking associated with manliness and it is the mainstream of things, childern might end up taking drugs to let other kids know that they are the 'cool kids' in school.
This can lead to disatrous consequence as they might lead to increase of social problems such as drug addicts.
Further more, they also might end up with robbery as they cannot afford the drugs because they are too expensive for them to afford.
Next, children who grow up watching television and commercials might have worse eye sights compared to those who do not grow up with television.
This is because long exposure to the light emited by the screen of the television can end up damaging the delicate nerve cells in young childern's eyes and they are forced to wear glasses at a young age while this problem is usually found at the elderly age.
Last but not least, watching too much television might end up with addiction.
certain television shows are shown at the same time everyday, for example a series of cartoons.
That will cause the children to want more and in turn, causing them to be addicted to television and will stop at nothing in order to watch thier favourite shows.
For example, a young childern might start to cry and whine because they are not allow to watch their favourite show and will not stop until they get to see them.
In conclusion, as convinient as it is to just let children watch televion everyday, in my opinion, it is better to let children to go out and enjoy the sunshine and play with others.
I find it better that to let children be themselves and let them explore the world without the use of televion until they are able to differenciate what is right and what is wrong by themselves so that the wrong message is not imprinted into their innocent minds.
Every time you switch on the television, there is advertise.
But it does not only make adults buy things, it does also influence young children.
Is it fair to bring in this television advertising directed toward young children?
On every chanel on the television companies are making advertise to influence the buying habits of people.
But I think you have to make a difference between adults and children.
Adults often can control themselves, so that they know how to spend money.But when childrem aged two to five see these toys on the television, they mostly want it.
I think advertise is like poison to people, not only to children but to all people.
When you watch television and you see a new perfume or the new summercollection of a brand it makes you think about something you may have never thought about if you have not seen it on television.
But somehow you can either learn to deal with this poison or you can be poisoned, that is something you and your parents decide.
But I also think that the problem is the way advertise is made, is wrong.
Often the actors in the advertise are smiling and they seem to be pretty happy having the product.
So young children automatically think that this thing has to make them even happier.
Then they make their parents buy them stuff, which in some weeks is lying in the back corner and the chilren have only touches it once.
Spoiled children also do not learn how to be creative when they are bored.
I think that the fact how children deal with the advertise has alot to do with how they grew up.
I think that the advertising has both good and bad sides.
It should be allowed because in that way they learn how to deal with it, also when they get older.
So if you learn not to buy everything only because the television say so, you generally do not have problems when you are older.
Television plays a role in almost every child's life.
Also does advertising.
It is always the parent's decision to let the children get to that or not.
Some want it and some don't.
Even if in today's world, it is difficult to protect your child from advertising and even television.
So what are the pros and contras about television advertising?
There could be many reasons, why it should not be allowed to let television advertising get to people at that young age.
It always depends on the
advertisment and that is the important point.
What kind of advertisment is it?
Advertisments that reflect social media often have topics that could be problemating like: sexual content, violence or alcohol/drugs.
These are the things parents often see as dangerous for their children, but for example even a advertisment about healthy eating can influence the child's live massively in a bad way.
Children at that age, believe almost everything, want to know a lot and ask about everything.
Parents who don't let their children watch Television just maybe don't want to confront them with the problems of today's world that early.
How I already said are children at that age very (neugierig).
They want to know more and it that case not only advertisments, but mostly television can be the right.
There are a lot of programms for children all day long, so why shouldn't that be allowed?
They hear and watch stories, cartoons leran new things and it's different from reading books or listening hearing stories.
In my opinion it's barely possible to protect your child from television advertising.
Ban it or just refuse tp do it would be unnecessary, because how I already said, they'll get to it sooner or later.
But what I'm really glad about are television programms for children.
In most cases they are exactly the right thing and influence the child more positive than negative.
I agree with the statement beacuse young children can easely be manipulated by television advertisement.
For example if a young child sees an advertisement in the television about a toy can be much better manipulated as grown people.
Because the television shows the children a world they like to be for example barbie.
And if a young girl in the age of five years see that they insist that the parents buy whatever is shown in  the advertisement.
But I also think that the parents have to protect their children of advertisements.
But I think it would be better when the television advertising directed toward young children would not be allowed.
I think young children can not say what they really want.
One day they want atoy and the next day it isn,t interesting any more.
And I think if it wouldn't have this television advertisement wich is directed toward young children they better know what they really want and don't want a new toy each day.
It is also a problem for parents because they do not know when their child says he want that new toy if he had seen an advertisement and think it's cool to have this toy or he really will play with this toy.
It is also a problem that the adertisement shows the children a unreal world in which they want they get in ant hey think if buy this product they will be in this world.
There are many advertising for toys or other things directed toward young children.
And in many cases the children want to have the advertised stuff.
That's because children are easier to affect and manipulate.
But should it be allowed?
The good thing is that children can have very fun with toys and if the companies advertise their things in television they can see it.
Another reason is that most of the children who are between two to five stay home all day so they can see the advertisment many times per day.
So perhaps a child who is bored wants to watch television and if he sees a toy and his parents buy it to him he is no longer bored and plays with the toy instead of watching TV.
So in this case it would be good to advertise toys.
But on the other side for parents who are really poor this isn't a good thing.
Children want everything and if they don't get it they'll be mad.
And if the parents can't afford it this could really create problems un the family when the young child is crying everytime.
Another contra argument is that children's mind isn't clear as an adults yet.
So they want really everything they see in TV even the unnecessary stuff.
In my opinion it should not be allowed because children are so easy to manipulate with tthe advertisment and for poor parents it could really cause problems.
And the advertisment industry knows how to manipulate people and they will do it without any problem.
Generally I really, from the bottom of my heart, do not like any statement that wants to ban something because I think the greatest treasure we have these days is our freedom to do or not do what ever we want and we already have enough poeple and aswell as laws that want to tell us what to do.
The same can be said for this statement although I have some more arguments especially for this one.
I get that the advertisments could influence the children in a bad way and you might think that because they are so young they can not do anything against this influence, which you are probably right about, if they are alone.
However the point that I want to make is that the parents are responsible for what their children do especially at that young of an age.
That way if the parents allow their kid to watch tv they should accompany them if they think there might be controversial content in whatever their child is watching.
If they do this they can talk about that content, might it be advertismnents or just a topic in the aired programm.
Another thing is that I did not grow up with tv all around me because I didnt feel any need to watch tv until I was probably around 8-10 years old.
Of course this is not regarding movies that I watched with friends or family.
Therefore I think that this is the same for most kids however I do not have any evidence of this and even if it is like that there are for sure exceptions.
In the end my opinion is that these advertiments should not get banned because of personal experience aswell as my opinion that everything about media and advertisment that you can learn so early on is a very valuable lesson for life in modern society.
I also believe that parents should get more responsible again when there children are in contact with modern media.
This statement is wrong because if children get confronted with the danger of advertising really early they could resist them later in life because they know that advertising tries to make you buy something.
Another argument against this statement is that advertising for young children helps to get out of stress before birthdays and Christmas.
Children get inspired from the advertising and so they know what they want for birthday or Christmas.
This helps stressed parents to know their childs wisches.
A third argument against the statement is the fact that advertising influences also adults.
Otherwise do children not know that an advertising tries to influence you.
If they see an advertising they get trapped by it.
Also can't children resist the psychological strengh of advertisings.
And as the third argument children can't build their own opinion about the product because they believe everything the advertising says.
They can't build their opinion because they can't imagine what it means to see a product they once saw in the television.
I think that television advertising directed young children should not be allowed because they aren't able to resist and they haven't got the knowledge to decide whether the product is as it is shown in the advertising or it is diffrent and not as cool as they thought.
Mom, can I watch TV?
A sentence we hear very often nowadays, especially from younger children.
The television is something younger children grow up with.
It's a normal thing thing.
The problem is, that a lot of children get addicted to it.
A huge problem is the addiction of children to the television.
They keap asking to watch tv all the time.
When the parents don't allow it, the kids get angry.
So the parents don't know what to do.
Because they don't want any stress or an annoying child, they allow the television.
The child winns.
After the child watched TV, it probably starts to be angry again because it wants to watch even more TV.
Another fact which speaks against TV advertising directed toward younger children is that they often watch stuff that isn't thought for young children.
They see that beating the others and stuff like that can be a solution.
But it isn't in the real world.
Especially primary teachers can see  what this kind of television does to children.
A thing that isn't that bad is that there are television programs which help children to learn how to read or how to write.
This can be helpful when the kids come to school, they may have less problems in their future.
Another point is that it can be relaxing for the parents when they can sleep a little bit longer on the weekends when the children are watching TV.
It's just important that the parents have the control of what their children are watching.
I think that it would be stupid to just forbid the television for younger children.
Of course it's very important that the children don't end up watching TV all day long.
But I think half an hour in the morning on the weekend is not a problem.
Children just shouldn't watch TV before they go to bed.
They would dream very wild and wouldn't sleep that good.
But I think that the TV as a learning program is a good thing.
Children are probably the agegroup which can be influenced most easily from all people.
They are very curious about new things and eager to learn, even unconciously.
So television advertising is a very smart tool to influence not only their opinion but also the childrens behaviour and personality.
But is it really that smart and what impact does television advertising have on a childs daily life and the development of their childhood?
In TV advertising children learn about new things they haven't encountered before.
They may find out about the different habitat of animals, places in other countries or even new languages.
This is a very easy way to teach children new facts about the world.
So why should TV advertising not be allowed for little kids?
On the other hand, television advertising can also influence children in a bad way.
Because most TV ads are about products, often toys, which only want to be sold for the own profit of companies.
Whenever children see new toys they like on Tv, they want it immediately, because the ads are constructed in way, that people would want to buy it.
So then, children would want every new toy they see on TV because it looks cool, but of course their parents won't buy them every item.
And this will lead to a dispute between the child and parent.
Children at that age don't understand that money doesn't grow on trees.
On top of that, a lot of money could be saved, if television advertising for children would be prohibited.
Instead this money could be invested for example free daycare for children.
In conclusion, I agree with the statement, that TV ads for young children should not be allowed.
I think kids can develop perfectly fine, even without a TV and can grow and discover new things by simply go out and enjoy the nature that has been given to us.
Advertising is a controversial topic.
There are different opinions about what kinds of advertising should be allowed and at what point it should be banned.
For big companies, there are different methods to advertise their products.
One of this method is the television advertising directed toward young children.
In the following I will describe arguments for and against these kinds of advertising.
A first and strong argument for the ban of this kinds of advertising is that the goal of the advertising is to play with a children's feelings.
They give them the feeling that they need something, which, in fact, they do not need.
Children are also not able to understand the goal of advertising like adults do.
From this point of view, the advertising directed toward young children is irresponsible and therefore it should not be allowed.
But there are also arguments for not banning this kinds of advertising.
Even if the children want to buy a product they saw in an advertising, there are the parents who decide if the child can have the product or not.
For children it is also important to learn that they can not have everything they want to have.
In my opinion there is no reason to ban television advertising directed toward young children.
In the end it is the  parents job to teach their children that they can not have everything they want to have.
This is an important lesson in life.
Children who're now aged two to five do not yet have an understanding of the world, of what's going on in it and that the people who advertise their products on TV just want their money (or their parent's money to be exact).
They'll blindly walk into the advertisement's traps and ask their parents over and over again for the "awsome" product that they have seen on television, until they finally say yes.
So I assume you could say that this is basically taking advantage of the children, of their...
I guess "stupidity" (which is kind of a very harsh word for what I want to say) and of their disability to see through the whole system.
The only thing the children know is that they want this toy that they can brag with in front of their friends (which by the way will probably turn out to be not as cool as they thought).
Now while all of that might be true, it is also to be taken into consideration that only their parents would even be able to buy their children the things that they want after having seen these controversial commercials.
So basically I think it is possible to say that even though the kids can't form an opinion and don't know what's going on, their parents will have to do the final step of buying the products which gives them the job of knowing what's going on.
On the other hand, I honeslty don't know why advertising directed towards children is only viewed negatively.
Because, believe it or not, there might actually be useful products that are advertised, and there might actually be honest and genuine people out there who do not only want to abuse the system.
Not all of it should be branded as "bad".
Having thought about all that and knowing, that if it were to be a bad product by bad people who only want to trick children and their parents into buying their stuff, that it would then only be the parent's fault and not the children's, I think I can safely say, that I would not prohibit television advertising for kids, because if you really think about it, the advertisers are not taking advantage of the children, but rather of their parent's disability to say no to them.
A simple question that has a difficulte and complicate answer.
I tend toward the answer that such advetising is extremely harmful for young children.
First of all should a child with that age not even be allowed to watch television.
Because watching television at that age it is dangerous for the development of the language and the logical thinking of a child (as a german study showed).
The results which were published were extremely frightening.
The study showed that children who watched television more than half an hour were more likely to drop out of school and only ten percent of these kids went to universtity whereas children who did not watch television at all (between the age two to five) had a much bigger chance to make it to university.
So watching commercials on TV at that age is automaticly harmful because watching ads includes obviously watching TV.
A reason much more important why advetsing toward children should be forbidden is that young children are more likely to be influenced by ads.
These adverstisments are often very loud and colourful which implifies the need to buy the adverted thing.
A child sees these kind of ads and has automaticly the need to get one of those things.
So you can say that children get influenced easily by these ads.
The decision to want something is made by the concernes which produce the adverted thing, because right at that monent as the child sees the ad it feels the need to get one of the things.
This circumstance is improved by the sound of the ad.
The sound, which is often the voice of a man with a deep and loud voice, is also a huge influence because of phrases like: ,,If you want to be cool, get the superblaser 1000" (this serves as an example).
So it is vital to say that sdvertising toward young children should be forbidden and sanctioned.
Imagine wathching TV with your little child.
Its 6 p.m and your child have to go to bed soon so she's wathching a good evening serie for kids.
After the little episode, she also sees the advertising.
It's about a new sinderella film in the cinema.
After that, she just want to see this film with you.
But you don't like Disnay movies.
Television advertising should be allowed because parents, grandparents and her childs have to lerne to deal with adverticement and her concequences.
Firstly, parents often don't like kids advertising on the television because kids take it very seriously.
They realy think that for example the new film of sinderella is the best and they realy have to watch it.
They can't seperate the real life and the TV world.
But how other children learn the bad absicht of adertissement as when parents watch advertising with their children and explain them, that they can't do all the funny things in the TV because its expensice and it isn't as fancy as it is shown.
The parents have to show them that they can't buy all the things they want.
Second, it would be easyer for parents if there would be a rule to manage the advertising for children.
But i thing parents have to make rules for children and have to look that they don't watch the bad adavertising.
Advertising

I think it's not wrong to show children televisoin advertising.
Because it is not something who destroys the children.
Maybe for the parents it isn't so good beacause if the children watching the advertising of games, for example playmobile or barbie, they want this things so bad.
So they talk to her parents and talk and talk, till they say yes and buy the games for there childrens.
Also I think some TV-Series are more worse than friendly television advertising, because some comics and other stuff in the tv are so bad.
They are so sexual and terrorising, so they make the childrens dumb.
Otherwise it gives so many other things whitch we should protect our childrens therefore.
For example the internet or the streets, which are very dangerouse.
So i think the adevertising is the smalest problem of all.
This are the reasons why I disagree with the statement, which says that television advertising directed toward young children ahould not be allowed.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed

Televison advertising is a topic over the hole world and so a country, which is on the other side of the world can be in the  television advertising in a coutry, which is thousands of miles away from it.
Many people hate television advertising of different reasonds but should it not be allowed to young children?
Many online shopping websites have been in TV advertising and so if they show it to young children, they hope that they would call the parents to show them that they want the toy.
So is is good for the shop.
Young children would be directed to watch every advertising of them to remember the parents that they want that.
So there are also some children songs advertisings, which makes the young children happy and also the parents.
Also there are many movie advertising on the TV and they show them a lot of on a children channel, where there is also for Teenager some series.
So if there is a advertising, which has been for Teenager the young children would also see it and this is not very good in some times.
Televison advertising could be a advertising to everything, so i think it depends on the advertising, if it schould be allowed to children or not.
So my opinion is if it is a advertising of a friendly children movie or a playsstore the young children could watch it, but when the advertising is about a teenager action movie with war and blood the advertising should not be allowed to young children.
Television advertising directed toward children aged two to five

Everybody nows it, the annoying television advertising, but if it is a good advertisment it influences you to buy stuff.
And is not that the purpose of a advertisment?
To influence you.
A lot of young children spend a lot of time in front of the television and also watch advertisment.
Is that really a good thing?
Im am going to talk about if television for young children should not be allowed.
First I would like to define the words young children.
When I talk about young children in this essay I mean children aged two to five.
To start I would like to say that advertising can include violence, sexism and bad language which shoud not be accesable for young children.
But I have to say that the advertisment on channels for children is made for children and does not contain things like violence.
So if the parents just allow the children childrenchannels or block the others, they not affected by advertisment which are not made for them.
Another aspect is that the advertising is bad, because children are easier to manipulate.
In my opinion I think advertisment shoudl be accseable for children, because they may get influence but their not getting brainwashed.
A lot of kids aged two to five like to watch television and do this all day for some hours.
For the parents is this also good because the kids have something to do and the parents can work in this time or clean up the house.
But ist that a good idea?
In television you see not just movies or series you also see a lot of advertising directed toward young children.
It shouldn`t be allowed to do television advertising directed toward young children.
An argument who speaks for the thesis is that kids in this age believe everything you say to them.
When Kids hear something what people say in the advertising they think that`s true oder when they see something stupid in the advertising they also believe it`s true.
Because of this kid are very vulnerable and it could be that they learn something wrong because of this advertising.
This could change the life of the kids.
An reason who speaks against this thesis is that advertisings aren`t bad.
There aren`t brutal or cruel scenes in it.
The scenes which are shown in advertising are happy and full of harmony.
A lot advertisings are funny and you have to laugh if you see it.
This isn`t bad for this kids and don`t harm them.
Finally I think it shouldn`t be allow to do this.
Kids are too vulnerable in this age and television advertising directed toward young children is unessecary.
Should it be allowed to advertise television directed toward young childrens?
Today many children watch TV at home instead of playing outside.
Peolpe often critices this evolution because they thinks electronic devices are not good for the young children.
So they think about making television advertising prohibited.
One advantage when TV advertising directed toward young children isn't allowed is that they would play outside because there only mord series etc on televison.
Next, when the children watch TV every time, they can lose friend or the don't know how the "real" world works.
On the other hand it's better when they have their own TV programms because if they haven't their own programms they watch tv programmes for adults instead of going outside or playing with other kids.
In addition, there's not a problem when parents look and control how long their watching TV.
Young childrens should also know how a TV works.
The earlier they learn how electronic devices works, the easier is it to learn and to work when they are adults.
They should learn from the beginning how long it's good watching tv and when its enough.
To sum up, there are also advantages and disadvantages.
But I think televisions advertising should be allowed because children should have their own TV programmes.
If they haven't got own TV series, they watch series for adults instead of making other things.
So it's better when they watch their own programmes which are done for childrens.
But the parents of the children must be careful about how long the children watch TV because they shouldn't watch TV the whole day.
They should go outside and play with other kids.
But a prohibition is not the right way to bring children away from the TV screen.
"Televison advertising should not be allowed if it is for young children (aged two to five)".
There are two sides about this statement.
Advertising for example for toys, is something only young children are going to watch.
It is one way to present a specific subject over televison directed toward the young children.
It can cause a few troubles.
For example children between two and five will most probably watch more televison beacuse it is very interesting and enyoable to see new things you maybe want for your next birthday.
They are now more infront of the television to see all these advertisements.
The time spend infront of the television they could play outside with other children instead of watching toys and other advertisements all day long.
But it has also a positive factor to advertise directly to young children.
For example a family with a three year old son who is going to befour soon, are looking for a birthdy gift.
The son watches television one hour twice a week in the afternoon.
One day three weeks before his birthday he sees this fantatic new techmobile in an ad from lego.
Now he knows exactly what he wants for his birthday and his parents are no longer in stress to find something good.
We see there are two points, one positive and one more negative point about this statement.
The negative is the the time one spends watching television instead of doing more things in real life, the positive side is, that children can actually find something interesting and be a bit happier in the short future beacause of advertising for them.
All in all in my personal oppinion the positive factor about advertising toward children outweighs the negative.
If you let your child watch tv for an appropiate time and not four hours every day, it can be very useful for parents and their children, without stealing important time of the real world.
A middle way in between is the best for children and parents.
Today the television plays a central part in each live.
It exist many pros and cons of watching television.
Often parents are to lazy to carry their young children and so they let them watch television.
But there exist negative consequenses of watching TV, espectually advertising.
Young children belive quite everything they see.
So when the children are watching television advertising, they belive in every detail.
But those advertisings are often not real.
The producers of those advertisings only want to earn a lot of money.
And after watching the advertisement, children want to buy the product.
A child also can get addicted of watching TV.
And then they cry very often or become a tantrum and are very angry to the parents,when they switch off the television.
So it's beter, when the young children do something other than watching television.
For example young children could play a game with their family or have a nice evening with some friends.
It also existe some positive points.
We can learn a lot from the television.
Documentaries often shows us, how something is in real.
Also young children can learn.
With watching television they could improve their speaking knowledge.
So it helps them, before they go to nursery school.
I think televison advertising towards young children shouldn't be allowed, because young childrens belive to everything.
But at the end the parents can decide, if their child can watch TV or not.
For sure it's better to go outside to play with some friends than watching television or surfing in the internet.
But often the parents are very stressed, so to calm down, they put their young child in front of a TV.
For me it's not bad to let the child watching television, but not more then half a houer a day.
Often the parents also work the whole day, so they have noother opportunity than let their child watch TV.
In this generation it's normal that young children watch a lot of TV all day, because it's the easiest thing: they have something to do and don't make any noises.
But television advertising can influence young children a lot, more than their parents, because they want something faster than adults.
If they want something from the television advertisment, the parents buy it.
the parents can't protect their children from television advertising and they often don't notice it.
Another point is, that kids often don't know what they want and when they see in the television, that other children have something, that make fun, they want it too.
I think television advertising shouldn't be allowed, because its unfair for the parents, who want the best for their children and that's why they buy a lot of things for example toys for them.
The best for the kids were that they don't watch so much TV and go out to play with their friends or they shouldn't put so much advertisment in kids programs.
I agree with this statement.
The reason why I agree this statement is, that these young children get influenced by this advertising.
An other big problem of this tv advertsing is, that they do not learn the bolasie flick.
This bolasie flick is very important for the future of the childrens.
This bolasie flick decide if they have five star skills or not.
When you have learned this very important skill, then you have more worth on the transfer market.
A few years ago I was looking advertising in the tv.
Advertising is the most beautiful part in a tv show.
This beautiful advertising has influenced me.
This has formed my charakter and made me to this person I am today.
that was my very informative essay about the subject advertsing.
I hope do not have a rectaldisfunktion an enjoied reading this beautiful easy.
Advertising becomes more and more important in our world.
But adverts are also dangerous, because they influence us in the way they want us to think.
This can have a very bad impact on children that's why I think ads that target children between the age of two and five should be forbitten.
Making a child think, that for eg.
a special toy is something they have to have, creates multible problems.
One of those problems is that the child will ennoy its parents because it wants to have this toy.
This is especially a problem if the parents don't want to buy the toy eighter because they don't have the money or because they don't think it's a good toy for their child.
This creates another problem, because if there is a group of children and some of them have this adverted toy and some of them don't the ones without the toy will probably feel bad or even be bullied.
This also creates even more stress for the parents.
Children are also more likely to remember an ad.
I've seen this phenomen with my little brother: When I saw the ad, I just told myself: "it's an ad, don't think about it to much".
But smaller children like my brother don't realise that, my brother now knows some ad by heart which means he definetly got influenced by them.
To pick up a point I wrote about earlier: Often toys or other things, that are shown in an ad, aren't very good things for children that's why parents mostly don't want their child to have them.
Very good toys for example have hardly ever an ad campaign.
Making ads that target two to five years old children illegal would be a huge step in the right direction.
But to do this, there are still some problems to overcome.
Who decideds which ads are banned for example.
Also with younger and younger children using the internet it also gets more and more difficult to ban ads because on the internet goverments sometimes cant control everything
As a componie that sells products adressed to children its quite an efficient way to present their products to children trough the television, As jung children get those Products presented interstingly, theiy almost instantly want to get them.
And as soon as they have heard of such a product they run to their parents and ask them to buy this prop seen in the advertisment.
The first time the parents might resist to the demanding of the child but as it has seen the advertisment a few times they almost need to buy it to ceep their child happy.
Whith this method the industry is able to get rid of every rubish they have produced an make profit whith it.
And as a consequence families do have to handle with hundreds of unneccessary things which the children have found in TV-advertiments.
Seen like his it ise quite obvious and understandable why parents want to get rid of those advertisments directed to jung children, but on the other hand there is the question if it isn't theyr own fault that the children see all these adwertisments, I meen how much television should a child aged two to five whatch?
If the parents would prevent theyr children from watching TV all the time they would not have the problems with the advertisments nd the companies would not have the possibility to mack such deals whith this and so they would maybe stop dooing this advertisements.
In my oppinion TV-advertisment is one of the most annoying things in the world and I would love to get rid off, but I does not have to be vorbidden to make advertising especcialy for such jung children because if they do see to much advertising it's not only the fault of the companies but also of the parents.
Children in this age should not wach too much TV.
Television advertising is a very big theme in our society today.
Because there are so many psycological ways to change the wahrnehmung of the people.
BUt little children can be better influenced bey television advertising than older people, because they want everything they can see and that is presented in a positiv way.
For example if there is a new Babyborn and they can see how other children (in TV) play with it, they also want this new one, and it does not matter if they have already one or not, they just want the new one.
Another argument to not allowed the television advertising is that sometimes, there are good series or documentations about themes kids should know.
But every few minutes comes a short advertieser, so the children have to watch them.
Or they generally do not watch television, but then,they also do not watch the good documentations.
But these products from the advertise should have the chance to be presented, and they pay to show these.
So maybe its the exercise from the parents to give their kids other things to do than watching television - if they do not want to show them advertises.
The parents can buy a film about goog-to-know-themes, or they can read books about interesting things or they can tell and discuss with their children.
So they are many other ways to learn things about life.
I think the kids learn more about everything if they do it for themself.
If they watch just television, their intelligence can not profit, because they do not think for themself, they just watch something.
When they do not watch television, they can not be influenced by the television advertising and the can learn more for themself.
And maybe they do something and can hold it in their memoir, because if you watch television, most of the time you do not know what you have watched a few days later.
The thing is; the parents have to know what they want for their children.
The advertiser should can show their television advertising, and if the parents do not want that their kids see it, there are many way to go around the advertise.
Advertising on television; Is it really bad for young children?
At first.
Does a two year old child need to watch already television shows?
Should it not enjoy life out side the house on the fresh air?
As older they get, they will watch television shows and advertising.
But does advertising works at a such young age?
Yes, unfortunately it does.
The little children see something awesome they want.
But they do not have the money to buy it.
So they annoying their parents as long as they buy their child the thing it wants.
Television advertising should be forbidden for such young age.
It affects the children a lot.
When we are young, the world around us has a big influence on us.
So maybe when the children are grown up, they still get, what they want.
And that is really annoying for the people around that person.
For every minus there is a plus.
Sooner or later the children will see advertising in the television.
It is better they see it, when they are young.
They learn, that we can not have everything we want, and that is a very important aspect in life.
The children have stuff to talk about.
They can exchange what they saw, and who thinks what is cool.
It also helps them to form their identity.
They will recognize, what they like, and what not.
And when they get something, that is not as it was in the advertising, they learn, that not everthing is like what it seems to be.
All in all, television advertising for young children should not be allowed.
The products which are presentet are only half as good as they were presented.
A lot of the advertising is made, correctet or idealized by computer.
In my opinion, the children shouldn't watch television that long, that they could be advertising in it.
They should watch their show and after that they should do something else.
Things that have to be advertised are useless, that is an old sentens, and sadly, it is true.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed

These days, adverstising is present everywhere.
It is common that these messages are normally directed to a particular client group.
But is advertising directed to young children really needed and also, should it even be allowed?
Children between the age of 2 and 5 aren't yet reasonable.
Not without any reason decide their parents most of the time for them, they can't really distinguish if something is good for them or not.
Therefore, advertising directed straight at these children isn't useful.
However, advertising company also want to reach this group of people, but they should direct it to the parents and not to their child.
Normally, these children can easily get a false idea about what this product really is about.
Their imagination is great, and they believe at things which were just meant to make the advertising more interesting.
They are innocent victims of false adverisments, if there's a fairy princess which makes dreams to become true, they are going to believe it.
And if then reality came and they would become aware that this isn't true, their hearts would be broken.
And after all, the parents are those who have to pay the product.
They are in charge for their child's health and well-beeing, and they have to say no to their child everytime when they want such an useless present.
Many parents have to deal with their children starting to cry and yell because they can't have the desired thing.
Although the product seems nice to the child, the parents really know if it's a real necessity to have.
In conclusion, these advertisings give the children a false view of things, they increase problem between parent and child, and sometimes, they just confuse them.
So in my opinion, television advertising directed to young children isn't for any good, it just creates conflicts.
Advertisement is an intelligent mean that's being used by almost every company.
It's very important for them to advertise their product but sometimes advertisement is also very manipulative for the people that are confronted with it.
Especially children are pretty easy to manipulate.
So, should the children be prevented of advertisements on television by a law that doesn't allow any advertising towards children?
I don't think that it's necessary to forbid such advertisements because of several reasons.
The first point that supports my opinion is that companies should always be able to show theis products to the customers.
If that wouldn't be the case, how should anybody know about the newest lego toy or the new puppet that can even eat?
And even if a child has been influenced by the television advertising, the parents will still decide if they want to buy their son or daughter the toy that they've seen on TV.
Another point is that the children will get in contact with those products anyways.
For example when they see them at a friend's house or in the kindergarten.
So they can also be confronted with an advertisement on television.
It doesn't matter how old an individual is, whether it should be allowed or forbidden to show advertisements or not.
Because children aren't able or don't even have any or that much money to buy things by themselves.
Whether it is on billboards, in newspapers, in the internet or television- we can't get around advertisements.
It's part of our culture and our economical system.
We're all subconciously influenced through advertising,that's scientifically proven.
Some advertisements may have negative impact on certain people or even society in general.
Therefore, one might ask themselves if this is something we need to protect our children from.
Infants and young children are in an important developemental stage and their experiences are their foundation for their future lives and leave a lasting impact.
Nowadays, many children spend a lot of their time watching TV and are exposed to television advertising towards them.
Some people argue that this sort of television advertising  directed toward young children should not be allowed because they could teach them questionable values or impact them otherwise in a negative way.
Others say it's not a big deal and it's just part of our world, therfore we should'nt condemn it.
It might even help them to find new interests, they argue.
I think it's fair to say that we need to be careful to what we expose our children to and there should certain rules concerning advertising directed toward young children.
All advertising is manipulating in some way, and we need to make our children aware of this at a very young age.
We must teach them that in the real world, things are different than on television and that values like friendship and compassion are more important than material things.
Personally, I don't think banning advertising towards children would be necessary, it's just important to have a conversation about it and to be aware of what they're exposed to.
An essay on televison advertising directed toward young children and weather it shoudn't be allowed

We live in a world full of technology and television is surely a part of it.
It may not be as important, as it once was, nowadays Iphones and Youtoube are of equal importance in the question of influencing people.
But still there is nearly in every houshold a television and people watch television up to 2 houres a day.
The programm and the series are adapted to the timetable of humans of different ages.
When you'd like to watch telly in the morning for example about 9 am or in the early afternoon you have to deal with the fact that there are only TV shows for childrens, because usually a grown adult has to work.
On the other hand you'll have some difficulties to find a serie for children on 11 pm in the eavening.
And like the TV programms change, so do the advertisments.
It woud'nt make any sense to make a five year old watch a commercial about alcohol, she would'nt be attracted.
Same case with an adult, tired after eight houres of working, isn't interested in the new Barbie doll.
Advertisments are made for a target audience.
But why should already childrens by the age of two watch TV and therefor be a target audience?
In my oppinion parents who let childrens watch television by the age of two aren't very responsible.
At such a young age they certainly are very easy to influence by the advertisments and the TV series for children, who aren't  educatif or pedagogial at all, just are not worth it.
I personally never watched TV as a child, because we never had one, I alwasy watched films, and I don't feel like I missed something.
Besides the advertisments who always make long brakes between the actual film or serie you're watching, of course.
I don't think that banning advertisments is the right way to protect young childrens.
Sure, if there isn't any temptation, it is easier to resist, but they also have to learn to deal with it.
To see something and not have the urgent need to get it, and also being able to know that is real and what is not.
But the question is, are childrens by the age of two to five already able to do that?
Probably not, so: If parents let their childs watch telly at such a early age, they have to be ready to explain them a lot and resist the crying of a two years old in the supermarket, who absolutely wants that toy she saw in the commercial.
To be done on own risk.
Nowadays young children spend a lot of time watching television.
After each show they are confrontated with television advertising.Can young children already understand television advertising?
Should television advertising toward young children not be allowed?
Television advertising toward young children should be allowed because advertisings show them new things children have not seen in their lives before.
Children can get informations about the existence of new toys for instance.
Although there are some advantages of advertising for young children there are many negative aspects as well.
Children aged two to five can not understand the advertising yet.
Young children get manipulated because advertisings present a wrong picture of the amount of things they need during their daily life.
If children get confrontated with an advertising for example about the newest toy they really want to have this toy as well.
They beg their parents to buy this specific toy although their play rooms are already full of stuff to play with.
On top advertisings often do not present suitable toys for kids.
There are a lot of advertisings of new play stations and video games.
It could be possible that children do not want to go outside and play anymore because the advertisings show them new interesting electronical toys which can have a negative influence on their health if they just sit inside the house and spend hours in front of the screen.
In my opinion television advertising toward children should be allowed with strict rules.
I would not allow advertisings which show electronical items because I think young children should not spend too much time in front of screens.
Some people think that it isn't good when little children watch TV.
They say that the television destroys the eyes of the children because children are then right now in the process where they are growing and getting educated.
That the television makes the children stupid is also a opinion of some people.
Children in this age should go better outside and see the natur and have fun by getting dirty in the playground.
So they can be fit and not sitting on the couch and be lazy, It's also better when children are outside and getting dirty so they can have a better imunsystem and so they can't get often sick.Sometimes they are very stupid children shows like Teletubbies.
The childrens are imitating the language of Teletubbies and it can have influenc in the futur.
So they will have problems when they are learning how to speak.
But they are also positiv sides.
They are so many TV shows for children that are very helpfull to learn important things.
Dora is that kind of show that improve the language and the logic thinking.
In the show Dora they learn the colours, numbers, shapes and a lot of other important things that a children at this age should know.
The Tv is also a good chance for children that don't like to go outside to learn view things.
When it's raining children can watch TV and have fun.
I also watched very often TV when i was a little child and i learn a lot by watching TV.
But i think it's not okay when the children never go outside because the real life is outside and not in the living room.
For one hour a day watching TV is okay at this age but not more.
It's funnier at the playground that inside the house.
Many parents said that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
There are many reasons which are supporting these statement.
It could be helpful for young children if television advertising should not be allowed.
In the following, I will explain my point of view.
However, television advertising is an entertainment for everyone, it does not matter which age you are.
It is mostly better than sitting around and be bored.
But there is also an other important point.
Young children could use television advertising to learn something.
There are not only positive arguements, but also negative aspects.
First, television advertising is mostly unhealthy for young children.
For example they can get very sick and they cannot get any friends if they are television advertising.
But there is also an other arguement which do not support the statement.
Children have to make expiriences in the world, and television advertising do not bring any important expiriences.
At last, television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
The health of young children is too important and television advertising could be like a wall between the children and the society.
Advertising in general is a very manipulative Action.
Companies use human weaknesses to their advantage when making an advertisment.
Now, children below the age of five don't have any experience with manipulative strategies of companies.
Therefore it is in the companies biggest interests, to direct their advertisment to the most naive crowd.
But is it fair to manipulate adults through their children.
I'd say no because if adults want to buy something they should be able to make desiciones themselves.
Companies shouldn't be allowed to target adults through their children.
I haven't got anymore Ideas therefore the remainder of this text will be about an amazing vegetable: The carrot.
Normally when you encounter a wild carrot it is surprisingly orange.
One might not expect such a pure colour in the wild, but nevertheless there it is.
Carrots can be grown in practically every environment suitable for growing plants.
For example do not recommend searching for a carrot in the antarctica.
I'm afraid you wouldn't be rewarded with what you desired to find.
Actually there is a slim chance you might end up in the horrendus fangs of an icebear.
Carrots can also be found in more urban areas, where there is no sudden danger of a  icebear-attack.
Also you don't need to trouble yourself with the freezing temperatures of the antarctica.
And at last in urban areas there are carrots contrary to the southern icecap of the marvelous planet earth.
ggez
Children are heaviliy influenced by everything they see.
So if they see a toy advertised in television, it's easy to understand, that these children want to have them, even if they have no use for them.
An advertisement in television can shoew a wrong image of the product, but for some children television is real.
An adult has experience in what he can trust and what is fake.
Children can't distinguish between what part of the advertisement they can belive and what they should be aware of.
Most of the toys are advertised between shows.
For the advertiser it's an easy way to get the people to buy their products.
They make the children beg their parents for the toys, even if the parents know better, what kind of toys their children have an use for.
If the children see the toy in real life, they may have an impression of what it does and they may change their minds.
But even adults can be influenced by advertisements.
So if  the children start early to analize, how advertisement in television works, they won't make similar mistakes in the future.
Advertisement in television can influence children, but it can also influence adults.
If a child learns how to look at advertisement in the early ages, it knows later how to avoid way bigger mistakes.
conclusion
Television advertising is nowadays exrteamly popular.
A couple of years ago mostly adults and adolesents watched TV.
Nowadays there are many TV programs for children only.
Betweeen the different shows there is alot of advertising directet toward  young children.
The advertising mostly includes advertising for toys.
The thing is most of the advertising is about toys for young children but at the same time designed to adjust the parents.
The üarents decide in the end if the toy is going to be bought or not.
A child under the age of five like to touch and feel stuff.
If they only see it on TV they can't really associate with the object.
So the advertising is indirectly for the parents.
If it is I don't see a reason why it's not okay.
If you look at the moral aspect of the whole story, it might be not that okay.
Advertiser is using young children and mostly young parents.
It can be that a chid sees something on the TV, that they despretly want.
So it screams and crys till they have it.
Young parents mostly don't have alot of money, because they are building a new life and have to stay at home because of the children.
So it's not okay to missuse the need of those children, so the parents have to buy the toy.
All in all you have to see for yourself if it's fine for you or not to advertise on TV towards young children.
The advertising is there anyhow so if you don't like it don't let your children watch TV.
I don't think it's okay for children at a very young age to sit a wholeday in front of a TV.
It leads to stupidity and numness.
Nowadays many young children already watch TV.
Because of that, they also are exposed to advertisements.
But the question is, if it does any good or bad to these children.
First of all, advetisements do have an influence on the one who watches them.
Especially young children can easily be influenced.This leads to the wish of needing and buying all these stuff, which is very bad.
Another point is, that these advertisements often are based on a joke.
Young children won't get these jokes, and can so be offended through the advertisement.
As an personal opinion, I also think such young children shouldn't watch TV.
Normal DVDs are ok, but on TV you mostly just watch trash.
Because of that, children who should touch and feel things just sit there and do nothing all the time.
This can lead to serious motivation problems in their later life.
On the other hand, advertising also have a good aspect.
Not for children aged two to five, but if they are a bit older thex begin to understand the use of advertisments.
They don't believe anymore that everything said on TV is true and this helps to develope their analytic ways of thinking.
I think young children mustn't be exposed to advertisments, but neither should they be exposed to too much TV.
In my opinion, watching in these boxes isn't good for children of any age.
They should go outside and make their own experiences for life.
But in the end it is the decision of their parents and their responsibility to care good for their children.

I do agree with that statement!
In todays televisionprograme, there is no more chanel left who hasn't got advertisements in their breaks.
I understand, that the people who work at the chanel need to earn money out of somewhere.
The simplest way to get the necessary money is by stream advertisements in the breaks of their TV shows.
Since a few years, television developed their advertising process.
They set the advertisings at specific times or between specific shows.
For example in the late evening.
At this time, there are only adults or teenagers left,so the people working at the chanel only place advertisements for products which are used by theese kind of people.
Or on Disney-chanel, there are specific advertisemnts for children.
I think chanels who stream children programe should not be allowed to place advertisement that could affect the children.
The young boys and girls might get attracted by the products, so they start yelling at there parents and wont stop begging until they get what they want.
In these cases the children win nine out of ten times.
So the ones who placed the advertisements gain profit by influencing children.
Thats a clever way, but not fair!
I think that debate would loose at court, because its their only way to make a financial gain.
Advertising will continue to be placed in TV, so there must be another possibility to let children watch their favourite TV shows.
Thats the point, where Netflix comes in.
Netflix has a wide range of TV shows for children and as a parent you don't have to worry that your child gets affected by advertisements.
It's quite hard to define the directed spectator group of an advertisement.
Not all people are educated like the others and not all people are in the same mental stage when they are at the same age as others.
Some children aged two to five can already decide about some easy questions and situations, others can't.
When young children aged two to five are watching television, there's only advertisement ment for young children and nothing that isn't meant for them.
Young children are quite good in getting what they want, so they can easily get the things they have seen in television.
Advertisements directed toward young children work well, if they are built attractive for them.
It also wouldn't be fair, if only things for older people were allowed to advertise in television.
Every toy store wants to sell his toys as well as every wine store wants to sell his wine.
If just the wine store would be allowed to advertise in television, the toy store wouldn't make enough money.
Toy stores can't exist that well without advertising, because most parents don't buy toys for their children, without having seen these toys before.
When young children are watching television advertisements, they can tell their parents exactly what they want.
For sure, young children are more likely to want everything they see but as long as you have to pay for it, the parents can decide whether they want to buy the product or not.
You shouldn't be able to buy the products for young children by a phone call, because maybe the young children already know how to use a phone and how to make a phone call.
But as far as I know, products directed to young children can't be bought by a phone call.
I can't see any problems in television advertising directet toward young children aged two to five, as long as it isn't something dangerous and as long as the young children can't get it without convincing their parents of buying it.
Televison advertising
In modern society media is always present.
It influences everybody just by the sheer presence.
There almost none possibilities to escape these ifluences.
Thus the young undeveloped minds of children are ifluenced by the media probably more than we know.
However the kids learn early to seperate in between what is real and what is not.
They may also get used to the devices that bring along these ads.
For exaple they get used to using a computer, a laptop, a smartphone or a tablet.
They will not have any problems using these gadgets.
And anyway it is the responibility of the parrents to what they show to their children and what not.
They are confronted this early that they do not even realize that they are influenced by these ads.
They are not able to get an imagination about what they should beliefe and what not.
Their minds will be influenced this much that they are almost completely controled by the media in terms of buying stuff.
They will not understand why something is neccesary and why they need it because in the ads everything is shown as it is necessery in life and you have to buy it to be able to continue to life a normal life.
But in the age where it will be vorbidden the parants have an inormous influence on the children and their behaviour in terms of consuming ads.
Thus it is a consequenze of parenting skill to show the children what they should beliefe and what not.
In my opinion it is necessair to control the consume of young children since their minds are still in development and easy ifluenced.
But as in order to everything else it is the responisbility of the parents of what their child is waching and what it should not watch.
Should advetising directed to young children be forbidden?
Do they have negative influences to the developpment of the children?
Or do the enterprises have the right to attract their costumers with advertises?
Young children are very easily influencable.
This is the reason why there are so many television advertisis these days directed to young children.
But many shown products are not good for the developpment of the children.
The young children love McDonald's, especially because of its commercial strategy.
In the end the children prefer hamburgers and fries over fruits and vegetables.
These can be the negative influences of TV advertising toward young children.
Brands can influence children for their hole life by using commercials.
So the people are unconsciously dependant on brands and their products, which are often overprized or unhealthy.
On the other hand, everybody wants to earn money.
The companys offer jobs to workers and the workers earn money for the family.
And there are companys whose clients are children.
They also want to survive and make their money.
To make more money it is inevitably for many enterprises to make televison advertising and then they can offer more jobs.
I think this is a very controversial question.
Every enterprise has the right to make money and they need those television advertising but they can have negative aspects, especially the children are endangered.
The best solution would be, if we could forbid the commercials with a bad influence on the children to protect them.
But the difficulty is do define these "bad commercials".
There will be a lot of work for the government.
Nowadays there are more and more advertisements.
Some are interesting and catchy while others don't really have a meaning and are bad for children.
But should television advertising be allowed for young children?
Firstly television advertising can have vulgar topics, so it might scare children.
For instance a game advertising about war.
Even though there are disadvantages there are also good reasons to allow advertising for young children.
For example, it can help young children to understand difficult things.
There are topics that can be explained in a playful way like an advertising.
Some advertisements directed toward adults, adults themselves have a difficulty to understand, even though it has a simple meaning that children understand faster.
Adults often think that there's a deep meaning behind but actually it's simple.
In conclusion I disagree with this statement.
If parents agree and don't want their kids to see it they should watch television with their kids and turn it off when an advertisement appears.
If there are vulgar advertisements there should be a warning at the beginning of the video.
Sometimes young children don't even understand if the advertisements are directed toward them.
They just have fun and enjoy watching television.
TV-shows or movies do have an extrem big influence on the spectaor.
Horros movies for example make some people cry or leads them to a slepless night.
An advertisement is shorter than a movie, but is also able to influence the spactator.
At least, this is the goal of an ad.
The behaviour of small kids therefore could change a lot, if they see someone doing or having something.
Even without the parental influence.
They believe, what they see on TV is true.
Mostly, in advertisements for children, a toy or something else to "use" is presented.
If they like it, they really, really want to have it too.
Escpecially if all their friends have the "thing".
The parents get stressed a lot, because there is no way, not to get the object of desire, without getting the kids sad.
On the other hand, if the advertisement for children is funny, but the kid is not interested in it, it's a good way to make the TV more attractive.
Besides the advertisements for adults, there is something for children to watch, and the spectrum of what you can watch on TV gets enourmous.
Another positiv thing about the advertisement for young children is, that it is not only for young children.
If an older one needs a gift for the son/daughter of a friend, and he sees something good on TV, he doesn't have to come up with a strange gift-idea.
But still, it is questionable, if there should be anything for children at the age of 2 to 5 on TV.
This doesn't really help the new generation, to learn to go out into the fresh air and do something on its own.
My opinion to the whole thing is therefore very simple: I would not allow television ads directed towards young children, or any other thing on television at all.
Television advertising

Advertising is seen everywhere on the streets, on plackates, it is heared in the radio or read in a magazine or newspaper, finally is is also seen in the televison or in the cinema.
Companies are showing their mostly new product to get some more popularity and get more people to buy it.
New trailers of a film which is coming soon in the cinema are often shown in advertising breaks of films which are on the tele.
This is clever in reason of many people see this advert and the scale of people going to see it will be higher.
Therefore will the company and the producer of the film earn more money and on top of that become more popular.
Young childeren like to watch television and therefore are children films often more fully booked.
By advertising a trailer in break time of a film more children get to see it and are therefore more likely to go to the cinema.
What happend to childeren if the shown trailer isn't age right or in the shown adverise are scenes shown which should not be watched of a young child.
Childeren can develope a fear of scary trailers.
In reason of that they think of it the whole day and cannot even go to bed because of their nightmears.
As well as it is boring for childerne to watch in between their childeren programm advertise for grown up people.
In conclusion a companie is advertising to get more popular and is shown their new product.
If a trailer is for young childeren in aged two to five a cinema trip can be  glad idea for the whole family.
If, though, a trailer is shown which isn't for that specificly age the children can develope a fear and kind of a trazma because of their naivity.
Finally I have to mantion I think advertising hase their pro in topics of show people new products they can make use.
Otherwise I have to say that childeren directed the advertising has to have a limite especially on childeren canals on televisions.
I wasn't in this situation, that the TV made a problem for me.
But now in our time, many people or almost all people have a TV.
For the children and young children is TV very funne, because there are funny fils and series.
But it a also advertisement.
I have no proplems with the advertisement in TV, but for young people is this not correct:

Young children are for all object and situations interessted.
Television advertising can use this situation and can lead in his "Richtung".
The children can be interessted for a thing in the futere, which produce a company, which had made this television advertisement.
Also is the problem, that we don't know the "Auswirkungen" by te television advertisement in the childhood.
It could be manipulatet us or it nothing happens.
But for me is important,that the parents know, what the children are showing at the moment and on TV cames things, that's not correct for the young people (example War Games and weapons).
The company can make little massage for the children in the television advertisement.
Example the state make this and say that your country need you and you should go to the army.
- Yes is a little over the top with this example.
:) But I will say, that people in young years learn a lot of information and the life is based on the childhood.
It is a good instrument for the state to lead the young generation.
That television advertisemt directed toward young children should not be allowed, is for me correct.
I am agree with with this statement on based of the different arguments.
When it comes to raising kids, the opinions drift apart.
In this time watching television is on the daily schedule of almost every little child.
Advertising directed to kids leads them to beg for it.
It makes them wanting all those shiny and funny things from the advertisment.
The people who pay for it are of course not the kids but the parents.
That intention itself makes the company that sends out the promotion very unsympathic.
So in the family that kind of advertisment causes riots from the kids.
If we have a look at this from the side of the company, then the whole thing looks very different and clever.
I mean who wouldn't buy a toy for its kid if they can affort it easily and make their kid so much happier with it?
Another question would be if exactly this behaviour leads our culture in a society of consume and non stop needs of material things.
Because they may cause happiness for a really short moment, but lasting happiness is a state of mind.
In conclusion I think that advertising directed toward kids is an effective strategie for the company, but from a social point of view very unhealthy for our future society and the consume behaviour of the kids.
Television advertising is something we live with in our every day life.
It has become something normal, that we mostly don't see as an issue.
But when it comes to children, more specific young children aged two to five, television advertising may be a problem.
Nowadays most of the younger children in our society are growing up with televisions surrounding and entertaining them.
They are being influenced by certain television shows but also of what comes inbetween them.
Since children are still growing up, they have to learn a lot, wich means things, for example television advertising, tend to have a much bigger impact on them, then they have on grown ups.
That can be a really big issue for parents who can not control what their children see on the television.
This means that they can not control what their children are being influenced by.
On the other hand there are a lot of other things that influence children.
If a child is not homeschooled, he or she has to go to school.
In school children are surrounded by others, who influence them.
Those children have a much bigger impact on others, than television advertising does.
But children are not only influenced by other children.
In fact we live in a society where we are being influenced every day.
By other people, by what happends around the globe, by basically everything.
So telvision advertising does not really have that big of an impcat, right?
In my opinion, it is still an issue we can't ignore just because of the fact that there are greater issues.
I do not think that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because it is really not necesarry.
Not only that, I think it would really help the children, if they got confronted with television advertsising later in their lifes.
A mother and her daughter, aged four, are sitting together on a couch and are watching TV at six o'clock in the evening.
The favorite TV-show of the girl has finished and an advertising about a princess ben shows up.
The girl is fascinated but forget what she saw.
Her mother is shocked and turns immediately the TV off.
She is angry and calls the channel.
This Television advertising did show a normal situation in our lifetime.
Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed or is it just a dumb thing?
First of all almost every child watches TV.
Maybe a mother or a father is sitting next to them and they develop their dreams in several advertisings.
They see what they want and they can look forward to telling their mothers and daddies what they want.
It's in the eye of the beholder but I think they are learning to have dreams and to follow them.
Also important is that a father or a mother can inspire itself of buying maybe a new birthday present for their child.
Advertising can be inspiring even if it's for young children.
On the other hand, against television advertising directed toward young children is that humans without children are bored if there shows an advertising for a young children aged 4 up.
They want to see advertisings for themselves and not one for children.
It also depends on what time it is.
If there is eleven o'clock in the evening there should not be showed an advertising for young children.
To concluse, there are positive and negative aspects.
I think the positive ones do overweight and I hope there won't be less television advertising directed toward young children.
If you come home and you were stressed, maybe caused by work, watching advertisings is a good thing to cool down and relax a little bit.
Today there are a lot of moms, daddies and nannies who let the childrens, aged two to five, watch tv.
What are the positifs and negatif sides?
Should we stop let them watch tv?
Parents are often stressed and somtimes they desire to have some time to spend for themselfes.
So they put the tv on and let their children watch series or movies.
Somentimes they haven't really an idea what the children are watching.
This could be dangereous because the things they see in this young age, have a great influence of their personality.
Looking on the other side, watching tv can be something really interesting for chlildren and they can learn things, depending what they are watching.
A negatif point could be that the children lost their imagination skills or they get a imagine of a world that doesen't exist.
In my opinion it is important that the children go out and play with others.
It should be allowed let the children watch tv but the parents should watch with them or  they should know what their children are watching.
I agree with this statment because young children can be easly influence.
But
Television adverts are a highly discussed topic, often because people don't want to watch them.
However they have a big effect on us and we are greatly influenced by them even if we don't want to admit it.
Often these adverts are about lifestyle products or other things we use in everyday life.
But should these adverts also be used to influence small children aged two to five?
First of all you should ask yourself if your child which is that young should be watching TV anyway.
But why should we show them adverts this will only influence them and they won't have a freemind as a child.
Because if you show a child an advert of unhealthy food everyday it will remember it at some stage and will be influenced by the advert.
So when it sees this product in real life it will probably want it because it has seen it a lot.
Also it is not a big use to show cildren these adverts because only a minority will remember them or unterstand them especially if they are two years old how should they know what they are watching.
Another point is that children at this age learn a lot so they should learn basic things like talking and walking however if they watch TV adverts they won't learn anything.
On the other side it can be useful to show children adverts because they can then recognize them and want them and this is a good thing for companys which are advertising their products.
For example if the children see a small bike being advertised it will slowly but surely be interested if not want the bike.
This then could lead the parents to buy it because they want to make their kids happy.
Also if the adverts are useful they can help the child so if you show them a math advert they will want to know what it is and will alter maybe be interested in this topic which is a good thing.
In my oppinion however these adverts are completely useless both for the companies and the children/ parents.
Because the children are way to small to recognize these things that well and if they do the companies are just using them to make even more money.
So I just think it is moraly not correct to show them these adverts.
Television advertising can be very diverse.
It always depends on the advertisement itself.
If the advertisement contains any possibly vulgar footage, it should not be allowed under any circumstances.Young childern, especially between the age of two and five years, should not be seeing those types of advertisements.
What also shouldn't be allowed is any type of vulgar or even rude language.
They can learn the language very fast and as a result even use it themselves.
And of course advertisements with any type of sexual content should be strictly forbidden.
For exampe advertisments for condoms or sex toys.
Young children should not be seeing advertisments of that type at their age.
Now all the other advertisments, like for instance a car advertisment, can be seen by young children.
They don't really harm anyone and children of that age are not intrested in buying a car anyways so they won't be affected.
Also food advertisments or advertisments for cleaning tools of any kind, like for example a toothbrush or soap to wash the dishes, can be allowed.
They don't really harm anyone and might even be interesting for the parents.
The only advertisments which might give the parents a headache would be toy advertisments.
There's the possibility that the children see the toys on television and start asking for them until the parents finally decide to buy them.
But apart from robbing the parents money, toy advertisements aren't really harming anyone so they can be allowed.
In my opinion the television crew might want to sort out the advertisements a bit better so that the parents are able to leave their children in front of the television without having the fear of them possibily seeing any vulgar or rude content.
Imagine a child.
It is your daughter and she sits in front of the Television.
Right now it is commercial time and they are showing a commercial of the newest barbie doll.
They show the barbie in a beautiful pink car and everything looks so real.
The girl who is playing with the barbie seems to be it's best friend  and they talk about their holidays and do lots of entertaining things.
I think in this example it gets clear, that the commercial was not very realistic but your daughter really believes, that this barbie doll will be different, than all the others she already owns.
She  wants to have such a friendship and that is only possible with this barbie doll.
On the other hand, the advertisement gives the girl some ideas of stories, that she could expierience with this barbie doll.
Her fantasy gets some thinking boosts.
And if the parents give the right direction to this fantasy, maybe the girl will have much more fun playing.
An other thing is, that the commercial seems  to have some prejudicies, because it is a girl who plays with the doll.
Boys maybe would also like to play with barbie dolls, but if you only hear barbie doll together with the expectation that girls play with them, a boy will not play with one on his o
I think a TV commercial can have negative aspects like, that the child believes all the promises, that the advertisement tells and it can be very disapointed if it gets the product and realizes, that it can not talk or it does not even move or drive a car.
The parents also play an important role in helping the child understand the commercial and having the right expectations about the real product.
Every evening thousands of children from all over watch television.
There are special children programs but even on them there is advertising.
But why children have to watch this?
Shoud it even be forbidden to do advertising directed towards young chidren?
In the following text I'll show some pros and cons an my opinion.
One reason why chidren shouldn't have to watch it is that they even don't have money to buy something.
The advertisment on the Television is just for adults.
And it is planed that the children ask their parents to buy something they've seen in the advertisment.
For instance if a little girls sees an pink, fluffy unicorn in an advertisment she cries as long as the parents buy it for her.
It is influence and not fair.
Children shoud enjoy their lives as long as they can.
Nobody like to watch advertisment and everybody is angry when it comes during a film.
From year to year there is more and more.
When it goes on like this we won't watch something else on TV.
And then even our children should have the choise watch something else.
On the other side later they are anyway confronted with this world.
It would be nice to stop the advertisment on television but it is unthinkable.
We live in a word full of advertisment and marketing.
Adults and adolecent have to watch it too.
It doesn't hurt a for example four year old boy to see it on the TV.
Yes, it's influence and perhaps boring but not dangerous.
And their parents are also old enough to say no, if they don't want to buy anything.
If the parents don't want their children to watch it they can forbid them to watch all kind of television.
In conclusion advertisment directed towards young children doen't make any sense.
In my opinon it can be allowed but it is useless.
Even though I mostly agree with the statemant, there are a lotof complex problems surounding it.
I shall start with an example from our past: In England in the 1950s television only just started gaining mass popularity.
At the time there were only about two TV channels to choose from (BBC 1, BBC 2 and possibly BBC 3).
They all were funded by the government and didn't therefore have to have advertising to be able to fund themselves.
This all changed when the first commercial TV station was born.
This was inherently a good thing, as it offered another choice next to the BBC channels, but it was a subject to heavy critisism because of the commercials.
People asked the same question as today, whether or not it should be alowed to advertise directly to their children.
But there was a major difference.
Ads were hidden directly into children's TV shows.
For example you could be wathing the Flintstones and suddently one of the characters would pull out a pack of cigarets and start sellig it to your children.
This "fluid" ads were quickly banned.
As all other ads seemed much better and less agresive people learned to live with them.
In today's age things are more complicated, as many children (even aged two to five) are actualy able to buy thing on their own even if it means using their parents' phone or credit card.
This of course is not common, but still makes the problem more important.
This of course doesn't only apply to TV, but also to the internet and games aimed at children.
Probably th biggest argument for keeping the things the way they are is that buissnises have to somehow make money.
The children market is huge and advertising to it is mostly a safe bet.
It mostly comess down to watching over your children and keeping and eye on what they do and watch.
On one hand, television advertising to children isn't good, because they alsways want to have, what they see in the advertising and almost it is not as good as in the advertising.
So parents buy things for their children to make them happy and in the end the children play once or twice with it and then it becomes uninteresting and boring.
But when the parents say "No, you won't get it, we don't by this game, because you won't play with it.
", the children are angry with the parents.
On the other hand the advertising could be good for parents, if they're looking for christmas or birthday presents they could find something good, because adults can more see the differences between fantasy and reality.
They could better imagine how the games are without the animals or faries in the advertising.
Some people think that television is bad for children, even when they look a film or a serie, because they're so focused on the screen, that they becomes agressive, when parents turn off the TV.
Other people say that looking films can be positive, because children learn something new.
In my opinion, in the advertising it looks always great, but when you buy it, it is much more worse.
For me, the advertising for children is okay, but i think it should be more realistic and with less fantasy.
I must honestly say that I never saw an advertising directed toward children aged two to five and for me it also doesn't make sense to produce such advertisings, because children don't or shouldn't spend more time watching television than their parents.
Moreover, children can't really react on the advertisings, because they don't have money to buy something by themselves so the goal of an advertising isn't reached anyway.
But if it should be allowed or not is the other question.
In my opinion it's a bit mean to show children things they would like to have or like to do, but they have not the chance to buy it by themselves.
But I wouldn't forbid it beacause it's the parent's exercice to "control" their children while watching television.
Children shouldn't watch television anyway, they should go out and play with other childen, so there isn't any problem with advertisings.
All in all I think this isn't a subject, that is important to discuss because like I said in the beginning, I've never seen advertisings directed toward young children.
Televison is something so important for the people in community that we can`t live without televison.
From time to time the children started watching television earlier in their lifes.
But television for young children isn`t in every situation something good.
With the television children are able to learn a lot.
There are a lot of TV programms in which children can learn a lot about animals and the nature etc.
With the televiosion they are using their time with learning new things and don`t vasting their time.
In some cases is it also useful to help learning a language.
But there are also a lot of negative points.
They can lose their sozial connection to other persons if they are only watching TV.
They don`t go out and play with some other children for example.
An other point ist that they can developp an addiction to the television.
If they are addicted they will not be interested in other things what could be a problem for their future.
An other problem of television is that TV isn`t really for 100% exactly.
We don`t realize that but our brain.
For example the sound and the movement of the lips from the persons in TV when the have a dialog or something like that isn`t exactly to the same time.
The timing is not correct.
Our brain realize that.
And in this young years of the children the brain can save a lot of informations.
And when for example this timing isn`t for 100% correct they don`t learn for example a language.
It is more useful to learn a language when the children listen to a person who read a book in this language.
In our age we don`t realize so small mistakes of TV.
I would clearly say that it is mor useful for young children if they watch not a lot TV or start to watch when they are seven or older.
They learn more when the play with other children or listen to persons who read something for them.
In my opinion is it completly unnecessary when children start watching TV with two years.
I support that television advertesing directed toward young children shouldn`t be allowed.
We are living in a world where we are constantly under the influences of the media.
Especially advertising belongs to our everyday live and there is hardly anyone who does not get affected by it.
Because of that there is a lot of critism going on.
Where do we have to draw a line?
Shoud it be aloud to direct adertisement toward all people?
in this essay i will display the advantages and disadvantages of television advertising directed toward young children

A salesmen would say of course.
It doesn`t do any harm and on top of that there are many perks to it.
Young children should see what the world holds and they should be able to grasp the wealth and luxury that adults do.
Also they are easily influenced to buy something and can talk their parents into purchasing things.
On the other hand we have concerned parents and caring grandparents who say that their children and grandchildren shouldn`t be constantly on the line for such things.
children should be protected from those influenes that pressure them into buying things that they don`t necessarly want or need.
I think that television advertising directed towards children shouldn`t be allowed because as a child you can`t really differenciate between you wishes, desires and necessities and therefore it is unfair to pressure them or their parents into buying things.
On the other hand I think that it is over all the parent`s responsibility to protect their children by limting their vulnerability and setting rules to the usage of television as well as other medias.
But those parents could be easily helped by setting a law.
Everywhere are advertiments.
Mostly there are only pictures, but in television advertisment includes moving pictures.
Parents who haven't time to play with their children put them in front of the TV all day.
The advertiser knows that.
With their clips they can influence this children.
Children who spend their leasuretime watching television see a lot of bullshit.
Not only the advertising.
Some series for children try to support the enfantil development but mostly they aren't really helpfull.
The children believe what the television say is true and if an advertisment says that it is super cool to have this car they think their life can only be cool with this car.
The one who complains about the advertisment directed torward childern are the parents.
but if they don't let their children sit the whole afternoon in front of the TV, the children wouldn't even see the advertisment.
If the children don't spend their time sitting in front of the TV,  advertisning torward children aged two to five wouldn't be a problem.
The parents could also limit the TV time down to one episode so there wont be any andvertising.
The game producer ( not computergames!)
has to bring his stuff to the people.
The parents mostly buy their chilrdern what they want to have.
The easiest way to make children believe they want something is television advertising.
In the eye of the producer, this is the only way to sell their stuff then after the children saw something they want, they are telling it their parents and they are buing it.
In my opinion the real problem is that the children are spending to much time in front of the TV.
I don't see a problem in the advertising torward children.

In the weekends, I take guard to my five year old niece and sometimes, we want to watch some TV escpecially the children's programe.Before the climax of the plot ,we are interrupted by annoying advertisers.
The problem is that they are not for children's eyes and I have to cover them.
I feel ashamed because it is not that late.
I would propose that children in this age should not be directed advertised because the content is sexualized.
The advertising has changed, they are more sexualized content also in the children's program.Cartoons aquire costumers for their toy and the appearance is not childlike.
That could be a danger for the growing up of the children because they children are in these phase naive and see a model in them.
That view can cause conflicts between the children and the parents which can, in worst case, loose their control.
Second, the language is developping in this time and if they hear for example curse words from the ad, it could have consequences for their language skills in the future.
The direct communication between children and ads is powerful and influences the language.
The produces use it for their profit but forget the impacts for their young costumers.
At the end, it would be my advise to the advertisers to make theyproduct more childlike becuse it could have serious impacts for their later consumers, the children.
I think censoring is not effective, to fit in for the childrens growing up would be much more sustainable.
During the life, a person earns a lot of knowledge by making mistakes and by making it better the next time.
Every person learns from experiences he or she made, from adventures he or she had and from spending time for thinking about things in life.
As more experiences as you make, as more you build your own opinions about things in life.
Children between two and five years don't have a lot of experiences.
They still live in their own world where everything is great and sweet and they don't know any danger or influencing people or advertisment.
They believe almost everything you tell them.
In case of that a television advertising which is directed toward young children makes no sense and shouldn't be allowed because they're too naïve and to young to make own decisions.
I would say a young boy aged three years would be scared about a telephone call with a unknown person who wants to sell a him something!
First of all the child would ask itsself why this unknown person wants a telephone conversation with him and not with his parents as usual.
The seller would just use this little guy for making money by influencing him with fascinating toys and sweet animals.
It's so much easier to influence young children than adults, because adults know that the unknown person at the telephone promises false facts about the product he wants to sell.
I absolutely don't agree with this statement.
It's not only unfair for the young children, I'm sure that also parents wouldn't be fascinated about a television advertising which is directed toward their children.
Otherwise it's very intelligent of the unknown person to influence young children with their call.
They really know how to make money...
But I'm still against a television advertising towards young children.
One site I agree with this statement but at the otherside I think we can't forbit children watching televison.
I have grown up in the year 1999.
And my little brother in the year 2004.
There are only five years between us,but so many things are completely diffrent.
For example the consum of social media.
So many children, don't go out for playing football or to meet other children.
I see less children outside than ever before.
And if my little brother asked his friends,if they wanted to come outside for playing football, they didn't wanted to come because they prefered to stay at home to play their video games.
They wanted to stay at home,to watch the television, or wantend to play with their new I Phone.
They had their own friends in their computerworld.
And I think this is so sad.
When I was in that age, I played football or volleyball with all my friends outside.
And my parents forbidden me watching the TV the whole afternoon.
My opinion is, that it is totally okay, if children aged two to five watch television, but their parents should set limits, because small children can't say what's good for them.
But their parents know it.
And they should only permit their children, to watch movies or series, that aren't scary or something like that.
I know that so many partents don't see what kind of movies their children watch.
And that's terrible.
But I kow there is nothing that we can do, the world is dominated by the new technology, and this technology is getting better and better.
The new genaration needs a  Sream everywhere.
It doesn't matter if this is an I Phone where they can watch TV or if this isa Television.
In my opinion children should not be able to watch advertisements in television.
One explicit reason is that the influence on children is much stronger than on an average adult.
Children tend to soak everything up they see.
And every thing they see can change their personality or influence their personal developement.
Kids who experience terrible things in their childhood are more likely to get into any kind of addiction.
That is why a child who sees some advertisements aldready starts to think in a way that takes consumtion for granted.
But this is not true.
Consumtion, as we do it today, is not eternal and therefore should not be promoted, especialy not in front of a child who is not able to think critical yet.
These advertisements directed to young children may even be a danger for their parents.
Because the persons who produce these advertisements do not care about the children, they care about their parents' money.
So if a child wants something out of an advertisement, he starts to beghis mother to buy him for example a new toy.
This scenario can have two different ends.
Rhe first end would be that his mother doesn't want to buy him a new toy.
This might cause some troubles.
The second end would be that his mother buys him his toy.
So she supports the consumtion promoted from people who make a living out of abusing our world.
In conclusion I think that unless you are a person who does not care about children you shouldn't allow advertising directed to young children.
When I think about my little 4-year-old brother watching TV and wanting me to come and look on the advertise on TV, because he wants to have this new Playmobil-Car, I do have my concerns about television advertising towards young children.
But lets start over:
Television advertising makes people wanting to buy things and maybe also some stuff, they do not really need or know what to use them for.
So in general advertise influences us a lot.
The influence is not really based on the age, but what is based on it, is the reaction on this wish.
Adults can handle their wishes much better than children can.
Kids live absolutely in the moment and they do not care whether they need a new Playmobil-Car or not.
They just want to have it.
And so the try to convince the parents to buy them this car.
Now it is the responsability of the parents to show them why they can or cannot have a new Playmobil-Car.
Children need an adult to make the rational decision and cannot do it by themselves.
Adults can, but sometimes it uses to be very hard to face the truth, that one really does not need to buy this.
When I think again about my brother wanting somthing he has seen on television, it can be very annoying when he is first begging, then shouting and sometimes crying, just to get me to buy him this thing.
So in such a situation I would say that television advertising direted toward young children should not be allowed.
But if we think rational, we recognize that when we do forbit television advertising towards young children, we need to forbit the advertising towards adults too.
Because children somehow have the advantage that their parents, that are more neutral that the kids are, can decide before buying.
But when adults are influenced by advertises they do not need to ask someone and so maybe they buy things faster than a kid can convince his parents.
In conclusion I would say that television advertising directed towards yound childre do not have to be forbidden, because it is anyway not that healthy to watch too much TV and parents should be able to handle their childrens wishes and decide rationally.
I also think that if it really were a problem, one had to forbit advertise in front of stores too, because if advertisting is a problem at all, then it should be elliminated everywhere.
Television advertising is something we see a lot when we watch TV.
It is a way to promote new products and make it appealing enough so that people want to buy it.
Often, it does work because a lot of adults and also children watch enough television to encounter these.
Television advertising directed toward young children has its positive and negatif sides.
If someone promotes a product for little children, like for example a new toy, the children can talk to their parents and maybe they will buy it for them.
Therefore, the children are used by the promoters to get the parents spending money on something they have seen in television.
At the end, children get influenced a lot by television and the producers gain a lot of money from this.
Promoting something over television can also be good since children see things they have never seen before and maybe they want to try out something new and exciting.
As for negatif facts, the children just follow what the guys in the television say and of course, they don't really think that hard about it if it's right or wrong.
Therefore, I think that adults, who are not their parents or family, should not meddle in a life of a child and decide fot it which toy it wants to have or not (except it is dangerous of course).
It should have the right to choose!
Though, if a friend of one of the children has got a new toy and the other child wants it, it's still a way of promoting the new toy but at least the child saw it in real and not only in a screen.
In conclusion, I think it's fine to use television advertising for children but one should consider that children still should be able to choose by themselves if they want something or not.
I would prefer it, if they could choose what they want in an actual store.
Is television advertising for young children good or bad?
This is a question for parents which is realy important in the education of their children.
First of all I have to say, that young children in the age between two or five shouldn't watch television alone in general.
For example, children in the age of two.
They have better things to do as watching something in the TV.
They can play with toys or they can go outside with their mother.
But they shouldn't sit inside and watch TV.
If the kids turn older for example in the age of five, than they can watch sometimes their series which they love.
But only the series and not the advertising between them.
I think often the advertising in the TV isn't for so little children.
Because mostely the advertising is for older children or for parents, so this isn't good to see by the young children.
On the otherside this children see the advertising and after that, they want the thing who they have seen.
For example, they see a new toy and after that they go to the parents and want that they will buy this toy.
So the parents have always this nerving children which want something.
The advertising in TV is often on a deep niveau and hasn't much background.
Also it isn't very intelligent.
So for the education of the children it's not very helpful.
Finally I would say, that the children in the age of two or three shoudn't watch TV and the older kids can watch TV but only one serie of propably twenty minutes and after that they have to turn of the television.
So they stop watching, before they can see the advertising.
So I agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Today the spectrum of diffrent television advertisings is huge, there are advertisings for man and woman as well as for every age including young children.
But are those advertisings directed towards young children a good influance?
Or do they even have such a negative influance towards children that they should be forbidden?
Advertisings, especially about food, do not always tell the truth and can have a negative impacked towards the health of the children.
For example the advertising about nutella says that their product makes a healthy start in the day, what is clearly not true.
Young children are not able to judge wheter the told stuff is true or not.
But besides that, the perants should tell them and look for the health of their children and tell them the truth about what advertisings make children believe.
But when the television advertising should not be allowed, what kind of advertising would be between children movies?
It is not reliable to show them advertisings made for adults, because they could scare the children and could cause an even worse influance than children advertising.
In my opinion advertising towards young children does not need to be forbitten.
Every advertising influance people, so either all advertisings should be forbitten or not.
It is not a good option to show children advertisings made for adults, because they can have an as worse influance as those made for children.
In today's society advertising is a big part of television.
These advertisment target different types of people and interests.
And as it comes some also target young children between two and five years old.
Obviously this brings several problems with it and the question is, if advertisment directed toward young children should be permitted or not.
First of all advertisment is a way to earn money by making people buy the things which are showed in this advertisment.
A big amount of companies use this tool what results in a big competition.
Because of this competition each company tries to specializes themselves for one type of costumer.
Taking that to consideration it is only logical that some are targeting young kids to prevent having a big competition what maximises their income.
However, making advertisment meant for young children brings a probelm with it.
These children are victims of the tactics of several companies.
They know that children are an easy and vulnerable target because they are not advanced in their evolvement yet.
Children are not able to evaluate situations like we adults do.
Despite this knowledge the advertiser is ruthlessly using those children.
Therefore, young childrens from age two to five are a victim of advertisement and should be protected.
In order to sell a product many companies are using advertisment to make it look better.
Over time the competition between those companies gets bigger and new targets have to be found - the kids.
In their early stage of growth they are a good target and easily influenced.
They are, in fact, victims.
In order to preotect them advertising directed toward young children should be banned.
Let the innocent young humans be safe and free from things which they are not able to handle.
In the following essay, I will talk about my opinion to TV advertisements, which are directed toward young children.
There are many different types of advertisements.
Some are pretty funny and some are just stupid and I'd wish they are taken offline immediately.
Because I don't like my time being wasted of stupid ads, which tell me lies about prices or facts.
And that's exactly the point.
There are too many lies and wrong facts shown in TV, the Internet or just on a screen in public.
The older we get, the better we can make differences about true or false information.
But children cannot do this and due to their thurst of knowledge, they believe pretty much everything, eventhough the information is completely wrong.
They get a wrong information and believe in this facts they are told.
There should clearly be set a difference between ads for children, which contain maybe a game or an idea for their christmas wish and ads for older people, which know what's wrong or what's true.
But not ads from greenpeace or wwf, in what awful conditions our planet is.
Cause they are mostly showing only the bad (or good) sides and chilren get a completely wrong opinion of it.
When they get such informations, they should be teached about the whole subject and not only one part of it.
Anyway, in my opinion adverstisements are a waste of money and recources, the companys got.
For example the Coca Cola Advertisement.
There was made a study where people were shown a Coca Cola Advertisement in the cinema and they were asked which drink they had bougt in the break.
The advertisement didn't change their opinion at all.The companies would better spend some more of their in exploring new technologies, to reduce the carbon footprint of everybody in here.
Especially our children, which don't need those advertisement, will be thankful to us having at least tried to save their future.
I think it depends on the specific situation.
It plays a rule what the children are looking at the television.
If they are looking ah childrenseries for their ages than it should be allowed to look television, but not to often.
Every day looking television is to much for their ages but one or time times in the week should be allowed.
Because I think it is possible to learn of looking televison, their are many series or movies which have something usefull to leran also for young kids.
It should be find a combination between looking television and doing more other things in the free time.
Reading or at this age looking books is more important or better than looking the whole time television.
But a little bit looking would be possible.
It is okey to looking a little bit television,because for one reason the children have for a little time something to do, the parents can do in the same time other things, they mustn't look really hard of the children.
And the children can also learn intressting things and they can see new things, which they wouldn't see without looking television.
It should be something special for the young kids, the parents shouldn't allowed their kids to looking often television.
The children should have the feeling that looking television is special and not something you can do every time.
SO in the end the perfect solution should be that the children are allowed to looking television but only movies or films which are for their ages and they can look only not often television.
The question if television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not is actually discussed very much.
It is a question which have many different opinions.
Some people say that television advertising directed toward young children is the key to a good childhood.
And they say it is good that they can watch television and so the parents have more freetime.
For parents it is very hard to have a child which is aged between two to five.
So to let them watch television is a good option to have a bit of freetime.
But the other side says that to let a child aged two to five watch advertising television is not good for the child.
Then in this time the mother is not there and the child do not get love.
Also many people say that for the education and for the developpment of the child it is very bad to watch television when you habe a age like this.
So they can become bad at school or bad in their job later.
All in all we see that there are many supporters that kids aged two to five can watch advertising television.
Because then the parents can get a bit of freetime.
But there are also many proposers which say that it is not good for the developpment of the child.
Now the question is if there will be soon a law for this case?
Advertising

It is known that children like to watch cartoons or other tv-shows which mach their age.
The producers of these tv-programms know that it's helping their company if they show a lot of advertising directed toward young children because they get money from the other companies for showing their products to children.
The question is should that be allowed?
Doesn't it count as manipulation?
Everyone knows the reaction of a little girl who sees a pretty doll on televison or a young boy who sees a nice electronic car.
They run to their parents and ask them if they could buy it for them.
Most of the parents aren't ready to do so and that's the point where the disappointment comes in.
The children start to cry or get angry and that after every single advertisment.
In other words it slowly ruins their character.
Unfortunatelly an other reaction is jealousy.
A child sees another child playing with the one toy it desperatelly wanted to have.
The child which is jealous could start to think about stealing the toy what would be even worse.
It leads to a bad life with no job, no money or even going to prison.
On the other side it could make them more interested in working and earning their own money when they get older.
Furthermore it makes them more and more independend and it helps them to get through their life on their own.
In my opinion they shouldn't allow showing advertisments towards young children.
The children shouldn't watch televison that much at all because it's better for their health when they play outside with their friends.
They shouldn't care about what they have or they don't have.
They should enjoy their life.
I think it's okay if they get presents but they shouldn't be spoiled with gifts and toys because that would be bad for their character and they wouldn't come so far with this way of thinking.
Advertising can be really abboying.
For exemple when you want to watch a youtube video about cars and you have to watch a clip about a datingwebsite first.
But for parents can it be even worse, because not they get trapped by advertising, there kids do.
When you get odler you learn to understand the differents between what you need and what you would like to have, and you know what you are able to afford.
You have the ability to decide what you want to spend your money for.
For young children thats diffrent.
They do not know how to handle money, they can not really tell the differents between what they want and what they need.
So they are great victims for advertising.
But the problem is they haven't even the money to buy it, so the real victims of advertising directed toward young children, are their parents.
They have to deal with crying babys, because they refuse to buy them a new toy.
Maybe they really would like to buy it for their children but they can't afford it can be heartbreaking if they see them being sad.
Another possibility would be if the parents already have problems to show dominance, and it gets even more difficult when they see new stuff on television all the time.
So it's a question about what is more important for us.
Do we want free economic possibilities or do we want to help the parents raise the next generation?
For me it's definitly the second point.
I think it's already a big challenge to be a parent and we do not have to make it more difficult for them, by using little children without experience as their weakness.
In this essay, I am writing about television advertising directed toward young children.
The question is, are this kinds of adds okay or should it not be allowed.
In my opinion, it is totally okay to show children things like that, because for the economics it is importent to catch money from the kids.
I mean when a kid likes a new toy from the television spot, then it is clear when it askes for it by the parents.
And if the parents are grateful and have enough money to buy it them go for it.
But when they haven't got enough money, why should the spend money on a television for the kids.
It is important that a country can earn enough money and for that they should also go for the children.
A full school career costs a lot for a country and why shouldn't give them some money back.
I can understand a father who doesn't like these kind of adverts, but then he has to search the problem by his salary.
Maybe he has to make rules, how much a child can spend on toys.
The kids have to learn how to spend money, but the main problem isnt television advertising.
A good father is someone who loves to spend money for their kids, because nothing makes him more happier than a happy face of his child.
We have to look at this theme from two sides.
One side is a worker at a toy industrie.
The other one is a broke human, because the own kid costs a lot...
I just realised that i made the whole essay wrong, but what can I do when the description in written in German.
A good argument for adverts in the television is, that everybody from the economic side profites.
A negative statement is that a kid gets influenced even before the can think alone.
They cannot build their own opinion.
For the guy who reads this, you're wasting your time.
haha.
I'm sorry but i don't know what I should write anymore.
:/ I'm sitting here, and I am waiting until the 30 minutes are done, I also think tha i am wasting my time.
I think a human never gets mature, only the toys are getting more expensive.
Children that are two to five years old, often decide things they want by looking.
Many companies that sell products for young children, advertise their products on many media platforms.
But the most popular platform is the television.
Many children are allowed to watch an episode of children program for example Teletubbies or Dora the explorer.
Inbetween the program the television company often show advertisements for games or other things that young children like.
If these companies would not advertise their products, the market for toys would breakdown.
Let me illustrate this point.
A young boy saw a LEGO product in an advertisement.
Now this young boy wants this Lego toy because the advertisements attracted him.
What the boy then does, is to ask the parents if he could have this toy.
As many parents only wnat the best for their children, they buy everything the child wants.
This means that they spend a lot of money.
As a result of this the parents support the economy in the country they live in.
A second point is that young children get used to the money system that exists in the whole world.
It starts to realise that you need to have money to buy things.
This means that the child learns how to use money.
All in all I disagree with the statement that was mentioned above because with advertisements children and their parents support the local economy.
The children also learn how to use money which is very helpful once they are older.
The first thing that comes in my mind reading this statement is that there are only toy companies which advertise towards young children.
Advertisement are here to attract a specific group of people to buy something.
What else  would a child desire than toys?
We all now young children like to scream and cry if they do not get what they want immediately.
It would therefore be a nightmare for parents if their child wishes for a toy  it just saw on the TV and starts to cry because the toy does not magically appear.
But the parents should not just shut down the television for their child.
Nowadays the TV plays a major role in our society especially during the childhood.
The cartoons and the early-morning serie cheers every child up.
The advertisement shows a child what is up and popular these days.
There may be some conspiracies that advertisements have hidden manipulative effects and are therefore a bad influence on children.
It might be far fetched but humans in this young stage of life are the most influencal and they can easily be convinced to something.
That would be one of the greates fears for over-protective parents.
In conclusion people should be less paranoid about the advertisement having a bad influence on their child.
Most of the advertising are for toys and there is probably no evil mastermind behind the screen who tries to manipulate the child from an ad.
Parents should be more concerned about their child browsing the internet.
The aim of this essay is to clear the contovers statement "television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed".
Then nowadays more and more young children "growing up in front of a TV".
So for many people leads this to problems and they want to disallowed it for young children.
On the one hand, the children are very interessted by the TV, so they can stay hours in front of the TV and watch children series.
That makes it very easy for parents and they can do other important work or clean the house.
But on the other hand, children should go outside and have fun with other children or play with the parents instead of sitting inside in front of TV.
If children only sit inside in front of the TV, they will lose there social conactions to other people and there social skils will disappear.
In my opinion, this ban for young children is a good idea, because children should play with other children instead of watching TV.
But how should this ban work?
How can we contoll it?
In many households the televisions are daily on and the children are sitting before those every time.
Is it better if the children aged two to five can't watch television anymore?
In our time childs are often confronted with televisions or smartphones.
I think that some parents just sit there kids before the television because for they it is easyer to handle and they mustn't play with the kids and can do other things for example the household.
First of all, children have to "explore" the world in nature and have to learn to speak.
To use the language they can play together.
But if they are watching tv they do not play and practice there voice they just hear the language.
On the other side many stories or series have a moral end or they could learn about the things they've watched.
But I think that the children are to young to learn about those.
Another point is that they can't make mistakes and learn from those if they're watching tv.
When they are outside and for example fall from a trampolin, they learn that they have to be more concentraded when they jump.
In summary, I think that it should be alloud that children could watch tv, but I think that the parents have to think more about how long their kids are sitting before it and to chose what their watching.
And not just sit the children before it because it is more comfortable for those.
And for the parents it should be clear that it is really important to play with the kids and be outside in nature.
While most people are quite anoyed of them, but still have to accept them, there are still parts of it, which have to be discused.
We are talking about commercials and in this case, if it should be forbidden to advertise directly to young children in the age from two to five.
An essay by me and myself.
(Idk if I'm allowed to wright my name, so...)

First of all, I think it is clear that commercials try to manipulate us, to make us believe that we need something, which we sometimes, do not really need at al.
And it should be also clear that children, especially as young as two to five, are realy easy to manipulate.
And I think it is right to say that companys should not make use of the naivity of young children.
The problem resulting out of this is, that children want things so bad, which can get verry annoying for parents.
Just imaging your children, all the time screaming for the new mega, super, duper, action, power figurine.
But it can also lead to other problems.
It can change the view about certain products.
I mean, just look back at the old Malboro commercials, the Malboro man was one of the coolest guys a lot of adults can remember nowadays and people start to conect beeing a cool person to smoking, even if you probably know how bad it is for you and your body.
So you see, that the wrong commercials in front of the wrong persons can cause many problems.
But on the other hand, there are a lot of problems at the question, how to make sure, the youngest of us do not recieve theese commercials.
I mean, we can not stop streaming commercials in television nor can we stop hanging them at walls etc.
Because that would mean to have no commercials at all.
An this is definetly not in the sence of companies.
And even if most commercials are stupid and not really necesairy, there are still some, which could be verry helpfull.
And yeah, for children that is probalby a play-doh clown which can grow his own hair, but the next birthday will come, and it is good to know what you want (it is also usefull for parents which would not have any idea what to give their childs).
And last but not least, I think it would make things worse if you didn't see comercials until you are five and suddenly all these influences.
No one would be prepared and companies would benefit of your naitivity, even stronger than before.
With that said, I think it is not necesairy to change anything about our commercial system as it runs right now.My myself, I used to watch a lot of commercials and I think it didn't really hurt me at all.
Sure, as a kid, I would liked to have all these toys, but as you get older, you start to see trough all these promeses and great looking products and start to see what you realy need.
And when you get to this point, it can be verry helpfull to see this laptop for just 150£ which could replace the one you just totally destroyed the day before because you decided to accidentaly throw your softdrink all over it.
But well, that is just my own view about it, thank you for reading.
Television advertising is one of the most important advertising methods, because most people watch television.
Even if they know what the aim of advertisement is, they are influenced by it and buy often things they saw in television advertising.
But children shouldn't be influenced.
Young children shouldn't watch television at all.
They could be confused by the fact that the audio doesn't fit to what they see.
The audio is always slightly delayed.
Advertisement directed towards the children doesn't help, it makes them even more addicted to the screen.
Maybe they don't understand what advertisement is, but they see things they would like to have.
They would watch the television more often because they enjoy seeing puppies or something else.
Children can't buy things they see in the advertisement.
The parents will decide, if they buy for example a puppy or not.
The children would of course try to convince their parents, but the adults don't buy everything their children want.
It would be more useful to direct television advertisement towards the parents.
If they think it would be great for the children to have something, they will buy it.
I think, that young children shouldn't watch television.
But this is the responsibility of the parents.
If they don't allow watching television, it isn't necessary to forbid television advertising directed towards children, because they won't see it either way.
Also, directing advertisement towards children aged two to five isn't useful, because the children have no money.
So my opinion is, that the parents shouldn't let their children watch television.
Television advertising directed toward young children
Television manipulation is known as long as the television itself.
People are tricked with commercials and advertising, because this is the easiest way to get them buying or making something.
Everybody can be manipulated, but as humans grow up, they can think difrently and ask themself whether it is right or not.
Children at the age of five can not decide such things.
I agree whith the satement, but this is caused by a complete different reason.
First of all, we have to decide, wether advertising towards two to five year olds makes sense at all.
Their brains are on the developing state of any other aduld animal such as a cat or a mouse.
These animals can be manipulated very well.
This is also showed in several tests, where the hunger and the instinct of surviving is used to force the test object to do anything.
The difference between humans and other animals is, that humans can reflect themselfs and ask who we are.
The earliest hildhood memories date around the age of three.
This means, young children are not more than any other animal, not reflecting its own actions.
As we look at these things from this point of view, advertising towards these little children is not only useless in many cases but also unfair.
On the other hand side I ask myself: Why are children in front of a television in the first place?
Whst is the meaning of childhood, the meaning of life when it is wasted in front of a television?
Humans do not think in the logic way they are teached to think.
Ten years additional to the life of a 30 years old is just a quarter of the whole life.
For a ten year old the life span is doubbeled.
S time seems to strech as we get older what is, in fact, the case, because with every second you get a smaller piece of the time you already got.
As we go further we see that a pretty short span in front of a television is a huge amount of time for younger people.
Childhood is one of the most important times in the life of a human being.
It can be used better than just in front of a televison.
Its not bad to watch a movie sometimes with the parents.
But in this case there is no advertising and the discussion is wothless.
To summerise, I can say that I am against advertising towards young children.
It is well known that a lot of brands would do everything to get more clients and obviously to earn more money.
A lot of companies spend tons of money for a good advertition campagne.
But is it okay to direct television advertising towards young children?
First, television advertising directed toward young children can be very useful for brands because children don`t think as much as adults do when they see an advertisement.
Children just think that for example the toy they see in the advertisement is funny to play with so they want to have it and they probably tell their parents the next time they see the toy in a store or when their birthday is coming up and they`re asked for their wishes.
This can really help companies to earn money and there are companies which only run thanks to this.
On the other hand, television advertising for young children can be dangerous and confusing for them.
Sometimes in television advertisments, things are happening which can`t possibly happen in real life.
Younger children may not understand that and for example suddenly get scared of their toys coming to life.
Even worse, they may try to copy certain actions which they see in an advertisment on television.
This can lead to very dangerous situations like children trying to climb out of the window or stand on a high wall.
After my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
I think they are too young to understand certain things and can easily misunderstand what they see.
As a better option, I would advice the companies to make good advertisments directed to parents because then they know that they get something good for their children.
Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
First of all, it helps the children to understand the world in a funny way.
On the other hand, they aren't playing on the outside while they are watching television.
Therefore, they are also missing the body movement while lying on the couch.
Television can help in education, but only as long as it isn't too much!
Children are learning the most when they are having fun or are interested in something.
While playing with their siblings or watching their favourite show, they are having fun and therefore learning something new.
Most television advertising for young children are made for this sole reason - the educate the children.
But while they are watching TV and learning something about the colours, they are missing the trees and flowers outside.
The connection to the green parts of the world is missing and that at a point in time where this could be humanity's downfall.
When the little ones aren't interested in mother earth, who protects it then from global warming?
Not only are they missing a huge part of nature and memories.
It is also not good for the body, when there is no movement in the childhood.
The muscles don't build up and also metabolism is suffering.
Also, they won't play soccer in the neighbours garden and probably won't be as interested in sports as the older generations where sports was the only free time activity.
In the end I think this subject isn't as black and white as it might seems.
Yes, I think children are learnig a lot during watching TV and they like to learn something this way.
On the other hand, you musn't underestimate the huge part nature and sport plays in all our lifes.
Best would be, if parents and siblings are doing some advertising together in the garden which is fun, so the role of the television isn't needed any longer.
The question is simple, like a monster is disguise,
should child equipment be directly advertised?
It doesn't matter if the families are wealthy,
we all agree that televivion is unhealthy.
But does the young age of toddlers affect
the television's unhealthy effect?
I've never been a good essay writer,
but when I write raps I appear brighter.
We all agree that there's no recipe
for right behavior on TV,
you know it's better not to mess with me,
'cause I can be your worst enemy.
A negative part about advertisement
is that in TV there aren't many wise men,
because all they care about is finance,
when I think about it I get frightened.
Not to mention that it's all a big contest,
and that the black boxes are like bombshells.
We can see the result in their notes,
how the stupidity explodes.
But in the end it doesn't stop the evolution,
I think about it writing my conclusion,
Forbidding it seems to me very useless,
so I'd allow it actually undisputed.
I don't know who I wrote this for,
but they can never enter my door,
where I keep my core,
my holy source of rhymes, that's for sure.
Young children do not have full conscience and can easily be manipulited.
Often, they can not know if the things that are shown in an advertising are true or can be true.
For example the advertising for "Kinderschokolade" is ckeay directed toward kids.
They see laughing and happy children eating this chocolate and giving them for example extra forces.
so they think, in real life, when they themselves eat this as well, they are afterwards as happy and as powerful like the kids in the advertising.
So they go to their parents and want them to buy this product, in this case "Kinderschokolade".
The parents themselves would not have bought it, but then, when the littel children ask them with a "dog-regard" they can not say no and buy it.
Exactly the same pheomene is wiht the McDonalds advertising for "HappyMeal".
The kids see the fries and burgers und hear the "yummy-sound" and, naive how they are, think that it is very tasty and want to get the little dolls or whatever that is offered with the food.
So they go to theparents and ask them to go to McDonalds with them to eat "HappyMeal".
So the parents have to buy things the would normally not and the kids get fat.
A positive argument is, that the economy augments because of the parents who have to buy things they do not really want to but they want to do a favour to their children.
So the eating and food companies profit from such advertisings directed toward children but also game and toy companies.
I personally think that it is not right of the companies to lance such advertisings, because the children at this age are not strong enough to not want to have the advertised stuff, because normally children want to get everythin that makes them laughig and that seems to be very tasty.
They are too young to deciede, if for example advertised food is healthy or not, if games are useful or make just dumb and aggressive, or if they will still like the toys after a week or if it is just nonsense that entertains two hours and after that it is just rubbish.
I think it is not fair from the companies, because of the children get just fat, dumb, aggressive, nervous, and want to get everything and the parents are nearly forceless beacause of they want to make their children happy and they often think that if the neighbours buy that stuff to for their kids, it has to be good.
But effectively they spend their money mostly for rubbish.
Nowadays advertisements are omnipresent, you see them when you leave your home in the morning to go to work,school or university, you see them when you are on your computer and surfing the internet and even when you are at home after a long day and want to watch a movie, there will always be commcercials everywhere and the further our technology develops the more we have to deal with a constant bombardement of advertisements or commercials.
So the question that posses itself is if it is okay to have global corporations subsequently implanting our desires in our brain, and where do you draw the line between advertisments and brain control, if you take coca cola for example, a lot of studies have been made to show that it can cause serious health issues when consumed every day as well as when you consume too much of it, for example bad teeth (because of the sugar) and other troubles you get, for example stomach ulcers due to all the acids it contents.
So the question is where does the urge of these children who drink coca cola come from, most likely due to advertisements which are programming them from young age.
The goal of these big corporations is to generate an urge to consume their product, in some way like a drug addict gets hooked on a substance and then needs more every time to achieve the same outcome.
To conclude I would state that it would be greatly contribute to our health, as well as an economic equality towards the people and a more natural development of a childs brain if it would be possible to stop advertisments towards young children.
Sadly this won't be easily done, because there are a lot of lobbies that need to make their point by staying in the game to grow bigger and bigger and make even more money, no matter what the costs are.
The time when a child is growing up is common to everybody.
But in this society the children are confronted earlier with the media such like on the television, mobile phone or on the computer.
While the parents let their children to watch childfriendly series on the TV there are also a lot of advertising.
But is it good for a two to five year old kid to look at so many advertisements?
Nowadays the children are being raised with much more attention and love than in the past.
It's known that parents usually want only the best thing for their child.
For instance when a kid sees something interesting on the Tv like a toy, they want it.
And the parents buy this toy because they know the child is going to play with it.
So the parents have some "free time" and the kid can play with the toy and also with the creativity of themselves.
But on the other hand the advertisements have an big influence on the children.
Not everything that appears on the Tv is also good for your child.
Today the opportunity to buy something is so big that means that the kids are constantly being confronted by advertisements on the Tv.
It's clear to everyone that children are children and don't think the way that adults do.
If they see something they want they're going to do everything just to have that thing.
And with that behaviour they're going to want everything they see.
They'll grow up with that behaviour and will be careless.
So the television advertising has an bigger influence on the future life of the children.
Nevertheless are televisions a part of the todays society children.
But we have to be carefull with how much time we spend or let our children spend with it.
The technology is moving forward but we should not forget that we have a real life to live.
In the last few years, there has been more and more advertisment on television for children, younger than the age of five.
Critcs say, this shouldn't be allowed.
Children are easily influenced, therefore adds might have an even bigger effect on them than they have on adults.
If they see something that looks cool on television, they will probably desire it which could, cause stress for their parents, since they might not be able to afford it or just simply don't want to spoil their kids.
On the other hand, selling things is always good for the economy and adds like this, will increase sellings of toys, since a lot of parents have trouble saying no to their children.
Strengthening the economy might be advantagous to all people, since it could increase the general living standars and might even lead to a reduction of taxes.
Furthermore, television adds might even make things easier for parents around christmas time, since their children will be able to pinpoint exactly what they want.
However, I believe, it's rather unusual for a child to have trouble finding a wish, so that might be unnecessary.
Adds on television might promote things which do not fit in the parents' moral priniciple.
For example, there could be an advertisment for toy guns.
The parents might be against violence and could be shocked if their child suddenly exclaims a wish for a toy gun.
It might be harder to be firm in one's principle if the television influents the childrens' mind strongly.
Personally, I think, advertising directed to this age group shouldn't need to be prohibited, it just shouldn't bring any profit.
Parents should not allow their children to watch TV in such a young age.
They could let them watch a movie once in a while but only if the parents themselves are present for it.
There are so many ways to occupy a little kid, ways that actually help the development of the brain and their ability to form relationships, while watching TV could potentially cause damage to their psychological development.
If parents would just not let their children watch TV, adds for the younger audience would seize to exist, since noone would profit from them anymore.
I firmly believe, this would be the best solution for all parties.
Essay-Television advertising directed  toward young children should not be allowed

In one hand is it not that good to make advertising to young children, because the advertising industry want that the children love the item, that is advertised for.
So the children go to their dad or mom to say, that they want this toy or these awesome shoes that light up when you wear it.
In the age of two to five, they believe what is said in the TV.
For example when an advertising comes on about shoes and they say, that these can breathe because it's GEOX, the children believe that and obviously want that.
On the other hand should advertising toward young children be allowed, because the advertising industry should have the right to advertise the toys they sell to the children.
Because for the industry it's important, that they can advertise their item, so they make income.
In the advertisement, they can lie a bit to make the item look better.
And for the children it looks cool so they convince their parents to buy it.
And with the cool comercial they made, the item will be better sold out.
And that really works.
In my opinion it should be allowed, because i don't think that an advertisement is that bad for children.
If the parents don't want that, the children don't have to watch TV.
I mean n
Well the first thought which came to my mind is that it really shouldn't be allowed just because children of this age are easy to influence.
I mean how many times have we seen in our life that you just have to tell kids something and if you tell it with conviction they most likley will agree with you and will tell it to other kids.
And these children are not really capable of analizing a commercial and forming their own opinions.
They just want it because it appeals to them or they don't.
I just don't feel like it's good for children at this age to bombard them with so many commercial.
So maybe you shoudln't prohibid them but reduce them.
But if I was a CMO of a company that sells children's toys I'd say that we need these commercials.
Because we need to give these kids the incentive to buy something.
Respectively to tell their parents they want something.
If we can't promote our products no one really will.
Since a lot of parents just buy their kids what they want, but they don't tell them what's on the market...
So as with everything there are two sides that you can pick.
For me personally I feel like these are the most important factors (or at least the one's which came to my mind the quickest ;)).
I feel like we can't let the kids be bombarded with all these commercials etc.
I feel like we kind of need to protect them from our "bad" world.
They have enough time to still be bombarded later with all the "adult stuff".
But one the other hand I grew up with commercials and I don't feel like they damaged me in any way.
Or maybe they did but I just don't know/ noticed it... Maybe we should do some research about that.
So we actually know what effect it has, IF it does have a effect.
But also I aknowledge the fact that business/ economy is a really important factor to...
I mean can a country really prohibid commercials directed twoards children.
Companys need to be able to promote their product and through that actually sell them, that's what let's our economy going.
First of all there is the main problem that advertising directed toward children has the effect that they ask their parents to buy this toy they are interested in.
Secondary there are some parents who aren't able to buy these toys because of financial reasons, so their chhildren could get very dissapointed in their parents if they don't follow their wishes.
If there aren't enough financial resources in this family but the parents want to buy this toy for their children they maybe leave out a meal or something else to save money.
Actually  advertising isn't the main problem but the fact that children in the age of two till five years are spending to much time in front of the TV.
In that age there are many better ways to spend time than watching movies or TV in general.
Advertising isn't against the law if the advertised product is legal so there isn't any use of prohibitting advertising like this.
The advertiser doesn't target the children between two and five years, they mainly advertise for their parents because they want them to buy some cool stuff for their kids.
So the true problem is, that parents aren't able to diside which toy would be suitable for their kids.
Personally I'm not against advertising for products for children because there woudn't be any space for Playmobil etc.
to promote their products if not in TV.
So I think the better solution for this problem would be to teach young couples and parents how they can decide which toy is a good one and which isn't.
In a short sentence I can say, that there isn't any need to unallow advertising directed to young children.
Nowadays it doesn't matter where you are, everywhere you are confronted with advertising especially in television.
In our society also young children are included, they raise with the endless advirtising.
On tv channels which are made for children, they show advertising which are especially directed toward young children.
A negative aspect of advertising towards young children is that it can increase the wish of receiving presents from their parents.
When they are about to watch a tv serie for children, it's not possible that they won't watch the advertising too.
They see toys, games and other stuff in the advertising which they automatically want to receive from their parents.
They would not have wanted it if they have not watched the things in the advertising.
Television advertising towards young children can also be positive.
It can influence their behaving in a good way.
When they watch an advertising about a toy, they don't just see the toy for itself, they also see how children play together with it and how they treat eachother.
Through that children can learn social competences and learn early how you have to behave yourself in our society.
In my opinion this statement is true.
There are a lot of other ways how they can learn how to behave, for example when they play outside with their friends.
Nowadays everything is digitalisised and i do not think that also that learning has to pass throug television.
Advertisig can have a big impact of our lives and children will be confronted early enough with advertising when they grow up.
To conclude, television advertising directed toward young children should be forbitten and on tv channels for children should only be the series withour advertising in between.
I agree with this statement.
But today`s young children are even without the television confrontated with advertising and other things which children some years ago haven`t ever seen.
Maybe in some years it will be normal that a five year old boy is using a handy and can explain his father how to use his computer.
When I`m travelling i can often see how the parents give their children electronic devices like an Ipad.
Like this the children are occupied and the parents don`t have to look after their kid.
The children are already used to see advertising everywhere so I don`t think that with a televsion advertising they would have some damage.
When the children are watching tv and an advertisement appears where for example the newest thing to play is introduced the children want it.
Like this the parents get more and more in an obligation to buy their kid everything.
My personal problem is that the children nowadays play with their phone and not with their friends anymore.
All the social interactions while playing a game with other kids aren`t there anymore.
I think later they willl have problems to get in contact with other people because it`s the time of 3-7 years where children have no problems to play with any child.
I cant`figure out any advantage if the television advertising is directed toward young children.
It`s normal that every company wants his own advertisement in the tv beacause it`s a good maybe the best platform to find new people buying their product.
And it`s the right of every company to show an advertisement but if it`s for children up to five it`s not okay.
Advertising directed towards young children:

The pure fact that young children age two to five already watch so much television that we as adultes need to talk about the ban of TV advertising already reflects the huge problems we have in the first world...
However it has to be said that we live in a capital based society which is built on capitalism and the free market.
In a free market economy the whole population profits when more products and goods are sold to the pobulation.
So we should argue that we should allow adertising for our kids just for the good of our economy.
I must say I disagree strongly.
Our country is run by a so called social free market economy, which is a system where the state corrects social differences by reallocation resources from the rich to the poor.
All that wants to say that we care about everybody wellbeing in our society.
So why should not care about our youngest and already make them and protect them from the influence of advertising.
Since children at the age of two to five are getting to know our world very intensively we should not show them our made up world of advertising, we better show them our real world and by that i dont think about some sort of cool animal documentaries on Dmax.
Our kids should figure out for themself what they like or not.
We should not be talking about what kind of ads we would like to ban for kids we should be there and support them as our own brothers and sisters.
I am very sure then only when we are able to rais our kids in a good way, only then their future gets breither.
So when we think about banning advertision for your youngest we should actualy be talking about how to raise our kids properly.
Advertising

This essay is about the discussion if television advertising towards yound children should be allowed or not.
A child gets immidiantly confronted with advertising as soon as the television is switched on.
But isn't it a wrong thing to make yound children believe that they need certain products in order to be happy?
One could say that the decision wheter to buy the advertised product or not, still lays in the hands of the parents.
A child in this age can't simply march into a supermarked and buy the aimed product.
In the end the child learns, that he can't have everything and that not everyting advertised in really needed in order to be happy.
Also the mother or the father learns to say no.
One could also say that advertising is simply a part of the economy.
And there's also a sector that promotes children products.
All the toys-shops or other companys that sell children-products need to survive and today it is needed to advertise in order to be competitive in the harsh market.
But there's also an other side of the advertising in television.
For partens it is not easy to always say no, the advertising lays pressure on them.
Nobody wants to be the strictly person that always says no, and nobody wants endless discussion with their children about someting they don't need.
And that's already another point, the advertising makes immature children believe that they're in a need of certain products.
In a yound age they're already told that they can't be happy or not fit into a group whitout having the latest cool products.
At a later point in life they have problems to resist buying the latests products, what can lead to a buy-addiction.
So isn't it very unethical and unfair to make economical benefits of the immaturity of our young innocent generation?
Yes it is!
There is absolutely no need to advertise products towards two year old children.
And for the sector of economy there are also other ways to promote products, like magazins for partens.
They're mature enough to decide if that product is needed or not.
I think that would be a better way to advertise this products.
There are channels with films and series just for kids so these cannels must show their advertisments for kids.
It doesn't make sense when the adverts are for older people, because this could be a reason to switch the channels.
This would have consequences like less views and people would search other channels for their kids to watch.
Kids have a difficulty to accept and to understand.
When they liked for example a new lego house form an advert, they will go to their parents and tell them that they want these things.
It could be that the parents have no time or no money to buy this.
This would stress the parents also.
Adverts can danger little kids  (age 2 -3).
We all know that little kids like to have something in their mouth like the finger or something different.
When they put a liitle subject in their mouth like a little lego weapon,The kid could not get oxygen.
It can be the reason for the death.It is the job of the parents to look after the kids and that the people who made that advert can't do something, when something is happenng to the kid.
Little kids with the age 2/3 are also easy to trick, because you can talk about something different what they like and make that they forget what they wanted to.
An older kid who has not a good education would talk everyday about this game until the kid gets it.
It depends also on the education of the kids and who the parents handle with the kids.
When they show programms for little kids everything must be for kids as i said.
The people who do the adverts can just look that the adverts dont get too voilent or agressive.
Don't you remember when you were young and sitting infront of the television and then there comes this really amazing advertisement of this really cool toy which you just had to have to play with?
I can remembre these times just like they happened yesterday.
And everytime when I asked my parents and they finaly said yes and I had the toy in my very own hands I was disapointed because it just wasn't the same as it was shown in the advertisement.
Every child really likes these awesome advertisements which show the product in its greatest way but should television advertising directed to young children be allowed?
These organisations whose product is directed to young children do have to advertise so they can sell their products better.
Every organisation has to advertise.
The whole reason of advertising is that the people who see the advertisement buy the product.
Young children don't have any money so the reason of these advertisements is that the little girls or boys go to their parents and tell them to buy the product.
The problem of this is that often young children just want everything and they can't decide what really is worth to buy and then the parents will buy it for their children to not disapoint them.
With this advertising-strategy the organisations are abusing exactly this problem.
So the young children are an easy target to sell stuff to.
In the end I think that television advertising which is directed to young children should not be allowed because it abuses the lack of knowledge that children have.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Television advertising has a really big impact on children.
Mostly the television advertising directed toward children shows a situation where other children play with or use the advertised thing.
In the advertising everything seems to be great.
Children think, if they have the advertised thing, their life would be like the one shown on TV.
But as soon as they got this thing, they realise that it isn't as funny as they had thought, they start to ignore that they had it and they want to have the next thing.
If Children would like to have the advertised thing they had seen in TV, they ask for it all the time and the parents have to say strictly no or if they aren't that strictly, they will buy it.
But if they start to buy one thing, they will have to buy a sencend thing and so on.
In the end, it's going to be a big amount of money they spent for these things and the children aren't happier with these things.
That the parents don't get in such a situation, they can't let their children watch TV, but in todays time, this is really difficult.
In conclusion, the children and the parents don't profit from the advertising and they just waste money for something they don't really like a long time.
The best thing to do is not to allow television advertising.
Some peole say, that telvision ads dirceted to young children could be a problem, because they could be influeced by them and they could drain the money of a poor houshold, but kids at his age normally don't have money.
So should those ads still be allowed?
Ads work on the concept ofinfluencing people to buy their products or to believe, that something is good.
If such ads are directed to two to five years old children, that are easily influenced by anything, could be dangerous.
They could be influenced by companies, so they'd be an easy target for further ads and could be bound to a companie, believing everything the say.
Furthermore, especially referencing to toy ads, they could push their parents to buy them anythig they want, because they've seen itin an ad and that could be damaging for housholds tht don't have that much money.
It's similar to the phenomenon of microtransactions: If you give them the permission to do that, by bindin your credit card to your account, they will ypend as much money as they can, since they don't uderstand the conceptof money.
But why giving them everything they want?
If you're persistant, you can fend of the demands of your child.
They themselves don't have money, so aslon as you're in charge, you can block everything.
No one gets everything he wants.
In my opinion, the fact, that the parents are still in charge is the reason, why those ads should still be allowed.
It doesn't matter how hard kids get influenced, as long as you don't give them everything they want.
I think there is some truth behind this statement.
Afterall there are studies which prove, that watching televison isn't good for children.
It sais that it has negativ influence on the development of the brain.
But on the other side TV doesn't stop influencing your brain, no mather what age you are.
Another importent reason, why I think watching TV under the age of five shouldn't be allowed is, that in that age you normaly aren't able to make a diffrence between reality and fiction.
Even some grownups fail doing that line.
Watching TV isn't in the nature of humans, actually a lot of things that we do isn't natural anymore, and I think in the first years of your life, you shouldn't interact with tecnology too much.
Personaly I think that as a kid you should play with other kids or some toys like Lego, action-figueres...
Watching TV from time to time is alright, as long as the parents are careful about the movie choice and make sure watching TV is something their kid doesn't do often.
A lot of parents let their kids watch TV so they are distracted or to calm them down.
But that is one of the worst things you could do as a parent.
Further I think TV can be used as a rare treatment.
In the end i have to admit taht there are some good TV shows for kids and they do have fun during watching TV - who doesn't?
I think as long as the parents keep watching TV as a special and rare treatment, it shouldn't be a problem to let kids watch TV.
But never the less they should be careful and make sure that the TV consume doesn't get out of hands.
One of the biggest problem in our todays society is the influence of technologie by watching television or by using your mobile phone in your life and your attitude.
This fact people does use for advertisement in due to make the product or the company more famous and popular.
Now, there are so many advertisements for so many people.
For example an advertisement of the newest mobile phone is directed toward the younger generation.
Advertisement is the most popular way to show todays life and enter in this society.
So why should not be an advertisement for chldren too?
Advertisement is important so people children included are up to date and can compare different offers.
Advertisement is a part in our every daylife for we find it everywhere: in the internet, in television or even at the bus.
Owing to that it is like a part of education for children.
In that way they are from the beginning on confronted with advertisement so they can learn earlier and quicker how to handle with it.
Moreover they share a component of everyday life.Because of that they feel like a part of this world and this society and this improves their self-confidence.
In the other way advertisement can have a bad influence on children, because they can not be able to make their own decisions for their mind is still opened to every experience without asking the consequences.
That means children can be more manipulated than adults.
Additionally,this influence does not takes the possibility of making decisions it destroys the naturefriendly childhood too in due to that children are disturbed in their life by let them in this world to early.
Moreover it gives the children the possibility to rebel and scream their parents for children want the product represented bythe advertisement.
My opinion is that is better not to have television advertising for that children need to discover their nature surrounding first before enter in to this society.
One reason why it shoudn`t be allowed, is that young children don`t really understand what they see in television.
They can missunderstand things or they can get manipulated, what can make it difficult for parents to help them grow up.
At the age of for example four years, children are in my opinion not in position think about what they saw or what the advertise really means and they don`t know what to believe in when they hear things in the television advertise.
But I ask me the quesion if the advertising really can manipulate the children that much that there are problems for the parents or for the children themselves.
Maybe, when the children see an advertise of, for example, a very tasty looking candy, and they see it in the next supermarket, the parents can still say no.
Another question is if the children really get sort of manipulated or if they are really happier when they see an advertise of something in the television, they seem to like it and they get it bought by her parents.
So at the end, there are arguments for both opinions.
So the real question is if a very strict rule like forbit it completely, is really the way to solve the problem.
Tough it is not sure that it really is a problem.
I think of myself that it`s a too strict measure for a (in my opinion) little problem.
I think that the parents can for example see that her child don`t watch too much of television or something like that.
Ads for the young

Young children spend a lot of time consuming digitial media, one of which is the television.
There is no doubt that children will at one point or another come to watch some sort of advertisement in their infancy.
The goal of advertising something is usually to get the viewer interested in whatever you are advertising, and possibly have them buy your service, product or whatever it is.
So should people be alllowed to advertise their products to young children?
I think that you should be able to.
There is no good reason as to why your target audience has to exceed 5 years of age.
Of course I am talking in a general sense.
There are obviously some special case products which I would not want to see advertised on TV, whether it be directed towards a 5 or 15 year old.
Things like adult movies, toys etc.. are obviously meant by this.
Anyway, there are reasons o plenty for why ads directed towards youngsters are a good thing.
First off, they will distract the kid from whatever he was watching, and force him to take a break.
This is a good thing, because othrewise the kid might be inclined to watch TV all day, his eyes glued to the screen.
Health is really a important subject and to prevent its deteriation advertisements serve a useful purpose.
So advertisements serve a practical purpose and keep your kid from becoming an addict.
When it comes to the actual content of the advertisement, it really does not matter.
Im sure there are going to be ads advertising baby toys and stuff like that.
There is really no problem with that because all it can do is inform the child of something.
It does not force the child to buy whatever the advertiser is selling.
That decision will hopefully rest with the parents as they would be the ones who will have to go out and pay for the toy.
So if the contents of the advertisement are for older kids or adults, then it really doesnt matter because the kid will not understand it, e.g.
medical advertisement, and if the ad is directed towards the kid, there is really no harm.
In fact, it is essential that well made advertisements are directed towards young children, because we all know how annoying those dirty little brats can be if they want something.
Them little devils will be tugging at your shirt and bawling all day if you dont get it for them.
This is exactly what those greedy advertisers are banking on.
They want to drive you crazy and make a profit.
As I have no kids I really couldnt care less.
In the end, advertising is just another way to make some revenue.
And revenue means money, which we all want...
Right??
?
The first thing I thought when I red this statement was why young children are definited by two to five years?
What is, when younger children watch the television?
Or when they are six or seven years old?
It would be a problem himself, if babys watch television, but thats not the question.
My oppinion is, that it should not be allowed to every person, who could not already think critically about, what they see.
But a big problem is, that this is also a problem itself, because you can't think critically about things you see in television as long as lesser; also as an adult.
Do you know that the television is able to publish some clips from coca-cola, mc donalds or what ever, which you won't see (because there are published in a few milliseconds) , but your brain remainds?
In the future, it will be more and more that the television or other "new" tecnological would change your mind, without thinking about it.
For children, it would maybe be more important because they are getting there minde and personality, but also for adults, because this are the people, which buy this products.
For children, there should also be an affect, that they learn something while they are watching, which is also a big point in the discussion about children and television.
Another problem is, how long do a "normal" person watch the television or playing with their smartphones?
I think, it is an interessting statement, but it would be very very hard to change something (politic, people, ...), and if there would be something, it would not be hard to cheat.
All people (children and adults) should watch less television and "consuming" smartphones etc., they should go out, do some sport, meet some friends, and love their lives, so you may would not talk about this question.
Well why are there always boring statements in essays.
I do clearly disagree.
The explanation for it is very simple it´s becaue it destroys the base idea of capitalism.
If people had a problem with ads in the television then they wouldn´t let their childern watch it.
There would be atleast one or a few channels which wouldn´t advertise and they would be much more popular then the others.
But it seems like every channel dispalys ads so noone really wants to block them.
Another problem with the state manipulating specific categories in the economy is that it wouldn´t be fair.
Who can juge if it shouldn´t be allowed to advertise young children and whats about the eight year olds?
After 15 minutes of thinking over it still didn´t came into my mind why anyone would want this.
To protect you children from foodadvertise so that they eat healthier and dont become fed?
Maybe because young children can´t compare the difference between reality and ads and so they trust anything they see?
Then there are still the parents to control them and to tell them what is real and what they should do.
And in addition to only block and on television won´t help at all.
They will still see ads if they browse throught the web, and yes four years old do that, and when they play outside they will also see ads on the streets and other people would tell them about new products.
As a conclusion it should be allowed to advertise to anyone and if my country would block certain economies like that, then i would leave this country immediatly because as a content creater i would never know which content gets blocked and which doesn´t.
Televesion advertising is something we all see nearly everyday, it has become part of our life.
It can be annoying for example while watching a movie but it might also be interesting to young children to know what new toys have been made.
In this essay I am going to be talking about television advertising to young children and why it should or should not be allowed.
Children today watch alot of television, it is very easily accesible, and while they are watching television and add always pops up.
This adds are targeted to young children since they pop up in the childrens television channels such as Disney Channel.
They have cool music on their background and make the toy they are advertising something everybody has to have they basically brainwash the children.
That is the first negative point of advertising to young children, these children get brainwashed very quickly so what they do after seeing the add on television is go their mom or dad to make them buy them the toy.
The second negative point is that making young children watch adds brings nothing usefull to their lives it just brainwashes them to buy the toy, it does not teach them anything.
Advertising to young children has also a positive side but only for the company which is advertising the product.
Like I mentioned before young children get brainwashed very quickly, and because they will not stop beging to their parents to buy the product the parents will eventually buy it to them so they can shut up once and for all about that product, and that ladies and gentlemen is how companies make money by advertising to young children.
I am against advertising to young children.
Instead if putting an add the government or the channel itself should put something that teaches the young children something usefull.
Like for example brainwash the children to not smoke or not do drugs which in my opinion makes much more sense than advertisng a toy.
Television advertising in general is a controversial topic.
I mean most of us don't like them at all.
But we adults see what is behind those advertisings, that the promises often aren't true, that they just say things to make you buy them.
But what is about children?
They are more and more the aim of television advertising.
Should that not be allowed?
Childern don't see what a true promise is and what is just an empty statement, which was developed from a marketing team with the aim of making you buy that product.
Childern believe those things.
They somehow are easy victims for the companies.
They shouldn't be confronted with such markteing strategies in that age.
So is it better to make those advertising illegal?
Shouldn't companies have the freedom to do what they want.
I mean we live in a time of capitalism.
All people want to earn as much money as they can.
As a company you just want to make a good financial profit.
But doesn't a company have a certain responbility?
They should be a good role model and stand for moral.
There are already laws which make sure that some kind of advertising isn't leagl.
For example advertising for cigarettes at public events aren't allowed anymore, while they very quite normal in the 60ties.
Clearly a company stands for something and they influence people.
But some desisions should be made from parents.
The children have to learn that they can't get everything they see in TV.
And the parents are responsible to learn that to their children.
I mean even if a child wants a product which was advertised in TV, the parents are in the end the ones who buy it.
It's their desision.
I disagree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
In the todays world we are confronted with a big amout of adverts daily.
So it is important that children also learn that these promises aren't true, that it's just a strategie of the companies.
So they become more critical which is on my opinion very important in todays world.
It's a fact that economic groups want to make profit.
So they should be free to make advertising.
As mentioned it's in the power of the parents what they allow their children and what not.
Out of this reasons I thinks it's okay that television advertising directeed to children is allowed.
Absolutely!
Marketing should be made available to all customers subjecting themselves to the medium used to advertise the products.
If parents have trouble with their toddlers demanding "Tracy's Fruit Blast Bubble Gum", then the appropriate solution would be to turn off the TV, or have their kids watch a different programm.
After all; it isn't the kids that will end up buying the advertised products, so by targeting their age-group in advertisements they are not being exposed to anything that could affect them economically, nor are they prone to bad judgement (that would be the legal guardian).
One of the few situations in which I would advocate for controlled advertisement is when it comes selling potentially addicitve or hazardous products to young adolescents, because this age group already has the means to buy the products, but lacks the judgement to decide whether or not that it's a good idea.
Where young kids are concerned however, it's up to the parents to decide what they want their children exposed to.
At any rate, the only means of advertising products to toddlers and young children, are through a tv or (potentially) a radio, seeing as most kids in the targeted age-group will not have the reading skills (and will very probably lack the interest) to decipher the offers on billboards and posters set up in their immediate environment.
So all means of advertising to small kids, are very easily controlled by their parents, and can easily be turned off, if the content is deemed unsuitable.
Also; how then would companies exclusively selling children's toys advertise their products if not to children?
Sure...adults can be targeted too, but they will not always be "inspired" by the same products, as their squealing counterparts that always seem to know exactly what they want whenever they see a colorful picture of a toy.
I mean...how on earth would My Little Pony have gotten started, if adults were the only ones who knew about the product?
Nowadays a lot of children watch Television.But the things you see there are not just movies or series.There is always a lot of advertising in the program.And as we know advertising can be very manipulative.So the question is if Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
Advertising isn't always something negative or manipulative.It can also inspire people.For example a child sees a very cool bag made out of jeans in an advertising in Television.The child asks his mother if he could have a bag like that.His mother answered with a clear no and so the child starts to think of how he could get a jeansbag.He comes up with the idea to create one by himself.A creative idea and clearly a good investigation of his time.So the advertising had a good influence on the child.But advertising can influence a child in a negative way as well.For exemple that the child wants everything to own by himself and to have more and more things and games.The child could get unthankful and unhappy.
In my opinion children in the young age shouln't watch TV too often but when they watch it for once it is okey to have advertising.Advertising is not only in Television visible as well in the newspaper or on walls in the streets it has a lot of advertising so why should one forbid advertising in Tv when it apears in the daily life as well.Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
First of all television advertising isn't something you can allow or not.
It is just there if you want or not.
There is advertising that is nice for children to watch because it has a lot of colors and cute music.
In the evening the advertising is a little bit different.
But i think this is not really important because children aged two to five don't get it for what the advertising is for.
Maybe they talk about dating sides or condoms and so on but the kids don't even know what this is.
They look at it and think: Oh what a nice color.
Or something like that.
The only reason why we think that this should not be allowed to our children is because we don't think like kids.
When the television is on and then we see a spot about condoms we instantly want our kids to close their eyes but they really don't know jet what this thing is.
They think this is advertising for a ballon.
Maybe we should worry a little bit less about that.
It is just in our minds and not in the minds of the children.
They don't care what about this advertising is they just look at it and listen to the music in the background.
So I disagree with this statement.
It would be an overreaction.
In this essay, we speak about the question: "Should television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed?"
With children, they mean the kids aged two to five.
Children aged two to five are very manipulative.
If they see something, they will test it out by themselv or if soemone have something that they want, they don`t stop speak about it.
For the business guys is this a chek-pot.
If they can manipulate the kids with Television advertising is this awesome for them.
That is one piont that says that it should be allowed

The first point was from the view from a businessguy.
But we also have to respet the view from the parents.
Imagin you have a four year old kid and it sees one of those television advertisings for example from a toy.
Your kid does not stop cry until it has this toy.
This can be very annoying and disturbing.
So from the view from the parents, television advertising should not be allowed.
They point, that kids are very manipulative is also negative.
Imagin your three year old daughter sees a television advertising in which soemone get killed.
Now your daughter starts tinking, that killing is ok because of this television advertising.
Or another example.
Your daughter sees in one of thouse television advertisings how people rob banks or things like this and she starts thinking that commiting a crime is ok. 

My conclusion is that it should be allowed but only as long as it don`t manipulate the kids in a bad way, as I sayd above.
I also tink it`s the problem from the parents.
If they think it`s ok to let her four year old daughter watch tv, it should be clear for them that there are television advertising.
No I dont agree because the Electronic is the future.
Besides that young children love to watch TV.
I would say that the children could watch max.
one hour a day.
There arent many arguments for that statement.
On the one hand side,  as I said before, kids like to watch Tv.
On the other is it not good for their brain to watch too much Tv.
In these days nearly everyone has a television in the house.
This activity is completely integrated in the society.
Several hours a day are spend in watching TV and in this time also advertisment is consumed.
With advertisment exists not only the intrest to make a product known, it transports also the information that the product is needed to have a good life.
This is a way to manipulate the idea of a fullfilled life and I think the effects are for children stronger.
With this information you can say that the consumation will rise and this will have a positive influence on the economy.
I agree with the statement because in my opinion children shouldn't consume advertisement which may manipulate them.
And I would extend the age from two years up to thirteen years, because teenagers are also, if not more, concerned.
But for me it's more important that children shouldn't watch a lot of TV.
Today TV is often not a way to learn about new topics than to waste the time, for example until you have to go to bed.
I think it is sad that in this society a law is needed to protect children from the influence of advertisment, instead of offer them more attractive activities and keeping them away form consuming too much TV.
Television advertising is a big problem in our society.
Well not for the people who earn money with it but for the people who just want to watch a movie on a saturday evening.
It`s really anoying advertisment is everywhere and there is even specific one for young children.
Many parents are afraid of that and want the industry to stop making them.
I don`t really know why it`s thought that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Because for them it`s only a nice show which shows the newest toys or television shows.
And it also could be a chance for parents to see what their children want for example at Christmas or Easter!
Well I understand that parents could be afraid that their children crav for more and more.
But that is the problem of their education and their oppinion of how they want to raise their kids.
Parents can also be afraid that the television advertising tries to control the toughts of the children and make them believe in things they want them to.
But in Europe that isn`t the case maybe in North Korea but not here.
So finally I think that parents care to much about things that are harmless maybe they`re just afraid because they hadn`t that kind of advertising in their childhood.
But in one thing we all agree television advertising is immens boring.
Im not certainly agree but but not disagree either.However television advertisements generally misusing to recommend the thing that advertising from them for people to buyThey always try to show the produch more convinient and better to prefer for selling them.Advertisements which are directed by toward young childrens parents actually should have the responsibity that their children directing in advertisement that tries to show the product different.Advertisements makes people to want and buy the product.But its actually very common for example in children products that advertisers prefer to use little children to have their their parents confidence.Because when parents see a little children directing advertise something they think like its okay if i buy this product to my children.But actually its not a big problem that little children directing in an advertisement because when you try to sell something if its children product you have to direct a children tht can be used by them for have more request.In my opinion if the advertising product not trying to show what is actually like not misusing peoples minds it okay to directing a children in an advertisement.But some of parents which has no responsibity about advertisements they can direct their children because of for earning some money from there.But at 2-3 age of children cant decide what they exactly think what they have to do as an adult so thats certainly up to their parents.
Television advertising directed toward young children is a often discussed topic.
There are different opinions.
On one side you have to understand the company because they want to sell their products and earn a lot of money.
They know how the children react when they see something in television what they like und then they want to have it.
Their parents want that their children have all what they want and be happy.
So they buy the product.
But you have to look at the cons too.
It is not good for children in this age to be confronted with games like that.
And with games it is not meant a normal game, it is a psychological game.
In the televison advertising they tell the children that they need that product and only with this one they could have fun.
So they make a hype around something.
The children are too young to understand that it is only a hype because of the television advertising and in the end they want it.
But that is really unfair because they do not understand that all is based on psychology.
But when you think about it, then all of us see that the companies are really mean and they use the children to sell their products.
I think that television advertising directed towards young children is nothing what should be done, because it is not fair.
The children cannot handle the situation and they do what the companies want them to do, they want that their parents buy the product.In the end the parents want that their children are happy and they  buy the product.
It is like a robery, only in a legal way.
I neither agree or disagree with this statement, because television isn't a good or a bad thing.
You can learn so much with just a flat screen but there's also very much nonsense on it.
But for those young children, who are just 5 years there is a high chance, that they just look some stupid shows or things about animals wich can talk.
So they don't watch popular shows like "Galileo", where you can learn so much about the earth and how things are going.
They more watch shows like "Spongbob" or somethinig like this.
But if you look at the books for todays children, it's not a big difference to those television shows.
Another thing you often say about the TV is, that your eyes will get very fast worse.
If that statement is true than I think it's miserable if you let those litte children watch TV.
But there are also many positive aspects like you learn how to use electric things, you fast know many things about live and you can better keep them in your mind than if you red them in books.
I think you also need less time to learn the things because you hear and see them, so they stay more easily in your mind.
And if the statement, that your eyes will get worse from watching TV, isn't true, than the negative side lost a big argument against the positive side.
Or maybe this doesn't even matter, because earlier or later you surely will get a handy and a computer, wich is today necessary to live and work.
So for me I don't think it's a that bad idea to let them watch the TV, because as I said you can learn so much about the life in a very short timelaps.
And about the eyes it doesn't matter that much if you start watching at displays with five or ten years.
So all in all I think it should be allowed to watch TV with the age of five years.
I feel like these days young children are often confronted with content, that still is age appropriate, but far more evolved than what other generations witnessed in television.
I feel like that might shape you and your childhood in different ways, but without necessarily damaging the character or having a negative impact.
Back then, children grew up with old-school toys, whereas nowadays children with the same age are growing up with the newest versions of iPhone and Samsung, something that I had no knowledge about and at that time simply didn't interest me, maybe because at that time smart phones weren't really a thing, but still.
Television advertising that are directed toward young children aged two to five often are just ads promoting the next big innovation when it comes to being on the playground.
Or maybe they'll see advertising of a small boy drinking some kind of special milk and suddenly becoming really strong.
Whatever it is, these ads, especially in this young age, often are forgotten.
In the moment, they could intrigue the children, but in the long run, they will not be haunted by it.
A lot of our generation of teenagers grew up watching, in my opinion, a lot of television and it didn't have an influence on us.
We're just an example of many obviously.
But one thing that seems like a key point to me is, that whatever they see at this young age, they don't take it in.
They don't overanalyze or think about the message, because they're children.
Maybe I'm wrong, because I don't have the knowledge or the proper evidence to support my theory.
I can only talk from my experience.
When you see advertising, there never is a deeper meaning to it, we're not talking about propaganda, but advertising used in channels directed toward infants.
They build on their desires, maybe, trying to get them to convice their parents to buy the heavily promoted product.
In the end, it's all about business.
But it doesn't show you the weight of the world or societal problems, and even if the would, first it's the job of the parents to protect their children from such advertising and second they wouldn't understand a thing.
And I'm talking about regular, smart children without worries.
Children that grew up under harder circumstances could be influenced more.
Television advertising: A perfect day in a zoo with your familiy.
They are showing elephants and giraffs and every little child tells his or her mother "Mommy can we go there?".
Now you think "why not?".
Let's say a child who lives in a big city and possibly will never have the chance to see animals like cows or horses in real life before it's 10th birthday.
In this case an advertisement would be a good thing (eventhough there are  maybe no cows or horses in a zoo).
But when nitendo is going to make advertisements towards children aged tow to five about their new mario-cart version and it's no problem for children from two to five to play it.
Is this usefull?
I think their parents are the origins that products like nitendos are bought for young children.
They will see this advertisement and maybe the vater says: "Mario-cart!
I allways played this game and it was the best game I ever had.
I loved it!"
And he possibly goes to the next gamestore and buys this new game beacuse he loved it and he would love it when his little boy would love it.
So he teaches his little boy how to play mario-cart.
Only because there was an advertisement about it.
But wouldn't it be better to let children in this age play with sand and water or legos?
To let them know how it is to play with things like that.
To encrease their creativity, to encrease their selfconfidence etc.
Their parents enjoyed it to play on the playground in the neighbourhood.
They knwo how funny it is to play hide and seek.
They never had an nitendo in this age.
So why do they allow it that their children are sitting all day long in front of their nitendo and play mario-cart?
That's only one example of advertisements toward children between two and five.
And it's defenetely not great.
So in my opinion advertisements directed toward yound children should not be allowed.
Advertising for young children
The question is if young children between two and five should get a directed advertsiting in the television ?
If young children get an advertising directed to them they become more interessed by the television.
And if the young children are more interessed in advertising on the television they learn more words and other things because they see an image and they hear somthing.
The consequences are that this child will learn faster and apply the things that he/she learned in their life.
For an example they learned a new word.
after he/she saved this in his/her head he/she uses this word always.
But what happens if th young children become adicted by television.
On the other hand it would not be a good idea to set advertising specially for young children.
They could become addicted by ttelevision and the concequences were that later on their lifestyles is not going well.
If they have not many frinds or more worse than that no frinds they can not really intgrate to the socaial life.
Thats not good becouse they were then isolated from the society.
In my opinion they should not have advertising for young children in the television because the negative points or the negative consequences are more then the positive points.
When we are children we look up to our idols and we try to be like them.
Maybe some of our idols are on television but are they always the best for us.
Our parents can watch with us tv and they can control if we are watching something that is no good for us then it depends on the parents.
Maybe they see some kind of things they not know before.
Plays, dolls or brands for children's sake in case of the parents are newbies they might be relieved for some advertising about them.
But on the other hand children are very easy to manipulate.
They're young and take up everything like a sponge if they're interested.The main cause why young people are into having sex or watching porn is because there are always some kind of naughty scenes in advertising.
Maybe not in advertising directed towards young children but there are others.
Children's advertising manipulate to buy those dolls, plays and games because children want to.
I think parents should look after their children and what they watch.
Television is a new form of ''let the children play'' so parents can relax.
There are so many children who are addicted to electronic gadgets and their parents don't want to do anything.
Their children're getting more and more unsociable.
My opinion is parents should more look after their children and play with them outside than watching tv.
The question in this essay is:"Should television advertising to young children should be not allowed?"
Televison advertising is made to give the impact to buy the product.
So maybe the advertising can have a big impact to the small children.
But is that not the choice of the parents?
Televison advertising has a big impact to the people who see it.
Children can be impacted much easier than adults.
It can affect children to do things that they would not do if they have not seen the advertise.
Think about that.
There is a advertise with a young child.
This child is playing with the televison and the cables of the televison.
When young children are seeing this.
They could do it aswell and playing with cabels and elecrticity.
This is very dangerous.
When you look at the other position, there is an other arguement.
Why should the gouvernement should make a law when there are parents that have to help the children growing up.
The parents should look that their children are getting a good character and they have to decide themself how they can do this.
So why should the gouvernement take that responsibility away from the parents?
They can also decide how much televion they should whatch

At the end you can see, that both side are respectable, but when you weiht the side up we can see, that it is not nessecary to interdict the televison advertise for young children.
It is in the responsibility of the parents.
On the one hand side, is television advertising generally legal.
every Television channel has the rigth to send adverising.
Also is it unpossible to hide the advertising from young children.
I mean how should that work?
A televions channel has do send advertise, otherhand they can't survive, so it's they're own incoming money.
Otherwise how will they decide if children or adults sitting in front of the tv.
they just can make advertise or not.
But on the other hand, i think is makes not really sens to show advertise to kds.
if they see a product in the television they don't go in a store and buy this stuff.
If they want something, it's in the most cases the parents which decides if a child get it or not.
The most of the advertise is build with an hidden sense.
so a child can't really understand what it really mean or they understand it wrongly.
so the chance that a child get a bad influence is much biggger than the chance that the kid goes to a store and buy the stuff the see in tv.
so all in all i think it should not be allowed to send advertise for kids.
it mekes no sens and is in the most cases just a bad influence.
so if it would be possible to separate kids from parents in frot of the tv they sould not send advertise for kids.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Many things can influence young children.
Of course the adverts in television.
And of course in this time period, in which we watch television all the time.
Young children trust this things they see first and is not good for them when they watch adverts.
But how can a this television programms can be financed?
It is very expensive to send some programm and when you do not get money from the adverts it does not make any sense for the producer to send this programm for free.
And when you do not send this for free the other peoples does not buy them to use and let the children watch the televison programms for free with adverts.
Another thing is the children with the age of two to five years do not have to watch television.
Of course it is much more easier for the parents to let their children watch television instead of playing outside with them.
In my opinion, it is not to do for the producer to send the programms for free and the children do not have to watch television with the age of two to five.
Clear the children in this peer group are very influencably but all in all this should be allowed, because the children do not have to watch television with this age.
The theme of this essay it pretty strange.
And i don`t really know something but i will try to give my best.
It`s possible that the advertising on the television have a bad influence to children aged two to five but for me the better question is if these children at all should watch TV at this age.
Shouldn`t they play with they`r toys in they`r rooms?
They are still so young and got already confronted with such medias.
It can`t belive that this is a good thing.
So I think the advertising isn`t good for the as well.
On the other side it`s possible that if they got confronted already soearly they learn how he world is doing and that the truth is that u have always to watch advertising if u watch TV.
Why should they have a better like than it is in reallity.
It would be a lie.
Another thing is that they are able to learn many tings from the advertising.
For exaple all the diffrent things which you are seeing at advertising they ot to know.
So the advertising have for young childrens a positiv and as well a negative influence.
For me there are more positiv ones than negativ so I agree with advertising for young childrens from age two to five pretty much.
If they are allowed to watch TV it don`t makes a big diffrenceif there is advertising or not.
By the way I think if you ban advertising at television for childrens (aged two to five) no chanel will continue to show broadcasts for young children because they aren`t able to earn some money without advertising.
Children are easy to be influenced.
They're obviously young and you can tell them anything you want and they'll believe you.
When they're directed with television advertising of the latest games or whatever parents could get in trouble because their children always want to have the latest games.
At this point the problem is that there are new games every week.
Whenever you switch on a kids channel you'll see lots of advertising for new stuff every kid needs (they don't actually need it but the advertising makes them and even you feel like they need it...).
Children of this generation need the advertisement to be updated.
What kind of chilld would you be if you hadn't heard anything about the latest toys or games?
You have to now what's going on to be a part of.
In todays' generation everyone wants to be a part of.
Children nowadays grow up with a television and are used to the advertising.
Back when their parents were kids they mostly didn't have a television so maybe it's something new for them.
I think television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.
When I was a kid the advertising influenced me much.
I was allowed to watch kids channels in the evening after school.
In kindergarten I wasn't that interested in watching television.
The advertising took place between the series I watched and sometimes was even longer than the clip itself.
Sometimes the advertisement made me feel bad because I felt like an outsider.
I've never had the latest toys.
It made me think about what I'd be and what my friends would think about me if I hadn't got those latest toys.
Nowadays, young childrens are watching more Tv than childrens who were born ten or more years before.
The fascinating technologie is really interesting for young childerns about this age.
In this age the chilrderns are learning a lot and they take everything what they hear and see and with that informations they learn and grow up.
So it is really important that they learn from real sources like the parents, not from the TV.
There are a lot of advertising in the TV, that tell nothing important or sometimes they show up a wrong reality.
The parents can't conrol what the childrens are watching and thats a big problem.
It isn't good for them to just consum TV.
It is better if they go outside and play games, so they can explore for them self the real world.
I think in nowadays time it is important that you don't just sit in your room and watch TV.
You have to get outside and see the real world.
It is more common to just watch TV the hole intheier day.
Exspecially for young childresn aged two to five.
I understand if they are fascinated of the TV, but as parents you heve to defend your childrens from bad influence.
And there are a lot of bad TV advertising.
So I am fully against Television advertising toward young childrens, because there are bad influences in the TV, whitch can understand wrongly.
And in this age they learn everything, what they been told, so they take it how it is and i think they can't decide if this in the TV is reality.
Would you want the bad influence of television advertising directed toward your child?
I suppose not.
And there are some good reasons why not:
They need toys at teir stage of development.
Young children need to play with things they can touch, and toys which are invented for the stage they are at.
Televisions are far too fast, altough there are series for children on TV, which is a benefit, they learn quick to change the channel, and the risk is too big, that the parents don`t pay enough attention, because they need time for their own and their child watches something else.
The development of young children is influenced badly.
Their brains are not developed enough to be able to make a whole out of the things they hear, and the movement of the lips they see.
That`s an ability they learn with time, but because the diffrent signals they receive are not received at the same time, they may develop speaching problems.
They learn at an early age, that electronic devices belong in the daily life.
This increases the risk of addiction in their life when they are older, and altough it isn`t proved yet that elecronic devices have a bad influence on our health, there are incidents to this theory, and especially for  the young children we should be careful until it is proved, that the theory is wrong.
Children are the weakest part of our society while, at the same time, the most important one, because they will create the future, but at an early age, that`s why they need our protection.
To provide abusing the TV as a toy, which it is not, to help them developing quikly and in a natural way, to avoid later problems like speaching faults or addiction, we should not allow television advertising directed toward young children.
To young to be advertised?
Nowadays children, especially young children, are allowed to watch TV longer than the children fourty years ago.
That's probably because of the evolution of technology and that every household has one or more TV.
Not only the tecnology has evolved but also the whole economy and marketing.
So it happens that the stores who sell products for young children make adverts for those.
And in which way?
With Television.
First off, the children shouldn't be allowed to watch TV that often, it's not good for their health and also not good for their relationships.
They rather should go play outside with other children.
When they watch TV, they are in another reality, in that age they don't know what's real or not.
They get influenced by the adverts and get a fake impression of the world.
For exemple if a child sees an advert of a toy animal.
If in the advert the toy can fly, the child most likely thinks it will do it in reality.
Or they tell the kid that they need this toy and the child believes it because it's naive.
It's almost like brainwashing.
Otherwise even if they watch TV and see the adverts for a produkt, they can't go by it by themselves.
They aren't even allowed, by law, to make a contract like buying stuff.
They have to ask their parents.
And if they won't by it then the adverts are useless.
Another point is, that the child would want the toy and cry to get it.
If it doesn't stop and the parents finally get it, this could lead to a spoiled kid.
And that is psychologicly not good.
All points considered, the television advertising towards young children is unnecessary, it would be better for the companys to direct the ads towards the parents.
The children are to young to know what's good for them.
They also shouldn't be influenced in a bad way by television.
They are just to young.
Television is a great source of entertainment for all of us, even for very young children.
It has advantages and disadvantages.
But here I want to talk about television advertisement and about the effets it has.
Children aged two to five don't have the ability to decide what is good for them.
They start to want eveything the advertisements want to sell them.
With television advertisement they get confronted with materialism quite early and I think at this age, it's important that they learn that there are other things which really matter.
They ought to learn how to make friends and being social instead of wish to have new expensive sneakers or a new app.
Young children get attracet to things for instance toys the advertisments have shwoed them, that's normal at this age.
Moreover, children that young aren't able to know which advertisement is real and which is fake, so they start to copy the moves the children in the advertisement do.
They can't assess what is dangerous to imitate and what not.
Thirdly television advertising could influence young children's eating habits.
If they see an advertisement with junk food in it all day and maybe see the cool kids eating it, they want to behave like them.
They think it's normal to eat this kind of food, because even the television says, it's good for them.
All things considered I agree with the statement that television adverstising directed toward young children souldn't be allowed.
The government should act to protect children from interference.
Banning a television advert isn't against the freedom of speech and expression.
If the government doesn't support my opinion, in my view the
Nowerdays many people spend hours in front of their television.
We might not even realise how many commercials we see in a day.
But what about young children aged between two to five?
What do they take out of those advertisements?
In this essay I will inform you about the adventages and disadvantages of advertising directed toward young children.
At first I think that the parents have to decide how much time their cildren are allowed to spend in front of the television.
If they do not want them to watch advertisements all the time, they should not allow them to watch TV.
But that might sound easier than it is.
On the one hand it is a good way for young children to see what is possible nowerdays.
They will get confronted with high technical things they did not know they would exist.
On the other hand they should learn and see that by discovering it in real life.
And who says they have to know that high technical computer games like this exist?
They will have enough time to learn about computers and high technic when they are older.
Beside that, children aged between two to five do not know that there are more important things in life.
TV the games look like they are so important in life but they can not make differences.
They do not know that most of the commercials are so unnecessairly and sometimes stupid.
In my opinion children this young should not be distracted by unessential things like that.
They are not capable to differentiate the importance of things in life because they do not have the exprience they need.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
When we watch television we can see a lot of television advertising.
A lot children in the age of two to five watch every day television, so they can see a lot of television advertising.
I think, the television advertising can influence the behaviour of  young children but it don't have to.
I think this is from child to child different.
I think it could have negative aspects but also positive aspects.
In the one side, the children can learn new things and they can discover a lot but on the other side maybe it can have negatives aspects, for example a bad behaviour or something.
Maybe the children don't understand the television advertising right.
When they don't understand this right it could give many of problems.
And  I think lots of the children don't understand the television advertising right because they are very young, don't have so much experience as the older people and don't have the same humour as peoples who are a little bit older.
A little bit of television advertising is good and also important and it also doesn't give any problems for the young children, but too much of television advertising isn't good, because on the one side it is really boring and of the other side it could give many of negative aspects to the behaviour of young children.
I think we have to find a good mixture of television advertising.
Advertissments make up a lot of parts in nowadays television.
Advertising is a big market in this industry.
This televised advertissments are directed to various factors, including age or gender.
In various occasions there even is advertising directed toward young children.
Because of their young age such advertissments can easily influence the children, more than in every other field of age.
Should this type of advertising be banned, or is this advertising such as every other?
Generally, television advertising directed towards children is like every other type of advertising.
It is fitted to their special needs.
In this age its often toys or other media made for entertainment.
It may does not matter if this advertising does strongly influence the children in their opinions and wishes.
Rather does the influence on the parents matter.
They are the one wich will buy the toys advertised in the TV.
Because there is a authority wich can decide wether to buy a product or not, the influence on the young children does hardly matter.
On the other hand, children can be very invested in their wishes and opinions.
It is often the case that they get what they want.
Specially in a time period like christmas.
This is also the reason why Advertissments with toys and similar products are displayed more before christmas.
The marketing strategy of most of the companies is clearly to make the most of the easily influencable children.
Wich is in a economial point of view rather understandable.
It is more a thing of morals to bann this type of advertising.
In my opinion, companies really take an advantage on the young children.
Their minds are not fully developed and are easy to influence.
Even when this makes sense in a economic way, this strategy of advertising should not be allowed.
Television for young children

Today there are a lot of kids who already has a mobile phone at the age of four or who watch TV all the time.
But do the parents really know what effect this have on the education of their kids?
The use of a television is just an escape for parents, so that they don't have to look after there kids activly.
But in that way the kids don't learn to communicate with there own parent or other children for example in a "Kinderhort".
For the parent it is easier and also cheeper to let them watch TV, then to pay for a "Kinderhort".
But is it worth to pay less, in con 
But if they don't learn the communication with other kids or even the parents, later they could be very shy or just not able to speak and behave correctly in contact with other people.
In school they would have problems, if they're not able to speak in front of the class, or they don't know how to behave in contact with a teacher because they just know what the people in TV does, and they often do things which are funny but not wished in reality.
Once I watched some kids at a birthdayparty.
The birthday-kid wants to do some sports outside, but some of her friends weren't in the mood.
So they sat down and looked on theire mobiles.
So the others also looked at there mobiles and they didn't speek to each other any more.
The mother of the birthday-kid - which hasn't bought her daughter a mobile or alouds to watch s lot of TV - had to tell them, they should play something together.
So the parents make theire kids just a more difficulty for theire schoollife.
In the fact of searching friends and being good at school.
If the kids always or ofter watch TV from the beginning on, then it could become a "Sucht".
So later, when they are in school or should work already, they always have to watch TV because they don't know something different to do.
So they would have difficulties to find a job, which they like.
Another point of being kind of "abhängig" is, that they do less sports because they just sit there in front of theire television.
So they might have health-problems.
Not just because of the less sportiv activity, but also the eyes might educate in a wrong way, so that many of them will need glasses.
And they aren't that cheep, so the parents would spend a lot of money for glasses then for the "Kinderhort".
I think, that the kids could watch TV, but just in a controlled way.
There is no need for advertising toward young people, because they shouldn't watch TV that often.
Nowadays, television advertisment is a subject we find ourselves constantly confronted with.
There is basically now way around it.
A lot of huge companies use this knowledge to manipulate or steer the behaviour of the people.
In all western countries where the standart of living is rather high, it is completly normal to have at least one televison per houshold.
This leads to young children being confronted with those advertisments too.
This essay will discuss whether it should be allowed to direct television advertisments towards young children.
On the one side, companies depend on having enough costumers and they usually get them by advertising their products on public spaces like platforms or TVs.
Furthermore, children who see commercials of things they want can tell their parents and the parents won't buy their child something it does not want.
On the other side, using the innocence of young children and manipulating them form a young age on is not very kind and a rather unethnic thing to do.
Personally, I think that parents should not allow their kids to watch television under the age of four anyways.
And if they finally get to watch something, it should be something off a DVD or something where the parents know there won't be a commercial break.
Furthermore, parents should always watch with their kids and not let them watch TV alone.
But apart from the parents responsibilities, I think that televiosion advertisments for young children in general should not be allowed because it seems useless to me.
In the end it will be the parents who decide whether to buy the product their child wants or
Years ago, when my brother was 5 years old and we watched TV together I always was genervt of the advertising.
But my brother was looking forward to the interrupts in the best scenes of the film.
But some advertisement weren't for his eyes I thought.
And then I asked me why they show them if little children it watches.
A cons is that young children don't understand what they watches.
They can't link one thing with the other.
Another point is that the parents can decide if their child are allowed to watch TV and so they can steuern the advertisement which the children are watching.
On the top of that, you can't stop the advertising on the television.
An argument for the pro side is that young children can see some thing they don't have to see.
There are television advertising which aren't for young-children-eyes.
Another point is that children should have the possibility to decide for themself what they find good.
Finally, it's difficult to control what the children are watching.
In my opinion it depends on the advertisment and the product which are the advertising for.
Each parents have to decide what they show their children.
I think the best is when young children play in the nature instead of watching TV.
When it comes to advertisment and the way corporate companies try to trick people into buying their product, I`m usually very pro consumer.
But at the same time I try to give the free market as much room to work with as possible.
Unnecessary regulations and restrictions are inevitably only going to be a hindrance and don`t really give us any other benefit other than a false feeling of being protected.
Television advertising directed towards young children is rarely harmful since most children aged two to five don`t watch TV the same way adults do.
For example if I watch a TV show my attention span is way larger than the actual time span of the program and so once it has ended I`m still hungry for more entertainment and my brain is still consciously watching TV, which makes it easy for advertisments dircted towards me to get my attention.
But on the other hand if a four year old watches a show like "Fire Man Sam" he can`t even pay attention during the whole episode, let alone during the adverstisment afterwards.
Another important thing to consider is the fact that advertisment for products for young children are actually directed towards their parents since three year olds are and shouldn`t be allowed to have their own money to spend anyway.
Ultimatley the parents have to make the decision to buy the product, if they consider it appropriate for their child.
Even in the case of a five year old who watches an ad for an action figure or some other toy, being exposed to it can in the worst case only teach him a lesson, if he doesn`t get what he wants.
Many people agree that television advertising directed toward childern aged two to five should not be allowed.
But why do they thinke so?
There are many reasons why it should be prohibited but how else should the new toy be advertised?
The companies know that the parents or grandparents buy the toys for the children, but the children should like the toy or else it is a waste of money.
Children are going to say their parents what they like and because of that is makes sense to advertise toward young children.
On the other hand children at the age of two to five like everrything they see and want to have it.
The parents like to see their child happy but what if they can not afford the new toy their child wants?
They're disapointed that they can not give the child the things that it wants.
The child is also going to be sad because if all his freinds has the toy he wants to but he can't have it he feels like he's not loved from the parents.
An other point is that the young children don't even understand what the advertise means.
They just find it very fascinating and want to be like the children they see in television.
For them it is like the perfect life they want to have.
They don't understand that it is just played to look like the perfect world.
Even though the child gets the toy it doesn't has a perfect life as the child in the television who has a lot of fun with his new toy.
In my opinion the television advertising towadrs children should be allowed but maybe not for children at age two or three.They are to young to understand what it really means and they just want to have it all.
As soon as the child gets older it should be allowed to advertise towards them but they have to understand that they can not have everything they see on television.
Televison advertising should be allowed for young children.
In my opinion it's a great idea to let children as soon as possible to work with multimedia electronics.
Children at a young age are very talented in learning new things very fast so they they will never be faster and better in learning new things than at that age.
In our culture television and other multimedia are very expended and important, so chlidren automatic will be conformed with these medias, so why keep it back and don't let them use it at a young age.
Some doctors may say that it's dangerous to let children playing and working with multimedia things at a young age, but i think sooner or later they will get used to the television and Co.
In many countrys televiosion advertising is already in use and the children don't get sick of it or have any problems with the handeling.
If we don't allow television advertising now it will happen in a few years, beacause the market is growing so fast and every minute the electronics get better and faster and we need to use them to get to work or to comunicate with each other.
So why don't let our children get used to it.
I'm sure in the future everyone will let their chilren to advertise direct by televisions, and it will be normal for everyone.
Everybody knows the situation: You're watching a movie but after twenty minutes some advertise interrups.
Television adevertising is on every channel.
Also the kids get in touch with the advertising.
Should the television advertising become forbiden for young children?
On the plus side of the television advertising can kids learn how many products excist.
They see that teddybears excist in many different forms and colours.
If they wouldn't see the promotion, they would think that the teddybears of themselves are the only one in the world.
But if the children see all those playtools they want to buy quite everything.
In the storage they are crying because of the "mean" mum who don't want to buy something.
An advantage is that the kids have to learn beause of the advertising what are important and what are usless informations.
They learn very fast that they can't guess everything.
Like that the advertise helps the kids to think by themself.
Enemies of the promotions says: "The advertise has to much influence to the kids".
A child doesn't see just television advertising which is made for his age.
It is very often confrontated with sloganes with bad influences.
For example: If they see some promotion with pills to lose weight, they are asking the parents why some people take these pills.
Like that they are confrontated with this beauty-force too early.
In my opinion the kids souldn't see every advertise.
But I think that's quite difficult to get trough.
But if it would be possible in a way I would say it shouldn't be allowed.
To sum up the television advertising has both; advantages and disadvantages.
But I thnik it don't have to be so much promotion.
Kids don't have to see everything in there young life.
Everybody or nearyly everybode watches the television.
When I was young my parents told me not to watch to long to the television.
Nowadays it is completly different.
Children getting a mobile-phone in the age of fife is sometimes more than usual.
I also got one really early but then I was nine years old and I had to pay it on my own.
Well, the question about advertising directed to five year old children is connected with several other things of education.
Education in the sence of sensibilisate the kids from getting stupid behind the television.
Its good for making the kids think of what they really need.
If there is an adverising about a playgun or something like that the can learn to ask themselves if they are really in need of such a thing.
But to the other side they look what their friends do or maybe what their parents want them to do.
So they dont think on their own.
But do they really think o their own in the ago of just five years?
No, I dont think so.
It could also be different.
In that age you often dont wanna do what your parents want you to.
So you start crying becaus you cant get your playgun before you have the possibility to think about it.
Should it be allowed or not?
Why not.
Thats now my own opinion.
It is not said that these children have to watch this advertising.
If the parents dont want them to they can just shot the television and make their kids to play in the garden.
But I see the next problem.
Many parents dont even realise advertising and its tricks.
So its absolutely ridiculous to want the children to realise it.
But you cant say the television is not allowed to send such advertising.
Thats a big problem.
Its their strategy to make young as well as old people to buy things.
If you want to do something in the opposite direction you would have to start to educate the parents because the children dont have an own opinion in that young age.
Start to sensibilisate parents who not realise how stupid and objectiv their children can get.
Parents, make your children watch docmentations about animals or about spaceshuttles.
Let them make sports or let them play an instrument.
But dont make them to see only one shity thing on the televion without thinking about it a little.
Let your children leave their lifes with a big futur.
"Mommy I want to go to McDonalds", said the three year old girl to her mother.
Many people are familiar with this situation.
The girl saw Ronald McDonald on tv and now she wants to go to McDonald.
But should such advertisment for young children be allowed?
One advantage of this advertisment is that the children are informed about their environment at a young age.
They might know where the closest pharmacy is at and where they have to go in an emergency.
But on the negative side the children get manipulated by the companies.
They see an advertisment about some toy and emediatley want this toy.
Their needs after material satisfaction gets bigger and bigger.
Furthermore it is difficult for the parents when their children have many material wishes and they can't fullfill them.
An other disadvantage is that the children want more electrical things through this advertisment and might forget to go and play outside.
It's important for a child to meet friends and play with them some games like hide and seek.
In fact the kids should explore the nature instead of the television.
On the plus side the kids could develope their caracter earlier.
For example they see some dolls in an ad and don't want them.
But then they see some teddybears and want one for christmas.
So the parents know what their child prefers and now they can get the perfect gift.
But this would make the happiness of a child dependent of their material gifts.
It shouldn't be a childs focus if they got this shoes or those shoes.
I think it's a bad idea to manipulate children at a young age to get more profit as a company.
In conclusion advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
They should rather play outside with some friends and explore the world.
In the following text I will discuss the question if television advertising direct to young children should not be allowd.
A lot of parents don`t know how to handle this issue and ask in conserversation with freinds about their opinion.
There are (I think) at the moment no facts which consist on evidence (bestätigen) that television has a bad influence on the childrens health.
The proponents using this argument add maybe the fact that children should early learn the possibilities we have and know how to handle certain informations.
A lot of parents just use the television as unterhaltung for their children while they have to go to work or to the supermarket.
They can leave the house knowing the children won`t leave the TV and do something stupid.
But the downside is that there are a lot of programmes on the TV that show the cruel world, the wars with death people and the destroyed surroundings.
Little children don`t know yet how to see the difference between a programme and the reality.
Maybe it leads also some children to criminal acts or to do dangerous things they have seen in a TV experiment.
I perfectly understand the parents view that sometimes children are so annoying and they want to have some free time on their own.
But I think too that we are responible for our children and we have to protect their fantasies and don`t influence them to much by the cruel facts.
Television advertising is a often discused thing.
Most of the people are against it and get angry when their favourite series is paused because of an adevertisment brake.
But television advertising gets far more controversial when a company is directing their advertisment towards young children.
So should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?¨


The main point people bring up against such advertising is that the children in this age aren't able to handle with advertisments.
Children in young age can be manipulated easily and believe in what the adverts suggest even if it is not the truth.
Children are not able to understand in their age that the world is dominated by the financial aspect and companies highest interest is to make as much money as possible.
On the other side people are giving the parents the responsibility to educate their children in such things.
Parents have to explain their children that the sense of adverts is to bring up an "I want this" feeling and not to inform the consuments about the positive and negative aspects of their product.
Furthermore at the end the parents are responsible for what they buy for their children.
In my opinion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because children are way to easy to manipulate in their age.
But on the other hand I think that it is very important that parents teach their children how advertising works and how it affects the peoples minds.
Furthermore companies know that children are easy to manipulate and so they are more interested in convincing children to buy their product than honestly explaining their product and it strenghts.
The question of this essay is, if i agree or disagree with the following statement.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
First, I would like to point out that children as young as two to five will not remember this time later in their life, maybe except very traumatsing experiences.
Furthermore,young children should watch channels which are specifically made for them in order not to scare them to death.
Also, they should not watch advertisement for adults.
For example women in the advertisement of Gilette shave their legs, which does not sound bad at first.
But if you look close it already teaches them the role of men and women in the society and children shoud not deal with that.
In my opinion it is better for them to get an advertisement for something to play with.
If they liked the things on television they can ask for it as a present for christmas or their birthday.
The parents can then decide if it is worth bying.
In the end the parents decide anyways, what their children are watching.
If the parents do not like advertisement for children, t
For those reasons I disagree with the statement.
Okay well I don't really know why we should ban such a thing from TV.
It doesn't really make a lot of sense to me and I probably don't really understand the statement anyway and maybe my text won't make a lot of sense to you.
But here's my opinion to this statement: I don't think you should ban such advertisments.
I mean it depends on what content it has and how they represent the product of whatever they want to advertise.
Of course it shouldn't also turn kids to having stupid brains and just watch TV all day.
And if it's directed to such young kids, they maybe should stop that.
Kids need to get out of the house and not stay home and stick their faces in front of the TV.
I don't know what else to say.
Technology took over humans.
Okay not really, I mean we are still living in this world of course.
I actually mean that humans are so addicted and constantly on their technologies, we can't imagine life without it.
Listen to be honest what am I supposed to say about this statement anyway?
I can't think of anything else than what I wrote and I that in like 8 minutes.
And that timer up there is still stressing me out.
I can't write 300 words because I can't think of anything else to type on this modern hp-computer.
I apologize for my behaviour in this text but I'm about to rage.
And the best part is I have to sit here for the next two hours.
I wonder what will come up next.
Yes I want to do something with filming in my future lifetime and maybe develop some advertisments.
But why the hell should this be banned from TV?
It's not pornography or anything similar to that.
It's just something that people want to sell to the world specifically to children aged two to five.
But what on earth do you think they will sell?
a dildo?
Of course not.
I completely respect the statement but I can't argue about it because I actually don't really care.
I understand if the advertisment would contain inappopriate information but in the end of the day they will ban that in some time anyway.
That doesn't mean you have to ban every single one of them.
Just the ones which aren't supposed to be aired on TV.
But seriously do you think the advertisers will be like: "Hey I got an idea!
Let's advertise some inappopriate toys to young kids aged two to five!"
If that's the case well then i can just say that they are mentally ill in their heads and just disgusting pedophiles who don't have a normal mind of thinking.
Of course there isn't anything "normal" in this world anyway.
But I'm just saying with some stuff you can like re-think about it before you actually open your mouth and share it to the whole entire world.
There's a Dark Web that exists in the internet.
They should check that out.
Well actually no.
They shouldn't check that out.
But instead of making a huge fuss about TV advertisments for kids they can start banning the sick-in-the-head place that's called Dark Web.
But anyway I think I didnt understand it.
The subject tv advertisement is often discused because of how the media rules our mind nowadays.
I, myself, think tv ads directed towards young children shouldn't be forbidden but I'd say it's a waste of money for the companies because such young children usually don't watch tv regularly that's why they'd probably barely ever see any ads, especially because they might only watch one show and then their parents would turn the tv off again.
Sure it's not the same for everyone and in some households they might watch a lot of tv and see those advertisements but it's not the norm.
Overall if I see ads, doesn't matter if for example on tv or in magasins, I don't feel like buying that object.
Sure it makes you aware of the product and the brand but otherwise my shopping isn't being influenced by advertisements.
If parents are concerned that their kids would annoy them with buying stuff they saw while watching tv then I suggest not letting them watch tv that often.
But even though I disagree with the statement above, I do think that it's not necessary and definitely no one would miss anything if they'd stop advertising products on tv, doesn't matter towards who it is.
Television advertising becomes more and more important in our daily lifes because more and more people are able to afford a Tv.
Even though a lot of children between two and five years do not yet watch a lot of television.
With that being said advertising becomes totally irrelevant.
But if they actually watch Tv, they shouldn't be confronted with advertising because some of them include rude statements.
I think children should grow up without being influenced by Tv advertising.
If they watch to much Tv, they'll get educated from the tv not from theyr parents.
Sometimes Tv advertisor use specific sentences to kind of conrtoll the childrens minds.
They know exactly how to get theyr attention because young children do not have as much experience in life as for example theyr parents do.
With that being said I do not think that the community should ban Tv advertising.
I think parents should pick theyr nose and conroll the television consume of theyr children.
If they successfully do so, I don't think Tv advertising will become a serious problem.
Advertising toward young children is a good life lesson for everyone

Advertising is an often discussed problem especially when it comes to advertisement for children.
While some people are certain that advertising toward young children should not be allowed as parents will hear their children say they want this teddy bear right now advertisement for children does have its positive points: a higher income of the advertising agency, a great example for parents to show their children how to handle money and a lesson to teach a child to resist.
First of all, the advertising agency does have a higher income because most children want to own everything they see especially in television.
In addition, parents are often not able to say "no" and eventually buy the certain product.
As a result the child reaches a temporary happiness which makes every parent happy too.
When it comes to the income of an agency, they will gain the most money with advertising directed toward young children not only because there is a higher possibility that parents will buy it but also because children will go to there friends to show off with their new product.
As a consequent, these friends will want it as well and the advertisement spreads out - the income increases.
Additionally, advertisement for children is a good example for parents to show their children that it is not possible to buy whatever they want.
But that it needs to be able to handle money.
For instance parents can teach children that one teddy bear is too expensive, while the other one is affordable and as a result okay to buy.
Lastly, children need to learn to resist.
They cannot have everything they want.
After having six teddy bears in their bed it is just enough even if that teddy bear in the adverisiment is the cutest.
Advertisiment teaches exactly this resistement of products which seem to be so extraordinarily beautiful and perfect.
Children need this life lesson to grow as a human.
Television advertising directed toward young children is efficient for the advertising agency, teaches parents to be the boss and children to resist.
Consequently it does have a positive impact and if parents cannot handle television advertising then how bad is this last part of the payment in a shop with all that chocolate and sweets?
Advertisement which is targeted at children has quite a big influence on our children and their lives.
When they see an advert on the television, they often want the products which are advertised.
Consequently, some people say that the children's opinions are altered by television advertising and they believe that our children should be able to make up their own opinions.
Additionally, it is argued that since advertising almost always presents a product, such as a toy, it makes the children believe that the material wealth is the most important thing.
Instead, they should be taught to value the immaterial things in our lives more.
Another interesting idea is that due to television advertising children in poor families see what rich parents can afford their children.
This can lead to the children's beeing unhappy about their family situation.
On the other hand, children should learn to cope with advertisement since they will encounter adverts all the time when they are adults.
It is therefore important that the parents teach their children to cope with television advertising, which leads us to the next point.
It is not the State's responsibility to protect our children from negative influence of advetising, but rather the parents' task.
They are the ones who should ensure that their children learn how not to be influenced too much by the adverts.
Last but not least, it would be hard to find a economist who would vote in favour of such a proposal.
This is for a good reason, because a lot of companies rely on selling kids' toys.
As a result, such an advertisement ban would have negative effects on the economy.
Because of the negative impact on the economy and the principle that it is the parents' responsibility rather than the government's, I do not agree with the statement.
Television advertising direced toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Children in this age don't knowe anything about life.
Theyr are dependent from theyr parents.
The economy is a big part of evrybody life ist a part of the children too.
There is a winn winn situation.
The children need some plays how Lego or Playmobil.
The children lean by playing.
The economy use the television to present the children the new plays and whats its possible with this tihngs.
So why shouldn't it be allowed when the parent of the children do the same and let them inspired by the adversiting.
So the economy can grow and the children can learn.
But there are some negative points.
If its allowed the children are slaves of the economy.
They don't know anything about life and how it works.
The economy use the joung people to make money.
The children don't know how mutch they have to pay for for it.
They haven't money.
The parents have to realise the children dreams.
At the end  the children have all the won't and don't know what it calls to have not anything.
There are children who have to work in this age in othe continents.
Ant our children have all things.
I question myself why children are watching TV between this age.
The children sould play aoutside on the street withe theyr freinds.
They tould play in the forest and enjoy the nature.
In this age they souldent be aroundet from TV, laptop, smartphone ant things like this.
They soult just be children.
In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed.
This children are our future.
We shoulden't influence them in this young age with strategies from the economy and from the TV.
Saturday evening, you are watchin a good movie.
Then the movie is interrupted and you see an ad.
Then another ad appears and you get slowly but surely angry.
Television advertising is nervous but sometimes they show some good products.
But what about the children?
Should the advertising direct towards young children?
I think it shouldn`t because if they show an ad with toys which the children want, they will cry until they get it.
So for the parents it is not just expensive, their life gets more stressed.
Imagine every day the same.
Your child is watching TV.
After a while an ad is shown during the break of a serie.
Your child is excited and wants this toy.
You say no, it stars to cry.
At a point you have enough and you go to buy this toy.
So this produces more costs for you, you have to work more.
On the other hand you can say no and let your child cry, it will stop after a few hours.
But you won`t have a relaxed evening because the child may say no to things you want that it does like going to bed.
An other argument is that it interrups the serie the child is watching.
Maybe it doesn`t understand what they show but it wants his serie to move on.
It gets sad maybe starts crying, so you don`t have tranquility.
I think it should be allowed because young children often don`t understand what they show in the advertisment.
They only see some, sometimes funny, mini-films.
They don`t realize that this is an ad.
I agree with this statement because I think this is not okay from the advertiser.
He takes children in the ban of his product, only to sell more.
And sometimes an ad shows things that children shouldn`t see.
So it`s better when an ad isn`t directed towards children.
We often hear about the discussion if it is right to allowd children to watch televsion.
On one hand we know that too much television is neither good for our psychical nor our physical health.
If we wacht television all the time we get antisocial and we do not exercise enougth and this will lead to a non healty life.
So first of all if we know that it is bad for us to watch too much television why should we let our children do it?
Children should go outside and play in nature.
Secondly they should use their own imagination when playing and to only watch something imagined by someoneelse.
We should not allow our small children to watch TV so they could learn to be with themeselves and to play even if there is nooneelse.
They should live their childhood without too many electronical devises.
On the other hand why should we allow it?
We urselves watch television and if it is not done too much there are no bad results.
Anyhow there should not be any general rule or law against it because it is in the hand of the parents to choos their side in this discussion and do as they think it is right.
It is a personall question witch should not be taken away from the parents.
They should have the posibillity to make their own desicion.
In my opinoin it should not be prohibited.
It should be the parents desicion how they want to raise their child.
I just think that it is not good for a child to watch too much television.
The child should have an alternative to this.
For example the parents could say yo can watch TV as long as you have read a book or that after watching a little TV the should go outside and play with others.
In this senario the child would have a balanced life.
It would not be onesided.
A child's life should have many aspects and it should not be always the same.
Television adverting directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
More and more parents of young children let their children watching tv, but other parents and people think that it isn't good to let children use electronics.
When parents of young children have to do housework or have guests it's easy to set their kids in front of the tv.
The kids are happy and the pparents can do other stuff.
It's clear that watching tv not has to be only bad for the kids.
There are special programs for baby's and children on the tv.
In these programs the children can learn other languages, call animals by the name, learn objects or probably also how they have to (re-)act with other kids, parents and strangers.The brain of a child that sometimes watch tv probably could be more trained as the brain of a child that never watches tv.
On the other side it doesn't make sense to have children and just set them in front of the tv, because they don't want to spend time with their own blood and it's also not that good for the eyes of the kids to see too long ond often in the screen of the television.
Children should play in the garden or in a park with other people and parents.
It's important to learn in real life, because in the age of one two five the children make experiences which are a lifetime with them.
What the children see in the tv is not bad at all.
Some things they learned by watching are a good help to interact for example in situations as in the park.
They can repeat in real life what they've seen in the television.
I with a dood mix of both is important for learning to
  Do we already have to try to influence young children?
Do we have to try to sell something to them, even if we know that they believe almost everything?
This is a difficult question.
We all know that children, especially the young ones, are so easy to influence and that they believe everything that anybody tells them.
So it is also a very easy thing to convince them, that there's something that they need to have and that it is the best thing for them.
Maybe the children will be very disapointed about something that they have seen when they were watching television.
TV advertising is like telling them a story.The world is often perfect and the children believe it.
They don't find advertising as anoying as we do and maybe they see something that they love and they have a wish for.
Nobody says that it is not fair to make your child believe in santa.
And this is similar.
I think that advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.Not believing that everything in advertises is true is just another thing that they need to learn when they grow up.
And in the end there are still many parents who watch TV as well and maybe they see something that they'd like to have for their children.
Advertising which is directed toward young children is a norm in our television programms, but even though some may think that this shouln't be a source for worrying it can have a few problems.
The clips we are talking about are usually advertisings about toys or fun activities for children.
It may be true that at first you can think that these are harmless, but there may be another side to these adverstisings which are harmful for the devolepment of the young children.
Supporters of these advertisings should comprehend that in our society everything we see, and we see a lot thanks to the internet and therefore our fast access to information, remains in our memory and changes our thoughts, especially with young children.
First it is important to point out that children are the most impressionable demographic there is.
It should not be allowed to gain profit of young impressionable minds that still need to be formed.
The companies are aware of this and exploit the fact that young children are more gullable than adults and also their mood swings.
Children that young don't have a long attention span, so what they want in this second may change in a moment.
With smart advertisings which are short, poignant and often very colorful they can win the child very easily.
Secondly it supports the spoiling of a child.
If the child in question sees and advertising about a certain toy and then comes running begging her or his parents to buy him that toy than a lot of parents give in to have at a least a moment of rest.
Of course this is the parents decision wether or not they give in to the nagging, but because the children are objected to all these advertisings it encourages them to not be happy with what they already have.
Psychologically it makes them want something they don't have and when they have it another advertising comes around and they want that to.
We should be very careful about what we subject our children to and we should be aware that we live in a very wasteful society which supports our need to consume something and then hop on the next thing.
The longer we wait for the children to be exposed to this, the better it will be for the child and maybe we can raise the next generation to be more content with what they have and to be more humble.
Television advertising directed toward young children has some advantages and some disadvantages.
Nowadays, nearly everyone has a televsion in their house.
Many children like to watch some movies or series on the television.
If they watch them, they are automatically confronted with televsion advertisements.
I think children aged two to five do not realise that much as adults do.
For example when we watch a Disney movie in our age, we recognise much more details then we did in the age between two to five.
I think the parents are responsible for their children, so they are able to switch off the television when there is something, that the children should not see.
On the other hand, children may not recognise details but they understand much more than we think sometimes.
Because of that, children can be easily manipulated.
And if they learn something in their young age, they keep it sometimes until they are grown up.
Children are confronted with many wonderful things on the television for example during the christmas time.
If the children want something then sometimes the parents buy it because of the advertisements.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
Because I think that the parents are responsible for their children, they should keep their children under controll, that they do not watch to much television.
The following statement takes about adverticement directed towards young children, between two and five years old.
The main purpose of televison advertising is, to sell a product and earn money.
Each advertise has its own neash and is dedicated to a specific groupe of people.
Behind each advertisment there is a sertain promotion, that controlls people and their decisions.
Televison advertising helps a product or a brand to become famous and to be sold at the end.
Creativity can positifly influence an advertising so it will reach out to their comsumers.
AD dedicated to children might help them develop an interest in something or makes them familiour with all the options that are out in the world.
But there are major problems that advertising can cause.
Tt leads to consumerism.
With their clever advertising they can control your mind and make you want something that you aldready have or something that you do not need.
An other issue is, that it can promote a wrong image.
Advertising is a part of our life and comtrolls our decisions.
It can help us find a product in a mass of options but it can also lead to unnaiccesery comsumerism and materialism.
When it comes to advertising,that is dedicated to young children, I thing that it should not be allowed.
Influencing a child from such a young age is just cruel.
Children should grow up makeing their own decitions without being brainwashed from the media.
Even if their still quiete young they get a wrong image trough television advertising.
Whenever you watch a movie which is played in the television, you're interrupted by some annoying advertisement.
Some people say that television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.
In fact, there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages.
Some people would say, there's no need to hide commercial from children, because they do no harm.
It's a everyday thing and belongs to the televison programm.
There's no reason to feel any guilt in showing advertisements.
The advertisement is made for new products and they're often not showing the whole truth.
They're made to influence people to buy something really good without giving any information about the negative side.
The children will believe everything they hear.
So it's not the best idea to make them think everything is only good and perfect.
There are also advertisement especially made for children at this age to make them wanted their toys.
Companies should have this ability to have a chance to grow.
In our world, marketing is a huge and important factor.
Another thing is that children aged two to five have no money and the parents have to buy them the things they want.
Without television advertising, parents aren't forced to buy that many toys.
Even if there aren't advertising directed toward young children there are some toward adults, so there would be the same effect.
To sum up, television advertising is part of our everyday life and have some influence on young children.
In my point of view, television advertising is nothing bad and should be part of the television.
The statement "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed."
highlights the issues surrounding the impressionability of young children, which is often abused by corporations.
The author of the statement is of the opinion that such advertising should not be banned.
However, in today's modern society, is a claim such as this to be taken seriously and is this something worth considering, or is this an isssue of no importance.
On the one hand children's television is an important source of income for many television companies and it is understandable that the adverts shown are directed towards the audience watching.
Many children enjoy watching the adverts as they can learn about new toys and games on the market.
Another point supporting advertising directed towards children during this segment of children's television, is that other adverts might be of an inappropriate nature and make young children feel uncomfortable.
On the other hand, companies are well aware of how impressionable young children are and often advertisements for toys are not completely accurate, leading children to believe that they are getting something far more desirable than the item their parents buy for them, meaning that parent's are essentially wasting money.
The second and perhaps strongest argument is that there are many adverts for snacks and drinks directed at young children, these adverts are dangerous because they can lead to young children being unaware of the health risks that these foods pose and not learning about healthy eating at a young enugh age.
They leave young children with the belief that such and such gummy snack is a cool thing to eat as the adverts glamourize their consumption consideably.
These bad habits can accompany a child through their lifetime, leading them to think first of the tastiness of what they are eating and not what effect it is having on their bodies and health.
In conclusion although adverts directed towards children between the ages of 2 and 5 are perhaps necessary if the product for example a fisher price toy is targeted at this audience and needs to capture their attention in order to make sales the fact that the impresionability of young children is being abused for financial gain is undeniable and children are taught to think in incorrect ways when it comes to what foods they eat.
After all how many adverts for fruit roll ups and sugary juice boxes can we all remember being streamed into our conciousness as young children and infdluencing what we twanted to eat?
I personally believe that the author is correct in the statemnet that he makes and that there should be no television adverts directed towards children of such a young age.
I believe that when children are this young parent's can be relied on to make choices as to what products to buy to further the happiness of their young children.
Television for all ages

We all see them.
They are everywhere.
From the televisions to the streets, which we are using everyday.
I'm speaking of adverdisments.
Advertisments have a very big impact on the people, not only on the adults but also on young children.
For example: when a young boy sees a new advertisment for a new toy car, he wants to have it and annoys his parents to buy them that.
Should it be allowed to produce adverstiments directed to young children ?
On the good side it's positive for the people who sell the products for children.
Children are the easiest clients, because they are naive and they don't look at a price of a product.
When they want something, they want to have it and beg their parents to buy it for them.
That's an intresting and also a save way to sell their products.
But on the other side most parents can't refuse anythung to their children.
Because they don't want them to be sad and to hate them.
So they buy them for example: the new toy car because their son saw it on the televison ad.
It has also a very good impact on the childrens minds, they TV advertisments can control the opinions of the kids.
For example: what toy is cool, what jacket you should by next.
In my opinion it's a very good marketing technic, but also a very mean one.
Because children have a very big impact on their parents, the parents want their child to be happy and buy them what they want.
They spoil the children, but not only the parents also the media.
For me the parents should be a little more stricter and shouldn't buy everything that their children wants.
Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
Advertising Children

Many companies try to get new costumers by advertising on television.
Some companies try to get children between two and five years.
These companies try to sell candy, fast food or toys.
I agree with the statement because young children are easily influenced by advertisments on TV.
These advertisements are a reason why many children are fat.
Companies like Mc Donalds try to target young children by making advertisments that cater towards children.
At that age children can't think logically yet and get addicted to fast food.
Once they are addicted, they will go to these restaurants for the rest of their lives.
It's very difficult to get adults to come to your restaurant because they know that fast food is bad for your health and children don't know that yet.
It's also annoying for the parents of the children because they always want to go to that restaurant and to no other.
But on the other hand do I think that it's the parents fault to let the children watch TV at that age.
When I was that age my parents didn't let me watch TV, so I played with my friends or with my sister.
The parents could also let the children watch only one program like spongebob and when the episode is over they can turn the TV off.
All in all, I think that advertisments with the target audience being young children should be banned because young children are easily influenced by these advertisments.
Some of these kids could become fat if they go to fast  food restaurants too often.
Advertisings in general do occupy a big aspect in our daily lifes.
There are uncountable forms of ardertisings and we are getting confronted with advertisings everywhere we go, at any time.
Commeicials on television are very intense because they consume ones attenion by stimulating multiple humen senses, such as ones eyes and ears.
Therefore children can be easily influenced by tv-commercials because they react according to their stimulatings and feelings.
Advertisings on television which are specificially created to reach children, often include edits that are supposed to manipulate the young audience.
Children are easy to persuade and are likely to believe false promisings that are used in advertings to sell a product.
One problem of the manipulation is that companies do present an unrealistic image to children, so kids may start believe in things that dont't actually exist in the real world, beacuse they have seen it in a commercial.
Parents do also suffer from the specialized advertisisings, beacuse children will beg their parents to by a certain product as long until they will either buy it ore have a mental breakdown.
Even though that commercials for young children may cause some stress-situations or aren't very ideal for the kid's education, the advertisings on television should not be prohibited.
Children should get used to commecials and learn how to deal with daily advertising as soon as possible.
Parents also need to take the responsibility and educate their kids about commercals and the way how to react to them.
These days while watching TV, every 30 minutes there will be an ad.
Obvioulsy if you are watching TV online, you can have an adblocker but the people on television will experience those ads.
They might effect us but especially our children.
Therefore should we forbid television ads which even are directed to the children?
First, the parents would save a lot of money.
Children do want whatever they see (based on my experience).
So let's say they want an iPhone which they saw on TV while watching an ad.
They would beg and beg for this kind of piece of technology and even they are starting to make a mess.
What can we do then?
We nearly "have to" buy it for them and those aren't that cheap like a teddy bear.
Second and last those ads might shape their life.
In the future they could be all lazy bed room sleepers with their iPads and iPhones in their hands and doing nothing.
They wouldn't go out to play with friends or even doing sports because they are used to be on their new devices.
Those ads provide different things to them which might be dangerous in the near future.
On the other hand, they might see something very useful due to an ad like a useful gadget or stuff like that.
The ads these day does have some really useful stuff.
Another aspects by allowing the ads would be getting ideas for the future.
They might get an useful idea of a future product.
So in that case it would be good to direct those ads to children.
But if I have to decide to forbid those ads directed to children or not, I would probably say yes.
When I was a child, I wasn't hanging out on PC's/ iPhones, I was going out playing some football and having fun with my friends.
Those ads weren't effecting us because there were just toys stuff like teddy bears these days.
But now we have iPhone ads or even worse.
As I said in the beginning in every 30 minutes there is an ad.
Maybe in the near future there will be an adblocker for TV's?
There is a big discussion going on about whether or not to ban television advertising directed towards young children.
As more and more young children watch television more companies are interested in showing advertisings on the respecting channels.
Now I'll state some arguments for both sides.
Many parents state, that their kids are to young and to easy influenced.
It is well known, that younger children are generally more easily influenced.
Therefore it is only logical that people want these advertisings to be banned.
Parents want these advertisings banned, so that their kids don't get influenced by them.
Another point is, that when young children like something, they want it.
If they now get flooded with tons of ads on tv they probably want multiple of the things advertised.
As they don't have money, their parent's would have to pay, making it rather expensive.
Because the parents have to pay for the things the chidlren want, it could get very expensive.
The third point is the fact, that generally speaking less ads lead to more enjoyment.
Nobody really likes ads.
The same also goes for small children.
Allready are the channels flooded with tons of ads.
So to make watching tv more enjoyable for them, ads directed to them should be banned.
However there aren't only positive things about a ban.
Small children shouldn't be watching tv in the first place.
More and more parents let their kids watch way to much tv.
If the children wouldn't watch it, ads would be obsolete and there wouldn't be a need for a ban.
Another thing to keep in mind is, that most of these children don't understand what they are watching.
If they now see an and, it doesn't mean, that they understood the message.
So again, a ban would be obsolete.
Now the third and most important point.
These ads are vital for the channels.
If channels with shows directed towards young chidlren wouldn't be able to have ads anymore.
Their revenue would decrease very strongly.
So to keep these channels alive, it is necessary to have ads, also the ones directed to young chidlren, their main audience.
After looking at the points stated above, it seems, that the channels themselves should decide whether or not they want these sort of ads.
A ban would just lead to problems for the companies hosting the channels and would be to big of a change for many companies.
Television advertising directed towards yong children shouldn't be banned.
I agree with the statement that television adverstising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
To understand why it should not be allowed, it is important to know what adverstiser are.
These are attempts to influence a child's mind, in order to make its parents to buy the advertisied product.
First, young children are not aware of the reason behind advertising like explained in the beginning because it is a complexe thing children dont zhhink about.
They are not aware that they are influenced, whereas older people can be aware of being influenced by advertising.
Second, young children do not even know that they are influenced by advertising.
Their state of mind is not that developed to realize such an influence.
This kind of influence is called brainwashing, which should definitely not be allowed, especially because these children are in a rapid and dynamic character development which affects their further lifes.
The parents cannot fully protect their children from being brainwashed, only if the parents abolish the TV from home.
So the state should take action in this and prohibit adverstising directing young children becuase these little human beings are truly innoncent and should be first edcuated about influences when they are old enough so they know
If parents do not know what they can do with the childrens, they sat them in front of the television.
This has disadvantages and also advantages.
In this essay, I will discuss if the television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Young childrens are boy and girls in the age of two to five.
The childrens in the age of two to five are learning much easier to speak a language.
Movies in Switzerland are often in standard german, while we are speaking dialect at home.
Later, in school the people have to learn standard german.
If they look television as a child they can better and easier speaking standard german.
A negative point of looking television is that the childrens do not play anything at this time.
They do not explore and they do not make expermients what is important for getting intelligent.So they loose many important skills like going on with materials like sand.
Furthermore, childrens are inactive while they are looking television.
Many people in industriated countries have a problem with overweight.
On one side it is because they eat too much fastfood and sucre.
On the other side it is because many people are to less active.
In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
The children can not learn much things while looking a movie.
The only thing they can learn, is to speak standard german but this they can also learn in the childrengarden.
In todays life even young children get in contact with new technologies like computers, smartphones and also television.
These young people are easily influenced by the media and also by advertisements because they do not know it better yet.
To form future consumers and costumers companies try to influence these people already at a very young age.
Television advertising direct toward young children should not be allowed because these young people might experience a negative influence of which they are not yet aware of.
This could result in an different uprising compared with those who did not watch television at a young age.
In advertisings are always flashing and bright colours, women and other tools which help to get the consumer interested.
Young childrend should not see such things like half nacked women or other offenive things.
Even if the advertisements are directed toward young children such elements are part of the advertisements.
The children should keep their innocent minds.
One the other hand television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because it helps the economie to grow in the future.
The economie is not only important for the industries and companies, it is also important for a country.
The government is also interested in a growing economie which results in a wealthy nation.
In the end it is all a desicion of the parents which allow their children to watch TV.
If the parents would not allow them to watch TV there would not be such problems.
In my opinion the companies should not make use of those innocent children even though it is a good tactic for winning new future cosumers.
Most of the advertisement are too offensive and often not meant for those young minds.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Nowadays an increasing number of families leave their children in front of the television for several reasons.
This circumstance results in different effects, whereby this essay will specifically focus on the influence of the advertisements on these kids.
The science of commercials has become a huge field of interest for today's society and, if not acquinted to the topic, is largely underestimated in it's manipulative effect on human psychology.
Unconsciously numerous gadgets are used to catch our attention, using colours, emotions etc.
As one's maturity grows, you gain the abilty to distinguish between desires and reality.
It takes a lot to put your realistic judgement over your will and it is that especially young children struggle in realising what lays within their possibilities.
They see other kids laughing on TV and wish to be in their position - leading to the parents having a hard time explaining, why they will have to find their luck without these toys.
On the other hand side Psychology states, it stengthens a kid's self-confidence if he/she can see their acting having a direct influence.
They see something, aak for it and half an hour later they might hold it.
Knowing there is action potential emphasises their self-esteem, nevertheless for example incresing their ability to get over frustration.
This argument can easily be weakened though since parents can also emphasis this characteristic by for example simply playing games with their kids - without spending any money.
In my opinion I find it unnecessary to display commercials on TV to small kids because it is not them that will have to live with the 'consequences', thus paying for the gadget.
Commercialists are taking advantage of kids and them being easily biased and this should nowhere be allowed.
Nevertheless leaving kids watching TV alone can have further negative influence and if parents do not allow this, there is not a need of official prohibition
Television advertisements: we have all seen them, we have all either laughed about them or even hated them.
But what does it actually do with a child's brain and the coseption of their environment?
It's nothing new to say, that television advertisements are made to convice or even brainwash you into feeling like you need something, even if you don't.
Children are weak victims as they haven't got the mental strength yet to distance themselves from the constant televison adversitements they play on repeat.
As a consequence they might get very unsadisfite, unhappy or even frustrated children.
My cousins, who are between four and six years old, started at a very young age to cry about a toy they saw on television advertisements, because oubvisely their parents would't get it.
It seemed like they couldn't live without it anymore and when you started to convince them, that they already had enough and even better toys than the one they saw on TV, they just went on throwing a fit.
Of course I have to admit, that now as they get older it doesn't seem to affect them as much anymore, but I still don't find it funny as it puts parents in a very uncomfortable position.
I understand and accept that it's a very good strategy to sell more products and I wouldn't mind as much if they didn't play over thirdy advertisements between a children's cartoon and another.
It might also inspire you to buy something cool and usefull for your kids and make "their wish" come true.
I still think that we should try to avoid this brainwash for childen as much as possible and let them go outside, play with their toys, using their own imagination and fanatsy to make the old toy become a "new" one.
Let them grow old in peace in a world they are happy about what they have!
Nowadays it's a very discussed topic so I think it's really important to take a break and to think intensly about it.
Social media no matter if the internet, or like here the television, marks our life dramatically.
And the more years pass the younger the people get who are confronted with the fast moving social media.
So the question of young children beiing in connection with these commercials can be discussed deeply.
There are some positive things about such commercials in a young age.
Children can learn from a very young age to know which things are on the marcet and to think about what they really need.
And if the parents take some time they can explain their children that not everything what's shown to us is essential for a happy life (what sadly most of the advertisings claim).
But there are also a lot misleading parts about it.
If you spend too much time with people, in this case commercials, telling you what you need to have to be complete can be very dangerous.
Why do I say that?
Well imagine if someone tells you every morning you have to brush your hair to have a propper appearance someday you will start doing that and believing that yourself.
That's the trick about commercials.
They do the same thing to you and if such young people grow with that idea of needing everything they tell you they will have it a lot more difficult to think for themselves and to difference what they really need or what they just crave for.
In my opinion children shouldn't be confronted that directly with these commercials because the negative points that are listed have a bigger effect on the future life and they aren't able to think in a rational way.
We fall too fast into that dependence of the advertisings don't we?
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because of several reasons.
First of all, children are not a part of the adult community yet and do not earn any money.
It is the responsibiltiy of the parent to decide what is good for their child and what they want to buy for it.
Therefore the advertising should be focused on parents and not on to children.
Secondly, children are easily influenced, which makes it a lot easier for advertisment companies to get into the children's heads.
That fact brings a certain danger, some people could misuse that opportunity to influence children in a bad way.
And it could also be a reason for a quality drop in television advertising.
I also think that children should spend more time in nature playing, making social contacts and making a lot of experiences out there in the world.
It might be alright to watch television from time to time, but if the advertisement encourages children to play with some product and make them believe that they actually need it to be happy it makes them addicted to things, which could kill off children's natural eagerness to live and play.
Having too many things or products also dicreases the children's creativity, since they do not have to come up with any own ideas to play anymore.
This would lead to serious problem when the children become teenagers or adults.
They would always have to rely on products to entertain them.
All in all, television advertising targeting children seems to be a very bad idea to me.
It does not focuse on the buyer but on the user of the product, which does not make sense because the parent is responsible for their child and should decide what they play with.
It has also a high possiblity of influencing children negatively.
Other points are that it discourgages the children to make any experiences in the real world and it decreases a children's natural creativity.
Nowadays multiedia like radio, television or computer has become dayly stuff.
There is everywhere advertising.
It is possible in every kind of way to make publicity.
Some Advertisments are even for young childern aged two to five.
They watch tv and become influenced by the ads.
Should television advertising directed toward young childern not be allowed?
Firtly,young childern aged two to five don't understand what advertising really is.
they see the ads about maybe diffrent toys for children, they find them cool and want them but finally they don't understand what this toys really are and why they're seeing them.
It is always the parents' desition whether they by something for their children or not ans not the childrens' desition.
So advertising hasen't a great influence on little kids.
Secondly, young children shouldn't watch television at that age!
They should play with other kids and learn things and not stay hours infrint of a screen.
So it isn't the companies' fault if a child wants a toy or if the child crys because it dosen't get it.
Parents should't let them watch tv if they don't want that teir kids demand toys.
Summing up, advertising is something you can avoid if you really want to.
It is a parents' job to make sure that their children do not become influnced by television advertising.
And also if they get influenced, the parents can always say no and decide ifthey want their children to get inclueced.
Personally, television advertising directet toward children should keep being allowed.
As a matter of fact, nearly every child aged two to five watches tv from time to time or mostly even on a regular basis.
Children orient themselves on every sort of idol they are in touch with.
Thats why the influece of television advertisement shall not be underestimated.
Still, it doesen't get children in any danger.
If you have a closer look on advertisement for toddlers, its almost exclusively about toys, a tv show or gross looking colourful cereals.
In the worst case, the child has a screaming fit, when it's parents won't by them that transformers roboter or the new barbie house they saw on tv.
In comparison to the effects that advertisement has on younger women and teenage girls, the toddlers are far better of.
While 14 year olds pressure themselves about not looking like the angel from the Victoria's Secret ad, developing a completely sureal picture of the ideal woman's body, toddlers just desperatly desire that new gameboy that now comes with every happy meal.
The only risk I see in toddler advertisements, is the toy machine gun, the battelfield game or the fake granade.
A potentionally handicapped child could develop a wrong image considering weapons and war.
But on the other hand, children have awlays been playimg with squirt machine guns, water pistols and some centuries ago with slingshots, so a connection between playing with guns in an early chidhood and later misuse of weapons is highly questionabe.
In conclusion I think that w certainly have bigger, more important issues to talk about and give our attention to, than advertisement for chilren in an early age.
If a person has the opionion that advertisements have a bad influence on his or her children, this person should just simply not let them watch it.
In these days everyone wants to make as much profit as possible and therefore advertising and especially television advertising gets more and more important.
But often they can influence people and especially children to buy things they do not really need.
In this essay I will discuss the question whether television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
There are some reason which support the statement that televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Children aged two to five can often not decide, whether they really need something or not.
They can easily get influenced by the pictures represented in the advertisments.
They want to have what everyone else has.
The parents then have to convince them that not everything showed in these advertisments is useful and sometimes things are not as they look like in television advertising.
This often leads to conflict between parents and their children.
But there are also reasons which show that there is no problem in showing young children television advertising.
Adults often get influenced as well by television advertising.
So, why should television advertising directed to adults then be allowed?
In addition, children get not just influenced by television advertising.
Other advertising methods or even other people can inluence their opinion about something just as well or even more.
In my opinion there is no need to not allow television advertising toward young children.
Of course they can be influenced but I think other people can be influenced by advertising just as well as children.
In addition I think that other factors influence childrens opinion more than television advertising.
A lot of children are watching television eventhough they are very young.
On one hand the question comes up, if young children aged two to five should already start watching television.
Often, when the parents do not have time to carry for their children they put them in front of the television in order to advertise them.
But in this young age it is said that it is bad for the children's education.
Instead of watching television, they should learn how to play and to learn a lot of very important things and to be honest, I do not think that they really would understand what they are watching.
But on the other hand, maybe it is not that bad, because with watching television the children can learn the language.
Especially the Swiss children could learn the german by listening to television.
Despite the fact that they learn the language, I do not support this because when their parents are talking to them, they can also learn how to spell and understand the language.
An other problem is, that quite often in television is not shown the truth.
Sometimes, even in movies for children, there exists brutality and cruality.
In my opinion it is clear that a lot of teenagers and generally young adults do have problems in their social life because of having watched to much television.
Concluding I do not think that children should be allowed watching television, they should learn how to play with other children and how the real life is.
Advertising can be seen in all places in our everyday life.
In the Internet, in newspapers, magazines and of course, in television as well.
Especially television advertising is a very controversial topic, not only in terms of young children.
Some people suggest that it would be a good idea if television advertising directed toward young children wasn't allowed so that the danger which the children are exposed to could be minimzed.
However, the question arises whether advertising in fact is dangerous for young children.
In this essay, some arguments of both sides are given on this topic.
On one side, it can't be denied that advertising has a huge influence on us and our everyday life.
Sometimes, we clearly see how advertisments try to manipulate us but in other cases, we don't even recognize their impact on our decisions and our actions.
In consequence, advertisments bring some dangers with them.
Older people are probably aware of this and that is why it is not a general problem.
Yet, there is no way that young children are able to completely understand these problems.
Young children are unconciously influenced in many different ways.
To illustrate, if young children start to see advertisments of new toys in the TV, they usually want all the things they've seen and become somehow addicted to buying new stuff.
On the other hand, to pick up the last mentioned aspect, young children can't buy these toys by themselves, they need their parents.
This suggests that it lies in the hands of the parents to control their children.
Furthermore, there are probably quite a few children in such a young age that are not even allowed to watch TV but rather have to watch DVDs so that the parents know the exact content of what their children are watching and therefore, the problem with television advertising could be diminished.
To conclude, there are arguements for both sides of this controversial topic.
In a way, one could argue that parents are responsible for their children and therefore, it is a unneeded restriction of our mostly free economy.
Yet, there are many dangers that people, not only young children, are exposed to with the massive amount of advertisments in our everyday life and so it could make sense to protect younger people with the prohibition of television advertising which is directed toward them, similar as it is with the prohibition of advertisments for smoking which is also banned.
In my opinion though, we should try to stick to the idea of a free economy and I believe it should be possible for parents to control their kids so that the influence of these advertisments can be minimized.
And if these ads won't have any effect anymore, probably
Television and young children

Nowadays nearly every family has got a television at home.
Most people use the television to watch the news, the weather forcast, series, movies or documentations.
I think that television in general is a very good thing for children.
In my opinion there are many aspects which help children with their education.
For example there are series in which they can learn many things about nature, music, animals and more.
But there are also some series which aren't good for children like series in which they fight, shoot or use expressions, children shouldn't use.
Television shouldn't be prohibited, but parents should observe what their children are watching.
Parents should notice which series have a good influence and which ones have a bad influence to their education.
Another aspect is that parents should be aware about how many hours their children sit in front of the television.
In my opinion for children, aged two to five, it shouldn't be more than one hour a day.
There are some exeptions for example when they want to wach a movie maybe once a week or something like that.
But in general children have much more opinions than pass the whole day in front of the TV.
They should go outside in nature, play with friends or draw a picture.
I think this is a very interesting topic because when we compare this topic to the way of life 50 years ago this was no problem at all.
It was an exeption when a family had got a television at home.
Most families had got a radio to listen to the news everyday and not more.
Nowadays technology has more and more influence to our life and especially to the life of the children.
But I think when people 50 years ago could live without television, our generation should also be able to live without it.
When nowadays someone turns on the tv, he or she will probably be confronted with some kind of commercial they've already seen somewhere else.
But in most cases this doesn't mean they're going to buy it just because they saw it on tv.
In fact, a lot of people find television advertising very annoying, especially when their favorite show is being interrupted by it.
But what about the children?
Should there be television advertising on the favorite channel of a three years old child?
First of all, advertising was invented to make the customers interested in different products, like a shampoo, a razor or maybe some kind of makeup.
The customer would then go to a store and buy it.
But a child doesn't have any money.
It would ask it's parents to buy it and start to cry when they say no.
The parents would eventually be exhausted.
And their wallet would become thinner and thinner.
A child wouldn't understand what advertising is.
It would think the products are awesome and want them, no matter what they are.
Manipulating a small child and tricking it into wanting expensive toys and other products should never be allowed.
Imagine a child watching its favorite show when it suddenly gets interrupted by some kind of commercial.
Once wouldn't be the end of the world, but all the time would.
If it doesn't want the products, it will get annoyed by it.
Maybe it would even stop to watch tv and do something else.
It would be bad for the tv industry.
But on the other hand, it might do something better, like play outside with its friends.
This would be the only positive aspect of tv advertising directed toward young children I can think of.
But I'm still against it, because the child might still stay inside and watch tv instead of playing with friends.
There is no garanty for it.
And the bad aspects outweight the good ones by far.
Television advertising has more power than we think.
The influence of seeing all those topmodels with the nice clothes and the perfect bodies, or seeing the hot guy with the newest iphone, is quite huge.
But how does television advertising affect young children, precicly two- to five-year-olds?
And how bad is it for those children to already stand under the great influence of television advertising that early?
When young children see television advertising showing bad manners or habits, they could likely start bevaing the same, which is bad for their developement.
Children at the age of two to five are in a phase where they learn and develope just by imitating grown-ups.
They copy movements, gestures but also words and phrases.
So, it is important to make sure that children at this age don't see any television advertising that destroys their innocence and teaches them bad manners and/or words.
We live in a time where adverts are everywhere.
So it's quite important that we can deal with them, even if we don't like seeing them.
If children don't get used to advertisement early, it might just get harder when they someday get to know television advertisement anyway.
By letting young children see television advertisment right from the start, parents may be able to teach their kids how to deal with it earlier and also a bit easier.
I think television advertising directed toward young children should stay allowed, because I think that it's important that children learn
I do think that these young children can be baited way too easy.
But I dont think its a bad thing to have advertises towards them.
When I was young and would watch television I wouldn't notice that there is much advertising.
I just wanted to watch my favorite show and nothing else.
If the pause during two episodes would be too long because there was too much advertising I got annoyed.
Some products are designed for young children, so why shouldn't you be able to advertise towards them?
When a mother sees an advertisement for the newest and best toy, she wouldn't just immediately think of buying it.
But when her son watches the same advertisement, he would stop begging her to buy it until he will get it.
Children shouldn't be exposed to advertising that early.
Later in their life they will be facing an uncountable amount of advertisements.
At a young age their opinion can be chaned very easily, it need time to grow up an build an own opinion wich really represents what you are thinking.
I think people would like to have advertising towards young children banned because they think that these young children will get baited way too easy and kinda fall for the advertisement.
You should also consider the situation I mentioned above, the mother doesn't want to buy a new toy for her children, so she doesn't want her child to be exposed to those advertisements.
In my opinion it shouldn't be banned.
Advertising will become more important in the next ten years, so children will have to face it even if they wouldn't like to.
It is much easier to learn things when one is young and what we learn then is waht we will keep in our mind, so if a child is exposed to advertising very soon it will be able to easily handle with it later on in their life.
Children watching television.
A common sight in any household these days, especially as TVs are affordable for almost anyone nowadays.
I myself remember watching different childens shows, just so my mother could do something else for a while rather than entertaining me.
With all normal TV chanals come advertisements, usually for the newest beauty product or a nice car and most of us don't think twice about it.
But is advertisment on a childrens chanal for young children a good idea?
Children are much more influenced by things that people are doing around them, it is all part of the learning process.
This includes watching TV, which is not too bad as specific childrens films and series can even help them learn.
The problem is the advertising between these shows.
The things shown might seem appealing and could lead to dangerous behavoir.
For example if a nerf-gun is advertised and the child might think it looked cool shoot things.
If this child then found a real gun, it could end disaterous.
Advertisement for make-up and cars are made to look appealing to anyone it is directed to.
This is the same for childrens toys.
A child will see many toys advertised on TV as it is what most children love.
If he or she sees something she likes they will ask their mother or father to get it for them and this could go either way.
If the childs parents say no and the child will have a tantrum which is both not nice for he parents and the child.
Or if the parents say yes the child is happy but will ask for more and more and will either get a no and have a tantrum or get spoiled by all the toys.
Obesity is an ever growing epidemic all over the world.
And people are blaming the fast-food industry for it as thier food is high is calories and low in nutriens.
A big problem related to it is the growing size of overweight children.
Food advertisement on television is not helping this at all.
Advertising for a happy meal or cookies will only make the children want more food even if they are not hungry.
Which leads to them gaining even more weight.
This is why I agree with the statement above.
I think children are to easily influenced by the advertisements to be able to have them on TV.
Our modern world could not be thought without television.
People from young to old are watching on daily bases.
If that is healthy for little children is an other question.
Because so many people are watching, the television is a good place for advertising.
Now are we asking if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Advertisments for young children are not only bad.
When children never saw advertisments, directed toward them, then they do not know that not everything that is advertised is needed in life.
So if the advertising is forbitten, young children do not learn how to handle it and when they are adults they buy everything thats advertised to them.
On the other side advertisments try to persuade our mind to buy something.
The most people can think against that and deside for themselves whats good and what they need.
But young children are not able to think for themselves and want everything they see in the advertisments.
Especially if it is directed toward the two to five years old.
We should forbit this to protect the children from all this things.
in my opinion adversising to the young children should not be allowed.
Because they see too many things they do not really need.
If children are about one to fourteen years old they aren't able to think responsible or make important decissons.
We can't juge them because they just haven't collected enough experience.
So I think children at the age two to five aren't able to consider wether they should buy this or not, wether if it is good for them or bad, wether they should spend money on something or not.
They just look at things and they like them or they don't or they want them or they don't want them.
Children don't think about if they need thing like that or not.
The television advertising for children are mostly about toys or things to paint or build something.
They are often visualized better than they really are in reality.
Some toys can speak or walk, plays are often animated with other things, wich aren't in really in the game and most of the time the stuff in the advertising look better than in real life.
So children want them and if they receive them, they are dissapointed because they imagined the things diffrent than they really are.
On the other hand everything costs money and as i suppose children don't have money.
They want something they see but they're not aware what that thing cost, so they always have to ask their parents or their grandparents or someone like that.
And some toys aren't cheap, they cost a lot of money and some familys can not afford them.
So the children are dissapointed that they don't get what they want and they don't understand why.
The television advertising always bring some new things up new games, new toys.
Often Children think what is new, that is deffinitly better than something old.
So they always want the new things and they will never be completly satisfied.
So i think television advertising directed toward young children should not be alllowed.
They influent the life of the children too much, the children will never be satisfied.
And i think young children shouldn't watch that much Tv, so they should just bring de programme for them so they can watch it and then turn off the television and do other stuff like go out or play with toys.
And if they would show so many advertisings to little children like toward adults, children would watch more Tv and would want more stuff.
So i think it wouldn't be a good thing for them and i wouldn't be that sure if it would bring more money to diffrent companys.
Imagine you are sitting in front of your TV with your children.
The movie is so ripping and you can't wait until the end.
But then, suddenly the TV-advertising is coming.
You know that your children have to go to bed in the next 15 minutes, but the movie is going a little longer.
So what should you do?
Bring them to bed and having a big argument with them or let them watching until the end?
If there wouldn't have been the TV-advertising, they had been on the right time in bed.
So should we forbid advertising directed toward young children in the age of 2-5?
First, like I've told before, when there is an interruption between a movie, the child has more time for staying up.
Every person hates when you can't watch your movie until the end.
Especially when you are a child.
Parents today allow children to watch the movie to the end.
So when there is more interruption between, the child can stay longer up.
So it is a benefit for him, but not for the parents

In the TV-advertising there are often a lot of things for playing presented.
When a child sees that, it automaticly wants to have it.
E.g when it sees the brand new playstation.
That's the biggest dream of a child.
So he can play it wiht all of his friends.
But who will pay it?
Right, the parents.
And if they won't pay, the child gets very said.
.TV-Advertising is one of the important things for a TV channel to earn money.
Who has ever thought about the producer?
They also have a job and the aim is to earn money of that and also give the people something to relax (watching TV).
When I was a child, I also hated the TV-advertising.
But I learned to live with it.
At some point in your life you have to accept that.
And today there are lots of other possibilities where you can record a movie and then watch it at any time you want.
So I don't see any reason of give a forbition of TV-advertising for childrens.
Watch TV with two years?
Today a lot of children aged two to five watch TV.Shoud that be forbidden?
Why should this be forbbiden or why not?
Children aged two to five shouldn`t watch tv, because thy learn a lot of things in this years like how to climb on trees.But wen they watch TV they don`t go in the nature and don`t make experience for her lfe.
They only sit infront of the TV and do nothing.They don`t do sport,they don`t learn how to make a fire or how to swim,On the plus side you learn the language when you watch TV and you can learn a lot of new words.When you watch TV aged two to five years you could see thing who could destroy your fantasy or things who could shock you because as child you live in your world and you never have seen blood.
Then when you see blood you could have nightmars.When you watch TV you do nothing dangerous so it could be good to watch TV aged two to five years because you don`t hurt yourselfe or do other bad things when you wath TV.
So you see there are a lot good and bad things about watching TVaged two to five years.You can`t say it`s very bad or it`s very good to watch TV in these years,but in my opinion it`s bat to do it because in my childhood my parents did a lot of things with me.
I always was in the nature and everything was a new experience and made me very fun.I guess you feel afraid if you look back to you childhood and you only watched Tv all the time,because you haven`t done somthing real and you haven`t got a lot of beautiful experience.
Essay

The following text is about the question if television adververtising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
With young children is meant children aged two to five.
Television advertisements have different qualities.
Some are very deep and you think about it a long time after you have seen the advertisement.
And others are not as deep and do not have a specifial meaning.
They are just dumb or inappropriate.
Children aged two to five understand only adwertisements with clear meanings and which are easy to understand.
They can not think about the advertisements the same way as adults or teenagers can.
If the advertisements show bad things such as violence or things which are easy to understand they should not be allowed.
On the other hand advertisements directed toward children aged two to five with a deeper meaning can be allowed because they would not understand.
They would not understand because they can not think about things as adults do and if they understand, deeper meanings mostly have an important lesson to learn.
To sum up it depends on what advertisement.
If the advertisement has a deep meaning or does not show any bad things such as violence then it can be directed toward children aged two to five.
However, if the advertisement shows things the children should not see it should not be allowed.
Television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed, because two to five year olds shouldn't be watching TV all the time.
They should play outside and socialize.
They don't learn as much if they are just at home watching TV as they do if they are active and social.
Also, children can get addicted to watching TV quite easily.
They don't want to do anything else but watching TV and once they're used to watching many hours of television per day, it's hard to change the habit.
Parent's shouldn't think it's ok for their young children to be watching TV.
Television advertising directed towards young children can give parents the impression that they should buy a television for their kids, which can have bad effects on their childhood, as stated above.
On the other hand, a company shouldn't have too many regulations with respect to competition.
A free market requires free competition.
A business has to think of ways to sell their products.
If they feel the need to direct television advertising toward young children, then they should be free to do so.
Parents who aren't aware of the consequences that letting their children watch television can have, should be taught about them.
Yet, television advertising toward young children won't change anything about the problem.
Parents should be old enough to be able to decide if they want to buy a TV for their kids or not.
In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
It is immoral and doesn't help with the problem that too many kids nowadays watch too many hours of television in their free time.
In the last century advertising evolved into a new level.
Through digital media it has become fairly easy to direct advertisment towards a certain social group.
It is common for even young children to spend time watching television and thus being exposed to advertisment.
This essay will discuss wether or not television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Young children do not yet have a sense of what is true and what is a lie.
Because of this reason they should not have to deal with advertisement.
If a child watches a person telling him that this is "the best toy in the world" it will certainly want one.
At a young age a child will believe most of what it is told.
The child is still learing about the structure of this world and having to deal with a person telling you what is better will influence the development of his liking drastically.
To remain objective advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.
In contrast raising a child can never be objective and wether the child is influenced by advertisement or by his parents does not matter.
In fact it might even be better if the child gets influenced by people other than it's parents.
The child will then not grow fully according to the will of the parents which will grant it individuality.
This is the reason why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.
In conclusion advertising can be a risk because it affects the thinking of a young child.
Yet even though it is clear that the child is influenced this way, it can never be fully shielded from the influence of the outside world and this has to be taken into consideration when asking the question wether it truely makes sense to frobid a form of advertising which is onmnipresent in todays society.
Young children are easily manipulated.
If by their peers, their parents or other people or objects they look up to, children's opinions can be changed quickly.
Television and specificaly advertisments are especially important in this matter, but is it actually ok for children to be specificaly targeted by advertisment?
One might argue that it should not be allowed, and it would be sensible to do so.
Children are very suseptible to subconsious manipulation and have no means of defending themselves from it.
They willingly listen and take in consious information along with subconsious stimuli, leading them to unreasonable requests and maybe even changed behaviour.
On the other hand, children's parents have a great amount of control over what their child sees on the television and how it reacts to it, since their opinions and behaviour has been affecting that of their child since shortly after its birth.
Furthermore, children are not only influenced by commercials, but by anything they see and like, so banning or monitoring advertisements that target children can be bypassed by pretty much anything that is shown on televison.
To conclude, my personal opinion of banning advertisements directed towards children is, that a ban would not do much.
For one thing, parents are the ultimate filter of what children see and the behaviour they show as a reaction.
So if a child makes unreasonable requests, like constantly demanding new toys, parents can work against the advertisment by simply not answering those requests.
And, finaly, on the other hand children, even rather young ones, tend to recognise what they want or not without being guided by what they see on television.
Advertising - baiting the helpless?
Advertising is literally everywhere.
You stumble upon it in the market, you notice a slogan at the side of the road while driving and you red about "the best cleaner ever invented" in your morning papers.
While you probably just ignore it the way I do, not caring about what others think is best for you, is everbody able to do just that?
Is a small child, maybe even your own lovley child, able to resist such a strong opinion and thus able to decide on its own?
How could it resist a superhero telling it that Actimel will make it strong and ready for the day?
I mean, its a superhero, right?
That aside, is it really okay, even legal, to directly aim advertising at young children?
Latley I`ve read an infuriating article in the newspaper.
It was about a tobacco companie designing chewinggum cigarettes to look like their real product.
The direct aim was to influence children to a point where they would subconciously grab exactly those real cigarettes at a later age.
While they might not start smoking because of this, it still made me question our society.
Targeting and influencing small children sneakily, trying to make profit off them.
I would love to find someone who has a positive sight on this one, just so I could argue with said person, but since that has not yet been the case I will just let this stand the way it is.
Onto my second point, television advertising.
To be clear, I have never owned a television.
My Mom said no and that`s that.
However, even I didnt miss out on TV advertisements, since i was just watching TV over at a friends house, convincing my mother that i was going to be having fun with said friend at the playing ground.
Myself aside, advertising is, as stated, everywhere.
Introducing and marketing products is a fine thing to do and that is exactly why everybody does it.
My own mother always knew which was best, she had read all about it in a "saldo" article already.
Other mothers will most likley go by their childrens wishes, disregarding price and how healthy it is.
To come to a point, if you got the child in your bag, you probably got the mother and the money aswell.
While I find it questionable to directly target small children in a TV advertisement, it certainly isnt illegal.
Point is, "advertising" doesn`t stop there.
If your best friend is drinking a diet coke, you most likley want to atleast try one aswell.
That said, I personally think that there are a few lines that shouldnt be crossed, certainly not for profit.
While small children are most certainly more "vulnerable" to being influenced, they (or their mothers) are the ones to decide what to buy in the end.
After all, you still have to like it.
(And i hate you, diet coke, as healthy as you are advertised to be.)
To conclude, as far as my opinion goes, keep spamming your advertisements but please, please keep it on a realistic level and stop making me hopes.
I`m still drinking Actimel but no, I havn`t become a superhero yet.
Should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
Children see something and they are immediately in love.
They don't give up bothering their mom and dad until they get what they want or they sit there crying in the corner.
For parents advertisment on Television, on the radio or at the mall directed towards their kiddos is nerve-racking.
Surely they prefer not to be in the situation to be the mean parent in the first place, where banning of advertisement for two to five year olds would be great help.
Additionally the advertisements often promise more than the product's worth.
These ads are so colorful and bright, surely draw your attention to them and drown out all the sadness in a childs mind for a moment.
Be it sugar loaded cereal, a miraculous peeing stuffed dog or the show that's on next monday.
Then the product is overpriced and breaks after using it three times, unhealthy or bad for the development of a childs mind.
The child and the parent are fooled to the max.
On the other hand these ads help forming a childs fantasy and its first wishes.
If the parents don't want their kids to experience the advertisement there are easy ways to keep them from them or teach them otherwhise.
Who doesn't think it's easier to find a christmas or birthday present for their child when they already see so many propositions on TV, or to get the child occupied for the next hour or two with a TV show, while you can finally relax a bit.
Another point is that there is no reasonable explanation to why there should be advertisement directed toward adults and teenagers but not children.
What makes older people so much more worth advertising towards?
There is a good chance of making profit in the toy business and other related places.
I personally think that the kids advertisements aren't bad, because I remember enjoying exoeriencing them as a child.
My parents were able to control me and to not go crazy because of them.
They sure are annoying, but it's easy to switch the channel, look away or just ignore it.
In general, children aged two to five should not watch to much television.
There are psychological experiments which show, that children who watched a lot of television are a view time later not able to do the same things like drawing a person, like other children can with a lot of details.
So children did't get enough inputs wehn they watch a lot of television.
The advertising between a programm in the television are not just watched by adults but also by children.
And there are advertisings for adults and also for children.
But those for children are most of the time absolutely rubbish and just make children to want this product they advertise for.
Actually every advertising has this aim, to make people to want have a product.
But I think it is something different when you do it for children, because children do always want to have everything, also in the supermarked.
Parents then have to tell their children, that they cannot have everything they want, but the television advertising makes this much more difficult.
On the other side for many businesses it's something verry important because otherwise they will not earn enough money.
But my point is clear: Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Today, many young children watch in the age of two a lot of television.Does that damage the education of a child and should it be forbidden for them?
Arguments why it should not be forbidden are that many television programs for young people show good morals and the children can learn a lot of them.
For example when the protagonist of a programm says that you should not lie.
The child won't lie because maybe his parents said that and  the protagonist.
Another good reason why it should not be forbidden is, that for the children in the young age the television stars are for them heroes and they look up to them.
And when they do good things they will do the same as they do.
But there are also a lot of negatives for them and a lot of pro arguments that say it should not be allowed for young children to watch television.
A good reason why it should not be allowed for children is, that children who watch a lot of television does not learn how to make some social contacts or friends.
Mostely they are very quiet and does not want to do anything.
They just want to watch television.
Another pro argument is that young children in this age should play together.
The best would be if they go outside to play.
They should explore the world and not the world of their fantasy heroes.
In this essay we saw many different arguments which say that television for young people is good or bad.
But in conclusion I have to say that watching television is good for the education of a child.
( At least it doesn't damage the education), you just should not let your child watch too often television, because it should also learn to make some friends and explore the real world.
When I was young I regularly watched television and I do not regret it.
As far as I can remember I never liked those television advertising.
My mother did not like it at all when I was in front of the television because it would not be good for the eyes but my father thought that I would learn new things while watching.
But did I learn anything from advertisings?
Are advertisings good for children?
First of all, watching advertisings makes children curious because they show things with the newest technology and this stops the children appreciating what they actually have.
My father thaught me then that I should not believe everything I see on TV because most of them just want to sell as much as possible even when they have to lie.
Advertisings are good for children when they cannot speak the language fluently.
Watching TV teachs their listening and comprehension skills.
Of course, you will not learn much from advertisings but they often do only use simple words, so most of the people will understand.
In this way it is a good training for the children.
In conclusion, there are pros and cons.
You may let the children watch to practise the language skills or you do not let them because you want to protect them.
In my opinion, I think the parents should decide on their own what their children should watch or not.
There is actually no bad or good side of watching advertisings.
No matter where you are you see those advertisings everywhere and when you think that your child will be influenced by some more advertisings in the TV then do not let you child watch them.
Advertising on digital media, mainly on Television and on internet sides such as youtube, have experienced an uplifting in recent years.
Following the trend of our society to get digitalized, the children also seek their joy in television and youtube.
There they get confronted with advertisment for the first time in their lifes.
This essay should examine the question whetherr it should be allowed to create advertisment which is directed towards young children should be allowed.
On one hand, children between two to five years of age are not able to form an own opinion.
When they get confronted with a certain opinion, which is usually the case in those kind of advertisment, they frequently adapt the very same opinion.
Additionally, those advertisments often show, that one might be more included into the society, or in specific peers, when one  chooses to buy this product, which again makes them eager to this product.
All in all, it is extremely simple to generate a young child's interest towards a product

On the other hand, there are  parents, who should be responsible that for firstly what a child watches in its free time, but also what it buys.
A child does not have the money  to buy something.
Most of the times, they ask their parents to do so.
And the parents should not be that easily influencable.
Furthermore, if the law forbid these advertisements, then children would not be informed about new products they are keen on playing with.
This results in less children specific products being sold, which eventually can damage the economy.
Also, in the advertisment, jobs would be lost.
Additionally, the channels airing children programms would go bankrupt, since they cannot generate money from advdertisement.
Another point is the resistibilty.
Once an experiment was conducted in which children were given the opportunity to eat a marshmallow right now or wait and then eat two marshmallows.
The longer they waited for the other marshmallow, the more successful the will become in their later life, the study suggested.
In life nowadays, it is keen to be able to resist.
And these advertisements might be a good preparation for later life.
In conclusion, it can be said that to forbid those advertisements would seem like a good idea at first sight, but it would just bring disatvantages.
Ps: those lags/ freezes are highly annoying.
On every televison channel there is an advertising break at least 5 times a day.
Kids nowadays could easily get manipulated or influenced by these advertisings.
Now should the advertising be banned?
The first problem is, that the televison doesen't knows if the father or the mother of the kid are watching tv or if the kid is watching alone.
How does the tv knows when he should ban the advertisement and when not?
Because a whole advertising banning on every channel wouldn't work.
The channels earn really much money with the advertisement and they wouldn't give up these earnings because of the bad influence for the childrens.
But is there really a bad influence for the two to five year old childrens?
Children in this age want to learn as much as they can.
And a two year old could learn really much of the language of the country by watching all the advertisings.
For example my last english teacher learned english by watching tv in england and now she speaks perfectly english.
And this could happen with every child who went to another country really early in his live.
A bad thing is, that children in these years don't think comletely logic and their brain isn't fully complete.
So they could believe in things which aren't real for example people flying around in the city like in the SRF advertising.
I heard of a boy who always wanted to fly like superman because he had seen the superman movie and one day he dressed like him, jumped out of the window and died.
In the worst case something like that could happen.
My opinion is that they should continue with the advertising for every person because a child can learn from it, but the parents should always look at the child a little bit.
And also thechild shouldn't grow up by watching tv because too much tv isn't healthy.
For example I could watch until i was eleven or twelve one movie a week and after the movie a little bit tv.
Advertising in the television is a huge business meanwhile.
Today there are so many commercial breaks during a movie or whatever is on TV.
This can be very disturbing for the viewers, because of the interruptions.
The business though, is getting more power after all.
Imagine the broadcaster and companies are even trying to make money with advertisement for young children.
Now the question really is, should it be allowed?
Firstly, commercials for young children can be an advantage for adults.
They can be very helpful in order to inform parents about new products for young children, such as play toys or diapers.
However, children might not really profit out of that.
Especially when the grow older and they see such commercials in the television, it is to assume that they want to spend more time on the Tv.
The reason for that is that children probably will ask the parents more frequently to go on Tv.
Moreover, children also might get euphoric about a special product, which they really want.
This may also be very disturbing for parents, because children are trying to persuade the parents to get the product from the company.
Thus, this is not a controversial topic were the opionons can be totally splitted.
In order to all those facts I would like to admit, that in my opinion commercials for children are definitely exaggerated.
For me this is an absolute reason that advertising has been growing for the past decade and I really do not think that companies need to do that.
Children in that range of age are very young.
Usually, they are not capable of judging a situation like adults are and this makes it easier for companies to convince children of their products.
I think this is very unfair, even rude.
It is like making someone weaker and smaller the decision for you.
Plus, that the children are always seem cute and that is why an adult is more likely to say yes to the product even if they do not want it and this is rude.
In this essay I want to talk about if television advertising directed toward young childern who are between  two to five should be allowed or not.
There's a big contraversy on this topic and there are many different oppinions on it.
My goal is it to show you the positiv and the negativ aspects of this topic and at the end I want to explain my own oppinion.
I want to start with the positiv aspects.
At the moment we are conforonted every day with advertisement.
There is no day where you don't see or hear advertisement in any form.
So why should it not be allowed to make advertisment which is direct toward yound children?
They are confronted to it even if it is not directly toward them.
If they see it in young age they maybe even learn from their parents how to look at them in a critisizing way.
Even if there are a couple of positive aspects to it there are aspects which are not that positv aswell.
For example that young children especially between two to five can be easily influenced by the advertisement.
Maybe there's a danger which we are not aware of.
Like this you could manipulate the children when they're watching TV and they don't even realise it.
In my oppinion the television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed but in a way where they don't get influenced that much.
You can make advertising about healthy food for example.
Like this they get influenced but in a good way.
At this young age you shouldn't let your children whatch TV on their own anyway.
The question whether television advertising directed toward young children, from age two to five, should be forbidden by law is controversial.
This essay is going to examine the issue from three differnt aspects to conduct a reasonable answer.
Firstly one could ask herseld or himself, why should someone wants to invest in two to five years old children.
Those children somehow don't earn any money to spend, neither do they get any from their parents, and mostly their understanding is not enough developped to obtain the message of the advertisers.
On the other hand it can be argued that they do respond to advertising and that there is really a danger.
Namely the companies stress a psychological effect on the children.
That means that advertising occurs to manipulation toward kids in therearly growing stage.
Last but not least one needs to question the system and its reason.
In general kids should not watch any advertising on television.
If they do, it means on one hand that they watch more than 25min on one stroke, which is obciously not healthy, and on the other hand that theîr parents are not able to control the amount of time that their kids watch and secondly, more importantly: what they watch.
Therefore I do stronly believe that the parents of the children should be aware of their responsibility and the law should not interfere in the advertising in television.
This would only give the parents the signal to be less cautious about their children's activities.
I think that televiion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
In that early phase of their life, these children begin to develope their thinking, morality and behaviour.
With the advertising directed to young children, their interest in products and offers could be influenced even controled by the firms who make these advertising.
Through the advertising in the early phase of the children's life, the firms achieve to get loyal clients in the future because these children grown up with these firmsin their minds.
We should protected our children from such an influence because these children are our future and they should develope a free mind and not grow up with the influence of big firms which have only an interst in their profit.
These firms don't see us people as humans, they see us simply as clients.
And I'm gonna be honest wit you.
I don't see one positive argument to allow advertising which are directed toward young children.
These positive arguments would all end with the same goal: money.
Nowaday children watch a lot more television than they used to at the end of the 20th century.
Today nearly every house has a television.
People often do not watch tv for the latest news but to watch movies or documentaries.
So it's normal that young children watch tv for fun but is it healthy for them?
Children at the age of two to five learn a lot of things and it is the age where children learn the most and the brain has the biggest capacity to learn and understand things.
Children (also Tenagers/Adults) who watch television turn off their brain and they forgett the things they "laerned" a few moments before.
The brain needs time to overthink and repeat the things so that the children can remember and it ist saved in their heads.
If children watch tv the brain cannot repeat the informations.
Also teenagers schould not watch tv or game on their sell phones after studying.
Better than watch tv ist reading a book or listening to music so that the brain can work and make the important connections.
Children who wtched tv when they were younger are not that succesful when they grow up than children who didn't watch that much tv.
They learn to spent their time with other things and they developpe their social behaviour by playing with other children and spend time outside.
When tv advertisings are directed toward young children they feel welcome, they are includet in the "world of television".
If there weren't these advertisements the children may not feel comfortable.
I think advertising directly toward young children schould not be allowed.
But the most tv programms has them
In this essay the topic of televion advertising directed towards young children is discussed.
This is a controversial topic as there have been rising many concerns.
The statement argues that young children who are aged between two and five years shoud not be the targets of these television advertisements.
First of all, it is arguable that these advertisements should stay allowed, because there exists the law that states freedom of speech.
For example if there are no more television advertisements allowed for products that only sell to children between the age of two and five years these companies can't sell their products.
Therefore, these televsion advertisements have to stay allowed.
Secondly, it would hurt the economy if these companies couldn't sell their products anymore, because they are not allowed to make television advertising.
This could lead to whole companies who have to file for bankruptcy which leads to a loss of jobs and this hurts the economy badly.
Thus, even parents of children who are aged between two and five could lose their employment.
On the other hand, parents have to buy these products for their children, because the children have seen them in the advertisements.
For example, a boy who is three years old sees the exact same toy car he has seen in the television advertisements in the supermarket.Of course he will beg his mother to buy it for him een though he might already have tons of toy cars at home.
Furthermore, the exposure of small children to the same television advertisements can lead to an indoctrination of these children.
For example, a little girl four years of age only wants to drink a certain juice anymore, because she has seen this advertisement over and over again.
These arguments would suggest a ban on television advertising directed toward children between the age of two and five.
In conclusion, the arguments that support the statement are more serious than the ones that disagree, because the young children are the future and they cannot be indoctrinated.
Others would argue that if the economy is hurt badly there wouldn't be a future to live in, but the companies can still make advertisements on other sources.
Therefore, this topic is very controversial.
In my opinion, I wouldn't ban the advertisements, because they are only on television and if parents don't want their children to be exposed towards them, they have the possibility to not let their children watch television.
The fallowing statement is a true thing in my eyes.
I agree with it.
I think that there is already to much advertising on television.
If you want to watch a film, you spent like two thirds of the time watching some advertising and this really annoys me extremely.
Also it is a very bad thing, because advertising forces you to buy things you maybe never wanted to have.
Everything is showed in a unbelievable fascinating way, witch isn't the truth in realitiy, for example a hair product.
It really attracts women to buy stuff to color their hair, because it looks so wonderful in the advertising, but in realitiy the stuff sometimes looks like straw.
And thats exactly what is does to the children, because in advertising for children there are only things, that every child wants to have if it sees it in televison or if a friend has it.
And with advertising, these things are totally force kids to want them.
The diference between adults and kids is, that adults most time can make the difference if something is really good and if they need it or not.
A child most time can't know this.
It sees it with its child eyes, and it wants everything witch looks good, funny or cute.
Advertising is also played by children.
It shows kids that are playing with the new playmobile or with a cool lazer pistols for boys.
And if kids see these other kids smiling while playing with the things, it automatically shows the kids that tis must be fun.
In my opinion the kids are manipulated by advertising in a very bad way.
It also shows to the child that it is needed to have cool things to e cool and to have fun.
And most times it starts if some child of a schoolclass has a cool thing, because everyone wants it too.
In case, it is also negativ for the parents because they have kids that are killing their nerves, because they want something so badly.
And you can't explain them why they can't buy everything.
It's just a very bad way to force kids having stuff they don't have.
And it's a sad story that adult people do this just to making money.
What makes a successful business?
Is it the number of products sold?
Or the revenue?
This is a well argued question all over the world.
What all economists agree on, is the fact that a successful business can just be created by a well planed marketing concept.
The main focus of such a concept lies on the different ways of advertising.
Pobably the most successful way of advertising a product these days is the media.
Is there a better way to bring your advertisement to potential costumers than by streaming it right into their living room?
Television advertising has become much more popular over the last few years, but shall such ads be directed to young children between two to five years?
For sure, there may be some success with that.
Young children are really easy to manipulate and as soon as they see something they want, they will probably argue with their parents about it until they give in.
The businessman is happy, the child as well, so it is a happy ending, right?
Wrong...
By directing their advertisements direct to young children,the businessman has to face severe moral and ethnical issues.
They bet their money on the assumption, that kids these days hang out in front of the television all day long and that they do not have enough respect from their parents to accept the so called NO-decision.
Businesses should not be promoting such family sircumstances and behaviour by making their company rely on them.
So even though a company could probably increase their revenue by directing television advertisements to young children, they should for moral as well as for ethnical reasons not do so.
Advertising in general influence people.
If you reached yet the adulty age (eighteen years) you should be able to value the things you've seen in television.
In the early childhood this might be difficult.
Also because you dont't have yet the same knowledge than persons (for example parents) with higher ages.
Children aged two to five in general aren't able to see positive or negative aspects of the things they've been seen in television.
Children are influenced by this television advertisings and they really want to follow them up, although they can't value if it's good or bad for them.
Or when they see something attractive for them, they really want to have these staffs.
This things might be a big problem for the parents.
On the other hand you could see a positive point in the fact, that children have to learn to deal with this theme.
Earlier or later they have to separate good and bad by their own oppinion.
The parents have to inform children and sumit them on some rules.
So they take a very importent position in thei children's life.
With that there is the possibility to learn to cope with all that in a positive way.
Like always there are positive examples but also negative ones.
In my oppinion this is very difficult to cope with because I asked my self how they would be able to different this young children to the other ones.
Furthermore I think that the parents should be responsable enough to look after their children.
Evenmore because they were capable to create this children.
These days we can see eâdvertisings everywhere.
Mostly on television.
But young children can also see these advertising.
Does this really make sense, or shouldn't it be allowed?
The first point is, that most of the young children in this age, cant think rationally like an adult.
They think, that everything what they see in the advertising is real.
But a lot of the advertising are fake.
So its really easy to manipulate the children with the advertising.
The second point is, that its boring for the parents, because they have to buy most of the things, which their children have seen in the advetising.
And mostly of this things arent really cheap.
But on the other side, its good for the economy, because of the fact, that children are easier to manipulate than adults.
So these sellers make a lot of profit with their toys.
An other argument is, that the parents know exactly what their childrens want.
For example as christmas present.
They dont have to ask, what the childrens want.
And the parents can see in the advertising what it is exactly.
My opinion is, that television advertising directed to children isn't good.
Because the young children cant make a difference between fake things and real things.
They think everything what they see is real.
So they are a kind of "victims" from the advertising and are really easy to manipulate.
And its bad for the parents too, because they buy most of the toys for their children, because they don't want that the children are mad.
So these advertisings don' make sense for me and I think that they shouldn't be allowed.
I think when someone wants to make television advertising toward young children he should be able to do it.
Maybe some parents doesn't like it because the children don't stop asking for the thing in the ad.
That could be annoying for the parrents but I think, children in the age of two to five ages shouldn't shouldn't be allowed to watch television anyway.
So it is the fault of the parents, not of the ad.
But when it wouldn't be allowed, what would stand in the law?
There is no definition of advertising for a two year old.
And what is the difference between advertising toward five and advertising toward six year old?
It wouldn't be possible to control this law.
For example: There is a game and the game would be for 6 year old childrens.
But also younger childrens would like this game.
So the advertising would be for six year old childrens but also the 3 year olds would like it.
In this century the techniology is a good evelopment but also a risk.
In this text I'll explain my opinion about the statement: 'Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.'
Before the televison exsited children were often palying outside with nature things and with their friends or inside with plain games.
But now, that the television exists they are more often inside and are watching television alone, or with friends instead of be creative and create their own games.
Not olnly the creativity of the children is a problem, also the healthyness, you should eat a little bit dirt or bacterias that your body can protect himself from this things.
An other point is that if they are meeting less friends,when they can have 'fun' alone and so they have less relationships what is boring and depressing  in a long period of time.
But watching television is also good, young children can learn about it and the parents have a little bit free time.
But that shouldn't be the situation all the time.
Because young children can also have fun with a pen, a rattle or with other plain things.
So I think when partents make their children watching television is because they don't want to spend time with their children.
Or don't want they disturb them.
When I was a child I liked to play outside and get durty in the mud.
I always played with my older sister an my neighbours and later with my friends from school so I made a lot of relationships.
When I look back, I would have regretted when I haven't been so much outside.
But the children who are alsways watching television don't know, what they are missing.
So I agree with the statement, but when they watch television once or twice a week it is okay.
Later they can watch a little bit more.
Advertising is nowaday a very important method to distribute information about a product and to convince people to buy a specific one.
Everyone knows the feeling of wanting something really hard.
You can't turn on the TV and watch a movie without having some breaks for advertising.
Some advertising are especially for young children.
They see some toys on TV and afterwards they want them.
It is very easy to manipulate children and that is a reason why advertising for children is normally successful.
In my opinion television advertising directed young children (aged two to five) shouldn't be allowed because so young children should learn to play outside and shouldn't be dependent on to much material objects.
We should protect them from advertising.
The parents have to teach them how to play alone or with other children.
Interaction is very important.
I know that a lot of children in this age already spend a long period of time in front of the TV but I think this is wrong because they should do other activities.
Even young children are nowaday addicted to mobile phone and want to play games on the tablet.
This is very dangerous.
Almost every app (for children as well) contains advertising which influences the children and their opinion.
You can't do anything against it.
Children need to learn how to deal with the tecnology and advertising but I don't think they should learn it by the age of two or five.
Soon enough they know how to handle with smartphones and computers.
They grow up with the tecnogoly and are digital natives.
But they shouldn't start by the age of two.
Nowadays the television has a big influence on the whole society.
Mostly children fill their free time more and more with watching television.
So it does not surprise that the market reacts of the change in the age of the consumers and starts to produce advertising for children.
But should that really be allowed?
On the one hand, television adverts for children open a whole new market, which has an high potential.
It is an opportunity for companies to make their brand be aware in the heads of the kids from a really young age on.
So they create a higher possibility that these children will stick to this brand even when they grow older.
But on the other hand, television advertising also has its risks.
Their is the possibility that first of all the advert is not appropiated for young children, so they get in contact with subjects they can not cope with.
Also the children get, from an early age on, an education in capitalism.
They grew up in a world where they get all the time information about what they could buy and what is available out in the stores.
This creates a need for this things which should not be told in a such early ages.
In my opinion it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward young children.
Children are not able to cope with the mass on information the would get over television advertising.
Also they are emotional not as stable as adults are, so they are more easily captured by the advertising.
And what is most dangerousily about this fact is, that children mostly are not able to get the real message behind a advertising and can not put it in the right relations with the real facts, because they are still just children and believe in what adults tell them.
I think I'd agree with that statement because yeah why not.
I don't think there are many or any children aged to to five already watching television or even the advertising sections.
In adition to that I would say if there should be any regulation of tv advertising than a complete ban of it.
I mean the complete background of this Idea is that little boys and girls are ought to be more influenceable then others.
Some studies may have shown so but really: Do those people really think there is advertising directed towards little kids?
Those people then do have to believe that everyone is highly influenced by advertising and it should be banned completly, don't they?
And if so - as already mentoioned - tv advertising should be banned completly.
If someone want to make a television advertising about baby daipers or for toys than it schould be possible to direct an advertising with young chldren.
I think it would be funny when you would see a toy advertising just directed towad older chlidren or teenagers.
And babys or young children are cut and because of that a product would maybe be sold out quicker than others.
For mothers who cant go to work because of their kids it could be helpful when teir kids have a "job" an make money.
But those mothers shoulded force their kids to do that, they should have fun filming an advertising.
One negative point of that thing is that it is a lot of pressure for a young kid to film something and thy should have fun doing it.
And i thnk for a lot of mums out there it is like a drug when their kid once have success by filming sommething they want that the kids do it al the time, and that could turn out bad for the children.so that they dont have a real childhood.
I the end i think as long as the kids have fun filming an advertising and as long they also have time to play with their friends and just can be young kids it is no problem to make television advertising toward young kids.
so i think it should be allowed.
Television advertising that is directed toward young children is a manipulative method that brainwashes the children to become consumers as they are growing up.
Evident for this would be the high impact advertising is already having on our society today, with consumption in the West already being so high that one earth would not surfice anymore if every individual lived accordingly.
Having children grow up accustomed to high consumption of goods is problematic since it would have a massive impact on our environment, which would amplify the issues we are already facing today.
Additionaly this type of advertisment would cause more stain on the parents, since they would be the ones paying for these advertised goods.
The standards for parents everywhere would be higher, as the demands of the children will increase with the advertisment.
Therefore it will create more pressure for the parents with low financial means, as they attempt to live up to parents that can afford giving their children what they desire.
However what has to be taken into consideration is that adverts are already a crucial part of our life and society.
We cannot leave our house without seeing them, sometimes they are even subconciously imbedded in our minds.
Even children are affected by adverts meant for adults, even if the target audience is older.
Therefore it's questionable if banning age-specific television adverts would make much of a difference.
In conclusion although television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed since it puts unnecessary strain on our planet and the parents, it is not the main offender when analyzing the problems we face.
To really make a difference it would be necessary to review our general use of advertisment and how we monitor our consumption.
However we should not increase the problem by targeting and conditioning children at an early age.
We all know the advertising for children.
They are a lot of things they see and they want to have.
In toystores, TV or magazins other people want to make money with articles for children.
Is this bad for them?
When you want to make money with your toy then you have to make advertising.
And almost every child wants to play with something.
It is also good when parents don't know what they could give the child on Christmas or Birthday.
With advertising the child can see different things and say what he or she wants.
But on the other hand there are many things who don't speak for advertising directed toward young children.
They can see that the children in the advertising play with a lot of toys and they want them even if they are dangerouse or not good for the child.
But I don't want to write all the time about toys.
There are also many other advertising.
Sometimes with food or clothes.
We often can see in TV young children who eat a chocolat bar or something other sweet.
Other children see them and want to eat this too.
But the parents don't want them to eat more sweet things than they eat normally and then they are the "bad parents" who don't let their children eat what they want.
Children in the age of two to five are also to young to know what is good for them and what isn't.
Parents can better know what their children need or want for a present or they can ask the child.
In my opinion it should not be allowed to make television advertising directed toward young children.
It is better when the advertisement is directed toward the parents.
So everyone who wants (and who have enough money) can make advertising but the parents can say what the children need and what not and it don't give a lot of row.
The children are too young for directet advertising.
Nowadays there is a lot of advertisments in the television directed to different kind of groups.
Groups with different interests and characteristics.
Some groups are easilier influenced than others, children for one are rather simple to manipulate.
The product just has to be presented with some flashy colors and they all suddenly need this object.
But is it okay to have all these ads?
Children don't know what they want, they just 'want' what the others have, what is new.
And these adverisments use this fact on purpose, because they know, sooner or later, most children will have been working their parents long enough in order for them to buy it, so that the children are calm again.
On the other hand, if those ads were to be banned all of a sudden, the companies won't sell as much no more.
It would have quite a grave influence on the economy without really helping anyone.
Maybe those ads are manipulating the children, but adults are manipulated as well by ads and media.
Lastly, banning these ads is only milding the symptons, not curing this materialistic disease Europe is suffering from since their free will was stomped by the Americans, the British and the Soviets.
These children, as said, don't know what they want, and the adults seek it alike in these times: it is order, guidance, discipline, a purpose other than existing.
So banning these ads will not do much good anyway,
so there's no need to do so.
Many peoples in the world couldn't live without television.
Because there are newsflashes, films, series, documentation, and much more.
So, should watch young children with the age two to five television.
But the big question is, should television advertising toward these young children be allowed.
The positive effects of advertising to children, is that they may learn what they like.
Often children like the same tihngs in television as in their real life.
Another effect is that they learn the language while they listen to it  and they also learn many voices of the life, like animal voices.
Negative effects are surely that if the children see and like an advertising of a television programm, they want to see it immediately.
They seat before the television for hours, if the parents don't do anything, instead of going out and playing with other children.
Television may also make the children unsure of what they already know, because not everyting in televison is true and many things are invented, The children may also have fear from some TV programms an due to this they might sleep bad.
In general I think the parents of the children should decide if television advertising to their children is okay.
So, it's all right from the television company, if they make television advertising to young children, if parents want that, and in this sense it should be allowed and parents who didn't like this advertising to their children shouldn't let them know that.
Because up to five years it isn't necessary to watch television, they can learn much more, while playing with other children or reading some books with many pictures and noices.
Should TV ads dircted toward young children be allowed?
The television is a common way to bring information to customers by publishing advertising.
A lot of people do use the TV to watch their favourite movie, series or the news.
Some people do watch TV just because they're bored and do not know what to do otherwise.
Because this media is so frequented it's extremely interesting for enterprises to show their products in the breaks between a TV show.
If a lot of people do see the advertising, the probability will raise that more potential customers will buy the product.
The income of the enterprise will raise too and their goal is achieved.
But there aren't only adults watching TV.
Also a lot of children love it to watch their favourite movies like cartoons or Disney films.
For sure companies have seen the potential to sell children's products in the pause between a Disney film for instance.
But critical voices say, that children get confused by these advertisings made for them.
They don't understand if the ad is saying the truth or not.
They can't make this difference.
After they have seen an advertising they will go to their parents and ask them to buy the shown product.
If they won't, the child will cry until they do it and exactly this mechanism is planned by the company which has shown the advertising.
And because this is firstly betrayal towards the children, because they can't analyse the ad correctly about its correctness and secondary because the parents do not have a choice to buy the product or not I think this should be forbidden.
Not to mention that it's the parents job to decide what is right for their son or daughter and not the televisions.
Advertisments aimed towards children.
Unmoralic or okay?
Some advertisments are particularly aimed towards children, this will influence them without them or the parents even noticing.
Is this a problem or does it have  too little of an impact to care about it ?
If you look at the point of view of the parents, they will always buy the stuff their kid wants in terms of food or diapers or whatever.
So they might pay more for something they could buy cheaper without any loss of quality.This may in some cases lead to the parents having financial issues and they do this only to make their child happy because they've been influenced by these advertisments.
When you look at the companies' point of view then you can recognise that this will make them earn more money which probably every company on earth wants to achieve.
So of course if they are allowed to use these kinds of advertisments they for sure will use them as it has only positive effects for their company.
Just think of it as if you were the guy in the company who is in charge of the advertising department.
If you are honest with yourself you know that you would use this technique too to earn more money.
Finally, in the society's point of view, some will say that this isn't a big problem at all and can be ignored, some will say that it is unmoralic and that the companies definitely shouldn't do it and there will be people that don't care at all.
So in the end it is difficult to get to one solution to this problem and say whether it is okay to use television advertising to have an impact on children, so that some particular companies can make more profit.
Personally, I disagree with this statement, because I don't think that little children will be influenced in such a crucial way that this would lead to any bigger problems.Even though i'd also say that it is not right to make money by using innocent children.
Technology has advanced really fast in the last couple of years.
One of the most used and probably the one thing every hous and family uses is a television.
There are now many diffrent kind of televisions, which are diffrent in styles and also in their function.
How to sell these products themselves is a sciencefield on its own.
The older generations were not used to , or even not allowed to watch television.
Now parents look at the Tv as a cheap babysitter.
This developpement gives room for the companys which produce the adverstisment, to directly speak to 2 and up until 6 years old children.The companys which produce the advertisments have always specific goals.
Either they want to have a special kind of ad, which was never seen before and so it is special and stays in the minds of the people who are watching Tv.
The other technique is to overplay an ad, so the ad gets accepted and a habit to see in the television.
Normally ads are here to provide information over a new product or they just want to sell their own product.
Nearly everyone likes to watch Tv, and this gives the producers of the ad an oppurtunity to sell their stuff and they are getting more and more agressive in new commercials, since there are so many other companys, trying to sell the same product.
In the end the children are the ones who see in the stores the products they have seen magicly in the Tv and because they look nice and their friends have them, they want them and beg the parents to buy them.
But the parents are the ones with the money and not the children.
So it is clever to let the kids see what is new and what they could buy, because if only the parents would see it, they  think its just an other dumb ad, but if their kid begs them to buy it, they are letting themselves easier to buy it, because they don't want to be cruel.
So it is kind of messed up that the companys are targeting already the very young children, which are innocent and don't know that they are being influenced by the ads.
But from an older age like 5 years , in my oppinnion it's okey, because from there on the childreen tend to start wanting specific toys, and to showcase them in an ad is really clever.So why not trying to get the childern already in an early age to accept ads in their function, thaat later maybe they work as planned.
TV watching for young children is a hard issue to talk about.
Everybody has another opinion to that.
But the children have mostly no other idea than watching TV or game on the computer.
One argument for TV watching for young children is that they could learn something about the world, when they for example watch the news or some documentary films.
It could also be that they watch a film or serie with their parents and that like connects the familys' relationship.
They could have together fun and laugh about the same things.
In future many jobs will have something to do with electric gadgets, like computers, televisons or tablets.
These children are therefore very good prepared for their future, because they already know how this electronical gadget would work.
A argument against TV watching for young children is, that they don't know what else they should do in their free time.
With their friends they have no other or almost no other idea what they should do together.
My parents always said, when you watch too much television you'll get squared eyes.
Today I and everybody else know that this statement is not true.
But I think they just wanted to say, that I'll would be dependent on TV watching.
And in some ways I think that this is absolutely true.
In my opinion children should be allowed that they could watch sometimes TV for example every day 15 minutes but not too long.
They should have ideas that what else to do and not just hanging around and watching TV all the time.
In Switzerland people watch tv three hours a day on average.
That's quite a lot of time.
Even in young children's life television is very present.
A tird of the time people watch tv, they watch advertising.
The following essay is going to explain why advertising should not be allowed toward children aged two to five.
At the first place, young children are not able to handle with advertising.
If children are young they are very good-beliving.
They think that everything people say in tv it's true.
That means that they are very easy to improve.
That's exectly what the advertising companies want to do.
At the second place, advertising learns young children a false way to see the world.
Well, advertising is all about material things.
It learns that your cool or popular if you have a lot of stuff.
But that's totally wrong.
It's all about your caracter and not about what you posses.
Not to forget is, that not all of the families have a lot of money to use for their childrens toys.
That can be very stressing for parents if they aren't able to buy all things their childrens wish.
Other parents maybe are able to buy their children the newest toys, they saw in advertising spots.
That couls cause that children are jealous of each others.
In conclusion, advertising towards young childrens causes lot of problems.
Not only because of jealousy, it also shows the good-believing children a fals way of life.
Thats why it shouldn't be allowed.
Young children often watch television nowadays.
Because of that, there are more and more advertisements directed to children.
But to what extent can we support advertisements directed to our children, since it influences them, withour them noticing?
In our modern world there is no way to fully live without advertisements.
Sure enough, on television a great part of our advertisements are shown.
However even if we go to a supermarket or just outside for a walk, we are exposed to many different kinds of advertisements.
A huge part of it is directed to young children as well.
Why should we ban television advertising directed to young children, while still accepting all the other forms of advertisements directed to our children?
Another argument that television advertising directed to young children should not be forbidden is the fact, that once children hit a certain age, they will be exposed to advertisements anyways.
So maybe, it's better for them to learn how to deal with it from a very young age.
On the other hand, young children most often don't understand, that not everything on television is true, which isn't a huge problem if they're watching a childrens show, but advertisements use that innocence, to make them believe that they need a certain product.
In that way, television advertising influences our children badly, without them noticing.
Because of that, television advertising is a disgusting way to make money from children who don't understand what's going on.
In conclusion, it is impossible to ban all advertisements directed to young children, however, not allowing television advertising directed to young children would be a start, at least.
in my opinion, I agree with the statement.
I find the children in the young age should better play in the nature.
CHildren should go to the school and after that at home, they should go play in the garden or something with friends.
I don't find it goot, when children go home and watch for the whole evening tv.
I think also, that today are more and more tv programms, which aren't make for children.
I mean, when you scroll on your tv programm, there is sometimes only things witch the subject war, suicide, horror, thriller and something like that.
I think, these aren't subject for children.
And as I know the children, they would watch these series and films, when they are alone at home.
So, the children should play in the nature and don't watch Tv the whole evening.
I also think, that children, who plays regulary in the nature are healthier as these children, who are only at home.
When they are in the nature, they are also in contact with schmutz and thats good for them.
Another reason why tv schouldn't be allowed is that the children would be more outside.
There, they would play many games.
So, they would always be moving and fit.
Today, more and more children are fat because they have to less movemement.
When the children play outside, they play a lot of games with other friends.
Or other children, they don't know.
So, its perfect to start an new friendschip with others and you have more fun, because you know everybody.
The children should better go outside to do sport and have fun with friends.
Television is a daily theme.
doesn't matter for who.
Kids, teenager, adults everyone is confronted with that theme.
But now we talk about how the advertisments are directed towards kids.
Is that a good thing or not?
Should it be allowed or not?
Those are all questions we have to think about at latest when we are grown up and have kids.
Would you like it if the TV advertisements are directed towards your kids?
There are always positive things about it and negative ones.
Advertisements are a great way for kids to see something and learn about something.
because while they're watching TV they also watch the avertisements in an intrested way.
It's a good chance to let the kids see something they have to learn about anyways.
But if the Advertisements are also the reason why kids know what they could have and if it's directed towards them they feel like they really have to have it and start wining about it infront of the parents.
Kids at the age of two mostly don't really get what they're watching and don't get really influenced by the comercials so if it's directed towards them they don't really notice that so it really doesn't matter.
The way the advertisements are done matters though becaus eif there is some violence it can affect the kids and they just do what tehy see in the TV (advertisements).
So I think it really matters what commerical it is, that is directed towards the kids and also how they're made because I think all kind of commercials, Series or DVD's don't just affect the kids also the parents and their parenting.
If it's an advertisement about school or stuff for school or somethinglike that I think it's a good way to get the kids intressted to it and they'll look forward going to school.
Television advertising directed toward young children is a very common thing nowadays.
Through this a lot of money is made by the companies but there are some dangers involved with this.
First off theese advertisements can influence young children.
They will always want what they just saw in the TV.
This is pretty hard to handle for parents which don't have a lot of money and can't buy their kids what they want all the time.
And if the kids don't get the toy they want they'll be sad.
Another point is that this advertisement is often misleading which means that the product isn't correctly described and won't be the same in real life as in the advertisement.
Also it's a bad to make money from young children.
They will always want the newest toy they saw in the TV because thats just how children are.
On the other side the companies which produce theese kids toys should be able to advertise in TV because it's very effective.
And anyways not getting everything is a good lesson for the young children because that's how life works.
You never get everything you want.
I think that advertisement directed to young children in TV should be allowed because it's the parents responsibility to control what the children should watch in TV.
I also think that this advertisement generates a lot of money which is very good for our economy.
I think that not all adverts are bad for children.
For example an advert that presents vegetables could encourage young children to eat more vegetables which is good for their health.
However adverts for toys that are new to the market and very expensive can put the idea of needing to have them in their head.
The parents will then have to tell their children that they can't have it which is a struggle.
On the other hand if the parents don't want to argue with their children about stuff they have seen on television adverts they can just minimize the time spent in front of the television.
Because it's the parents task to have control what their children see, not the governments.
Let's say a child spends 4 hours a day watching television they will see more adverts than a child who watches one hour per day.
Therefore the first child is more influenced by those adverts and will have more desires that his parents will have to decline.
In my opinion adverts directed toward young children should not be forbidden since it's not the task of the government.
but they could change the adverts and the time they're shown.
At the age of two to five children should learn to know the world.
The real world and not an invented cartoon-fantasy-world with talking fruits and too thin barbies.
Thats not good for them and maybe it could even effect their childhood.
But not everything on television is bad.
There are so many good shows like Dora, who is teachingthe children englisch, or a good animal-show, to get to now new animals and the parts of the world they live on.
Shows like this are in my opinion important for kids.
It's a good preparation for kindergarten or school.
I personally wished I could have watched shows like this.
But are these kind of shows really good for them, aren't they putting to much pressure on our children?
Kids at this age should have fun and don't have to be interested in geographics, english or biology.
But on the other hand, we have the other kind of TV-shows.
They show them a fictional world with people with too big heads and eyes, a too thinn body.
I've read many storys about young girls with eating disorders just because they wanted to be like their idol.
A fictional caracter.
Even if some TV-shows show us not a real image of real human beings they could inspire our litlle ones to do great things.
Many shows are about friendship, helping each other and being a good person.
The question now is if  kids really understand what's happening in front of their eyes or if they are just happy to be animated, because these days parents don't play very often anymore with their kids.
They are to busy with work and other stuff to go outside and play with their kids.
So in my opinion TV-advertisement should be allowed in a good balance between cartoons or animated shows and shows to improve childrens knowledge.
But not too often!
Essay

We start with the question: should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) be allowed or not?
First of all, we have to know, that children are also humans with the same rights as an adult or as an educated person.
So they can be manipulated by the advertising in the same way as an older person.
For my opinion, it's allowed to create and show children-advertisings to children with the age two to five.
you have to see, that only the kids whoms parents gave the okay can watch TV.
In all of the cases is the mother or the father responsable for his child and especially what it is watching.
And when somebody watch television there is every time advertising.
If qou do not want your child confranted with this things, you have to forbit it or controll it or you have to speach with your children abaout the problems who can folloy - this is the only way of prevention.
But we also have to focus on the psycic of de child.
Television can be good, interessting and educating but you can also watch horrible things wich injure you mentally... this goes to the question if it is usefull to watch television in general.
Apearently, kids withe tte age of two are really (anfällig) in brutal stories, dangerous situations or even pictures with a world wich is not perfect.
because they do not know it better.
So it is very important, that you as a parent take the responsability and talk to your child, to his behaviour to other children and help him to understand the differents between the virt   the okonly the boys and girls
I think, children generally shouldn't watch television a lot.
Perhaps sometimes in the evening half an hour, but surely not more.
When they watch too much television, they see definitely advertising, which they shoudn't see.
But if they watch just rarely television, they won't have any disadvantage by the advertising.
In contrast, when they see this and the parents can tell them, why does it exist, they can learn something.
When the children know about the use of the advertising, they know in the future, that they can't take all this things like it was said.
But this is the parent's work.
So, when the children are allowed to watch TV just because the parents will their silence, advertising (and television in generally) is bad for the children, but when the parents talk to their children about what they have seen, this can be good for their learning process.
For example, when a child see a toy on television, he will have it for any reason.
But the child has to learn, that he doesn't need all this stuff.
First, the child will cry and shout and so on.
But when it receive the toy, he thinks that the next time, he will be offered an other toy when he want that.
On the other side, when the parents doesn't give him the toy and explain why, the child won't agree, but he know for the next time, that crying doesn't helps.
For the parents is the second way much more complicated, they have to dispute with their child (and this can be really annoying) but a few years later, they have less problems with their child because he know that he doesn't receive all he wants.
So to resume, I would say, that advertising - especially television advertising - isn't bad when the young children just watch them rarely.
But when they see this too much, it can
Televison advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Well, today there are lots of televisison ads.
You cannnot watch one single film without any ad break all twenty minutes.
At least in free-tv.
On the other side i can understand why there are so many ads.
The tv companies need a huge amount of money for there channels and there is only one easy way to get to it.
Yes, you guessed it right.
Advertising.
But should five year old children also see those ads?
On one side we can say that there are many ads which shouldn't be watched by young children because they are to complicated or maybe they scare little children.
The imagination of a young human is much bigger than it is by an old one.
So advertising isn't just advertising.
For a child it could be much more in a bad way.
It depends on what is shown in the advertisement.
Children are also much more influencable than older people.
And I think that the ads are aiming for that.
Especially toy-advertisements for example.
On the other hand there is no other option for a lot of tv companies because somehow they need to get money.
For some chanels we need to pay taxes which are called "Bilag" in Switzerland.
But most of them dont have any other way to get money.
Also the fact that younger children are more influenceable isn't a good reason because the decision over buying something that appears in a tv spot is still the parents decision.
And not the decision of the five year old.
In my opinion it isn't that horrible or bad if younger children watch tv ads.
So if you, as a parent for example, don't want your children to watch such ads just don't let them watch tv.
This may sound a bit to strong but there are lots of series and films which they shouldn't watch anyway.
So why you don't go out with them and play football or some other outside activities.
That would be healthier either.
Most children like to watch television.
They can watch films and series which are espacially made for their age, and there are also a lot of teaching TV programms.
But between to programms there are often advertisings.
They aim to get people to buy a sepcific product.
Should it be allowed in children television, too?
Children who are between two and five years old aren't able to think about other peoples opinion.
They are influenced by diffrent aspects, especially from advertisings.
If they see joys in the television they want to have it, even if it isn't made for their age or it isn't useful.
In addition to that children can be very exhausting if they don't get what they want.
Once a child saw something it really wants, the parents are often not able to stop it from crying until it gets what it wants to have.
For parents it means a lot of trouble and spending money for joys.
Some parents may not want that children see certain products, because they can't or don't want to buy it.
In my opinion childrens TV programm should be free of advertisings because children aren't able to deal with it or to understand it properly.
Watching TV should be fun and children should learn something without being disturbed.
Advertisings influence children too much and aren't helpful for their education.
Consequently, I think it shouldn't be allowed.
Should advertising directed to toward young children be allowed or not?
In this short essay it will be discused if children from two to five years should be directed with advertising that could influence them in positiv or negativ ways.
Firstly, I think young children should not be directed with advertising of any kind because I dont think they will understand the meaning of it.
It is hard to know how the children react to this kind of advertising for example an advertising about a shooter games.
The children see this advertising and they want to buy this game but in fact it is not good for them.
They could get serious issues for their whole life like aggressions.
It is clear that the parents play an important role in this case, but for parents it is hard too to say no to their own children.
The second aspect is in general the media influence.
Young children should not be confronted with any kind of media because they could get dependent to it.
If they watch television every day they can not focus on other important things like going outside and enjoy the time with friends or explore new things in their lives.
The television advertising could act like a drug.
The children need it everyday and cant get out of this issues.
Lastly, young children should stay away of this trap the companies create to buy their products.
To conclure, I fully disagree the statement that tv advertising toward young children should not be allowed because I think it is a bad influence for the children, who have to explore new things in their lives without any technological influence.
Companies should be punished for creating a trap for the children.
Everywhere we have advertisings.
A few people say, that advertising are a bad thing and lay to often.
But not every advertising are the same like the other, we have they in television, newspapers, magazines or in shops.
So young people maybe are more influenced then older.
Should it not be allowed to directe television advertising toward young children?
On one hand young children haven't much money so when they see something in a TV-Show they want buy it and after that the children have no money.
These people can't learn how to deal with money and later when they are grown-up they often have financial problems.
A other problem are also that the products in the television often aren't healthy for the kids.
For example cereals with so much diffrent tastes, I think you have never seen a advertising from a potato or a tomato.
On the other hand when children grow up they will confronted with all this things.
When they already knew everything in this direction they are less influenced.
It would be also really hard to forbite this.
I think advertising isn't something realy bad how many people say, but it could be dangerous for some.
Children betwenn the age two-five don't realize this so much.
So I think this can be allowed for the children.
If parent won't this then their children shoudn't watch too much TV.
Television advertising directed to young children, should it be allowed or not?
It is always said, that watching television is not good in general and even more critical for children of young age.
But it has also some positive aspects.
For example watching television is a very good thing when the parents need some time for each other, so that they have later more time to do things with the child.
It is also good, because on the television the world of the child is not so little like when it is just at home.
The child gets to see more aspects of life.
That has an important influence on the developpement of the cultural knowledge of the child and the skills of interaction between people.
But it can also developpe excatly the opposite.
If the parents aren't present to control the activity, the child can for example change the chanal of the television and watch somesing very brutal of very scary like an action film or a thriller.
That can have a bad influence on the developpement of the personality of the child and also for their skills of interaction with people.
It is possible that the child learns something that does just existe in films and not in the real world.
The influence of the television could also have an aspect in the physical developpement of the child.
It can be said, that just sitting around is not the healthiest thing that one could do.
And watching television includes excactly that: sitting around, never breath fresh air, fixing the eyes on a screen.
That will have some influences in the physical developpement.
In my opinion watching television is not the problem, even not for young children.
The problem is, that if the parents aren't there, the child can change the chanal or watch too long.
It is a good thing as long as it it is controlled by the parents and not for too long, but I thinks the most important thing of a little child is the interaction with real people and advertising outside on fresh air.
Today the problem is not the television anymore.
More and more the phone gets to a bigger problem, than the television ever was, because now even outside it is possible to watch some film on YouTube for example and that is something I think should not be allowed by the parents in such a young age.
So to my question on the first line: Yes, it should be allowed, but in a healthy portion.
It should not be too much.
The child has to developpe himself in the real world and not in fictive univers of the television.
I think it is not necessary to put advertises on television channels for children.
My opinion is that young childreen watch too much television on general.
It would be difficult to ban all advertises on every channel because many children do not only watch channels and series they are meant to watch.
I think most parents aren't concsious about the consequences what too much watching television does to young children.
What series and what channels the younger watch is a bigger problem.
Banning advertising won't solve this probelm.
In the modern time a lot of children watch television and between the normal programms are a lot of television advertising.
So, the question is if it should not be allowed to directed television advertising toward young children between two and five.
On of the main advantages is that if childrens are looking television and they see an advertising of a game or something to play they want to have those things.
It's the best chance to make them want those beautiful things when they see it.
So they go to their parents and ask them to buy this games for them.
It's the best way to make children want things.
Children see in the television how those things are working and how to use them and than they know ecsactly which they want.
It's better for the parents, because they do't have problems like buying the wrong game and after that have the problem with the children because they don't like it.
On the other hand it can get very expensive if children are always seeing new stuff.
It can be more stressful for the parents to say no all the time and to be the bad parent because you don't buy it for them.
Probably they get spoilt if you buy all those things.
However a lot of children have already enough things to play with and they don't need more new things.
With television advertising they get a view of life which isn't always true, it shows the life where everybody should have everything which isn't nessecary.
In this age it's like manipulate a young children.
I

In conclusion I'm against television advertising directed toward young children.
Because I think it isn't a good idea to show those things to them and make them wanting those things.
But at all I'm against watching television in this young age.
It's a better idea to go out in the natur and play with animals or build a woodhouse.
But at the end the parents have to decide if they want to allowed their chilrends to watch television or not.
But if they allowed it to them it's possible that they have to deal with more things.
Essay about television for young children

Every child want to watch television, but is this really a good thing?
I mean there are a lot of series only for young children and this series say, that the children will learn something with the television.
But is it really better to sit at home and watch television instead of playing outside with the other kids?
I dont think so.
In the first years of our life we learn how to integrate us in the sociality, how to make friends and how we should be to other persons.
All these things do we learn during the playing outside with the kids from our neigborhood.
We learn so much for our future and i cant believe that the television can relpace this things.
And today there are a lot of teenager who arent social and arent well-bred, because they never learned it.
They werent outside with the other kids and didnt learn how to make friends and so they dont know how to treat other kids in the same age.
Another problem is, that the science have found out, that television is bad for your intelligence in the first years of the life.
Someone who always played outside is better in school than someone who always watched television.
The television watching children cant stay concentrate a hole day, because they never learned it.
Children without television have to engage with themselves, because there isnt always a programm for them.
So for these kids it is easier to stay concentrated even if the lesson is boring or they dont like the subject
Nowadays, information is constantly given to us.
According to our behaviour on social media, we are being targeted to specific products and ads whithout our knowledge.
We probably buy way too many things that we do not need but usually we realize this too late.
This is what we call consumerism.
At times, it seems as if we were held captive in a materialistic world where the brand of your shoes matters more than the ideas in your head.
The consumerism of the Western countries is a very controversial topic, especially when we consider the fact that already younger children are the group of interest of certain television ads.
Children at the age of two to five do not own money nor do they have jobs to earn money, at least not by law in these countries.
They do not have the ability to comprehend the concept of money yet.
Thus, it can have serious consequences for them.
If they start spending money they do not have at such a young age they might enter a downward spiral of debts.
On the other hand, showing them ads directed towards them could help them develop their own opinion and taste early on.
This might contribute to them being creative people later in life.
Creativity is a main part of developping ideas and starting new projects.
Since we face various and unique problems these days such as the climatic change, gender ineqaulity, racial tension etc.
supporting innovation could be crucial.
Nevertheless, I still agree with the statement above.
Television ads directed towards children aged two to five should be prohibited because it is a misleading concept.
The children would not understand the reason why the can not have the products advertised to them.
In addition I think that many money related issues could be prevented this way.
Advertisments are everywhere these days.
Companies wnt to make money and concluding they put their advertisments everywhere.
Newspapers, billboards and television are full of advertisments for every age group out there but should there rally be advertisments even for chlildren?
Children lets say from age two to five, do they rally understand that what they see is really an ad?
The whole point of advertisment is that the viewer sees the product and feels inclined to buy it but children are not able to buy what they want so in the end it doesnt rally matter if they see the advertisment or not.
What is actually important is the parental advisory.
If the parents themselves dont want their children to be watching all of those advertises on television then they should cut the the TV-time for their children.
Its not the companies fault, somehow they need to make money.
On the other hand ads are everywhere and it is impossible for one individual to avoid them.
They influence uf into different thinking and are there to make us want things that we didnt even knew existed.
Why would we want the chlidren to be influenced at such a young age?
Children are supposed to be playing outside with other kids and to enjoy childhood but it is inevitable that sometimes a little time on televison is also needed.
But in that time they get influenced into wanting toys and games that get advertised.
They dont get to enjoy their favourite show or programm because after some ads they wish to have a product or toy that got promoted some time prior.
Concluding to all this i agree with the statement that TV-ads should not be allowed for children younger that five.
Companies should stop try and influence children at such a young age and we should let them be children becaous there is enough time where they will get influenced ba ads.
First of all, I think it is quite difficult to direct advertising towards individuals that haven't yet learned any language to a degree at which they completely understand the advertising.
You could only make ads about toys in which you just show the object you are advertising.
Because this does not correspond to the "guidelines", to which ads are created in order for them to be as effective as possible in finding new customers for the advertised goods, it would not be very efficient to show lots of ads directed at young children.
If this statemnt is true, the density of child-directed advertising is quite low in public television.
Why does this matter?
A person defending the original statement would probably argue, that those ads may "brainwash" a child.
It could be influenced by the ads in ways that do not correspond with the principals of the parents or the daycare of the child.
However, in my opinion, this is not a realistic problem.
A child between the age of 2 and 5 is in the process of learning to behave according to its surroundings.
Television is a quite widespread form of entertainement right now, and so the child will also be exposed to television and its advertisements.
The chance of a child being badly influenced by the ads directed towards it is extremely low.
Even the ads not directed at the child may pose a bigger problem than the ones who were made to be watched by children.
Personally, I don't see a reason why advertising directed towards young children should be prohibited.
Especially if the normal advertising directed towards adults would still be shown to children.
Everyone knows advertisements, and I can't recall a situation where I realy enjoyed advertisements, especially while watching TV.
As I am no longer a little child, I know quite well to draw a line between what the ad states and what the product in reality will look like.
The younger a viewer is, the more approachable he becomes for advertisement, and with the increase in toddlers adn kids watching TV, they are a well targeted group.
So should advertises for kids be prohibited or not?
First of all how does one detect ads specifically targeting kids?
It's a lot harder then one initially thinks.
As for an example, is featuring kids in advertisements automatically targeting young children, even if they are advertising a product for adultes?
Or is a pampers ad targeted at kids eventhough they're clearly not the ones who decide what type of pampers they're going to wear?
Secondly, theres a real danger in kids watching TV and not only for the ads thrown at them, no child aged between 2-5 should spend most of it's time alone watching TV at home.
Children that age should be oudoors, running around, playing catch (I don't mean "Fangis", but catching balls), evolve there social behaviour and link up with other young children.
The fact that so many kids are doomed to stay at home watching TV make them so much more approachable for all sorts of advertising.
Third of all, are ads realy dangerous for kids this age or are they not equaly dangerous for everyone who has not made experiences with advertisements.
The modern society is realy used to ads all over the place.
One can not go to work without wlking or driving past billboards with ads on them.
So one gets to realize that not believing what most ads try to sell you and not buying it is the easiest way not the waste money through ads.
So is it not better, if people at a younger age start to learn this fact early rather than waiting till they are older and then have to learn these fundamentals when they start to believe that they know everything?
After all i think that ads are a problem especially the ones targeting young children.
But I find it far more worrying that there are so many kids just watching TV at home on their own.
The fact that they're not playing outdoors and not making friends with other children is the way bigger problem then ads directed at kids.
The blame for this situation goes not to the advertising companies, but to the parents who fail to raise their children in  a way to protect them from ads and giving them a ra
It's shocking if you see all them young children watching television or playing games on the gigantic phones or tablets of their parents.
Should it be forbidden to take advantage of that in advertising toward young children?
First of all, it has to be said that advertises are really important in our daily life.
Even if you don't recognise it, your mind thinks about it and considers the quality and nessesarity of it.
So if young people see products and thoughts for themselves, it's way better for their education and graduation.
Secondly, and even more relevant: If it wasn't allowed, what would be the content of advertises?
I mean one can't do advertise for men on a disney channel.
So if you can't do either of it, there isn't any advertise.
But then you have the next problem: How are you able to pay the whole channel?
It just doesn't work.
Others argue that adverise makes little children even more addicted to television, but I guess if children wouldn't watch advertise, they would just waste their time on watching something else.
If you want to change something, you should try to solve to problem in the education.
So in general I think it's a good thing.
You can use advertising to give good information to the young generation, but you should use it wisely and barely.
Advertising has always been a controversial topic.
From cigarette ads that say smoking is good for you, to offensive tv advertisent and a swearing goat trying to sell Mountain Dew.
But claiming that tv advertisement directed towards young children should not be allowed seems a little weird.
And I don't really know on which side of this discussion I should be.
On one hand I think advertisement in general is a bad thing.
It can lead you into buying something you don't really want or weren't really planning on buying.
And doing that to little kids is kind of messed up.
I don't think a small child should be forced into liking something just because the advertisement of it is flashy and colourful.
It's even worse when the product isn't enjoyable to play with.
You can compare it with the Pokémon trading card game.
Most of the kids didn't know how it was played, they only knew about the anime and just collected the cards.
The anime series was just one big advertisement.
But on the other hand you could say that it's good for the economy.
You have an army of mindless children that will want everything that looks cool on tv.
Also we live in a society that is based around consuming and buying expensive stuff we don't really need.
We have to learn them young, am I right?
Just kidding.
I'm really sorry for the parents that have to deal with kids who watch tv advertisements.
All the money they have to spend and all the crying children they have to deal with.
In conclusion I think tv in general is bad for kids, and if your kid doesn't watch tv it won't watch advertisements directed to him or her.
Go send your kids outside to play.
It's easy to influence children.
They believe at almost everything, and even more when they have seen something on televison.
But the televison workers must be free to put whatever they want, and if the parents of the children disagree with a kind of advertissement, or anything else, the have to control what their child is looking at the televison.
Maybe the parents of one child would think that, one adevrtissement is very bad, or stupid, but some others would think that, this is a very great advertissement.
So I think this is not the law, or the televison who mustn't allowed that, but the parents to their children.
They must control what their youngs children watch on televison, and forbiden some kind of programms, or anything else like that, if they disagree tha their child watch that, or if the think that it could be a bad influence to him/her.
Some people can find the advertissement good, and some other can think that it is bad for many differents reasons, so I think it's better to let people decide what the want to their children and what they think it's bad.
I believe thatit's better to not control how people wants to educate their sons and daughters,and give them the possibilty to choose what they children can watchor not.
So I think that this t
Advertising; It's everywhere and there's one for almost everything.
On the television, on the radio, the streets, in magazines and even in our school books.
One can barely imagine our society as we know it today without it.
Advertisings have a huge influenece on our consume, often even without our knowledge.
Sometimes an add is also very questionable, so there are people who claim that there should be more districtions for what's allowed and what's not.
For example wether advertising toward very young children should be forbidden.
Arguments reach from the question wether childern should even watch TV too often to parents deciding what they buy for their kids and the fact that the products the advertising companty is trying to sell can also be very good pructucts even when they are for children.
At first sight, it's up to the parents, wether they want to buy a pruduct for their kid or not.
Childern usually don't have enough money and don't know how they can buy something, for example on the internet.
On the other side it's also the responsibility of our society too make our next generation the best it can be.
It's very questionable if it's good for a child i it's just brought to watch Tv the whole day.
Children should read or play for example in their free time
Television today is something that is extremely present in our modern lives.
As are smartphones, computers and electronical devices in general.
It is almost impossible to prevent that also young children are confronted with the technical development.
Children as young as two to five are very influencable.
They are young and they are interested in everything looking funny to them.
Adverts that are directed towards them intend to make them want something; there is the important difference between children and adults seeing adverts.
Adults can differ between something they actually need and something they only want because it looks nice on TV.
Children watch this advert and believe that they need it even though they have enough to play with.
The good thing about this is, that children have more to say in what they get to play with.
When children can not see these adverts they won't know that there are certain plays they would maybe rather play with than what their parents have bought them beliving they would like it.
They are clearly more advanced in a way that they can choose freely what they want.
In my opinion it's not healthy for children to watch TV excessively and adverts encourage this further.
I think adverts should not be directed at children that young because this tells everyone that it is okay if children sit in front of the television all the time.
Everybody knows these annoying ads when you are watching tv.
They are everywhere and it is impossible to ignore them as we want to.
They are quite different, like specific products for men or women, for children and more.
But is this really useful that some ads are directed toward  young children?
I would like to investigate this question.
First of all let's have a look to the children.
They are pretty young and they do not really know how to handle with these adverts.
If they see a thing like a mini electric car they want it.
They do not think how they could get it or who pays it.
They just want it.
Maybe it is possible that they also buy something without the permission of their parents.
Because this there are coming a few problems.
And I think this is not nice for every parents.
In the other side you  can see young children as helpful for ads because as I said if they see something that looks nice the want it.
So they try to persuade their parents to buy it.
And that is what factories want.
They want to sell their products.
Last but not least I think it is not really correct to sell products in this way.
Sure they need to sell them but it is not correct.
To sum up I would like to say that I agree with the statement that television advertising directed towardd young children should not be allowed because it is not nice for the parents and young children do not know always what they are doing so they can buy something not because they want to but because the have done a mistake pressed on "buy" for example.
And this is not necessary.
Today, there are many different types of advertisements.
There are advertisements which are directed to men, women, teenager, housewifes, sportsmen and children.
Is it right to advertise products directed towards to people who cannot effort  this product by their own like teenager or even children?
Firstly, the advertisement has to present a product which is directed to a certain group, This means you have to make an advertisement towards children because they are consumers and users of this product and not the parents.
So they have to get excited about this product and again not the parents.
Secondly, the parents buy the products for their children which means that they know the best which product is good and useful for their child.
Children see a lot in the TV's and they want everything what they see and like.
but this does not mean that everything which they see and like are also good for them.
The problem here is that they cannot distinguish between what is good for them and what is useless.
Thirdly, A company can only sell its products when the consumers like and find the products attractive.
Parents anyway will not find the products for instance a toy attractive.
While children are looking at the design,colours and the ability of the toy the parents look only at the price and if their child can lern something from it.
But learning and the price of a toy or any other product for children are not the only factors.
Children need also toys with which they can just play and for this they have to see them in the TVs in order to decide which one they want.
Forthly, advertisements on the TVs towards children can and do also lead to family problems.
The raison for that is that children see a product and they want it but the parents do not agree with their child.
So they have to explain their child that they will not buy this product for it which makes the child sad, angry and disappointed towards his parents.
This happens every single time when this child sees a product and wants it.
In the end, it gets the feeling of not to be important enough for his parents which can lead to huge misunderstandings and problems of trust to his parents.
In the conclusion, there are good and bad sides of advertising directed towards children.
In my opinion, children have a right to see also product which they like and they can identify with it.
It would be very boring for them to see only advertisements directed to adults.
They also learn not get everything which they want what is also good.
Television toward young Children
Some people think the new technology is bad for all.
Computers, mobile phones and the television too.
Young children where aged two to five sit the whole day in front of the TV and do nothing.
That can`t be good.
What if there were a rule that television advertising directed torward young people should not be allowed?
This is a good idea because the children will go out and play with their friends.
But on the other side the parenst have to watch all the time what his/her child is doing.
So they haven`t a break, they overwhelmed.
Unfortunatly the TV is not good for the eyes.
If they are looking TV since they`re young children they will wear glasses.
On the minus side it isn`t every day sunny.
On a raining day they can`t play outside.
They will be bored all day.
But no, the will play with their games.
with lego, barbie or playmobil.
They will do something.
In fact when they look television they learn something.
And we all know young children learn fast.
Finally I think this rule is a bad idea.
The parents can make the rules.
They`re able to say how long his\her child can look TV.
The young children can do both, look TV and play outside.
Did you ever buy something eventough you didn't need it and then realized you saw a television advertising of it the other day?
Most of the time we don't even realized how big of an impact this have on us.
Now, imaging how kids without the ability to disting between reality and fiction react to television advertising.
Television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
This essay will show the impact of advertising for children, the influence that publicity have on parenting and the leck of protection of the children while watching TV.
Advertising has an impact on our minds.
Especially kids don't know how to handle it.
While they are watching TV their shows will be interrupted by many advertisments.
Some are for kids, others are for their parents.
These children will soon get an idea of what is popular and what they have to have.
Let's take a remotecontroled car for an exemple.
Boys and girls watching the advertisment would like to have this car.
Often the short clip shows some cool guys playing with it, saying every cool boy needs to have this remotecontrolled car.
The children will develop the feeling that they need to have this car, otherwise they are left out.
Our society works like that.
It is ridicoulus if it starts in an early age.
Children should be protected form trends to follow as long as possible.
Other than an impact on kids, advertising directed toward kids also influencecs their parents.
Going to the store with kids isn't easy.
Going to the store with kids that really want something is even harder.
They will have a hard time explaning that things are expensive, that the children have to wait for their birthday or christmas to get a new toy.
Televiosn advertising directed toward young children do have a big influence on parenting.
Television will lead the kids in other direction than the parents would like.
Children wachting a advertisment will get values from the company that the parents might not agree with.
Furthermore, television advertising on a kids channel is not for kids only.
It can be that an advertisment for an powershake is showed between an episode of Spongebob and Pipi Longstocking.
This is not directed toward young children, but toward their parents watching with them.
This is might seem like a harmless exemple, but there can be more dirsturbing advertising.
Children watching TV in general are not protected at all.
The shows they watch might be for kids, but the advertising breaks in between are not only for kids.
Parents let their kids watch a kidschannel, thinking they are allright, not knowing what happens when their episode is finished.
In conlusion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed to protect the children.
They don't know how to handle it, parenting get's to a harder level and parents do not have absoulte control on what their kids are watching.
There should not be any advertising on a kids TV channel or in between to movies for kids.
They will soon enough get influence by advertising, but they should not grow up with it.
Television advertising for young children should not be allowed because the young children don't really have the ability to understand and to think about the things that the ad communicates.
The children just think:"oh I want to play with that" and are saying this to their parents.
But often the ad is not something good and manipulates the child.
It manipulates the will to play and the will for adventure.
But at the end it can be a bad product and not worth the money.
The parents then have to buy it or make the child sad and to ignore the wish.
Just because the children cannot yet analyse and think through the advertisement.
I think that an advertisement for the child but directed toward the parents is the best alternative way to advert a product for a young child.
With such an advertisement the parents can analyse and see through the advertisement and can make a well decision if the product is good for the child or not.
As an example we see something to play from Toys'R'Us and it is made to attract young children sitting in front of their television.
Now the child just sees the fabulous design of the thing and wants it immediatly.
But if Toys'R'Us would make an advertisment for the parents it would also show the good funtionality and the safety that the thing brings or not brings.
And then the parents can analyse that and not just buy it because the advertisment tricked the child with its design.
In our digital age our television gets unsed a lot.
When the fist televisions came into the households, mostly the parents watched TV.
But soon we found out the use of television for children.
The television companies started to show kids programms for children.
So more and more parents led their children watch TV.
As television got more and more famous, it got attractiv for advertiser.
A company who advertises over a TV chanel, for example in a movie break, could rich, without a lot of effort, a decent number of potential costumers.
Nowadays television advertising is normal on the most chanels.
The effect on those who are watching the advertise is not totaly clear.
Some television chanels even started to show advertisements on kids chanels and these are also specially made for young children.
But is this legal, or is it manipulating?
Young children of the age from two to five can not realy build their own opinion and often can not decide whether they want to see the advertisement or not.
Young children also react a lot more sensilbe to inputs than older people do.
They can ealsy get manipulatet.
If an adult is watching an advertisement on television, he can make his own opinion about it.
But a young child does not have this ability.
So whatever a young child sees on television it believes.
Another poin is, that it is just not fair for the parents if their children are keen on having the lollipop from television after they have seen its advertisement.
Because of these facts, I think that television advertising directed toward young children should be banned from all television chanels.
Otherwise our children get somehow manipulated in a way we do not really anderstand.
Advertising is a good thing because without it, the companys would make much less profit.
You can change a viewers opinion to something by just showing him an advertissement.
Of course it depends on how good the advert is, but if it's a well based one, it can influence many peoples mind.
But is it okey to influence a young child?
A child at the age of two to five didn't even had a chance to build up his own opinion to some kind of topics.
Also it is way easier to change a babys mind then it is to change the mind of an adult person.
Kids can so easily get fascinated by some colourful, with music and nice voices filled adverts.
They aren't smart enough to think about the dialogs in adverts and if there is a advert, lets say about a new yoghurt, they want their mothers to buy them this yoghurt if the advert attracts them.
They don't know if the product is made with some unhealthy chemical stuff or if the company is bad and the workers have to work way to much for way to less money.
And this is the point where the companys can make so much profit.
A young mother don't want her children to be sad, so if the kid says he wants this yoghurt, the mother is most likely going to buy it.
Without the children as a group which you can attack with adverts, the economy would be way smaller.
For companys, kids are a good object for advertising because they are so easy to convince but I personally don't think, that you should be able to distract such a young childrens mind by showing them unreal things.
In my opinion you shouldn't be able to show adverts in childrens TV programms.
I mean you just have to look at the advert of "Kinder Milchschnitte".
The advert has absolutely nothing to do with the product, but they are showing some nice animals and happy people who are eating this cream filled chocolate thing.
What kind of world were living in, if we have to attack a young childs mind to make profit of it.
Nowadays there is a lot of advertisment in modern media.
The goal of those advertisments is making people buy their products.
Obviously every product is working perfectly in the advertisment.
People have to make their own opinion and decide if they should believe what they see and if they want to buy it.
Firstly, it is obvious that young children are not able to buy products and clearly not because of advertisment on their own.
They depend on their parents.
Their parents are caring for them, buying them food and even clothes.
Children do not know yet that not everything what comes in television advertisments is true.
Children aged two to five cannot make their own decisions about what they want to buy.
Moreover they do not have the money for that and they are not allowed to buy stuff on their own because of the law.
Although they can say what they would like best it is the parents who make the decisons in the end.
That is why it does not make a lot of sense if television is advertising toward that specific age.
On the other hand it is well-known that young children talk a lot.
It could be possible for them to scream for the products in the advertisment to their parents untill they are willing to buy those things.
I guess that is cleary what the advertisment industry is aiming for.
They try to influence the childrens mind so that they talk more about what they really want instead of just letting their parents buy what they think it is best.
Furthermore it is an ethical question if it is alright to influence innocent young child.
In conclusion, altough I can see what goal for the industry is I do not think that it makes a lot of sense to advertise directed toward young children.
That is why it should not be allowed in my opinion.
First of all what is exactly meant by television advertising?
These are advertisements on the television that want to achieve a child's attention.
Those can for example be advertisments for games (physical and electronic).
Reasons why these should not be allowed are first, the children are two to five years old and their brain is in the middle of the process of developping (at this age even more than later) and they are not supposed to watch television anyway because they do not understand it and it could have a bad impact on their developement.
Second, children should play outside with other children.
It is important for a child to have friends that are the same age.
If parents let their child watch television then he or she suddenly absolutely wants the thing that is shown on the advertisement and most of the time it is something stupid because nowadays people produce anything to get a lot of money.
So parents should not even let their children know what unnecessairy things exist.
But on the hand it can also be a good thing if children see child's advertisments because they get to know new things and it may also give them ideas for new games they can play with their freinds.
Another argument for allowing is that they learn new words.
Children aged between two and five are learning languages most efficient because the brain is very active.
They learns new verbs, nouns and adjective.
It can be very helpful for the linguistic process.
My opinion is that advertisements for iPads or other electronic devices for children should be banned but not normal games that one can play with parents and friends.
Furthermore advertisments for healthy food should really be a thing because as we all know healthy food is important.
Where as unhealthy food such as fast food should not be allowed as television advertising.
Advertisements are differentiable and we should know which are the good ones to show the children.
Advertising in tv.
Why should be it not allowed?
I clearly disagree with not allowing ads in childrens-tv.
I mean the parents can allow their childrent to watch tv or not.
If they have a problem with advertisments, which appear in shows, they can just forbid their Children to watch, or switch of the television in pauses and turn it on again when  the show continues.
I think children their selves (here between 2 and 5) don't have opinions about ads in tv.
They just watch them.
And another point is, that advertisments dont just appear in tv.
As an example, the childrens-journals and placates.
And in the questionaire, it's written, for children between two and five.
Are children in the age of two years even able to know, what happens in advertisments?
For me, parents who allow their two year-olds to watch tv often and wich are complaining abot advertisments in tv, aren't really intelligent anyway.
Another reason is, that there is tv for adults too and there advertisments are much more often.
And I don't think, that children are much more reachable for ads.
A simple example: there are ads in tv for chickenwings in a warehouse, there's a big possibillity that they say, that it's time to visit the warehouse anyway and there they buy the chickenwings.
Children between two and five, hopefully don't havereally much money anyway,so they can't just go for a shoppingtour and buy thethings they see in tv.
So I think it would be really silly to forbid ads in childrens-tv and even though its not really cool to get interrupted by it all the time.
A lot parents use the sentence: "Television has a bad influence on young children."
Watching a lot of TV is bad for our concentration and stops the experiencing of life by yourself.
Plus children can't know the difference between reality and imagination.
So everything they see is automatically real for them.
This essay will show that this common expressions isn't as wrong as some people may think.
Everytime we sit down and watch TV our brain gets in the energy-saver-mode and during time this has a bad influence on our concentration.
Watching television is relaxing because you don't have to do anything.
So our brain takes time also for relaxing: Our concentration sinks.
If we want to do something again which takes a lot of energy and which isn't very easy our brain has to come on its full potential back.
This takes time.
So if you have a habbit that you watch a lot of TV your brain is most of the time in a slow-potential-mode.
As a child the brain doesn't develop as much as it should.
Specially very young people want to experience life and are conscious about learning new things.
With television you can't learn a lot.
Even if it's a documentary the brain can't remember so much as when you experience it by yourself because you only hear something maybe once and there's no emotional connection to it.
Experiences connected to feeling can last so much longer in the brain and this is reason for why it's important to go out in this world and see new staff in reality because you get a emotional connection to it.
Children to eight years old can't seperate phantasie and reality as good as an adult.
This is the reason for young people think that there's for example an monster under their bed.
So if they see some scenes in the TV they do not know that these are only played and aren't real, maybe can't even be real.
As you can imagine television without knowing the difference between real and unreal has a bad influence on children.
To conclure watching TV isn't bad as itself.
It gets bad if you do it too much and too long.
It's important for children to learn by themself by experience and to get their full potential of concentration and this needs to be without TV.
Children believe everything they see on television because they can't seperate phantasy and reality so as a parent you have to be carefully about what your child is allowed to watch.
When I was a child we didn't have a television at home.
So I was never confronted with television advertising.
And I don't have the feeling that this was such a bad thing.
My parents bought my toys, and I don't think I would have done the same good selection.
We didn't have so many things at home,so there as also more time to play with my brothers, at home or in the nature.
Young children are not experienced enough to see that they can't have anything.
If they see advertising, they just think: "I need this".
And they cry: "Momma, I want this!"
For parents it's hard to stand the wishes of their children and so they end up buying a lot of things that are just in the wardrobe or "made in China"-plastic that is broken after a few weeks.
So the children will look for new toys and find them - of course - in television advertisement.
In the society that we have, capitalism reigns.
And I don't think it's a bad thing.
It brought us far and I wan't like to miss our good economy.
Free marketing is important for that, and wouldn't work without advertising.
So it's hard to forbid some kind of advertisement, because than we are going in the direction of an economic system that is controlled by the state.
So don't allow is maybe not the best way to protect the younger generation.
I think it's more important that parents teach their children how to deal with advertising.
Learn them to say "No" and show them that not every toy is necessary to have a great childhood.
It's enough to play outside in the nature with some friends or, for exemple, brothers.
I am the living example for this.
In my generation, we often talk about the developement from technology.
It is no secret, that people today are more connected to technologys than ever before.
The TV`s are getting bigger and bigger, it is no surprise, that children in young age are watching television about an hour or more a day.
The world i going foreward, and today, watching television is normal, even for young children, but are we one the right way of our developement?
When I was four years old, I playd the whole day with my toys and I think that experience is important.
We learnd what it meant to be bored, and we learnd to do something on our own.
I remember the first time I built an Lego house on my one.
I felt like the king of the world, and is not that the experience, that children who only watch TV are missing?
Another reasen, why I think that watching television in younf age is not good is, that the mother - child relation is not as good as if they would play with theyr children.
Advertising Television should not be forbidden, but maybe it would be better, if parents would only let there children watch television about an hour a week.
Maybe sometimes we should listen to the old people, when they are talking about "the good old times".
Are children being manipulated by television?
Nowadays nearly every child watches tv at least once in a while.
There are many shows for young children such as cartoons and so on.
But there's one thing everyone dislikes while watching tv: advertisments.
Every half an hour there's a five to ten minute pause for advertising, and they're getting even longer.
And like in every channel there's advertising in the channels for young children.
Should television advertising directed towards young children be forbidden?
Channels have to earn money and the best way of doing that is showing advertisments.
But who wants to put their advertisment on a channel which is for children?
I mean the advertisment would be watched mostly by children and this wouldn't be worth it.
So the only advertisment that are worth to be showed on a channel for children is one that is directed to them.
But many advertisments are made, for example, to make the viewer by something, so these advertisments are often manipulativ.
They want you to do what they want.
Young children can be manipulated much easier than adults.
One could just make an advertisment about some kind of soda every hour and it's likely that this child will remember this soda.
This could lead to an obsession with it.
This could make the child obese and thats already a big problem nowadays.
But that would be one of the smaller problems, one could use advertisments to make children much more things.
Imagine if during the second world war there were so many children watching tv and being manipulated.
One could argue that the parents are much more influential for those children and that it is their job to watch their children and make sure they don't watch too much tv.
However nowadays there are too many parents not being able to handle parenting and just letting their children watch tv all day.
In my opinion tv advertising toward children should not be allowed.
Children should not be manipulated so early in their lives.
It could become a much bigger issue than just wanting to buy some stuff.
These statement is really hard and strict.
I think it is impossible to stop the television advertising because the companies want to start by the young children with their advertisement.
So the children can nerve their parents and get the things they wanted.
Without the direct advertisements on television, they can't explore the world in this way so fast.
They see everywhere advertisements, why should it get forbidden on the television?
On the other side I understand these statement completely.
Parents know that advertisments are bad for development of their child and make unsatisfied.
They sorrow theirselves and want, that their chidren can look television without the advertisements.
Because to buy all these things would be very expensive.
At least my opinin is that parents should not allow their children to look to the television alone when they are so young.
The parents should have the control.
They can play outdoor with friends and have fun.
So it is a desicion for each family individully.
I think the advertisements are not bad, but the television should not show too much of them.
Television advertising directed toward young children should  not be allowed.
Young children basically grow up with a television in their household nowadays.
There special Tv channels that show a suitable programm for young chidren such as KiKa in germany.
In order to run the channel sucessfully, they have to place commercials in between the different TV series.
These commercials are often adressed to young children, the target group of the tv channel.
In my opinion, adressing a commercial to young children has several problems.
First of all, these young kids do not realise that this is a commercial and the promoted products are often very expensive.
They want to have this products and since they have no money their parents have to buy it.
Secondary, young children basically love everything that looks fun.
They cannot decide wheather they really need this products or not.
They just want to have it.
Another important point to mention is that even elder people often cannot resist the demand to get the latest gadget.
How should kids realise that the companies just want to earn money by selling these products.
As we can see, commercials adressed to children is very difficult.
I neither agree nor disagree.
There are some facts which make this sentense true and some which don't.
Especially young children are fascinated by the television.
When the television is on then all children are looking at it because something is moving.
In the following essay I will have a look why children depend on television, why it is worse when children are looking to the television all the time and how they change because of it.
For children it is very important to learn new things all the time.
Television isn't just useless.
Children can learn from it a lot.
There are some series for children which are quite well.
They can learn about nature and how life works.
Televison is for children quite important because like this they can learn something in a different way.
Although, children can learn from television to much is not that good.
It is important that children don't just learn by the television.
The parents have to go out with them and show them the nature and how they have to behave.
Children learn the best when they can copy their parents.
Like this they can observe how life works.
They know how they have to behave with other people and how to get friends.
On television they often see wrong behaviors and the thing is that they can not make friends on television.
They have to go out and learn by themselves.
To this not watching too much, it exists many films where people are killing each other.
If children are looking to this kind of film they can end up really badly.
The children know that they can learn a lot from television and when they are watching to a crime or something like this the children think that how these peaple act and react is right.
Then maybe they want to be like these people and they don't know that killing people is wrong.
I think television is a good thing for children but not everything on television.
They can learn good things from children series.
For parents it's important to find the middle way.
Too much television is bad but a little is quite important.
"Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
Television can learn you much things, like beeing social in good company or solving things, with that I just mean "what do I do when...?".
Children do learn fastly and good so television can be very good.
But technoligy isn`t always good, children need to go out and "explore" the world, they need to fail so they can learn how to do it right so always sitting infront of the TV is not the best thing you could let your children do.
Many series who are for young kids are full of phantasie and they need much imagination and that is very good because sometimes they just need phantasie, as we do in writing tests.
But it has its dark side, a lot series are about fighting and war, the hate and the distruction, that is not fine at all.
Kids need to learn how to love and be grateful for that what they have and not spend their time watching TV.
So I think that this is a critical subject and I`m not sure at all what I should think, but I grew up not watchig TV till I was like eight years old or something.
So my oppinion is that children shouldn`t watch much TV, they need to spend their time outside watching birds or just explore the nature.
But TV isn`t always bad, so I think that it should be allowed to let the kids watch TV but not much just a lil bit  a day.
The first thing that comes to my mind, is that this statement can't be answered by yes or no.
Advertising is made by companies which wan't to sell their products.
They're using their knowledge to catch the attention of the group of people they want to speak to.
So when they sell something for young children, aged two to five, the products are things which kids love, like sweets or things to play.
Young children don't think about the original thought of the advertisment, they just think 'I like that' or 'I don't care'
As I was a little child a few years ago, I can face this problem quite well.
The next thing they do is talk to their mother and ask if she could buy that.
I think parents don't even react anymore to this question, beacuse they're ask that all few seconds.
Another question is, how much television do children in this age watch.
All the technological progress causes youth using television earlier and earlier.
I think companies achieve much more sucess when they use advertising which is directed toward adults, because they can buy all the things themselves.
Little children first have to ask the parents which decide if the product will be bought.
So in my opinion this is mainly a question of annoyed parents.
If you look at this question from the psychological part I think children are influenced by all the advertisments in medias, but I don't think it changes much in the emotional part, So if I look at the statement now, I think it doesn't have any positive aspects from the side of the client, but it forces the the companies.
Little children are easyly manipulated.
For that reason it is easy to understand when people feel that directing advertising toward them should be prohibited.
For the same reason advertisers would probably say that it is the most effective sort of advertising and for that the most profitable.
They would also argue that children should choose for themselves what they want.
I dont think that children of that age understand what is good for them and what isnt.
Few advertisers care about what is good for children as long as they can profit from it.
Since they are responsible for their children the parents must decide what they thinkis good for their children and act according to that.
Advertising directet toward the parents of those children is something different since they are old enough to know what is good for their children.
For those reasons i think that advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
In my essay I am going to write about the statement; Television advertising directed toward young children, aged between two to five, should not be allowed.
Of course this is a critical topic because there are lots of different opinions and so I will give you the chance to have a short look out of these points of view.
First of all I chose to start with the cons, which means with the statements that are for television advertising ad think this sentence is not true.
It also depends on the presons situaution, whether she grew up wachting television often or if the person did never have the 'chance' to sit in front of it.
People who grew up with a TV at home were probably often watching there a film, a serie or something like that.
So they got much more accustomed to advertisements than others and learned since little how to react with them.
They know that most of those products that are shown there, are not that great as presented.
But we have to make a difference between normal TV advertisements and other advertisements on web pages that are erotic, because then I think most of the people, especially parents would not agree with television advertising.
But now lets turn to the other part, the pros which support the statement.
There is a lot of television advertising in TV and it often comes in a film, when the scene is the most interesting, perhaps you also know this situation.
Then you are not so concentrated on the film and you change the channel because you may do not want to watch these people, making out of everything the best so that you pretty much have to buy it.
It disturbs the tense in the room which has to rebuild when the film continues.
In my opinion is advertisement also good for to clam down the tense and for to have a short break so tht you could think about the film and what ha d happened in it.
But of course sometimes I also get frustrated when the film stops in the worst scene but what e3lse can we do?
Young children, aged two to five, are extremely susceptible to manipulation by anything they see, hear, or otherwise perceive.
This makes them ideal targets for advertisement experts, because they can easily implant the desire for a product (mostly toys of some sort) in the minds of the young children, who will then most probably go on to nag about this to their parents, eventually annoying them enough to make them pay the toy or whatever the advertisement was for for them.
On the one hand, this is obviously using a weakness in another human being, which is at least morally undesireble and at most illegal in some regions.
Because the chilren are scientifically proven to be so easily manipulated, the advertisement designers specifically target them, not respecting their inability to make proper assessments of any content they see.
For example, a four year old child will not be able to tell that a new sort of drink is harmful to them, for example because of high sugar content, and they will only see the "cool" advertisement, maybe with some cute animals or another smartly assembled theme that makes the children admire the product.
On the other hand, incorporating a ban on advertisements on television could not only be perceived as a challenge to freedom of expression, it also plays another important role in economical development.
Getting to know the feeling of "desire", wanting to buy something, prepares the children for what they are going to experience in their later lives and is the first step to a new generation of consumers that keep the economy flourishing.
In conclusion, acknowledging the fact that children need to be prepared to be parts of the consuming economy, the abovementioned reasons and concerns about the childrens' mental and physical sanity, strongly hint at the need for stricter regulations or even a ban for advertising directed towards young children.
I don't think that the problem would be the advertisement itself, but the fact that those children are watching the advertisement.
In the case that this marketing strategie would be successful, that would tell us that those children were watching TV at that exact moent.
So I guess that the overall problem wouldn't be the TV advertising, but a new way of caring for the children.
Years ago they were playing outside, they were probably doing something with their parents or friends, they would and improve walking, maybe even begin learning how a bycicle is used.
But now, they are watching TV, maybe even playing something like XBOX or similar stuff.
In my opinion this is a shocking fact and a drastic change in childrens education.
At the moment they are learnig whatever TV says them, like for example they see a advertisement about M&Ms, in consequence of them watching this, they want some.
Now the example withM&Ms isn't that bad, but there could also be other stuff on TV, which isnt actually meant for children.
And even if there would be TV advertising directed toward young children, there would also be other stuff lurking araound in the advertising crowd on TV.
Now an example for those other things would be the new game-trailer for a violent horror game, which the children are also watching.
Now they could e scared and quit watching TV, but the other possibility would be them actually amazed by the trailer, which could result in a change of personality of those children, because they now accept the violence as a natural part, which would again result in real violence because the think they could solve problems with violence.
And that is why I dont think one shouldn't allow the TV advertising directed toward young children, but one definetly should not allow those children watching TV.
So to say the most important problem isn't economy which is using nowadays culture and way of educating for their own purposes, but the nowadays family for giving the economy such opportunities.
And that is what should be changed, its like one would eradicate a bacteria, if you want to succeed you shouldn't fight the simptoms, but their origin.
And its quite the same here, the symptom is the advertisment but the origin is the  education children get nowadays.
And even if we wouldn't allow this, the only thing we would actually do, would be  restricting the only advertisment which is actually not damaging childrens minds, because the advertisement for aduldts would stay how it is.
And because of that, I am totally against the action of not allowing advertisement directed toward young children.
Is television advertising toward young children good or bad?
Nowadays not only teenagers and adults watch television but also children from two to five years old.
Inbetween the movie or soap there is always advertisement.
These advertisements also direct themselves toward these young children.
What effect can that have on children at that age?
Most advertisements that are directet toward children, are about toys.
Therefore these children want to have these toys, that mostly cost a fortune.
In some cases their parents don't have that much money to buy the toys, and as a consequence the children are mad or angry at them.
But on the other side this is a great way for the parents to find out what their child likes, so they can surprise them with a fitting birthday gift.
Mostly the very young children don't really understand what they see on television, and that means that these advertisements don't make a lot of sense.
However if they do understand what they see, for example a toy commercial, it doesn't really affect them in any other way then that they want to have these toys.
Nevertheless, if these advertisements promote dangerous toys or violent behaviour, it can't possibly be good for a child at that age.
But nowadays there isn't much or any advertisment like that on television.
In conclusion, I think that it doesn't make sense to make commercials for children that are between two and five years old, because they don't understand what they see.
First of all it is necessary to say that television advertising nowadays is really common in our society.
Everybody gets used to it, already in young age.
It depends on the personality but I would claim that at least every second household has a TV at home.
So children rise with television.
On the other hand you could say that advertising in general isn't really necessecary in TV.
It just gets on peoples' nerves because they cannot watch the TV-show or movie that they're watching in one piece.
Children also don't like the breaks in their movies and I would say that they're also getting bored when there's lot of advertising.
Another reason to allow advertising is that young children mostly are interestet in things that do not take a long time and that are easy to understand.
That's the case in advertising.
Often it is also made in a funny way or has music in the background which young children enjoy.
The last argument not to allow advertising for young children is because it sometimes shows a fake or a wrong illustration of the real life.
So already in young age, children don't see the life how it really is and get influenced by advertising.
There are studies which say that advertising does really influence us and how we see our life becuase it shows a perfect world which isn't the truth.
To summarize, there are positiv and negativ aspects in advertising.
Often not just for young children but for people in general.
In my opinion advertising should be allowed to young children because in our society we are just used to it and it would be kind of difficult to allow it for children above five and not to allow it for the younger ones.
Today's television programs consists of a lot of advertisements to.
And depending on the channel there's a big variety between them since some tv channels appeal more to kids while others are meant for adults.
Therefore kids are exposed to adverts too.
I see this very critically.
Firstly, kids can be influenced very easily and by appealing ads the young children get very interested in the advertised objects.
The advertisers use this facility of influency and of creating interest to their profit.
It is a lot easier to appeal to a kid than to an adult since the adults know that the advertiser is only interested in his profit.
Regarding this, it is also a question of morality whether you want to use the children's naivety to your profit or not.
Secondly, the ads might create an addiction-like behaviour.
By seeing all those fancy toys the kids get a sense of wanting something really bad and not having it.
And when they get it they will be happy for some time until they see the next advertisement with a new toy that they don't possess.
In my opinion, advertising toward young children should not be allowed since the advertisers use the childish naivety and simplicity to influence kids to their profit and since it can cause an addiction to toys or new things without the kids being happy with what they have.
There are hundreds of different types of advertising directed toward any type of person.
There are shampoo and lipstick advertisments for women, advertisments for cremes to reduce pain in the anchle especially for older people and just like that there is a never ending amount of toys and other things you want to get children interested in.
Nowadays children have way more opportunities and better toys than just a few decades ago.
Back in "the good old times" children used to play in the garden or in the forest more often and they probably didn't even know what a television actually is.
Today children have the possibility to go far away, to africa where they can talk to lions or to outter space where they can fly with their favourite super heros, by just sitting on the couch at home.
It's no question that children like to take these offers even though it's sometimes hard for older people to understand how a tv-show can be more interetsing than everything around you.
Now if companies make advertisments for things you play in the garden or you use in the swimming pool it seems like they want the children to leave the house more often again and for that to get them away from their main source of advertising.
But of course they just do it because they know that nowadays children lose interets in a toy much faster and then they'll go back to the couch and keep watching television and see another cool thing they want really badly.
So with advertising directed toward children companies that sell toys and stuff like that might make a lot of profit because they can sell more things to children which don't really use it anymore.
But why should it be forbidden for those companies to make advertisments?
Of course if children see something they really want it and they won't let go of it but in the end it's their parents to make the call and to buy the things they really need and it's not the five year old children spending a lot of monyey
Television advertising directed toward young children

These days there is a lot of advertising found on television, not only for adults or teens, but also for our yougest generation.
Do these adverts have an influence on children aged two to five?
Many parents leave their children infront of TV, stuck there for hours and it still keeps them entertained.
But what they don`t realize, is that the next time they walk into a shop, the kids have special wishes, like a new barbie or a plastic truck.
At first they might hesitate, but then they go witht he flow and see that there are many other mothers buying those toys for their kids that age.
The TV adverts which are directed toward young children, do have an influence that way, they show them what there is out there that they could wish for their next birthday or christmas.
So basically it is informing them and demonstrating what great toys could make them happy next.It also gives their parents ideas what`s in, and also gives them ideas for presents which could make their children happier than ever, according to the adverts.
It somehow keeps them updated about the toys market.
And it also keeps the toys market going, because there are that many parents who make the wishes of their kids come true.
On the other hand, it can influcence them to being greedy, because Susan or Jeremy on TV have those toys and they seem happy, so those children watching TV could also have that longing of having fun with the newest toys.
That could get onto their parents nerves and then they`d feel pressured in return, and if they give in, they buy them those toys.
It somehow doesnt offer to enable the children to feel happy with their toys and settle, because there are always new things coming up and they get that information from those adverts.
If there wouldn`t be any sources of information directed toward young children, they wouldn`t get any information concerning the newest toy items on the market, so they could find themselves being happy without having to always get new things.
Despite that fact, what happens to all the old toys they saw on last years adverts ?
They probably end up in the bin.
They probably hardly get used to the toys they get because they are confronted with something "better" on Tv.
In my opinion, it`s a benefit for parents because they can easily get informed about the newest toys.
But unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros .
The whole society longing of always wanting the newest things that apparently are supposed to be more trendy than the last hype, is really sad, because you forget to be happy with what you have because you`re constantly informed about new things.
So for me it shouldn`t be allowed, it shouldn`t start at that age.
As manking grows and technology advances, we face more and more conflicts.
Today we live in a world of media.
It is all around us and sometimes to difficult to find refuge from.Television advertisingt is just another form of media.
This media is directed towards different groups of people, even small children.
But should television advertising directed toward young children be allowed?
Advertisement directed towards young children should be allowed, because we live in a society, a state, where we the people of our country have the freedom to say and think anything we want to.
An advertisement is nothing but an extension of a thought or a statement.
One could think of it as a message.
And one should be able to screen anything on television or send any kind of message that one wants to.
Yet this statement is meant to manipulate and change the thoughts of the viewer on a subconscious basis.
These targeted viewers aren't able to judge or censore this commercial in any way.They are driven to ask their parents to buy them this product, because they do not know how to react to it yet.
Censoring and obsorbing media is in my oppinion an abillity that has to be learned in time.
People who are older and more mature are able to do so and are less affected by this.With the freedom of speech comes great responsibility, which can not be abused.
So I believe televsion advertising directed towards small children should be forbidden.
There certainly are many harmless advertisments on the televison (which are aimed at kids), though the influence which they have on kids is often underestimated.
Children aren't adults after all, they can't form their own opinion as easily as an adult can.
More often than not, kids immitate their parents trying to get an idea of what to do.
That's why it's only natural for them to want something they see in the television as they seek for guidance everywhere.
This is probably also one of the reason why advertising tailored towards children is more profitable than other methods.
To add to that, children are constantly developing their personality, so any harmful advertisments are going to influence younger children much more than older ones.
This may lead to many different kinds of problems later in live, which is not something I or for that matter the majority of people want to see.
Now to be fair, there is also a good side to it, because advertising allows for many channels to operate for free or to have a bigger budget to allow for better educational programs or better quality television in general.
Especially since advertisments geared towards children are generally more profitable.
So the question is now, should we allow advertising for younger kids or should we ban it?
I believe there is no easy solution to this and I personally do only somewhat agree with the statement, but I think there is a way with which both sides are at least somewhat happy.
I think it would be best to have very strict rules on advertisments and to let someone check each one for malicious content.
That way we can make sure, that it still exists and finances our television, but companies can't use morally questionable methods to get kids to buy their things.
There already is advertising toward anyone, so why not toward young boys and girls?
They are just as part of the economic system as we are.
Children at a young age are a very good destination group to have.
I guess you surely can imagine that little girl, sitting in front of the television and watching an advertisement for a sweet, pretty puppy doll.
So what do you think?
Of course - she will be begging for this doll for days.
Her mother will have become weak by  the time.
You see, the allowance of television advertising is economically definitely great for some companies.
But at the same time it pulls the children already on the path of consumption.
And this is absolutely not, how this generation should be raised.
At the moment, the older generations are just like that, but we should protect the kids of this.
How could we live in a world, where already children in pre-school measure their worth by what they possess or wear?
The other big theme about children of television, is the sexualising, that is taking place in television all the time.
There are television advertising toward young kids of sexy underwear and makeup and oversexualised dolls.
In the end, in my opinion, it is bad for young children to look television anyway, but you definitely shouldn't make television advertising toward children.
the reason is, that you
The television is often used to influence and manipulate people.
Especially children are manipulated very easily.
But television advertising can entertain too, because it makes children see the new toys they could have.
This manipulation not only happens in television, also the stores are full of candy when you are leaving.
If television advertising should not be allowed there would be so many things which had to be not allowed too.
Otherwise it is not good to show children what toys they must have to be cool or something.
Children should have the possibility to think about their favorite toy by themselves.
Of course it can also be a great thing, when you see something in television for your wishlist for Christmas or your birthday.
Children don't go everyday to the stores to buy new toys, so where would they be able to see them?
As television is a very common thing for young and old people, the advertising is also a good thing to see what's new without having to run into the next store.
But if parents don't raise their children right, the children might get angry when they don't get what they want.
The parents would need to make sure that their children know that they get manipulated by advertising and that the toy maybe isn't that perfect and fun as it looks in the television.
I think television advertising for children should be allowed, because I know how much fun it was for me to see a new toy and to put it on my wishlist for Christmas.
Wishing and dreaming are some of the best things in childhood.
And as a child I knew exactly what toys I wanted and which not.
Not every advertising was attractive for me, so children do know exactly what they like or want no matter how the advertising looks like.
The technological change maybe is the most important invite.
We can't controll all this changes.
The reason is that without this changes like television advertising , we are ''closed'' to this world.
But there's some benefits and disavantages that we should know about televison advertising, because the victimes usually are children which grow up with this changes.
There's for example the danger that the children sees some scene in the television, which is not really clear for the children.
The best example is love scens.
2-5 years old is not the age that the kid can understand this Informations.So the child can not deal with the situation.
It could lead to psycial problems which is really dangerous in this age.
The other vision is that TV is good to learn the language.
Specially in the age 2-5 years.
IT's the best time to increase the vocabulary.
There are also channels which matchs whith childrens humor.
And the the child learn to deal whith situations.
So the children has more connection with the ''world'' and can find them better.
My opinion is that TV advertising for the young children should be allowed.
We live in a world that changed to a intelligent world.
We should learn the things around us.
It's really important to learn this things in this age.
So you can pick up the vocabulary very fast.
And the child learn to deal with the sitations in his real live.
But also very important is, to h
In modern time television and other technical instruments such as computers and tablets became normality for a lot of young people and even childern.
But is television for young children beneficial or rather the opposite?
I think it depends on the subject and the way, how the information is passed to the children.
Children of a very young age can take up information a lot better and faster.
In the first years, everything that is essential sticks to the mind of the children.
Therefore it's possible that television advertising to young children can be helpful.
If they see the pictures and hear it simuntaneasly, it might help them to remember things better.
Also if the parents contribute to it and watch the programm with their children together, it might improve the effect.
On the other side, starring at a television-screen isn't the very best for a young child.
It may cause headaches or even hurt their eyes.
Childern at that young age still can't read properly or at all.
Maybe it would make more sense if the knowledge and informations of the tv programm is being passed through books and textes.
It's essential for a child to learn how to read a text and to understand it.
Reading improves the intelligence whereas watching television does almost nothing to it since you only have to stare at the screen and listen to a voice.
Summerized, there are many aspects that speak against televison advertising toward young children but there are nevertheless also benefits.
Despite that readig is much better for children, television can be used as an additional help.
Therefore I wouldn't ban it but as a parent I would make sure, that my child gets both, books and televison.
So I disagree with the statement since it only would be contraproductive.
If adult people see an advertisement on television, they often don't watch to closely, they aren't interested in the majorty of the advertised products and even if they are, they are only influenced in their purchasing decision by some degree.
Now a child, especially a small one views advertisement completly different, it often can not differenciate truth from lies and is way easier influenced in general.
If for example an advertisement of a specific toy is shown, in which all the children posessing it are happy, the child will think its own life would definetly be better if it posessed this specific toy.
This can even lead to a point where the child envies the people shown in the advertisment, even though they are only characters playing their role.
The children then often try to force their parents to buy this specific toy by crying or even beating them.
This is even worse if a company promotes an unhealthy lifestyle.
If for example Mc'Donalds is adverstising their products beginning at a young age, many will often eat there for the rest of their lives and damage their health.
So to conclude, I am against advertisement for young childen, because they are to easily infleuncable.
Everybody watches television.
young, old, male, female it doesn't matter.
Some watch more than others but that's besides the point.
Advertising or Comercials are not everyones favorite.
Their duration are too long and they appear too often.
Still they are necessary for the TV Channel to earn money.
Comercials can be used in different ways.
Either it really shows you the product in its best ways or it just shows you a supermodel doing either super cool stunts or nothing at all and most of the time the comercial had nothing to do with the product itself.
Now, are advertisments bad for infants?
They can be!
Children are very influental.
Many little kids try out things they reall shouldn't based on what they saw on TV.
So should we ban advertisment for children?
In my opinion, absolutely yes!
Kids are easily tricked and brainwashed into liking something or wanting to do something.
Like I said before, children are very curious and they want to try things out themselves.
If they see their favorite hero doing a backflip in a comercial after drinking a certain bevrage, then they will try the same thing.
They could hurt themselves badly and many people will just shrugg it off and pretend like nothing bad happend.
They say that it's the childs own fault that it got injuries.
But it's a kid.
It didn't know any better.
How could he/she?
The adults were doing it on TV why shouldn't they be able to do the same?
But advertisments aren't just bad things.
They are good for the market.
Especially kids.
They are a very good audiance!
Why do you think parents buy so much stuff for their kids?
Certainly not because they thought that specific toy would be a great thing to have.
It was the choice of their offspring.
She/He wanted it because she/he saw it in the comercial.
Children can be very presistent in their choice and desire of something and if they don't get it right away, they will cry.
Parents don't want their kids to cry.
Especially if they're two to five years old.
So they buy it.
The conclusion is if you see children as a marketgroup then yes, show it to them.
If you see them as people then no, stop showing it!
In my opinion, we shouldn't show little kids comercials.
We shouldn't abuse our power over them to make them buy stuff, but protect them from their own ideas.
Advertising is used all over the globe as a means of marketing a product or service.
Television advertising is an effective methode for companys to advertise their product or service and gain new customers.
It is also a big income source for broadcasting channels.
Television marketing in contrast to other marketing strategies is very effiectiv because it reaches people of ages due to the fact that many people watch television.
Everybody knows about televisoion ads that disrupt their late night movie or football match that their watching.
This makes television advertising expected and catches noone of guard.
Thus parents can switch off the television if they do not want their kids to see it.
Futhermore children do not take the decision to make a purchase.
They can only influence heir parents decision.
Then again it`s up to parents to decide if they want to get influenced or not.
However children of young age are very vunerable and should be protected from the aggressiveness of television advertising.
If broadcasting channels had guidelines they should admid to it would be much easier to regulate everything.
In addition to that televsision shows aimed at young children should be a place of education and recreation.
Advertising is definitely out of place here.
In my opinion television marketing directed towards young children should not be allowed.
The governement needs to set up guidelies and regulate them.
This would protect children when they are most vunerable and take stress off of the parents.
Television advertisings are supposed to support the companies in question by proposing their rpoducts on screen.
HOwever, these can be very misleading and customers have to be quite careful when buying them.
Young children are often very unexperienced in that matter and are more easily manipulated, witch in fact can be seen as immoral.
But that fact should not prevent companies to produce advertisings directed towards children.
The fact that young children often have little to no pocket money leads to the fact that they are not able to buy the products in question.
They often ask their parents to buy them, which then allows their parents to carefully look at the advertised products and later decide whether or not they will buy them.
Every kind of advertisement can be misleading towards young or old, companies are somewhat forced to advertise their products for the income.
So in my opinion, any kind or advertising methods should be allowed.d
Televisions play an important rule in our daily lifes.
Advertisings are a part of it.
The longer the more young children use a TV.
Children can be influenced very easily.
That's why it's important to evaluate whether television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not.
One strong argument for stronger rules of such advertisings is that you can influence children in a positive way.
You could ban advertisings which lead to an unhealthy lifestyle and rather support education and sport.
If these advertisings were banned completely, the kids wouldn't be influenced, neither positive nor negative.
They could focus on being a child, enjoying their TV show without worrying about new stuff and money.
The last argument for such a restriction would be that parents don't have to worry about it.
They don't have to explain their children why they don't get a new toy or why the advertisings looks better than the it actually is.
On the other hand, there are several arguments for advertisings.
Selling advertisings is an importnant source of money for TV channels, also for channels with children as their main aim.
By cutting children-oriented advertisings, they'd loose a lot of money.
If you just made stronger rules of such advertisings, many enterprises and factories would have a benefit over the ones that mustn't make an advertising.
This would lead to unequal possibilities in the market.
Personally, I think that we should be very attentive what we want to show to children because advertisings can have many influences on them.
A compromise should be found.
I imagine something similar like the alcohol advertising-ban in Switzerland.
Let them discover what new toys exist or what they could save for but make clear limits of what should be permitted.
I disagree with the statement, because they still see the parents as an all-known-person.
So the last word from the parents is wright.
The age between two and five is easy to influence but not enough that the children influence afterwards their parents.
They still don`t have ther own opinion.
They tell that they have, but in fact they just retell the sentense of ther parents.
I know that a child, after seen something very cool in the advertise, wants to have it.
But if the parents explain and tell them the contraire or show them something different they won`t be anymore interesseted.
I have the impression that after the age of five the children start the make their own opinion, they have allready some money and they are able to go some where, for example walk away from their parents and buy it by themself.
The age of two they don`t understand what the are talking in the television and they just look at the persones and their movements.
The age of three is the age of saying "no".
Everything is not good, if it is or not, but just the fact they can say the word "no".
So they see something in the television and the parents ask him if he would like it, the child will always answer with "no".
They age of four the start to thinking and asking always "why".
Also if they don`t care they will say "why".
Also the explanation will be answered with "why" and again "why" and "why".
The age of five, it starts to get difficult as I wrote above allready.
They start to have there favorites chanals and will discuss it with there friends.
They will have a depate about it.
They will always have the same arguments but that doesn`t counts.
My opinion is so, that I don`t agree the statement because the children aren`t able to have there own opinion and to fill out or to continue there mission to get it or recieve it.
Also because after some time it`s not anymore interesseting.
I always hate it when I'm enjoying a good movie and then in a sudden a stupid advertisment comes on and won't ever come to an end.
Now a days I really don't have a problem with ignoreing all the products they're trying to sell through the TV.
Throughout the years I learned that there will always be a better face-creme, restaurant or make up that they will try to advertise one day.
But I remember that when I was younger I always wanted to buy the products that had a good advertisment.
I felt like i would become a perfect human if I would posses all of the stuff the people in the TV had and it took me quite a long to change my way of thinking.
As a young child i really enyojed the advertisemnt with the newest dolls or playthings.
I always imagend in my head how I would be playing with all those stuff and started to heag my parents to buy me the all the newest playthings.
Looking back I see how I was manipulated by our economie.
It's actually a rally and efficent way to sell your products by using a child.
Because a child doesn't know any better and will want everything that he sees on TV.
So I understand why a lot of people create their advertisemnt specific for little childern even though it is not fair to manipulate a childrens brain.
I feel like the parents need to be strict to the ch
We see advertisements for children on television everytime we watch TV.
Playmobile, lego, barbie and so on you name it.
They are colourful and always come with a happy tune.
But are parents pressured to buy the products appearing in these advertisements?
Do children actually need toys to be happy?
And should these advertisements be banned?
Advertisements directly addressing children may make them feel like they need the advertised products to be happy.
Every parent of course wants his child to be happy so when a child sees something on TV and wants that because the advertisement makes it feel like it needs it the parent may feel forced to buy the product.
It could also be that parents just buy their children all the toys they want because of the advertisements but actually do not give them what they would really need which would be love and attention.
Because this is what they need most they do not actually need the toys displayed in the advertisments.
You could make a toy out of everything.
There are however good toys like puzzles or informative games also other games which are just for fun but it should be the parents' and the child's decision alone which toy to buy uninfluenced by the TV.
In the end I think toys are secondary in a good relationship between parents and child and advertisements may make them appear like they are most improtant for a child to be happy.
What really matters is that parents give their child all the attention and love they can give and not just buy him or her material things which they think a good parent would do.
This text should be helpful for parents who have young children aged two to five because here we awnser the question if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not!
Pro to the statement is that they can learn more if they see like learning matter in the television and that they can see and hear it and learn it in that way a lot quicker.
Contra to the statement is the aspect that they lose their social abillitys and don't meet friends insted they are looking television and aren't playing outside.
Then what also speeks for the television statement is that if there is just a mother at home with her small children she can easily switch on the television with a good program and let the childern watch that so she can clean something up in the mean time.
An other contra argument is that if they just watch television they don't now what the reality looks like so they have just theoretical know-ledge and not practical this is important because the reality is diffrent then the television world.
The least pro argument is that they get confortable with the electronic devises of this century wich are important for the whole life like for jobs and the future.
The least and most important contra argument is that the childern lose touch with the parents when they are just watching tv and not talking to the parents wich avoids emotional connection with the family.
to sum things up I personaly think that they should do that because I mean if you are just like watching a lot of television and not doing something else you are just in this mood of beeing lazy and tired and not willing to do something else.
I think, that it should not  be allowed.
So I'm with the statement.
Today the people are using social media very often.
This includes for example: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Youtube.
On every media advertising is normal.
So we are all confrontated with it.
You even can't walk through a railway station without seeing some advertising.
We even don't notice them anymore.
When I am watching TV, I don't want to watch the advertising all the time.
With my TV programm, i can skip the advertising because it is so enoying.
Well, a five years old child do not manage to skip the advertising.
So they are confrontated with it every 15 minutes and those advertising are like 10 minutes long.
I also think that the series the children of today are watching is not as very informational, funny and interessting as the series I have watched when I was a child.
I also think the advertisings are coming more in the TV today than when I was a child.
When I was a child I only watched TV once a week.
I Think that the children of today are watching TV to often.
I am shocked, when I see how much of them have a smartphone.
I even became a smartphone when I was 12.
Because of all this things  I have the oppinion that television advertising should not be allowed to young children.
Nowadays parents let ther children watch television all day so they don't have to worry about them.
But this is not the job of the television to look after the children.
The parents should do this.
But why shouldn't this be not allowed?
Children which looks often television are going to get this language.
In the young age this is very important that the children learn good language.
But in the television there are many bad words which arent't good for the children.
They will start using this words over and over again.
Against this the children learning the language faster because they hear it often.
When they have parents which have to do much things in their job and don't have time like this the children are learning faster.
But it al suppose at which channel the children are watching.
Are they watching MTV odr a little children series?
Or even Discovery Channel?
When they watching something like that the children can learn from it or not.
One problem is that the children getting used to the television.
They only wanna watch television and don't go outside and play with other kids.
They get attached to it.
That is a huge problem.
You can see this in many families in the USA.
Many children are sitting in front of the television and getting fat and fatter day by the day.
They just sit there the whole day and watch television and eat fast food.
This isn't good.
We need to stop that.
I think chidren can watch television but only like a specific time, Maybe a half an hour a day or somethiing like that.
Otherwise the children getting used to it.
And they should look stuff in their age and not whit bad words.
Should television advertising for childern be allowed?
In earlier times televisons were not so popular as today.
They had only one or two chanels and adverties were too expensive.
But today we have a lot of chanels and also a lot of advertisy.
But is it nessecary to advert on a chanel for children?
In my opinion the companys which produce products for children can get a lot of money if the show their products on those chanels for the kids.
You can easy make a children to want something even when it does not need it.
They would ran to their parents and ask them to buy that thing as soon as they see it  on their television.
The parants always want to make their kids happy so they would go and buy it.
The advertisy does not even have to be very special to turn a childrens mind.
That is also a good point for the company.
They do not have to spend a lot of money on the production of an adverting.
It just has to look funny and cool and the rest dose not even matter for the little children.
On the other hand I think that it is okey to make money on this way.
Because the kids can not decide how good the product is.
They only want to have it.
I mean, the companys do some tricks.
So if the parents do not buy that thing for their kid, it will be very sad.
Some children can fall into depressions and feel uncool.
That is not good for later on.
If a children dose not have that thing and all the others have it and this little sad kid has to watch the product everyday on the televison, it loses the motivation for playing.
All things considered I would bann television advertising for children.
I think it is not fair to play whit the childrens mind and feelings.
I would rather try to get little costumers on an other way.
Young children are often influenced, especially when they are aged around two to five years, the time where they also pick up the language and begin to speak.
So television advertising could be very decisive for children in this age group, leading to a controversial discussion whether or not children in this young should be allowed to watch advertising in television directed towards them, as they could be influenced by bad behavior, the early idea of selling products or in the other hand influenced positively by le

It is known that young childrenn are easily influenced by their family, their friends or even through television.
although adverts are crucial for the television business, their goal is not to educate children and there are also plenty of examples, why children shouldn`t be watching adverts, although they are directed towards them, as they may include for example violence or bad behavior in general.
Furthermore the goal of adverts is often to sell something and children definitely shouldn`t be faced with these kinds of adverts at this young age, beacause they are also learning from their environment and selling products shouldn`t be a part of a four year old`s life.
On the other hand you could say that television advertising directed to this age group could also have a positive influence by healping them to learn a language mathematics, although adverts of this kind are very rare.
Another positive influence could be teaching them good behavior, but unfortunatly companys aren`t interested in this kind of adverts, wich is why there are hardly any of them.
In the end I think the negativ aspects overweigh heavily, as there are plenty of adverts wich do not help the children to learn something but rather to influence them in a negative way.
The danger of children seeing violence or bad behavior should not be put on the line for some companys profit, as children are and will always be the future of this world.
Advertising

Nowadays there are many companies which advertise their products over the television.
Many of those are advertisements about shampoos or a new parfume or something like that.
A new trend which came up, is to advertise products toward young children.
Most of them are toys.
To tell whether it's  bad or good to do this kind of advertisement we have to list the pros and the cons.
One thing which would be in favour of the advertisements is that children get to know which products there are.
They can tell their parents that they would like to have that new toy which they saw in the television.
That would be a way how parents wouldn't waste money on things their children don't even want.
Instead of buying their kid something that will never be used, they can make their child happy.
Now that we talked about the pros, let's talk about the cons.
Many of the products advertised in the television are either useless or over-priced.
The "manipulate" the children so that their parents will buy them the new toy.
99% of the time it's only about making money.
The companies make their advertisements as cool as possible so that many children go to their parents and tell them that they want the product.
It's hard for parents to say no to young children.
They don't want the kid to be sad or to think that they're bad parents so they eventually just buy it.
Children of this age can't decide whether they need this new toy or not.
They see the advertisement in the television and decide upon that if they want it or not.
Young kids don't ask themself if they will play with it more than once or twice.
The part of their brain which is responsible for the critical thinking is not as developed as the brain of an adult.
After talking about the pros and cons i would like to tell you about my own opinion.
In my opinion advertising toward young children is another way for companies to make money off of young children.
I do think that it shouldn't be allowed since it either has as a result that kids are mad at their parents or that parents have to waste their money even if they're living from hand to mouth.
Many young couples which have young children don't have that much money to buy their kids every expensive toy they see on the television.
It doesn't really have a good side for the parents.
The problem is that economie doesn't work like that.
Money is all that it is about.
Television advertising directed toward young children is a controversial issue.
On one hand marketing should not be strictly controlled and should allow creativity.
Restricting adverts aimed at young children therefore is a tough issue for the marketing industry.
The people who believe that this kind of advertising should be forbidden is that children are easily influenced and they don't pay the product themselves.
Since the parents are in charge of what they buy for their child, the child shouldn't be aimed at directly.
For example toys being advertised where a hotwheelscar is flying and jumping through a burning ring is clearly not realistic for a grown-up, but young children aren't aware of that and therefore have totally wrong expectations of what the toy will be like.
But who should the advertisement be aimed at if not at the consumer directly?
It is indeed difficult to advertise toys to adults because they don't use them themselves.
That's why aiming directly at the young children is the preferred way of advertising at the moment.
There is also a logistic problem to the issue: Who decides wheter or not an advertisement is directed toward young children?
Drawing a line would indeed be very difficult so that a prohibition would have to lead to somewhat arbitrary decisionmaking.
In the end noone can clearly say if an advertisment is directed at a four or a six year old.
In my opinion advertising should not be directed toward young children since I believe (as stated before) that children aren't aware of what is realistic and what isn't.
Children therefore get their hopes up and trick their parents into buying something they don't actually want.
I also believe,that the counterargument that that a restriction limits the creativity of marketing companies is quite weak because they should be creative enough to come up with alternatives.
Although I strongly agree that it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward two to five year olds I am aware of the fact that drawing a line would be almost impossible.
Do young children, aged two to five, understand what they see in Television advertising?
Can they understand what the Television does want to tell them?
And how are the children reacting towards Television advertising?
Are there any significations that it shouldn't be allowed toward young children?
I think children with this young age aren't old enough to really understand what the television wants to tell them.
Usually they have their children channels with shows to learn the alphabet or the numbers.
Furthermore to connect terms to the proper items.
It's a good source to give young children a way for easy education.
In television there is a huge programme of different shows with specific reasons.
You have programmes like Dora to educate the numbers, the alphabet, the colors and so on.
On the other hand you have shows like Caillou or the sandman to give them some happy hours.
However, what do children connect with Televisions advertising?
Studies have proofen that the brain of young children takes up a lot of information taught from television or other media sources.
But should they be bombered with television advertising?
I would say no.
In this young age, you should be taught about education.
Education is so important for our community and you are never to young to start with education.
But there is no need to allow television advertising.
Television advertising is always a controversial subject.
Especially when it concernes children between the ages two to five.
While some believe that it has many beneficial aspects to it, it is also clear that it is an unfair way to persuade children because they don't have the ability to question the said yet.
This is why television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
Young children have not learned to think critically and question the things that they hear.
This means that kids believe everything that you tell them.
If they see a television advertising that tells them that they need a certain toy to belong to the cool kids they want that in the first place to not become an outsider because they believe what the advertising says.
So children become victims of the ad and this is why it is very dangerous to direct television advertising on children.
Supporters of the television advertising directed toward the young children argue that the television advertising can help the parents figure out what their child is interested in.
Depending on how the child respons to the different advertisings the parents are able to figuere out what their child wants for their birthday for example without having to ask them.
While this is a helpfull source of getting information from their children you can also argue that you get the same respond from them if you walk through the toy section of a store.
Another reason why television advertising for kids is bad is because the children are not able to realize when their parents can not afford a thing promoted in TV.
This will make the children get mad at their parents because they think they do not want to buy them a certain toy but actually they just can not afford it.
This makes it also a very uncomfortable situation for parents.
It clearly shows that the children will only be disappointed after watching an advertising.
In the end when you look at the whole picture everyone can realize that the television advertising directed toward children does more harm than good.
While it can help some people figure out what their children would like to have it usually just leaves the child wanting something that they usually don't get because they can't have every toy they see on TV or because the parents are just not able to afford it.
And that is not all.
The advertising often also leaves them feeling like an outsider because the children are not able to think critically yet and believe everything that the ad says.
This clearly shows that television advertising directed toward young kids is an evil thing which has to be forbidden.
In the age of technology every thing change.
Nowerdays you can watch five minutes of tv and you have seen about 10 advertisments.
Many informations witch the brain has to understand and deal with it.
As my father said "your are getting stupid if you watch tv.
Is he right?
How much are the children influated with all these advertations especially the adverts for the children.
why shouldn`t there be ad`s vor children, whyshouldn`t company be allowed to make ad`s its their right to try to sell their products to it`scustomers, without advertising companies will make a lot of losts and couldn`t survive.
Especially in the age of technology, how should Playmobil and Lego survive when children are only haning out on the smartphones ore on the pc.
The tv is dying out, because of the internet.
There is less ad especially for children and when children uses Computers the are playing games or watching youtube.
The children themselves can choose what they wan to see and that they`d like to buy,

The problem with the advertisments is that they passively influent the children, The ad`s influate children to buy and buy more stuff.
The children are raised to be the perfect capitalist.
With is imagination they will have problems to handle money.
It takes them the usage to think allone when somebody tells you the whole tim eto do something.
one more point is the children can be addicted to the tv, they might sit there only to see the newest products.
The ad`s are presenting fun and colors and a happy world and changes the way of thinking of a child.
in the end i don`t mind ad`s for children but they should stop being that passively influential, i fortunately never liked watching tv but when i sometime watch it, i can`t stand it.
Sometimes i get the feeling getting a epileptical attack.
Television advertising 

So much people say that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
But is this correct and does the advertising influence the education of the children or is this just a little danger?
First of all, children are very credent and the companys know that.
They can influence the children with beautiful pictures or toys.
The children don't understand the reason of advertising and believe everything you tell them, for exemple the lie with the "toothfee".
The kids would be manipulated to buy a thing or change their opinion for the rest of their life.
The companys have the law to direct every televison advertising to everyone they want.
One of their reason to make children advertising is that the parents should look after their children and decide what they should watch or not.
It's also nice for the companys because the children are very easy to influence and manipulate.
In my opinion the television advertising toward young children should not be allowed, because the children can't imagine what happens with their decision they do.
It's also bad that the companys do that because they just look for their money and nothing more.
Since young children do not have the same cognitive skills as more aged people possess one is likely to say that those kids are not even able to understand the presented add properly.
As their brain and also their sensors for instance the ears is not yet far enough developed, they can neither be influenced nor being effected by the advertising aired on TV, which is the main goal of advertising companies.
Therefore, exposing children to TV-adds should not be prohibited.
However, most of the shown adds are very noisey and in addition to that an excess of bright and striking colours which are literally an eye catcher for these young children.
They are captured by the variety of blinking and permanent flactuating objects.
The very sensitive human eye may get dirstracted which in serious cases can lead to photosensitific epilepsy, causing irreperable damage to the eyes.
Furthermore, such an handicap will last a lifetime, having a major impact on a human's life.
Especially when one considers the technologies one have to face in our computerised world.
I disagree, because if the television advertising shows products which are especially for young children (aged two to five) the young children know better if they would like to have those products.I mean why would a 30-year-old man would like to have a teddy that looks like a unicorn?
But I'm more or less sure that his little girls would like to have one.
So it makes sence to direct the television advertising for little children.
In the end the parents have to buy everything, so I can't see a problem when television advertising is directed toward young children.
And if parents don't like there children to see the advertising on the television they shouldn't let them see it.
Those kids (aged two to five) are too young to watch TV without somebody who looks after them and who controls what they are watching.
So again Idon't see the problem and if there is one, the problem is that the children watch too much TV and not that they could see television advertising.
In my opinion children at this age shouldn't been showed television anyway.
I also can't see the reason why television advertising should be different to any other form of advertising.
There's advertising everywhere.
In the bus, at school, in the cinema, everywhere you can think about.
So if you ask me, I would say that the discussion about this topic wastes time.
It wastes my time and I can't see the sence anyway.
I think there is nothing more to say about this.
I think that it shouldn't be allowed to show advertising to children at the age between two to five, because you manipulate the children.
The children is in this state trying to understand the world and with advertising you are messing them up.
They think, that they really need the toy, bag or whatever is advertised.
But there is an other problem; why do children whatch television at that age?
They're way to young.
By whatching tv they don't learn anything important.
They learn things, that are shown in the ty and sadly they get confronted with advertisement.
Many companies know that and falsly use that.
They shouldn't manipulate those children.
The sad thing is, that there isn't a good reason to show them advertisement.
There may be some good reasons to show television, like there are some good channels, where they teach kids to understand nature, or they craft something etc.
But advertisement is a selfish act from companies which only want more profit.
And they pay their profit with the knowledge of children.
I got a neighbor and he is now 12 years old, I can remember, that he always whatched tv and always wanted the cool stuff, that was shown in the tv.
Now he is a selfish, snobby baggar.
But his older brother who is 18 know isn't like this.
He is the complete oposite, When I and he were in that age, we palyed football all the time and only watched tv once a week.
This shows an other problem: now there is a lot more media and the youth grows up witch it.
Like I said, it isn't paticulary a bad thing, but evereyone can influence the media today and that sadly hits also the youngest of us.
Now, how can we ban these advertisements?
They pay a lot of money for these advertisments and how can they show the world their product.
Maybe we can make it with the help of the coverment, but these companies will find an other way to get throgh to the children.
Television advertising is something, where you can't control who is watching it or how old the person is.
So it is nearly impossible to perhibit the young children to watch those spots.
But the other aspect is that you can control what companies produce.
The television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed means that the plot of de spot should not have an impact on young children.
They should not have the feeling that the advertising is made to impress them.
Children should never feel the pressure on them to buy the product they show in the spot.
In addition, children at that age aren't able to afford this things.
The parents are the ones who then must explain why they wont buy the product.
After the children had seen the amazing television advertising, it is impossible for them to understand why they wont get it.
Another point is that it is difficult to make clear what the advertisings are supposed to do.
Which group do they reach the most?
Why does a spot which shows a toy for children should not be allowed because it is directed toward young children?
It can be directed for expample toward the parents, the grandparents and uncles as well.
So its diffilcult to define which television advertising should be perhibited.
From my point of view it is nearly impossible to stop the television advertisiing which is directd toward young children.
First of all, the parents are resposible for their children and what they watch in the tv.
So it's their own business if they let their children watching television advertising.
The next point is that the spots do not reach just one specific group of people.
There are a lot of people who are watching the same spots at different ages but they can all toghether feel impressed and can find reason why they should buy it.
This essay I will start with examples which I have seen on the TV.
My sister is now 10 years old and she looks quite often TV.
As a little child she has often seen advertisment of Hasbro, chewingum marks and others.
Now there are tablets and computers in the TV which are only for kids.
Of course the opinion is relative to the person who is thinking about this but generally I think that it is very complicated to say something about this statement.
I think that it should be allowed to make advertisement to little children because a lot of people earn money with this and they probably have also some children which they have to feed.
On the other side I think that children aged from two to five generally don't have to looking at TV.
They should better playing in the nature with friends.
To look in screens is normal for the elder but for young children it is not so good for growing up with this kinds of technics but that is my opinion.
It could be that I am a little bit too hard and it looks like I am a father but it is my opinion.
At age two to five I haven't allready looking into things like TV and computers I looked at some pictures from books or I played with my playmates and I made things like this.
Because all the media have advertisment in their programm you have to decide of your own if you will looking that or not but the children could not decide if they will look at this.
They are only looking at this and they believe in the advertisment because it is so cool and nice to be a princess or a cowboy like the kids in the advertisment.
At least I will say that all the people decide of their own what their kids could do and what they should no do.
But I would say that my kids aged from two to five  should not looking TV anyway.
Not because of the advertisment it is because of the creativity they could loose with the state picture of how the kids should play.
In my opinion they have to invent their own games.
It's a daily problem: Your five year old child is sitting in front of the TV watching his or her favorite TV-show and a small comercialbreak appears, but instead of advertising products for you, a working adult who's able to buy whatever you want, it shows coulorful bright plastic toys and a kind voice tells you a story or a joke or why this product is a must-have and seconds later your child demandes you to buy him or her one.
Is this right?
Is it right to use children to persuade adults for buying them the toys they saw on TV?
I'd say clearly no, this ain't right.
Children shouldn't be capitalized.
In their age they don't even understand the value of money, they don't know what working and paying is.
Therefor they don't undrstand what the effort behind a funny toy is.
As an adult you should buy your kids a toy if you want to and not because your kid is demanding.
They need too understand the worth of things otherwise they won't understand the valuable of work and money afterwords.
Commercials especially for toddlers shouldn't be allowed at all, but you can't simply force them to disappear by law, there is and there will be commercial for young children but it's up to you if they will see them.
You can decide to show him or her what you think is appropriate for it.
Let him or her only see movies without commercial, by buying or borrow them.
And if you decide to let them watch regular TV make sure that you won't buy them the thing they want just because it's a must-have for them and not so expensive compared to your paycheck.
Teach them the value of things.
And finally: Your children shouldn't even be watching TV all day at this age.
If we turn on our television it's most likely that we will come across advertisment.
Nobody likes it but it's just there and there is nothing we can do about it.
It tries to sell us a new detergent or the newest vacuum cleaner.
But it doesn't stop there.
It even targets children by trying to show them how awsome the new barbie doll is and how much cooler you become with it.
But should that be allowed?
Advertisment is a product of our economy.
Each company wants to sell their products as much as possible to make the highest profit.
And for that children are a really easy targets because it's easy to influence and manipulate them.If you tell a child it would become cooler if it buys those blinky shoes it will believe you and want to buy them.
And that's exactly what the advertisment does.
Showing the children how fun their product is and how much cooler they will become.
Children are naïve and will believe the advertisment because they see the happy children in the television.They don't see them as actors as adults do  but they see them as their potential friends.
But one big problem without those advertisment would be the financing of the kids channels because most of the money comes from those advertisments.
And channels for kids aren't generally bad.
Without those funds many kids channels wouldn't exist any more and they might start to whatch content that wasn't ment for them.
I don't support the idea of advertisment directed directly towards kids beacause it just an easy way to make money and it's certainly a wrong approach.
I think the easiest solution for this problem wouldn't be banning those advertisments but giving more responsibilty to the parents.
Today there are many possibilities to get around them and if they don't want their children to be exposed to advertisment they maybe need to invest some mone and subscribe to Netflix,  buy more dvd's or simply record the program they want their kids to watch.
So if you don't like that your child is exposed to advertisment, there is an easy way out.
And maybe one day this will be enough to make the advertisment directed towards children disappear.
Nowadays you will find advertising everywhere and it manipulate us to buy or do certain things that we might would not do.
But the older we get more personallity and will get less easier to manipulate.
So companies try to get the easier targets like young childrens (aged twoto five).
Like McDonalds which builds playground in their restaurants to get children and with that making them loyal costumors when the grow up.
Criticts thinks that this is unfair and we might destroy their individuell personality.
But in the others say it is necessary for a healthy develepment.
There are tons of people which think that children's brains can not really see if something is real or not.
Their brain are not finished at that age so their easy prays for big advertising companies.
Aswell they are more inocent and might trust them to easiey and do not question it if it is real or not.
If the get manipulated this early we might get easier targets if wie grow up or even get damaged.
So people are scared that young children can not see between the line and detect the lies.
On the other sides there are the comapnies but aswell as other critics which think it is important to get in contact with advertising so if we grow up we question it more often.
Aswell our brains learns what it is and we will get harder targets for them.
They also think if we fall for a "trap" young we can not possibly make a huge finacial loss as if we grow up and fall for it then.
So the other side says that we need to learn what advertising is in a young age so we can learn how to question them.
But even in the "Pro Advertising side" there are some critics.
Well there are not really thinking about children but about the effiency of the advertisment in general.
Is it really clever to target young children which forget things if they get older.
Also they do not have any money to buy things.
So basicly they are saying that if is not clever to target childrens because they " do not buy" but there parents "are buying".
In my opinon I think we should advertising to young children.
I think is very important that they learn how to deal with it and that they lie to you.
That is a great lesson for their life.
But I do agree with the critcs but I would not ban them.
I rather would regular them more maybe ban a few too manipulative.
So in the end I would not can the system now to much because I think it is important to learn buy maybe with a little help at the start
In todays world advertising is present in every form possible, at every hour of the day and at nearly every location existing.
Especially television advertising is powerful, since this type of advertisment is directed to all your senses.
Therefor there is most probably nobody who manages to escape advertising.
But should advertising really be directed to all age groups and kind of people?
The importance of technology increases year by year, even in the life of infants televisions reached a high importance.
Not only is this bad for their health, fitness and social lifes it's also a danger for their education and development.
Children, mostly at their youngest, are very open for diffrent sources of influence.
To be exact this means they are very sensitive for everything that is communicated through advertising.
This has to result in a law against television advertising directed towards young children to stop the industry from making profit on the back of small inocent children.
On one hand we have to keep in mind that watching televison on a daily basis isn't healthy for anybody especially for little children but on the other hand it's the parents decision if and how much they want to allow their children to watch television.
If children would not be allowed to have such an amount of contact with smartphones, televisions and other similar products this would not be a problem.
In summary I have to say it should not be profitable for companys to invest in television advertising directed to infants since at this age children should not be watching television on a regular basis.
The only solution I see for this problem is a change in the thinking of the society as a whole.
Todays world is too much directed towards technology which reached a peak with the fact that even infants are affected by this.
Istead of having a discussion over television advertising, which is directed towards infants the people should rather inspire the next generation to a healthy and happy lifestyle.
Children of the ages from two to five are often very naiv and mostly in the visit of their parents.
If it's not the case, for example by watching television, the children can't decide by therselfes which of the given statements are necessary or true.
This young people haven't the knowledge to form their own opinion concerning the content given in televion adverttising.
It could also be possible that the adversiting companies try to influence the children in a certain direction to their own profit.
But on the other hand advertising could be a good way to teach even young people what's right and what's wrong for example concerning the natural environment or also humanity.
But adversiting itself for products like games isn't needed at that age.
Most of the time young children wont understand the given message in televion.
I think adversiting is mainly focussed on making money for the great buisnesses.
The only one's who can say what the childrens require are their parents.
They know them best.
Young children in generel shouldn't spend their time in front of the televion.
There is so much more to explore in the world than sitting in front of a screen and waiting for the next show.
Parent should go outside, play with their children, teach them what matters in life or visit friends.
All of those experiences will teach and influence a young child better than televion.
Television advertising is everywhere today.
Some people do not even realise it.
Other see it and belive in everithing they say.
This topic is now most popular than ever, because nobody really knows what can happen if the advertising is directed towards young children.
We do not have any experiences with something like that.
We should not forget, the television is a quiet new technologie, even if we all have smartphones in our bags now.
The advertising is directed to only a apecial group of humans.
That could be women, teenagers, children, animal-lovers, grandfathers etc.
There is no muster.
But it is known, that the younger generations have not made his own opinion.So, if the advertising is directed towards young people, nobody can say sure in wich way this could change their lives.
Many parents have not a TV in their house, so the children have not the influense of it and they can play outside like our parents did in this age.
They think, that the best way to handel this situation is to not confront the children with it but to hide it from them.
They are just too young for this big confrontation.
They could not learn how to handle it.
First, children need to make their own experiences with the real word.
After that, they are ready to confront the advertising.
Other parents think, confrontation is the best way for a child to learn how to handle things.
So they are always in de near, when a child looks an advertising and can make jokes of this product.
The children can realise, what this means and learn this way, not to take everything siriuc they see on the TV.
This can make the rest of the life easier if they realise it.
But if the children are too young, maybe they do not even see the advertising like it is, but only colourfull and moving pictures.
Parents learned how to handle such situiations on the way, they think it is the best.
But we would not have the problem if there was not any advertising directed toward young children.
Even the people in this management should realise, that children shoul be children even for a short time and not some targents for a new product.
My conclusion is, that it should not be allowed.
Nowadays television advertising is very commonly used in order to win new customers.
However, less often do we actually take the consequences of this type of advertisement into account.
Directing television advertising toward young children may have tremendous effects one a child's life.
In this essay I will discuss whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
First of all it needs to be taken into consideration that television advertisement may influence children's opinion to a very large extent.
This is due to the fact that by directing television advertising toward young children they will not only copy certain attitudes and beliefs, but also lose their ability to evaluate and judge significant values and matters.
Nevertheless, even though television advertising might too strongly influence young children, numerous advertisements can very often enable young children to think critically.
Therefore children might become sophisticated analysts who have to decide which advert they like the most.
Such skills are very important for the future in terms of becoming an adult, career decisions etc.
In conclusion, both aspects appear to be of great importance.
However, in my opinion television advertismemt do actually harm children's ability to evaluate and judge.
Accordingly, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
(Just to clear up how I understood the statement: It's about children watching the commercials and not commercials about things for children.)
Statement: Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
No television advertising for young children

Why would a toddler be intrested in televison advertising?
And why would it even matter to them?
To start off, I disagree with the statement.
Why?
- well first of all I don't think children aged from two to five watch television.
And if that isn't true then they do certanly not watch the advertising parts.
I litterlay can't see a single reason why a company or a firm would do a commercial for children that age, because I don't think it would matter to the children.
So basicly only the parents of these young children would see it, and if the advert was designed for children it isn't going to intrest the parents either.
But on the other hand if I'm understanding the statement wrong I am extremly sorry for the person who has to understand what I'm saying.
Summing up I can only disagree with the statement.
If I think about my own childhood, of course I can't remember back to when I was two, but even when I was five I for sure never watched TV , the only thing was DVD's and things like that, where their wouldn't be any television advertising included.
And even if I'm remembering that wrong again, that proves even more that it didn't influence me as a child so there isn't anything wrong with television advertising directed toward young children.
Today everywhere we go, we are influenced by advertising.
For us we know that and most of us can handle this, but how does it looks with the young childern?
Do they know that there are influenced?
Do they know that maybe there own desicions are not even there own?
Young childern should learn early to make their own desicions.
In the young age they should be told about the television advertising by their parents.
Maybe it is not a question about age, just about knowledge.
So if they know there are influecend, they will realise it and do not get caught by televiosion advertising.
If the youngest generation knows about this influencing, the question is if they understand it.
There is a reason why school starts in the age of seven years.
In this young years they are not able to understand and even control that.The Television advertising is getting smater and smater and is finding new tricks to catch the young childern,which makes it even more difficult to understand this for the young childern.
Television advertising toward young children has two side.
On one hand it is a great way for the industry to make their money and may also an easy way.
On the other hand for the young children it is an unfair game, because they are not able to understand and control this influence.
I think it would be good if the television advertising toward young children would not be allowed, but in my opinion it is not possible to stop the television advertising toward young children.
Advertising is an important thing to influence small children.
Now the big companys (which have already enough money) get more rich than before.
The message to the children is that the need something but in real they do not need it.
The poor parents have to pay thing for their kinds.
With this things the small childrens never play and it ends in the corner.
All of this is not important.
The most important reason is that the companys earn morer money.
This is good for the economy and a strong economy is good for everyone.
This leads to a happy society.
Sure you can say that is not nice.
As I was a child I liked this advertising very much and it makes me to the person who I am.
I often fight with my mother because she does not give the gift who I saw in television.
These are the negative effect.
But the money is more important.
The advertising also inform the small children (what is new?).
So the companys are able to influence the life of the children (which is not good!).
Our children are part of the economy.
In the last few years television became more popular.
Now also young children watch almost everyday TV.
It became to be a standard watching TV at least once a day.
Now some people ask theirselves if this is a good development or if television could also be bad especially for young children.
First I have to mention that there are some really good an interesting shows in the TV, for example documentations about animals or other countries.
By watching this sort of shows the children can also learn something for their lives.
Or if the children are watching TV in another language, for example they live in Switzerland but only watch TV in English.
Because especially in the young age of the children they are
"Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed."
Young children don't think like adolescents or teenagers.
They aren't suppose to watch television in general.
It doesn't make a lot of sense because they are not able to understand what's going on on TV.
It shouldn't be allowed to do advertising directed toward young children because TV shouldn't have an influence in their life.
Kids should be playing outside and having fun with other children.
It is important that they don't get to see too much of the social media and Television "world" so that they can exlore the real world by themselves.
On the other hand they can profit from advertising in a way so that they see what is happening on TV and what is popular at the moment.
They would have their own advertising made only for children in their age.
Of course it would be fun and pretty intersting for them to see what is going on.
In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed because children in that age are supposed to enjoy their lives in another way than watching TV.
I'm pretty sure that they will have enough time to watch a lot of different advertisings when they are older.
Television adverstising directed toward young children (aged two or five) should not be allowed.
Even though the television doesn't exist since a long time, it plays an important rule in our lifes, especially if you grow up with it.
There are a lot of parents who put their children in front of the television and make them watch it for hours.
The children will not only watch different shows, but also the adverstisings that are played every 20 minutes or so.
But are these advertisings bad for your children?
When I was a child I really enjoyed seeing all the different toys, that were displayed on the tv.
Even if I knew I wouldn't get all or even one of the toys, I liked seeing how they looked because it exited me.
I think that there are a lot of children who feel the same.
Advertisements directed towards children are really entertaining and that's a reason why they should be allowed.
There are also children who are influenced by the advertisements in another way.
These children see them and then, they want all of the toys and harrass their parents to buy them.
But it's the parents job to make their child understand, that it can't get everything it wants and to be carefull about not making it spoiled.
The other question is the one about morality.
Isn't it bad to try to influence a human, who doesn't really understand that it was influenced?
Yes, actually it is really bad, but on the other side it's a way to make them get in touch with these kind of things and to teach them how to handle these situations.
My general opinion is, that the advertisings aren't bad.
They can even be good.
But it's the parents task to control the level of influence and to manage how their children will react to them.
Parents can even use this experience to teach their children important things about life and to teach them that they won't get everything they want.
And besides the advertisements you shouldn't let your two to five year old child watch too much television anyway.
Television advertising

This following statement is difficult to answer.
Television in general is not every time to support.
As specialy not for young children who are two or five years old.
Young children in this age should do intelligent things like play with others.
They should not watch television all the time.
So It`s not right that television is directed toward young children.
Because they are affected of what they get to see in television.
They mostly don`t really realise what they are watching and are fascinated of everything.
A child with two years can`t decide anything alone.
It needs some help with decisions.
So parents can control what they are watching on the television.
My personal opinion is that I don`t agree the statement `Television advertising dircted toward young people`.
Children should watch less TV, so they get less influeced by it.
It`s not right that adult people are leading the children to watch television.
Parents should play more with they`re children and don`t set them in front of a television.
Each time when we look televison we see advertissments.
There are many of them and for all ages, but it is correct to advertising directed to young children?
Should these be allowed?
Today we talk about these questions.
Television advertising should be allowed because all humans have the same rights and it would be anoying when we only see advertissments only for one age.
The young children like this advertissment so they would have more fantasy in example when they see an add from children surprise.
They want those surprisee to play like the kids in the advertissment and have this fantasy and the chocolate give them power to create new things.
An other arguement for this is that at children telvesion like KIKA you can't show adds for adults.
This is not intressting for little kids, they want to see Barbie or something like that in the advertising.
Argument against this advertising is in general that kids in this age should play outside or with others and shouldn't look television.
But if they do it too they shouldn't see this adds.
It should be possile to make a children channel without advertissments.
This adverissments aren't helpful, so the children want something and the next time when they go to the market with the parents they cry that the parents must buy this for them or something like that.
To take up the argument for this addvertising with the joy from children surprise.
This joy isn't good for the environnement and in general you find fantasy without this joy which you throw in the bin after less time.
I'm against this advertissments and find this schould not be allowed.
Advertising is okey but not by this young children, they should play outside or watch tv without this add.
Adds for Pampers are okey too because this is useful for young children not like the add from children surprise.
They get fantasy all over the world and not only with this joy and this joy isn't useful it's for the bin and it's bad for the environement because it's made by plastic.
So think like parents.
Everywhere we go we have advertising.
Everybody, no matter if young or old, is influenced by the advertising.
As an adult you know whats happend and you can stay against it.
But as a young girl or boy you dont even understand what these adverting is doing with you.
They are so easily to influence, much easiler than adults.
So should it be allowed to show advertising in television toward these kids?
On the one hand yes, because everywhere is advertising.
so why shouldnt it be allowed to show some in the television?
In my eyes the question is: why can such young children watch television?
They should go out and play with there friends.
And so its the mistake of the parents because its their buisness to "save" the childrens from these advertisings and so its also there problem, if the children see something to play with and they want it.
The industry isnt stupid.
Its there plan to direct the advertising to these kids.
So they ask there parents for thousand times, if the can have this thing.
And the parents want that their child is happy or they just wont hear much longer the same question everyday, so they buy this item.
Thats how our system functionned.
On the other hand its not okey to espacially direct the advertising toward the childrens.
They havent the chance to stay against it and say: "ohh i dont wanna have these sweets" if they saw the advertising because its so easily to influenced them by anything in this age.
So its absolutly evil from these 
"advertising-chefs" to use this for there own money.
Back to the question: it should be allowed to show advertising on television.
But not  to often and not to much.
Its in the hands of the parents wheter they are okey with the fact that there child watch advertising or not.
So the have the chance to chance it if they dont wanna this.
Television advertising directed toward young children

The influence of television at our lifes, plays a big role today.
About this topic there are good but also negative sides to discuss, and people have many diffrent opinions about.
At the beginning, I'll show some positive aspects.
On  television are shown many interesting topics, where you can learn helpful things for life.
Also for very young children there are special storys, mostly fictional, which can be watched.
So when children sometimes watch something on television, which is thought for their age, parents get some free time but also know, what their children are doing.
In a second part, I'll talk about negative aspects of this influence.
On television there are also shown many stupid topics, and things which are not thougt for the eyes of very young children.
For example films with much violence or topics which are only thougt for adults.
So when parents just let look their children what they want, it could be very bad for them.
An other pint is, that when children always sit in front of television, they may loose their social contacts.
To close this essay, I'll tell my opinion.
I think that just sitting in front of television and zapping should not be allowed for young children, because there are to much things which aren't thought for children eyes.
But if parents sometimes show them a special selected film, it should be allowed.
Especially for versy young childen I think the time in front of television should be
Today, nearly every household has a television.
People of every age watch television daily.
But when we watch television, there is television advertising nearly every fifteen minutes, which is directed to different groups of people, also to young children.
A good reason to direct television advertising toward young children is, that this is good for merchandising.
When children see something on television, they want to have this thing, and the parents buy it to make them happy.
Another pro is, that they learn to not be influenced by television advertising.
For example, if they watch television and every 15 minutes there is advertising, maybe they turn out the television because it's boring and go doing other things, like playing.
When they know, that the advertising  is during 5 minutes, they come after this time and turn it on again.
But there are also some cons.Sometimes, children want things they don't really need and if their parents don't want to buy them these inuseful things, children often begin to cry and shout.
Especially children in a very young age (two to five), can't decide whether a thing is useful and if they really need this thing.
Another point is, that when they watch a film of  120 minutes and every 15 minutes there is television advertising during 5 minutes, they watch television television 40 minutes longer.
That causes for young children headaches and they are more tired than if they would play outside.
Personally, I think that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed, because it has a negative influence on the childhood.
If they get everything they want, because their parents want to make them happy, they grow up with the thinking that they can have anything they want.
This can bring problems when they become teenagers: they don't get much pocket money or the don't gain much money in a job and if they get it, they spend it immediatly, often on things they see on television.
Television advertising that is directed toward children seem usually harmless, since it is there to promote products and other things that seem harmless, as well.
However, what a young child doesn't notice is that commercials tend to be or normally are manipulative.
Of course do young children want the toy which was presented to them in a commercial which shows how awesome that toy is and how it's going to impress their friends, even though this product will never live up to their expectations.
Advertising is manipulative in general, but advertising that is targeted to children is often extremely exaggerated, too.
Of course you could say that products that are made for kids don't cost a lot and that the company needs money, though there are a lot of commercials for different types of candy which are unhealthy.
Television advertising generally presents sweets in a way, as if it were glorifying them and it's terrible that children think that unhealthy food is valuable.
In conclusion, I have to say that I'm not against television advertising for kids in general, but I'm against the exaggerated ones which trick children into thinking they really need the aforementioned products.
The problem is that children probably wouldn't want to buy them without such a commercial
I don't agree with this statement.Because I don't see how this could harm these children.
At that age they probably don't even understand the advertisment and if they do it is still the parents decision to buy them the product.You could argue that children being influenced at such a young age might be damaging in the future for their self-esteem (because the presenters of the product are models and show the children a beautystandart that they can't reach)  or they start to be very materialistic.
But to avoid that children shouldn't watch TV at all because they also see advertisements directed towards adults and that influences them pretty much in the same way, although they may be less intrested in those.The way capitalism works makes it nearly impossible too avoid any kind of advertisment, children in our day and age are going to be confronted with it everywhere not just in television but also on the internet.
I feel like they are too young to be on the internet or watch a lot of television but since most parents keep their children quiet by putting them in front of the TV or giving them a laptop to play games on.
So it is unavoidable for the children to encounter any kind of advertisment.
In the end it is the parents responsibility too judge what their children are allowed to watch and to explain to them how to deal with what they see.
So advertisement directed toward young children isn't something that should be banned.
Because in most cases it's just making them want something and when their parents don't buy it for them they learn a valuable lesson, that they don't get everything they want.
It is nearly impossible too keep them from becoming materialistic so it is again up to the parents to teach them to be also happy without all too many things.
There are arguments for and against it.
A main argument why it shouldn't be allowed is that advertisement often contains wrong information or is at least making the product look better than it is in reality.
So the children will get wrong informations and as they don't have much life experience yet they are not able to decide whether something is true or not.
That means that they will just believe everything the advertisement tells them.
Further they will be influenced by many things in this very young age.
And that is probably not the best thing to happen.
There is so much different advertisement and the will just have too many informations and maybe not believe the truth the parents tell them, bescause they like the wrong informations of the advertisement better.
But there are also a few arguments against not allowing it.
If there wouldn't be advertisement directed toward young children, the children would just see the advertisement directed to adults instead and that maybe is even worse for them, then seeing the advertisement especially produced for them.
Because there are some things they don't have to know or see at such a young age.
Also if they get used to advertisement in a soft way, meaning through advertisement produced especially for them, they already learned how to deal with advertisement in a young age.
So they won't have problems later.
And also in this young age the parents can help them dealing with advertisement, so they don't have to deal with it all by themselfs when there adult aswell.
I don't understand why you would let a child at such a young age watch TV at all.
I think they have enough time to do this later in their lifes.
At such a young age you have energy so you can play inside or outside or do something with friends from courses you and probably your parents are attending together.
When you are older you still have time to watch TV when you are very tired after work for example and don't have time to do something with your friends.
So I don't really have an opinion on television advertising, but if I had to choose I think I would say it should be allowed, because then they right away get the true impression of television and not a better picture of it than it is in reality.
I don't think that television advertising toward young children should be forbidden.
Because the companys who make teslevision advertises toward young children, they mostly also sell things for this young kids.
It would not make any sense if they want to sell a toy for children and then they would make the advertise for adults.
Because the parents don't want the toy.
Television advertises are often made for young children because they want to impress the kids, and if they are impressed, they directly go to their parents and ask them to buy the toy or whatever.
If the advertise don't impresses the child, they don't even ask their parents to buy the toy, and then the company would not sell many toys.
And thats not what the company wants, so they better makes talevision advertises for young children.
But in the other way, i don't think that it's good to make televion advertises for young children.
Of course, I understand the companys and the magasines why they're doing it but i think it's just not good for the young children.
Because when they watch the advertises the always think that they need this toy or whatever it is.
And so they are never confident with what they already have.
Maybe they got a new toy yesterday, but then they watch television and in the advertise there is another toy, maybe a newer one.
And so they directly think that this toy is better and of course they want the newer one.
So my answer to this question is, that i still think that television advertising is not only a good thing but it is quite normal nowadays and you cannot forbid it, so we have to get along with it, and the parents just have to be strict and don't buy their children everything they saw in the television advertising.
So my conclusion: No i don't agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should be not allowed.
Advertising:

The television advertising which is for example about "pampers" is not for the young children self.
The advertising is for their parents that they have to buy this article for their children.
The advertising need little children for this video because in my example the adults can't wear "pampers".
It would be very funny but it wouldn't be their idea.
After watching this advertising the young children often want everthing.
They want every playmobil and lego and everthing.
It must be very hard for the parents to disapponting their childern again and again.
I think that the people who makes this advertising for young children article doesn't directed their advertising toward young childern because they don't buy it.
They have to do it for the parents.
They want that the parents buy this article and so they use little sweet children for their television advertising because every adult think about them "oh they are so sweet" and this could be a good idea.
After watching that the adult buy the article.
But I also think that in this age the children have to play something outside int the forrest oder something like that and not watching TV.
So it wouldn't be a problem when every child in this age doesn't watch TV because I think in this age the children need to play and they are not allowed to watch TV.
My opinion is that the television advertising could be directed toward young children because it's the problem from their parents when they allowed their children to watch TV.
Watching television is a thing everybody does these days, from young children to pensioners.
And it's a normal thing that, while watching television, we are confronted with advertising.
But what if advertisement confronts the youngest of us?
Can we allow affecting children with these advertisements?
For many people television advertisement is just a nuisance that comes with watching television, they either change to another channel or do something else untill their desired program starts.But children may not understand the whole idea of advertising.
If they see something that looks fantastic on television they maybe want to have it too.
They can't know that the things they see may not be as marvelous as they seem.
However, one could say that kids aren't just influenced while watching television.
In stores for example there are a lot of toys and stuff presented for the kids.
A typical example is at the end of your shopping tour, when you want to check out, there are always those sweets and chewing gums presented right in the sight of the little children.
In the end everybody gets confronted with those advertisements and everybody copes with it differently.
The parents may have to keep an eye on their children too and teach them not to believe everything that the people on television say is true.
In conclusion I think one can argue whether or not children get influenced through televison advertising too much.
The parents can still forbid theit children to watch television if they are sceptical about those advertisings.
Television advertising aren't a thing I would support but I can't say it is so terrible that it should not be allowed either.
Nowdays the television adverdising is a part of our lives.
We see everyday some television adverdising directed toward the adults, but there is also some of them that are directed toward young children at the age of two or five years old.
Because of that fact, i would like to express my opinion about that controversial statement and discuss if that should be allowed or not.
First of all i would like to explain why there are some adverdising directed toward children.
As long as there are products such as toys consumed just by children it is normal that children are the "goal" of the adverdising.
Because of that we cannot avoid it.
Children are easy to get adverdised, because when they see something they probably want to buy it without thinking how expensive that is or if it is something that she need.
On the other hand adverdising toward children is manipulated and that manipulating people is illegal.
So we may should not allowed children to look TV at the  time of adverdising.
Furthermore it is difficult to protect.
Adverdising is manipulated but is also very important for our economy.
So if we just refuse to see any adverdising then we have a bad influence to the economy.
Moreover not just children get adverdising, but adults, too.
In conclusion, i do not think that we can protect ourselfs and of course children from adverdising.
We should just be carefull and do not get influenced easily.
Adverdising should be allowed, also for young children, but it should not be so extreme, because we all know that children are easy to adverdising.
Young children may should reduse the TV so the adverdising shoud also be redused.
In this text I would like to deal with the suggestion, or more the desire, that commercials that traget young children in the age of two to five shouldn't be allowed on the TV.
It is sure that many people start to watch television already in very young years.
In the past few years it even gets worse and worse, a child's consumption of TV programmes rises constantly.
So this question is a burning issue that we need to spend our thought on.
Are children at that age already able to understand what the sense of a commercial is?
Children at that age don't yet understand what is going on in the world and with what tricks companies want to influence people.
They're only watching television because they want to see their idols or their favourite series.
They're not yet interested in commercial or products that are promoted.
But exactly the not-understanding could be the problem.
Children haven't learnt yet what is good and what is bad.
Their brain collects all the information it can get and is not yet able to sort out what is useless and what is important.
At that age their imagination is at a peak point what means that when they see something they can make up a whole story of it.
Depending on what is showed in the commercial this could harm a child's mind or give it wrong illusions.
Another aspect to be considered is the aim of a commercial or its advertising company behind it.
The goal is to have people buying a specific product or booking a certain vacation, etc.
The deterrant at a commercial directed towards children is that they don't decide yet what they buy and what not.
They don't have their own money (even pocket money would not be enough) that they could go and buy stuff with.
In this point of view there shouldn't be any worries that commercial could lead to debts.
Eventhough children cannot buy the promoted stuff by themselves they can go and terrify their parents until they get it.
This creates a competition among children because they always want to own all what the others have as well what could possibly finally lead to debts for the parents.
Moreover, you never know what's going on in the mind of a child and how it perceives the world's action.
You don't know how it feels toward itself.
Maybe a child already has depressions or little psychical diseases and then commercial can be very dangerous.
People acting in a commercial mostly are quite beatiful and seem to look and live perfectly.
A child then could get offended and disencouraged because it sees what all could be like.
Here also a point against the argument below can be found.
Children actually live a very happy life because they don't have no worries yet.
This can be seen for example when a child meets new people, they're not shy and directly go talking to them if they are sypathic to the child.
Or also a child doesn't worry about what to say or what to keep for itself, it speaks out loud what it thinks.
It's not important for them how someone else looks like, they don't care, they just want to play around and have fun.
Although we have the same amount of pro and contras I disagree with the statement that television advertisings toward children should be prohibited.
While contemplating the arguments for and against the statement, to me it appears that the contras are way stronger than the pros.
To give a full accurate opinion about whether I support or refuse the statement given I would have needed to know what the intention was to say that commercial toward children should be forbidden.
I think that it is not harming or causing damage in any way the only thing I can think of is that it should not be allowed because it makes children sitting longer in front of a TV set because there are always commercial breaks interuppting what the child really would have wanted to watch.
Nowadays lots of people watch television.
There are different age groupes of people such as young children, teenagers, adults or even old people who sit in front of the TV at least once a day.
The one thing everyone hates are advertisements which interrupt our series in the most interesting part.
There are different types of advertisements but is that a problem for the younger generation?
does it have an affect to youg children?
Television advertising takes a lot of time when you are watching TV and most of the time these are harmeless to us, but is it the same for young children?
Young children watch TV more and more.
This is a great chance to advertise some kind of game that the young children want to have.
This works actually really well because if the child sees it, it goes to his parents and asks them to buy it.
When they don't, they will cry until the game is bought.
But is this a problem for the child itself?
It depends what kind of game it is.
There are friendly games which makes children play together or make them learn something in a playfull way.
In that case I dont think that it is a problem to advertise because it takes the child to play with others or to learn new stuff.
In another case where games are brutal or lead to violence, I think it shouldn't be allowed because this could lead to an aggressive child in the feature.
In the end, my opinion to ''television advertising toward young children'' is that if the advertisement advertises something fun or intelligent where young children can learn something or learn to play with a group it should be allowed.
But if the advertisment has content of something brutal or violent , content where it's obvious that there is brutallity in it, it shouldn't be allowed, because I think it has a small influence to the little child in the future.
Advertising in television has become more common over the past years, especially toward young children.
Children, just like adults, are prone to believe the advertisements and can be heavily influenced by them.
Advertisiting induces our western cosumerism into these little minds, securing the market for the future.
Does it make sense to ban television advertising?
Little children shouldn't be exposed to excessive advertising, they shouldn't even be exposed to any type of media, including the television itself.
The question is, whether or not the parents should control what their toddlers are watching, to protect them from advertising and from excessive media consumption.
In the end, it is the parents job to control what their kid gets to see and what is hidden.
The law cannot interfere too much with something that should be each parents own choice.
Children should learn from a young age, that real life is more valuable than spending time staring at little electronic gadgets, they should be taught that we must be free form the media, free to buy the things we really want, and to not let the media brainwash us.
Onlythen can a child become a good inhabitant of this planet, respecting the environment and overcoming the egoistic nature of the human being.
However, if television advertising were banned for young children, parents would have a much easier time raising thir offspring.
No more crying over barbie dolls or lego castles, the children wouldn't even know these things, they wouldn't have marterialistic wishes.
The companies would even save a lot of money, and if they really wanted to, they could target the children in other places, they could donate some toys to kindergardens, and targeting the children in other ways.
In conclusion, I believe that excessive media and advertisement consumption is harmful, not just for young children, but also for adults.
However, I can understand that some parents enjoy some time off their parental duties when their child is watching tv.
After all, not all tv shows are bad, some of them even have an educational or social purpose.
I don't think that it is right for the government and the law to interfere in things that are clearly every parents own choice.
In television often is advertising towards young children.
Many people aren`t the same meaning about this topic.
It can have positive and negative sites, but which is stronger?
On the plus side is that young children are amused.
They like seeing these spots because they are diriectly for them.
If there are  lions or  rabbits in this clip then most of children like tho see these.
They can be just like a short film for them and notan advertising.
Behind these television advertisings are creative people which tries to make the most funniest and cutest film for children.
But one of the biggest cons is that they don`t havetheir one money.
The advertising is only used to make the children ask their perents to buy something.
They see something in television and they want to have it but they need their parents.
The spot should be directed toward the parents who have to buy it.
Advertising toward childrean is unfair they don`t have the abbility to put this in a normal context.
Most of them don`t understand that their parents can`t buy them all things from these TV spots.
The children should learn to be play with that what they have.
But this advertising could also be useful.
It`s good for collecting new ideas for christmas presents and also for other plays towards children.
In this age the parents of them mostly chose what their children have and what they don`t have.
Good is also that when the young children are loking a film toward children the advertising between is also for children.
When the advertising contains stuff for other ages it could be boring or disturbing for young child.
In my oppinion should be allowed because of children like these and it`s a good donator of ideas for parents.
Thats also the reason why I think that the advertising should be more directed toward the parents, they chose what they buy.
This would be in my oppinion also more fair.
I see the point of the statement.
I think in the age of two to five young children don't have the ability to decide on their own what they need in their life.
So the kids don't see what is really behind the advertising.
They don't see that most of the products costs a lot of money and they don't know that you have to work really hard to get  lot of money.
So as a result, the children don't take care to the stuff and break them because they take them for granted.
Another point is that it takes also a lot influence of the child.
As soon as they see a good tool in the advertising they want it.
Those high needs are for parents a big pressure because they want to give the childrens only the best stuff but they can't do it all the time.
But I have to say that I also see the other side of the statement.
There are many brands which are making products only for children.
I think if it's forbidden to do television advertising most brands don't get enough money because there are less consumer.
A second point is that every brand should have the same rights.
It shouldn't matter if the brand are selling products for young children or adults.
My opinion is that you have to find a good balance.
I agree that the children take the stuff for granted and they should learn that the playtools costs a lot of money.
But that the whole television advertising isn't allowed anymore is in my opinion an overreaction.
Those brands have to life of something and it wouldn't be fair if they have other rights than other companys.
I think also that the parents can look that the child don't watch tv.
So they don't have to be afraid anymore of unrealistic needs.
All parents should rule it on their own.
They are responsible for their own kids.
Young children are supposed to do something, because they want to learn new things and if you don`t have the time to play with your children it`s very helpful to let them wathing television.
They learn new things like counting or learning colours.
And it is a really good change to see a film an after play a game, ... 

On the other side for young children it is not good to see too much television, because it is better if they play with real friends, because they talk together which they don`t do by seeing television.
And they are in a real life not only in a virtual life.
It is also better to play something outdoor with other people, because the fresh air outdoors is really good and it makes your head free of stuff.
And if they are too long in front of the television they become stupid, because it isn`t very helpful to sit on the floor and watch and listen therewhile for a long time.
I remember when my parents said me: "If you watch a too long time television your eyes become four ecked."
I`m not for or against it, because on my opinion it is not good to see too much television, because you need some fresh air and talking and playing with friends otherwhise you loose touch with your friends.
But it is also helpful to watch a bit television, because they learn new things.
And they are occupated.
They are not annoyed.
The television programm is most always interesting.
But all in all iI think it should be allowed.
If you don`t want that your children watch television you can switch off your TV or you can simply don`t by a television.
Advertising in general is a very controversial topic.
Advertising directed toward children brings the controversy to a whole new level.
While some people state that in the end the parents can decide if little Sarah gets her seventh Barbie doll, it is very often the case that (little) children are begging their parents for (useless) stuff and the parents are going to give in because they can't bear their children screaming at them and being unhappy.
Nevertheless the topic is a hot one and there is no 100% right and wrong.
Companys produce products.
Some companys produce products for children, toys for example.
People who are "pro-advertising" that without advertising those products won't sell themselves on their own.
Most television channels contain ads.
They need the money that is coming from the ad revenues.
Many children watch television.
So why not advertise a product for children on a medium that is consumed by children.
It all makes sense.
If parents don't want their children being seduced by television advertising than they should not let them watch television.
Why regulate it?
As I previously mentioned, in the end the parents decide what to buy and what not.
On the other hand the people who are "anti-advertising" state that ads directed towards young children should be abolished because they make use of the fact that (young) children lack the intellect to understand that the happy voice coming out of the telly is not like a friend who only wants their best (in this case to show them what are the coolest toys) for them.
Childrem don't understand that the advertisments and the company behind it simply want the money out of the pocket of their parents.
It is also very unfair because many parents sometimes want their children to be happy and - much more often - to be quiet and not screaming.
It often happens that parents buy their children (useless) stuff with the sole purpose that the begging for more toys would hopefully stop.
But the demand for toys doesn't stop.
It is created by the advertisements.
Therefore some people say that TV ads directed towards young children should be abolished.
Parents have much more important things to do than stopping their kids from begging for (useless) stuff, for example educating them & making sure that those tiny 

All in all I don't think that TV ads targeting children should be abolished.
There is a swiss pop-cultural quote "Jede chann mache was er will, will jede staht dezue was er seit.
"(Everyone should be able to do what he wants, because everyone stands for what he sais.)
I think this quote fits this topic.
If one doesn't want one's children poisoned by the venomous spell of TV ads then one simply shouldn't let one's children watch TV.
Amen.
In our society there are advertisements everywhere.
If you watch a show on the television every fifteen minutes comes another break where you have to go through many suggestions what you should buy.
There are also some advertisements which are directed toward children.
There comes the question: Should advertising toward children be allowed or not?
When children see a new product while watching television they want to have it.
Often it's something to eat, a new kind of sweets or a special toy to play with.
In such a situation the parents have to argue with her child weather they are going to buy the product or not.
The child can have two sorts of reactions: It can start crying and shouting and getting on the parents's nervs, just because of the product that was directetd to him.
In this case the parents feel bad to say no to their child and make it angry and sad.
But the child could also accept the decission and react normal.
That's not happening very often, because children can't really understand whats right for them, and that their parents make decissions for the childs best.
An other Point is, that a company who makes toys for children doesn't have much other chances to get their products selled.
If they don't make it attractive for children, there isn't a big chance that the parents are going to by it on their own.
I think the advertising towar children is a difficult theme.
In my opinion, it's a mean trick if you try to sell a product in directing it toward young children because they can't decide what they really need yet.
Children just want to have everything, especially when it looks good on television and other kids like to eat it or have fun to play with it.
A good advertisement would be something that attracs the parents too, because they should be alright with the thing their child eats and plays with.
If the parents like the product they are also going to buy it.
So in my opinion you shouldn't direct advertisements toward young children, but you sould make the parents want to buy it for their children instead.
If you turn the tv on, you will see commericals after commericals.
They seduct you to buy a product, that most probely istn't even something you really need.
But we as young adults know that the things they promise us aren't neccessarly the truth.
But what happens when we confront young children form the age of two to five with those television advertises?
For parents those commericals can turn into lots of argument with their child when they're out  goinig shopping.
For example when a child sees a toy, which had been in a commercial on tv he will beg for it next time he's in the store with his parents and often they cry until he gets his way.
It make the life of parents a lot harder especially when the parents are struggling with money.
A reason tho allow televison advertising directed toward young children is, that they will be confornted with it sooner or later no matter what.
It's important to learn to know what you need and what simply is just luxuary to have.
It should make you think about how bad you want it.
And what's truly worth spending money on.
My opinon on this 
We're living in the 21 centuary.
Technology is everywhere and so are commercials.
That's just a natrual result of it and we humans have to accept it.
We have to show children that all of it.
This is a part of living in this generation.
Building a shell isn't going to help them in the futur, because when they're older it would be even harder to teach them not to fall for every televison advertising.
It's better to teach them when they're young.
Its saturday morning.
The TV is turned on and Dora the explorer is playing.
After ten minutes there is a pause in the show where advertisments are seen.
But not advertisment for a skin care cream or a perfume.
It is an advertisment for toys for young children.
Should this be allowed?
Advertisments are shown to stimulate the customer to buy a product.
For that the customer must own money.
A child does not conciously own moneyto spend.
This makes the whole point of the advertisment useless.
The problem it might cause is for the parents.
The child might want to own the toy and will constantly beg the parents to buy the toy.
Young children might be more susceptible to advertisments than adults because they will not ask themselves the question if they need the product or not which could later on continue to make them an easy pray for as seen on tv products.
The advertisments might be directed toward children of such a young age but indirectly be for the parents.
At christmas it might be a good thing because if the childless uncle doesn't know what to get his nefeu he can simplly watch TV and be inspired.
In my opinion it is useless to show advertisments for young children because they cannot buy the product which makes the advertisment a waste of time and money.
If the advertisment were to encourage children to go outside and play it might change my opinion.
In my opinion the television advertising is a probelm for many TV-watchers and especially bad for teenagers or childrens.
Young children are very influental and don`t understand the target of the advertising.
I think young children should learn important and useful things and not be used to earn money.
But it`s impossible to forbid the advertising, because the TV companies need the advertising to earn money.
It`s also impossible for the TV company to control who is watching their programs.
I think the parents of the children have to have an eye on their children and what they are watching.
The parents should be more interessed in what their children do in their freetime.
I think there should be some TV chanels for young children without advertising, because very young people are too influental.
The products placements are very complex and try the customer to buy a product.
Young childrens are also used for this reason.
Certainly they couldn`t buy the things they want by them selfe, but the make their parents to spend money for it.
The children may only realise how they were influentet years later, when they are adults or have their own children.
In my opinion we have to find a way, which is okay for the TV companies, the parents and the children.
But it`s clear everyone have to work.
It has become a common thing that you have to watch advertisment throughout the day, if you want to consum modern media.
For the television ads have and will always be the best way for the channels to fund themselves.
In such situations I for myself prefer to watch ads wich aims at my peer.
Therefore I do not mind watching an adverstisment for a game rather than baby diapers.
On the other hand I will have to ask myself from where the companys know which age class I belong to.
It is the question of neutrality.
Of course it is easy for the companies to find out which age I am.
They got my name, I got facebook.
Although I doupt that they have to use social media for that.
If I had to guess I would say, that they know that kind of stuff from accounts which I have to login in order to use the television properly.
Never the less it doesent matter how they get the information they want.
As a matter of fact they got it and there is nothing I can do about it.
So why bother asking if it is good to be advertised with ads which live up to my expectations of entertainment?
Because it is not only a question of neutrality but also what adverstising makes with me.
Even without me noticing it.
For people of young age it is important what other people think of them, wo they are easily convinced to follow a new trend.
Stereotypes are formed by the advertisment Industrie.
So if I, as a youth, get to hear and see the same stuff more and more, with more precision, convincing me to buy or do something I am a easy victim.
So if the companys dont want to sell goods but a thought or political adverstisment it is queit disturping, being the aim of a well organised and proffesional campain.
All in all It would not be like that if the advertisment would be if waider spread.
In the end watching ads for a lipstick will never be as entertaining as watching a good movie trailer.
But at least I can be convieniend, that I am nor beeing mind washed.
Television avertising isn't only a huge business it's also an often discussed topic with really really different opinions.
Advertising for cigarettes or alcohol aren't the only critical ones.Those spots which are directed towards children are also well discussed.
But are children a good victim eventhough they can't buy these things for themselves.
Clear is that children are fascinated from the television and that they love to spend a lot of time in front of it.
Parents know that, and advertising companies are aware of this too.
Because of this they adress their advertising exactly to the children.
They use a lot of colors, a nice design and lots of good sounding words.
And exactly this is a problem with these advertising spots, childern only see the positive side of the products and they can't think about consequences or if they really need this product.
They just see the advertising and they want it.
They also aren't able to differantiate advertising from the reality.
Because of this they may think someting is healty or useful even it's not.
On the other hand it's clear that they can't just go and buy the product they saw in the advertising.
It's necessary to ask the parents or someone else to buy it because children aged two to five normally don't own any money.
For the parents it may be annoying if their children come everyday and ask for something they saw in the advertising.
But that's not a reason to ban these television spots.
As a parent you have to say 'no' to your child a lot.
And only because you're annoyed of something you can't just ban it.
Your child will always see thing which it doesn't have and wants it now.
Independant of television advertising there will be arguments about stuff they want but don't get it.
Additionnally advertising is a huge business and it'll always be a big business, with or without children advertising.
All in all I think it's silly to ban television advertising directed to children.
It's normal to argue with your child about things they don't have and if you can't say no to something your child wants because it has seen an advertising you really need to think about your parenting.
Advertising is business and that's the way it is.
Additionally if your child learns early to be critical against advertising and that sometimes you have to accept a 'no' it'll go stronger through its life.
And at the end you can't always keep everthing away from your child and you can't always ban things you don't like or things which annoy you.
Television nowdays is full of advertising and it isn't something special if you have full 10 minutes of dumb short-films.
But these little short-films dont influence young children.
And if you raise your child the right way they wont just sit in front of the Tv because they will use their ability to think about new activities to spend the time outside.
Since young children dont understand the advertisement until they are three they are harmless for them.
If a child is three to five years old he understands the advertisement but they do not realise  that they are influenced by the media but the other question is what should the advertisement do with the children?
These children can't buy anything because they are to young.
Another point of view is that you can't bann all the advertisements for young children because first of all the Tv-companies wont show anymore kids-series and how do you want to regulate who's a young children and who's a drunk student who wants to watch Sponge Bob.
The more important decision is why do my children have to watch Tv if they so young?
So young children should read a little book with their parents and not sit in front of the Tv.
These parents are just to exhausted to watch after their kids that is why they put them in front of the Tv.
The Tv is a Nanny for times when you don't want to interact with your children but this is a wrong method.
If you don't want to be interrupted by your child you have two solutions: a) don't make children and b) put them outside and let them fantasize about the world.
Children play alone if you just let them think about how they could spend the day.
Because children have enough imagination for other activities if you let them think and don't put them in front of the Tv where they lose their ability to think about a game.
You should not bann Television advertising directed toward young children.
There are two side to see it.
On the side that agrees with the statement, one of the arguments are that young children are also persons and the companies that want to advertise their products on the television are allowed to do it.
They say that there are some products that are specific for children and this is the easiest and the most efficient way to advertise them.
An example for this are toys and sweet food.
They are supposed to enjoy the children.
An second argument is that it's good for the economics.
They make a lot of money because parents doesn't want to rejects the wishes of their children and they're nearly forced to bey them.
What is more is that this children will grow up and from the age of ten they will watch television on their own.
So they will be confronted to advertisment at a later age.
There is also the contrary side to all this arguments.
They say that the children in this age don't realise that the advertisment in the television could be bad for them.
Children are innocent and aren't able to form their own opininon on this type of advertisment.
An other point is that children often sit near the television and they didn't decided this.
Their parents put them there to have them near to them selves to look after them.
Or sometimes parents just want the children to calm down and to stop crying or whatever.
The children are entertained and don't annoy the parents any more.
My own opinion is the last one.
I think that there is enough advertisment in the world that it hasn't to be also in the television when young children are watching the TV programation for children.
It's not fair.
I think children have to have a good childhood and enjoy what the already have.
They don't need to buy more toys and the sweet food is bad for their health.
The question if television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed is very recent.
More children are watching TV than ever before, so the industry tries to convience them to have their product.
A big part of this advertising are toys.
On the one side, in a free marked this advertising should be allowed, because the industry should be able to present their products.
On the other side children aged from two to five years are not able to decide what is good for them and what not.
So the industry trys to convience them what is good or what they need.
Parents often don't like this, because they want to decide what they want to buy them.
An argument to not disallow the advertising is that the channel has to make money from the advertising, because it is a very important way for them to make money in their buissines.
And if they are a channel designed for children, they have to accept this, because no company would show there advertising for adults.
Another problem is that advertising could get poor failys into trouble.
For example if the children is told that he must have a certain product and he thinks this is right, the parents get in trouble, because they can't afford it.
My opinion is that it should not be disallowed because we live in a free market and the TV channels will probalbly get in a financial trouble.
I agree that some advertising is very aggressive, but if the parents really worry about this, they should think about pay TV, where the channel is supported with the money from the subscription and not from the avertising.
Remeber you get nothing for free in your live.
The children should learn to play on it's own.
It could happen that they're going to be addicted to the television or other electronic things.
Some of them wouldn't be able to get rid of the addiciton.
Children might want to have the thing that is showed in the advertisment and when the don't get it, they're angry on the parents.
The Advertisment shows the kids what they could have and they only want more.
They should be happy with the things they have.
When a other kid has something of an advertisment and the other kid don't they may get bullied.
Watching television, especially advertisments, could be bad for the eyes.
The Advertisments could be good for the childre's creativity.
There fantasy would be better and bring the kids to new ideas.
They might recognize the advertisment or the sound of them, which helps the brain to remember things better.
I think that the children don't need to watch television advertisments because they won't be able to buy it.
When they're going to be addicted to something in this low age, they might be faster addicted to something else.
But I think that the television advertising don't have to be forbidden.
The parents should know if they want that their child watches the advertisments or not.
If they say it's ok than they should look that the time of watching television is limited.
Nowdays a lot of young children watch television.
There are many reasons why they do that.
I think it's often because the parents want to have free time or they want to entertain their children.
Instead of playing with them they let them watch a series on television.
And between their series or whatever they are watching a lot of advertisments come up.
They see all of the beautiful and fun toys on the screen and most likely want to have them too.
Is television advertising towards young children a good thing and should it even be allowed?
Firstly I think that young children are very easily influenced by things.
When they see advertisments for toys for example they probably want to buy them.
I think it's not a fair thing to show them something like that and they don't even know what's going on.
They just see the toy and think it looks cool and want to buy it.
Also the parents get into trouble with those advertisments.
Their children want to buy constantly new stuff because they see it on television and maybe also their friends got it.
It puts pressure on the parents to buy those things for their children.
On the other hand you have to question is it even something good to put their young child in front of a television?
I think when parents do something like this they have to be aware that their child will see those advertisments.
In my oppinion their are much worse things that children could see on the television than advertisments suchas guns or murder.
And I also think that young children aged to two five should not be put infront of a television.
But of course those advertisements are good for the stores.
They can sell their those even better because children get influenced quickly and the parents will most likely buy them.
And it's normal and important for the economy that they sell their products.
There are also advertisments for adults so I see no point not allowing to do some for children.
In my opinion television advertising towards young children should be allowed.
It's a normal thing that the media does and when they can do advertisments for grown ups they can also do it for children.
But I would give the parents the advice to take the children out of the house and away from the TV.
Playing with your children is much more efficient and better than the television and on top of that you will not have andy problems with advertisments.
I disagree, but I can understand why you could agree with it.
First of all you can influence children much easier and as a result they then want to have this product, but on the other hand they don't have any money to buy it.
So they have to go to their parents and ask them.
Their parents should be aware of manipulation and really think really sceptically about buying this product.
Because they lived their hole life with advertisment and its manipulation that they should know that they only try to manipulate you.
A small child isn't aware of this and the bigger it is the better.
There are some parents who can't handle this situation and want to forbid the advertisment toward young children.
But then we have an empty slot in the advertisment and they are going to fill this empty slot with a diffrent davertisment It is very difficult to make a restriction to prevent it, but the easiest way to prevent it is: not letting watch television or look at the newest catalogue about for exemple LEGO.
Of course you can't prevent your own child to look at a poster outside but you can take certein steps to minimalise it.
As a good parent, who can handle money, I don't think you're gonna have a big problem.
But to do all of this you have to be able to know about this problem  and you should not buy blind certein products for your child.
Please don't missunderstand me, I don't want to say you shouldn't buy any advertised product for your child but you have to think about that and decide by yourself.
Nowadays children often watch television instead of going outside.
This leads to some children seeing too many commercials.
It's not rare that children, after they've seen such a thing, go up to their parents and ask them to buy this certain thing for them.
But what if they wouldn't see the commercials?
Would the parents have less pressure of buying their children certain things?
On the one hand it's of course great for the product to direct their advertisement towards children, on the other hand they do make doubtful use of the childrens innocence and inexperience.
If someone tells a child that this nerf gun is great and it's the thing they've always wanted, then the child will believe this.
But what if it's true?
What if the child will have fun with the product?
Is it wrong to get the childrens parents to buy it?
Some people are sure it is.
Children should be able to choose what they want without getting influenced too much by advertisement.
However, some say that adults are also influenced a lot by advertisement so why should it be wrong to do the same with children.
Personnally, I think children should definitely not get to see as much advertisement as adults.
I guess it influences them too much in some ways.
If it was forbidden to direct television advertising towards young children, I think it would  also help the parents a lot.
Of course parents do have to say no sometimes, but it does no harm to prevent directing television advertising towards children.
Because despite the fun things you see on television some of the commercials do really have a bad influence.
My little cousin is three years old.
He is very activ and loves to be outside.
He always climbs on trees or plays on the playground.
He doesn't really care about television and electricitiy.
I think thats how little children should grow up.
They should go outside and play with other little kids and make their own experience with dirt and sand.
There is so much visual media in our world that young children shouldn't care about.
In their life it's the only time when they don't really realize whats important to the rest of the world.
Because in our time everybody is starring at his phone while watching youtube clips on the internet.
Three-years-old  live on their own little planet and there they shouldn't be hipnotisized by technology.
In my opinion its okay to watch a film with your kids but not everyday.
It must be something  extraordinary and special to watch TV.
Like my little cousin I adore to watch a movie saturday night.
Then we take some chocolates or biscuits with us and eat them to " Winnie the Pho " .
His eyes are always shining as bright as the sun he played to the whole day.
I think parents shouldnt forbit watching TV but they should controll it and take a limit.
They may watch together so they can make a family evening.
I think when more families would control the consumation  of TV , than it would become less important.
I think it's not a bad thing to produce films for young children but they should be beautiful and lovely.
I think advertising shouldn't be for young children because they don't really understand.
I think advertising for children products should be more for mothers or fathers.
Because they have to buy things for kids.
I think we cant forbid advertising toward children but we should minimize it.
And we shouldn't show bad advertising for adults in TV because we never know if children watch and thats why parents should controll the consumation of television time.
I think too many laws about everthing isn't good.
Because a law is only against the symptom.
It doesn't matter what it is, i'am not a friend of laws.
In fact i'am an anarchist.
A world without laws and borders is my dream.
I think you have to chose if you want that your children watching television or not.
But whith a law nothing is natural yet.
It is only a preasure.
So the princip is simple.
If you and only you or your husband/wife think it isn't good for our children watching tv, you can forbid.
And it is more senseful if you make a campaign against the children watching tv.
You should give options to the children like playing in nature and playing sport.
And it is also important how long the chlildren watching tv.
Cause of watching tv isn't always bad.
The children can also leaning a lot if they looking science magazines or the breaking news.
Also and important point is that if it isn't allowed yet, most of the children would still watching tv.
Cause of who will control, that they aren't watching tv?
It isn't possible.
So i think at finish it is also a question of the mass, like in thousand different other things in life.
The question if children should be allowed to watch television and if so, how much, is wiedly discussed.
Many parents are concerned that television is not good for their chldren.
A large concern is advertising, that is directed at young children between the ages two and five.
This type of advertisement has become more popular over the past few years and is usually streamed on channels that show cartoons for children.
This type of advertising should not be allowed, because it is harmful for the children and their development.
First of all, advertising is a way of manipulation.
Especially children can be manipulated very quickly.
Advertising supports our consumer society and shows these young children things they want, but don't really need, at a very young age already.
Although children do not have the money to buy the products they see on television themselves, they will want their parents to buy it for them and be jealoous of their friends who have it.
Children are not able to recognize what they really need and what they already have at that age.
Parents often report of having toys that are never played with at their house.
Furthermore, children should not watch so much television in general.
Since advertisemnet can be adicting to watch, it will make the children want to watch television more, than doing something else.
This could be harmful for their development, as it is proven, that watching television slows the thought process of the brain.
For example, a studay has proven, that teenagers who watched a lot of television at a young age, now have a lower IQ than those who didn't.
Therefore, it is important to encourage children to do something else than watching T.V.
Watching too much television is not good for anyone.
Especially children are in danger of harming their development by watching television excessivley.
I think, that it is manipulative for companies to direct there advertisemnt towards young children, just because it is easier to convince them.
Children should watch less television in general and rather go outside or play a board game, as this can improve their mental and physical abilities.
Television itself is adicting enough for young children, so advertisements directed at this age group should not be allowed at all.
In my opinion watching tv should be limitted, no matter if its advertising or a normal tv show.
I think television has a bad influence on people, mostly little kids.
Adults or teenager can handle the "pressure" of the television, they aren't that naiv, they don't believe anything.
But young children have to grow up, have to create an own personality and I think then its possible that the tv affects those people not in a positive way.
We have to think about the way of television advertising, if a business want to support a special car, I think it doesn't have to be disallowed.
But if this car is driving too fast, because the owner want to say that its ordinary fast, it shows young children a wrong view.
You can look at this topic on a other view.
Television advertising doesn't have to be disallowed because maybe young children could watch them.
There its the responsibility of the own partents to look, that their kids don't watch those things.
But in a chanell for young children, for example "kika" or "superrtl" it shouldn't be allowed.
First because this is a channel for young kids and there shouldn't be advertising.
For example if they promote a little rabbit who can speak and they want that the kids buy it, I don't think thats great.
Then most of the children go to their parents and say "oh, i want this..and this.." and so on.
And a other reason I think it shouldn't be allowed is, those young children want to watch there favourite Show and they don't want to see advertising.
They are little and if you say to your children, advertising is necessary they woulnd't understand why.
At the end I have to say, I don't think a young girl, aged two, mostly don't understands this advertising.
Maybe her parents allow to watch this special serie, because its okay to watch it, and then she sees promotin of a serie which you should only watch if you are like ten.
When i'm honest, those kids shouldn't watch tv at all.
When kids are that young, they want to do so much more than just watching tv.
You can go out with them, play with them outside.
I think they will love it more than watching tv.
Because no matter if youre old or young, spend time witch people you love, do things with them, is one of the best and most important things you can do.
Those kids have a lifetime to watch tv, to do boring things on the couch, but now they are growing up, they want to experience new things.
If they are like ten, okey, sometimes they can watch tv but not always.
Maybe I think like that, because my parents doesn't allowed me to watch that much tv.
And now I have to say, I don't watch that much tv, I just don't need it.
I want to spend my free time with friends, with pets I love, I just have no time to watch tv at all.
A young child get up in the morning.
Out of bed, down stairs, in front of the television for watching his favourite programm.
A situation that is very often today but what influence had television and all these followed things that television brings?
Often you hear the children don`t go out and play with other children or have a hobby for exemple foot ball.
The children become over wight and healthy problems but are those things the most problematic things?
Things like advertising are forget very often.
And very important are there also positive things for advertising in those young age?
An argument pro advertising is surely, that when children don`t learn how to use advertising in young age, the never learn what they have to do in older age.
With maybe ten years suddenly all TV programs are full of advertising, now the problem are with ten age the same with two.
And when you had no advertising in TV whats about advertising in the internet in the towns and citiies, our society are full of advertising and you can`t protect young children.
We are from our first they in this influence so there is no reason for no advertising on TV.
But these argument could look on from the other side.
Yes, our society is always in influence of advertising but you shouldn`t do extra advertising for xoung children when you have the possibility to do it different.
A big problem is also the topics of the advertising, often they are unhealthy things.
The television is a very good platform for advertising our society life very unhealthy why not to use television for healthy food or somethin like that.
I think, you can`t do anything, that a lot of children watch TV, that is in influence of the parents and you aren`t in influence that they weren`t advertising on Television because the big concerns had a lot of influence, but if they were possibility to say to the concern for other advertising for healthy food or something like that I think advertising is a goog way to chance our overwight society in the future because you have to chance something the quastion is just how?
I think children shouldn't get used to our world full of advertises that young.
I think it manipulates their opinion on different things.
In that age you start to develope your own creativity.
It would be bad to show them things better than they are, because that way they want a product and when they get it they notice that it's way less fun than they thought it would be.
I think it would be more difficult for them to develope their creativity and dreams if they were manipulated by advertises.
Another point is that your childhood is the most beautiful time in your life and it shouldn't be disturbed by annoying advertises on the TV, that's not enjoyable.
All things considered I think there shouldn't be advertising toward young children.
But to be honest I think kids that age shouldn't spend too much time on the TV at all.
I think that advertisements in general are nothing that should be prohibited in general.
Every company should be allowed to make advertisements, wherever they want to.
It may be true that children at that age are very easy to trick into thinking they want something even though they don't have an use for it.
One could say, that it's unfair in general to 'use' someone for your own interest, especially children who aren't as suspicious as grown men and women and still believe (almost) everything they hear.
Especially on tv which most small children have access to.
On the other side, who should the company address its advertisemments to, if not to the group of people the product is destined for?
Who would make an advertisement about princess dolls addressing a 50 year old man?
And, since the statement talks about television advertising specifically, one could argue that it is the parents' duty to watch over their children and decide whether they are allowed or forbidden to watch tv by themselves.
In the end, the parents should teach their children from early on, that they can't have everything they want to.
The parents are at all times the ones to decide for their children.
Personally I think that it is totally okay to put advertisements for children on tv.
Parents know that they are responsible for their own children and should have to put up with the difficulties that being a parent brings with itself.
Mostly I think that one can never direct their responsibilities to anyone else.
So the ones to blame aren't the advertising companies but the parents that can't raise their children properly.
I think letting young people (aged two to five) watching TV won't bring huge problmes within, if you let them see stuff made for their age.
That means that parents have to know what their children watch and when series are on the TV specially produced for childrens learning.
From 6 AM to 12Am are channels like bbc full of learning series like laura the explorer and others, while at 8PM films with violent scenes are on which can cause sleeping problems by little children.
So good parenting means letting your child watch TV when something approached is on and at specific times not all they long bacause children should still make use of their own fantasie and play games with their mates.
In my opinion watching TV for a long time will make you lazy to do activities made up on your own, so in younger years it's a huge danger because what you learned once you won't forget easily.
After all I can't really take a black or white opinion on this statement because watching TV can be good for children when you give it to them in a responsible dosis, and it can be worse than bad if you let them watch all day long.
Finally i think it's difficult to not allow television advertising directed toward young children because how do you wanna control if someone let them watch,and when we think of the fact that some parents will let them watch and some don't we have an other problem that children aren't treated ecually what causes disappointment and fights between childrens and their parents.Further the new technology brings up mobile phones on which children can watch youtubevideos or do online games all day long, I'd say that's a bigger problem, which should be discussed.
nowadays we live in a modern world with a lot of thecnology and in this society there are a lot of different opinions about how usefull for example a handy, a computer or a television is.
Is it good or is it bad?
what are the advantages and the disadvantages?
and a very important question, what about the children?
we fokus now on the television advertising and if it should be or not should be allowed for children.
One agrument which you can use that it should be allowed is, that the children maybe learn something about what they see, or that they learn the language better when they hear the voices on the TV.
Another one can be that when for example the governement says its not allowed, the people who made advertising have to rethink their whole strategie and this costs.
I also think that it`s not something you can go and watch if the parents are doing it right.
But one argument we can use as an agree-argument is, that it is harmful for the children to watch TV, they better should go outside and play with their freinds.
its not healthy, it can malke the children fat or in the worst case dumb.
the children don`t use their personal imagination as they do it when thy read a book for example.
i also think that at the age of two to five the brain developes really fast and its important in that period of time, that the children learn a lot from their parents or from the things which they experience and not from silly advertising which are not usefull in their future life.
in conclusion on the right hand side i would say that it would be better if its not allowed for children at that young age but on the other side i think it`s impossible to make this happened because every family is responsible for their own child.
But i would agree with this state.
An argument for agreeing with the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
is, that advertising can realy affect a aduldt person and children even more.
Children who watch TV and always see the advertisement for toys and other stuff they like will probably ask their parents to buy them these.
Because of the bunch of advertisement, there are so many toys they want and maybe their parents can`t afford them all because they do not have enough money for it.
These children will then probably be sad becaus others maybe got these toys and they didn`t.
An argument against the statement is, that we live in a world, where economics are part of our daily life and one usually works for more money.
Companies that produce toys and other stuff for kids achieve this by doing television advertising to sell more of their products.
It is the custumers choice wether they buy the product or not.
It is also the companies right, to search new customers to earn more money and by doing so, create new working places.
I personally do not think, that one should forbid television advertising directed toward children.
One should find a compromise in between both.
The advertising shouldn`t be as long as it is nowadys, but it shouln`t be completely forbidden.
Still, there are some customers, that find new products in TV advertising and are happy about having seen them to buy for their children.
Also the companies that sell these products will be pleased to get new customers who buy their stuff.
So with a compromise both parties will probably be happy and get what they want.
I guess this topic is a very popular one to talk about right now.
Television advertising just like many other kinds of advertising are mostly very controverial.
They can beeinflussen kids in a lot of ways sometimes more that parents do.
Advertisings are especially known for dividing gender.
Children, especially from two to five, are still learing things so they belive everything they see and hear.
If they see advertisings in which little girls only play with dolls and babies they are more likely to belive that real life is like that as well.
They start to internalize everything.
Some gender scientisty belived that if kids wouldn't see such advertisings they wouldn't pick their ''specific'' toys.
Boys would also pick Barbies and girls would maybe pick Cars at the Store.
Toys are beeinflussen kids so bad that they start beliving that women need to stay at home and take care of the baby while men have to go out, work and be mechanics.
A lot of people don't even come up with the idea that something so normal in our society could in a way change the thaughts of kids.
Others think it is even better to let kids see those kind of advertisings so they know how it is going to be in life later.
They belive in gender roles and that diffrences between male and female have to be how they are now.
A very good example for how advertising teaches kids how to be are the colours pink and blue.
Before televison existed, colours like pink and blue were not identified with gender.
Children were wearing all kind of colours without thinking about it.
Nowdays boys would never wear colours like pink already at the age of three.
My opinion is clearly that advertising in general should not be how it is now.
It should'nt show any diffrences between women and men especially not with kids.
I hope that it will change in the future.
Avertisement is all around us.
On our way to the bus stop huge banners can be seen, online ads on websites and most likely of all, on tv.
I grew up during a "boom" of television advertisement and I can still remember a few jingles from popular advertisements.
The questions is whether or not advertising directed toward children of the age of two to five should be banned.
Is it suitable to assume that children of the young age of two to five can even realise what an advertisement actually does?
Advertisements want to sell a product.
The marketing department of huge industries is behind that; they want to make profit.
Their idea is to make their advertisements most attractive for young children, because they are most "vulnerable".
The indusry reaches its goal by making advertisements with bright colours and funny creatures to appeal to the children.
So the little, innocent children go to their parents and ask them to buy it for them.
And who can say no to a little kid?
The children get exploited by the industry, its influence is enormous.
Nowadays a lot of young children already have a smartphone and they can access the internet or play games on it.
Therefore I think that a lot children don't watch tv as intensively anymore than my generation did in our youth.
In my opinion children should watch tv channels, for example KiKa, which is a channel specifically for children and without any advertisements.
I can say that I learnt a lot by watching tv.
Nowadays there is often even more advertising than actual broadcasting on tv.
So there is a lot of waiting for the actual tv program you want to watch.
I think that this time shouldn't be wasted by advertisement.
You should rather go out and play than stick to the tv to watch advertisements.
But in the end it comes down to the parents decision whether they want their children to watch a lot of tv or rather go outside and have a good time.
do they get it that young age?
influence?
waste of time ad

Opinion learning fun
Television advertising toward children; dangerous or good?
Kids see everywhere advertisement, on many walls in the city there are posters, in the tram, train, bus; everywhere you can see
advertisement.
But the problem of television advertising is that some of them are directed toward very young children.
So the business which made the advertisement knows that they use the children for theyre own goods, for the economy.
But is this theyre right to make that?
An example is Migros Mania, altought this isn`t television advertising, its a advertisement toward children.
The children want to have those Manias and tell theyre parents that they should go to Migros and buy some stuff.
So for sure Migros doesn`t want to make 
the children happy like they pretend to do, know they just want more customers and want to rise theyre profit.
But when you see it in the eyes of the economy you have to say that its very important to make that much advertisement.
Otherwise Switzerlands economy wouldn`t work.
It`s also important that the young children can handle these situations and that they get known with advertising.
Its really naive to say advertising should not be allowed.
Because then is the question how you want to get this through??
Who decides which television advertising should not be allowed?
And it would be very dangerous for the economy, we would lost much money!
So know I have shown you to sides how you can look at this statement.
But in the end I want to explain my own opinion.
It makes me really angry when I watch television and I see like advertising for red nike shoes for children aged five!
This is a big 
problem of capitalism.
The big companys like Nike, Apple, Addidas ... and more, use everybody expecially the kids and the youth!!
What should a Kid think when all of his friend have red Nike shoes and the television advertising says in other words "you should wear those shoes otherwise youre not as cool as the others".
Children have to be protected from the capitalism!
They shouldnt be used as "models" for red Nike shoes!
Television advertising is everywhere.
In my opinion, you don't only focus on kids but also on adults and it influences all of us even though we don't realise that.
It's not only in the TV that we get connected with these things, but also in magazines, commercials and in the malls.
However, how can you stop that?
I believe that television advertising for young children may be a little bit dangerous because in some cases, kids want that cool, pretty toy like in the TV.
But I think in the older ages, it's more dangerous when you get connected with the society and seeing your friend with better and cooler things.
I know a lot of parents who don't let their kids watch TV until the age of 6, so the children don't have to deal with these things early.
But is it also better to have to deal with it up to the age of 6 or 9?
I remembered that I was that kind of child, that always stood up early in the morning and watched some cartoons.
They had a lot of commercial and television advertising and maybe I wanted a lot of those things.
But it's in the hands of your parents.
If they don't treat you in the right way and aren't stubborn about not buying you all toys that you would like to get or only buying you those things if it's christmas or your birthday, then kids in the age of two until five will learn that.
My parents did a well done job in that case.
I agree that television advertising may have the effect, that some parents don't want to hurt their on children and buy them those things.
But on the other hand, I disagree that it shouldn't be allowed.
It also may help other people to see new stuff that the fabrics have produced and get some ideas for gifts.
It's not that toys are bad and kids shouldn't get connected with them.
So in my view of point, you should allow all kind of television advertising or non at all (also not for the adults).
Parents have the most source of power for the kids in that age.
They have to teach their kids if it's true or not, if it's good or bad.
And I think there are also some good television advertising.
It really depends, for example, what does the advertisement wants to show?
It's obvious that if they show inappropriate content for children, it's no good.
But the statement is "directed toward young children", so clearly, they are going to show them appropriate content.
Whether it is a movie trailer for children, or a product advertisement for children.
It doesn't matter, as long as it's safe for the children to watch the advertisement and not giving them some weird advertisement, which then gives the children the urge of trying it out, it's all good.
In the end, the parents get to decide whether the children get to watch some television or not.
I mean, some parents don't even care what their children watch, so how are you supposed to forbid something which you can't even control.
Yes, you could add a password to the television, but in the end, that's going to end up being a pain the neck.
Usually children under the age of 4 cannot comprehend what they're watching, they can only stare at the screen and watch the pretty pictures.
I'm not saying that children are stupid, no, but if an advertisement has text in it, they will not be able to read it.
And what does advertisement want to succeed?
Usually the products they sell aren't even allowed for children under the age of 4.
Then again if it's a movie it would make sense.
But you don't take a child to the cinemas under the age of 4.
As I said before, they don't understand what's going on.
You can show them a video of a dog running around for hours, and they would not get tired of it.
Now that I listed all my "points", I came to a conclusion.
I disagree with this statement.
There's no point in forbidding something they can't control.
So why would you forbid this?
This idea of forbidding the advertisement toward young children is pure garbage, in my opinion.
Yes, we shouldn't allow young children watching television advertising because there are advertises,which are brutal or the children couldn't understand their real meaning so they understand it in another sense or they just see the objects without the real meaning of this advertise.
So for example if their is a advertise where there are ghosts in a dark room advertising for a parfum, they couldn't think off the parfum and just see the ghosts.
They can't see the real sense off this advertise so they get scared and just remember the gosts.
In another case if they get shocked it can negativly influence the brain, because if you have a shocking moment as a child you will remeber it your whole life.
Otherwhise you can let them watch the advertises.
This are all normal advertises, because if it's scary or not for children it will appear a sign which says that the following film is not for younger children, so until that point they couldn't send brutal scences.
In some adverises you can learn things or they will get creativ if they see this things when they are young.
In my opinion you can let them watch the advertises, if it's a childrens television programme.
It is really important that if there will appear a brutal,scared or strange advertise the parents should turn off the television or explain the scene to their children.
In the end its the choice off every parents.
Some people say that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
That opinion on advertisments is not that strange because advertisements encourage people to buy things and if a little kid sees something really cool on the tv it might run to its mother or its fahter and tell them to buy it.
That is really common way to gain customers.
At one side it is kind of mean using children for getting a product bought.
Children don't know that advertisments want us to buy things and aren't really that cool than in the advertisememts.
They see all these nice things the product can do and then thay want that product.
But isn't it the same with adults?
Adults are might seeing other advertisements on tv but they they get to want products the same as little children.
In fact we have to  ask ourselves why a five year old children would watch that much tv that they see some advertisement of a product they want?It is not good for children to send so much time inside watching television.
Children should go outside and play with other children, make friends and have fun on a playground.
Moreover it is a bit suspious that advertisement for older children or adults are apparently so horrible, that they totally distract little children and give them nightmares, so you have to make advertisement for little children.
If it is really like this than older children or might even adults shouldn't watch them as well.
In my opinion I can't see a problem in making advertisements for little children, but I can in fact see a problem in parents who let their children watch tv all day.Altough I have to say that I don't think it ist really okay to gain customers on this way.
For me it is a problem in the moral.
In TV you find all five minutes some annoying ads.
Unfortunaly do those ads know which kind of groups in our soiciety should realize, that they are meant.
Also young children.
It's normal for kids, that they watch TV and charming advertising.
But I think, because of these ads, kids can get some bad influence.
The children get the feeling that they have to buy that product even though they don't have the money.
There are situations where some kids start to steal the money from their parents.
The producers of those ads know how to provocate a meanful thought where the people think, they need it.
Ads are very manipulating and do have a strong, hidden message.
The worst thing is, that there are ads, for example about video games which have violent scenes and death delicts which could cause psychological damage.
Even though, I disagree with the statement, that televisions advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I think, that kids should watch TV and also those ads.
If they don't watch them now, they'll never learn how to bend the feeling to buy these products which are shown in the advertisment.
The later they would watch TV and ads, the less they know how to handle the necessities.
And while you get older, the more rights and possibilities you get.
As a young kid you are not allowed to buy expensive products.
But as a 18-aged person you can buy whatever you want, as long as it's legal.
After all the parents do still have the decision, what to buy for or to allow their kids until they're 18.
I don't really agree one hundred percent with the statement, because it won't really work to not advertise things in the tv, because the tv channels can only live with these ads.
Especially the tv channels can't know when a kid is watching their programms, because some kids just watch channels which are made for children and some other children watch also tv channels that weren't done for the children.
So it would be pretty hard to really work out a plan in which these young children don't have to be confronted with television advertising.
On the other side I really think that the idea which is behind the statement is not that bad, because young children, especially in the phase in which they are seeing things for the first time, they can be influented very easily and they want everything they see.
So the children are going to ask their parents if they can buy them this and this and this.
For sure they won't buy them everything, but they want their child to be happy and have then to buy them maybe something.
In some tv advertisings are also things that won't be that good for the growing up process of the child.
In the worst case they could have disorders or any kind psycholigal error because of this content in the tv ads.
But we could also say that these young children won't understand the advertisements, because they don't know what these things in there are.
On the most tv channels the producers also pick not the worst advertisements for as an example after a tv show which is made for young children or especially on tv channels for young children like toggolino or kika or super rtl they don't use any kind of advertisement, because they are conscious about the consequences which these brutal ads will do to the kids.
As a last point the parents are also very important to look after their children, what they are watching on tv and which tv channels they are on.
In the world there are a lot of risks which could have consequences to the children or also to older people.
So a bit of a risk is always in this world and you have to protect you and the people around you or which are important to you.
The statement should be more specific about what they want to show in the advertisement.
Somehow it can be that parents think that the content is not really appropriate,which makes this statement true.
For example the parents don't want that their child gets in touch with something electronic but the kid sees the advertisement and wants it.
An other argument is that children between two to five want everything they see.
So if they see a television advertising, no matter what, they want it immediately and without excuse.For example, it can be hard for the parents if they're in a financial crisis and can't really satisfy the cravings of their child.
Or when the parents want their child to understand that he/she can't have everything, the advertisement could get a problem.
For the parents it's also hard to say no, which makes this whole situation even more complicated.
But when Christmas arrives or the child has it's birthday it can be a advantage because with the advertisement the parents know exactly what they're child wants to have as a present.
With that it's much easier for the parents to decide what they finally want to buy.
With that the child chooses i'ts own present and at the end no one complains.
At the end everyone has it's own opinion and one could discuss about that but i think it would be better that there's no television advertising directed toward young children because it is better for the children to not know everything about what's available in the stores as well as for the parent'shappines
Children at the age of two to five years should not already be watching television.
In that time period children learn to talk, to walk or start to play with children in their age.
So the parents have to be responsible and should not let the child watch television.
It could have an huge impact in the child's evolution.
For example a child who watches television every day or a child who goes and socializes.
Which child will have the better social connection when they are older.
Another reason why children should not watch advertises on television is that, at their age they can not understand what ads are for.
Ads are for parents who buy the stuff for the children but it is just a waste of time if a kid watches advertises.
Last week I went to visit my uncle and then his child was watching television as why arrived.
There was an ad going on about a new Mercedes car.
I asked myself why did my uncle not change the channel because now the kid is talking about this new car but my uncle did buy a new car not so long ago.
Also advertises give you that feeling that you have to be the same as this celebrity on television so children should not be thinking like that already in their young years.
A contradicting reason could be that children who watch advertises on television may notice earlier that it is just a huge money buisness.
So as they get older they can handle it better than children who did not watch ads.
Noticing that ads just want you to buy everything is a good notice.
It can give you another way of thinking.
At my point of view it is better when young children aged two to five do not watch television advertising because nobody should watch it.
It is just a huge buisness of making money on stupid people who believe thing on television.
There's several different aspects about advertising directed towards young aged children.
One good aspect for example is that children get to know what's out there on the market to buy for them.
But on the other hand there's also the bad aspects for expamle there's no reason to show advertising to young aged children because they don't have any money themselves to buy it.
And therefore the parents of the kids will end up buying something with their money for their kids because advertising made the kids thinking they need that specific thing even though they don't even need it.
I think that it shouldn't be allowed to show advertising directed towards young children on TV.
I think it is not neccessary to show such advertising to the yound kids because we already live in a materialistic world and there's no need for trying to get young kids to wanting something they don't even need.
The kids these days will be manipulated by advertising soon enough.
When you watch a film in the evening on television their are always breaks for adverts.
Some adverts are interestening, some adverts are funny and some adverts are just sexist and weird.
Mostly the adverts are nonsense and they aren't usefull.
But how do they seem to young children?
Young children don't konw as much as a teenager or even an adult.Young children are naiv and and can't order the adverts.
Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
Adverts are't usefull for young children, because they can't even buy things by themself.
Young children normally don't have enough money to buy things, for example toys.
But I think that adverts still can influence young children which toys they want for example for christmas.
I think that totally fine, because the parents of the young child can still decide, which toy they will buy their children.
Another negative point is that television at all is bad for children.
It's not good for the eyes if the young children watch always television.
They waste so much time watching television.
It would be so much healthier to play outside, for example in the garden.
I don't think that television advertising toward young children ) should not be allowed.
But I think that children should watch less television at all and play more
outside.
There are arguments for and against this topic.
And both of them are understandable and reasonable.
Children between the age of two and five do not remember a lot, there is no tomorrow for them and they do not have any time feelings.
They do forget a lot and if they see something that could be bad for them they will not remember it in a while, for example a three year old will not remember an advert with war content a couple of months later.
Television advertising is mostly about cars or shampoos and a young child will not be able to use this information or be influensed massivly like a grown-up.
Most children will watch childrens programms and in most cases there is no advertisment shown and if, mostly for the programm itself or the next show.
On the other hand children do learn fast, especialy in this age category.
They hear and see things and they repeat them, this is how a child learns, it is totally natural.
So if a child, by any chance joins in its' parents watching some programme on television and there is an advert for a game that involves guns the child may see this as a normal thing.
Or if there is an advert with bad or rude words the child may repeat them.
There could be adverts with content that is for adults and a child should not see that.
So there are two sides to this, depending on the adverts shown and how mature the child is.
My personal opinion is that children should not watch to much television anyway, it is bad for them to sit in front of screens for hours and if they watch something it should be child friendly and not agressiv or with adverts.
But because of the fact that a lot of children television programms do not show adverts a child can watch television alone as well.
If that is not the case there should be a adult watching the child.
In the end it is the dicision of the parent if they would like there child to grow up with adverts.
Television advertising should not be allowed toward young children

Let`s begin with the pro arguments: First, the most important argument in my opion is, that these young children react very strong on advertisements, especially on TV.
Young children watch TV very often.
When they see something on TV, which is interesting for them, they tell their parents that they want to have something.
This happens very often and can be stressful to the parents.
The second most important argument in my opinion is, that children should watch somothing, which improves their knowledge about the world, e.g.
a broadcast about animals or something in this direction.
But children watch (mostly) channels for children at their age like Super RTL, nickeloden or KIKA and so on.
Advertisements are especially made for these children, this is why they want to have something all the time.
Children see these things in another point of view, as the adults do.
Contra-arguments: It is quite normal, that children watch TV.
As a result, it is as well quite normal, that there are a lot of advertisements on these channels.
You can find advertisements almost everywhere on TV.
The people grow up with this fact.
Every advertisement has its own target group, there are adults, children, workers, teenagers and so on.
Advertisements aren`t as annoying for children as for adults.
This is why children don`t care about advertisements.
They often like advertisements to discover new toys and there are as well advertisements which support the education of the children.
My personal opinion: I think that advertisements should be banned from children`s channels.
Better would be, if advertisements are banned from all channels .
This would be great :.
The best argument for the new rule is, that they react differently on advertisements.
Advertisements have a very big influence on the life of a child.D
In my essy I write about the topic "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed."
Television is a kind of entertainment.
It has both positive and negative sides.
So it could make people uncreative because if they lie the whole day on the sofa and watch tv shows they don't have a hobby and they don't do anything.
They get lazy.
At the worst case they could lose their social connections.
On the other hand can television teach us because there are many documentary movies which show important stuff for example about our nature.
But there are also some tv series which makes watchers addicted to them.
And many movies show things which aren't realistic so the watcher could get a wrong picture of the reality especially children.
I'm agree with the statement that young children shouldn't be allowed to watch tv because they can't understand the documentary movies.
So if they watch television they would watch some series which aren't teachfull.
Instead of watching movies they should play with each other to make some social connections because that's important.
If a child never watch a movie or a serie it doesn't know it and then it doesn't need it.
It's a fault of the partents.
The problem is that most of the parents aren't too busy to play or care about their children so they put them on the sofa and they are entertained.
The result is that the parents haven't nothing to do.
To finish my essay I would say that young children shouldn't watch television because there are so many things to entertain themselves.
A current controversial issue are the all day seen advertisments.
They are everywhere.
In the supermarkets, on the street, in magazines and papers and especially in the TV.
We can't do something without beeing influenced by an advertisment.
Everything is about sponsoring people and gaining new customers.
But advertisment directed to children?
Should it be allowed?
Or should they at least be left out of this money making strategy?
With advertisment, children get to know new products.
With the help of adds they can develop new Ideas, what to do with their friends or suggest to do for example in the kindergarden.
Next, it would trigger their fantasies and wishes, as an example what they want for teir next birthday.
This, on the other hand, makes it easier for parents to buy their children the right thing, they really want and not just something the children then never play with and throw it away.
Moreover the children should know what different kind of new things there are they can get and mabey they also learn something from it, when they have to read something or listen to the adviser.
And last but not least, it is better for the companies, when adds are seen by young kids.
They then buy these items they like, and so the companies can focus on them and developp their ideas based on the products which are more bought and therfore preferred by the kids.
On the other hand, children can be damaged and manipulated by that many adds specially developped for them.
It can be too much for them and they can be misleaded or the add can be misunderstood.
Kids just want to life.
They don't want to see advertisment when they watch TV or read a cartoon.
They are too young for this.
For ost of the children it would just be a distracting thing in their life and they wouldn't pay attention to it.
So in the end the advertisment would be wasted.
Children get manipulated by it even before they really understand what is happening.
And in the end they aren't even able to afford all these thing which are presented to them by the adds.
It would be the parents which have to pay.
And this would put a lot of preassure n these parents which can't afford to spent too much money.
So I am against advertisment towards kids.
Because kids should life and not be manipulaz^ted by advertisments or
Even though television isn't as popular as it has been a few years ago it is still a big part of our society.
Especially younger people are extremely fascinated by their cartoon heroes and favourite shows.
But as we all know there's also advertisment in television and children do believe almost everything they see there.
They get amazed by the colourful toys and attractions that are shown in TV.
So they run up to their parents trying to convince them about buying the newest item they saw.
Often parents don't want to buy anything their child wants and so they have to say "no", which easily causes madness when it comes to kids.
Of course there's also an economical aspect because that's what advertisment is all about, economics.
There are thousands of enterprises which are simply based on selling toys to kids.
And of course their system wouldn't work anymore without advertising their products in national television.
If now television advertising for kids wouldn't be allowed anymore all these enterprises would crash.
So completely disallow television advertising for kids isn't really realistic.
But I guess children can't handle all the influences television has on them on their own.
Parents must supervise their children's behaviour when it comes to television.
Also advertisment toward young children should be controlled more.
It doesn't take much to convince children, so we have to protect them from all influences.
Children shouldn't be abused to make money.
Everything sold to children should help them to learn and discover stuff and there are lots of products on the market that don't do that.
To summ everything up I'd say forbidding television advertising isn't realistic but the future of our world should be protected better when it comes to influences from the outside.
Nowadays, television is a very important and controverse topic.
Kidds and teenagers spend a lot of time watching TV in their freetime because the do not have any other occupations like sports or other free time activities.
It's getting worse and worse and the age of the TV watchers decreaes from year to year -  evne young kids, aged two to five, are watching more often TV shows then their parents used to watch because 30 years ago, there was not any TV show for young kids.
Not anymore.
Kids are lost in the endless supply of media like, computer, radio, or even like in our case the TV - it is horrible for the young parents and inevitable to stop at the same time.
By watching televison, kids are automatically exposed to all the numerous advertisements between their favorite shows like Tele Tubby and co.
It seems impossible for parents to take care of the kids and not let them enjoy the advertised plays or cool Lego cars etc.And of course, the TV companies exactly know which sort of people watch TV at a certain time of the day.
This is how televison advertising works -  it is the try of showing and make specific aged people find joy and pleasure in a certain product, which is shown from its best side.
For example, pornographic stuff is shown in the night when kids usuallly sleep, and stuff for kids like Lego cars is advertised in the mornning when mothers are busy with cooking and occupates its kids with the TV.
It is as easy as this.
Since we know what televison advertising actually means, I will continue talking about benefits and disadvantages for kids who are exposed to these certain advertisements.
As you can perfectly remember when you were a young child, whenever you saw something cool you liked indeed, you would not stop bugging your mom and dad until you got what you desperitel wanted so bad.
That is exactly the strategy used by the companies which advertise stuff for kids - it is so easy to get children excited about a cool toy.
Kids see what they canput on their bucket list, whic is good, but simultaneously kids are exposed to to much stuff.
Children tend to get spoiled and do not appreciate anymore what they own.
it may sound crazy, but kids are getting slefish and mean.
In my opinion, tlevison advertising for young children shoould become prohibited based of all the arguments that I listed within this essay.
"Advertising"
Since the 20th century, companies use television as an important tool to reach millions of people by annoying them with a great deal of advertisement.
Nowadays advertisement is also present in TV-series for children.
What effect does this have on our children?
Should this be forbidden?
Advertising children leeds to big discussions in families.
It is that simple to influence children by televison, so they nearly believe everything the advertisement says.
They immediately run to there parents after the film and wanted them to buy the latest things they had seen.
Furthermore, most of childrens whises have been created by an extern influence, which means that children who are less influenced by televison or other sources for advertisement have much less whishes.
Children in the age between two and five years are psychologiclally not that far developped to decide between what they need and what is only a spontanious whish.
On one hand, we have the manipulation effect from advertisement on children, but on the other hand, we all know, that children once become adults.
As an adult you have the same problems but they are even much biger and diverse.
So why should the children be protected of this problems?
If they are faced up to reality at there prime of life they learn much earlier how to deal with there problems.
Nevertheless advertising children is an important ecological way to increase welfare of the producer.
Consumers often buy things -leaded by advertisement- they really do not need.
So in my oppinion, advertising children makes only sense for the economy.
That is why I think we shold limit advertisement in children's tv programmes.
Advertising like this, is a very new and modern problem, young adults are confronted with.
Over all it should be their own decision, if they want to raise the children with such influences like the TV or not, but here are some arguments for and against the advertising directed toward young children.
First of all, it's a good idea for the parents to see advertisments like this, not for them, but for their child of course, because even though it's not meant for them, by watching these kind of commercials, with or without their child, they'll get an idea of what their child and other children at their specific age want to play with.
Also it's a good source of finding out, what's new on the young children toy market, without having to leave the house and wander around toy stores.
But it's also not that good of an idea for the child, because already getting influenced by the media at such a young age, and watching too much TV, or even getting addicted to watching TV at a young age, has never been a good habit.
Problems like constant crying because of parents not buying their child the toys or things they want, or rather, they saw on TV , might also occur.
A big question would also be, if they actually understeand the things they see on the commercials, because if they don't, it's just a big waste of money directed towards someone, that doesn't even understeand any of it.
So overall i think it should be allowed, because it's the right of the channels to choose,which kind of commercials the want to use, and because it's also the parents, which are responsible for their child, and checking on them like the things they like, what they watch on TV or what the do on the internet, should be a very important part of parenthood.
So if they don't like what kind of advertising there is on TV, they can just turn it off, and let the child do different things, other than watching TV all day.
Television advertising directed toward young children between two and five should not be allowed.
I agree with the statement above for the following reasons.
At first, advertising on television will cause that children want the things they see.
A good example for this is, when they make promotion of a game, the young will show it to their parents.
This leads to finally buying the game for their daugther or for their son.
Furthermore, children will learn at such young age that the world is full of promotion.
This is how they get to know todays world.
Maybe this will help them to think intelligent in school and in their lives.
In the other hand, the two to five aged need to watch programmes specific for their age, for example ''Dora Explora''.
This is a television show where the young are able to learn new things.
It is way better for them.
Moreover, it could be possible that television advertising will cause a lot of more questions than answers because they are very young aged.
In my opinion, the two to five aged don't need to watch a lot of TV at all.
Of course they can learn something but there are better ways for that.
Television advertising can also give parents problems when they don't have enough money for everything their child sees in the promotion.
That is why I agree with the statement above.
In conclusion, it is a fact that advertising on TV is not very relaxing for young aged and for the adult because it takes a lot of their free time.
This statement depends on which sort of advertising it is meant.
But there is a very high chance that young children are more influenced than the older ones.
But if it is meant for advertisings that influence people to buy something it isn't this bad as the statement is telling.
Because the younger children are surely more influenced but they have less power.
Power is meant that they aren't able to buy anything alone, they their parents ermission and often also their money because they don't owe on their own money.
So the parents still are a big factor of the choice to buy something or not for the young children.
But if the statement is meant for advertising that are not for buying but doing soething or going somewhere it is a completely other view.
Because young children are very influenced by this.
They think that very much things are fun on the beginning but afterwards they aren't happy.
So if the parents try to be nice and offer something to the children they do what the chidren like and so the advertising influences them.
The young children are also way easier to impress with something and the advertisings are made to impress people to buy something or do something and the young children are very influenced because of this.
So my opinion on this statement is that there isn't really a ''good'' decision.
Because everybody is influenced by advertisings.
The young children are surely influenced the most but they have got their parents to tell them that that isn't right and can still decide.
Also we are unable to control if a young children is watching television or if it is anyone else.
So at the end the only solution would be to have no advertisisngs at all.
Because if not then it could stil happen that young children see advertisings.
But it isn't this bad as in the statement because they still have parents which normally are controlling them in this young age.
I disagree to that, beacause if television advertising are forbidden for children, it wouldn't be good for some businesses.
Businsesses need the television advertising to improve the children to buy the toys.
It's not only good for the business also for the parents from the children, because sometimes they have ideas for the children wich toy they should/could buy for christmas.
When the television advertising would be forbidden, many children wouldn't have toys anymore.
One only positive thing about forbid television advertising would be that children would go out ofter.
And also they would invent more games that they could play.
But thats the only positive thing about that.
The rest wouldn't be very good.
Inspecial for the business who produce toys.
If you imagen when the business had no television advertising, then they can't sell the toys anymore and that would mean that they would have no money.
The children also had no fun anymore in their lifes because they can't play with their toys, because they don't have any toys.
If you have no business who produces the toys, you can't buy them.
Not every child likes to play outside with other childrens.
So they have their toys that they play with and when there is no toy means that they can't play with anyone.
So this means that they're lonely.
Television advertising isn't that bad for the children.
It's only bad for the parents money, because they have to buy the toys.
But the parents loves to see their children laughing and having fun with their new toys.
And also when children have their toys they don't annoy the parents, if they're bored.
There were many concerns raised in the last coupple of years , about weither television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not .
The supporters of such a law that would forbid this type of advertisement,  argue that the advertisements seen on television could have a huge, negative  impact on children , who are easy targets for companies.
Especially the clips advertising candy or Fast Food , could influence the eating habits of toddlers and lead to overweight or obeysity.
The advertisors defend themselves from these accusations.
Stating that they are not ones to blame and that it is the parents responsibility to educate their children and make sure that they are eating healthy.
A second attack on TV advertisement is , that the pictures presented by them are stereo typing gender or ethnics and therefore disturbing the development of children .The product placer anwser to this statement again by pushing all responsibility on the parents and therefore away from them.
My personal opinion is that we can`t and shouldn`t prohibit the advertisement because of two reasons.
First of all , a law like this would violate the freedom of speech and media in an irreparable way.
If we start prohibiting children advertisements , there will be soon demands to ban all sorts of advertisement on TV.
Second , children will become desensibelized to advertisement in media, which will then lead to problems in the future  when they are suddenly exposed to it.
The only and true solution to this problem is , that advertisors should take more responsibility and maybe change the way or content they are showing to children .
So for example there should be more advertisement for healthy food and girls product placements should not only contain pink toys and dolls , which are stereotizing the role of women .
I hope for new advertisement which try to challenge the stereo typesof
Television advertising directed toward young children

Advertisements are a big part of our life.
However, we may not even realise, since it has become so normal to us, that we may not even notice them.
They are everywhere around us, since the day we are born.
It surely has changed a lot in the recent years, but, do we even think about their influences, especially for young children?
In this essay I want to write about whether television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed or not.
Young children consume advertisements everyday.
It doesn't make a lot of sense to me, to produce television ads directed toward young children, since they aren't capable of even understanding them.
Children don't have the capacity to analyse the goal of those ads, even if they consume them.
What two year old child would watch TV, and then begin to think about the influences of advertising?
Second, I want to add that television advertising has changed a lot in the recent years.
Lots of them provide us a false picture of our society which has a negative impact on us.
Young children may feel forced to follow a certain goal of the ad in order to fit in our society.
This biulds a lot of pressure on young consumers, even if they don't fully realise.
For example, if a young child sees an ad about a videogame or whatever, he thinks he needs this to be cool.
However, sexualised contents are also a big problem.
Lots of young children are already acting like adults in television advertising, which is really unhelathy for their development.
They need to be children, not dress like adults or put make up on.
In the US for example, young children already play roles of adult women in ads or movies.
My last argument that supports the prohibition of television advertising toward young children is the picture of violence they use.
Lots of ads for for example videogames are really violent.
This may contribute to the growing violence or aggressive behaviour of children.
To summarise, I think televison advertising for young children should not be allowed.
A child's brain isn't capable of differing between negative and positive aspects of them.
My opinion is also that they are kind of unnecessary.
What is the goal of them?
To make a five year old child buy those new cornflakes?
In the end, it is still the job of the parents to control what ads their children consume.
I disagree with this statement, because in my opinion, television advertising directed toward children under 5 years, should not be allowed.I think there are many reasons.
But why?
Firstly I think, it's not such a good idea to let young children watching TV in general, because in this age, there is so much to do.
They should go out and learn how to interact with the natur and to discover it.
Also young children should not be under influence of the meaning of others, for example of the meaning of a boss of Nestlé.
The young children are to young to decide, whats is true and possibe and what is impossible in an advertising.
For example an advertising of RedBull says, that you can fly, if you've drunk a RedBull.
If a young children don't know, that this is impossble, the child might try it out and fails.
Also most of the advertsing things are not healthy, but a young children don't know this, and ask the mum often, to buy this product.But I also think, that the solution is not, that children now just should watch advertising for parents.I think children shouldn't watch TV in general, and it should be forbitten to ad an advertsing between, before and after a child-TV-Programm.
Television for young children is always a big discussion.
It had been one since the television was invented and it will be one in the future.
There are many pros and cons.
On the pro side is the fact that children can learn languages with th TV for example greman.
Many children in Switzerland learn greman not swiss german but high german.
They have a bigger vocablurary and a better pronounciation.
Another argument is that the parents have some free time while their children are watching TV.
If the mother have to do the housework or the father have to work it's easier to do while they're watching so they don't run around and scream.
But for each pro there is a contra for example in the TV programm there are many series which are totally bad.
The figures do things the parents don't want their children to do or the children learn things which aren't correct and sometimes totally false.
And in fact if they want to learn a language it's not better learning from the TV then from the parents of friends or in school.
Another fact is the time some children spend before the TV.
A lot of houres a day and this is worse than the pro arguments because if the children don't do any sports or go outside they become fat and unhealthy and they will have no friends to play with.
I think television advertising is not such a good thing,all in all there are more cons than pros.
Althrough there are also chances for examples the children know how the world looks like and some programms have good series for learning something.
If I had children, I don't know exactly what I would do but in the end each one have to make his or her own decision if it's wrong or right, good or bad.
But we'll have the discussion several times the future because it's an important topic in our conected world.
Television advertising toward young children has advantages and disadvantages.
One advantage is that they learn how to deal with advertising in a young age.
They get used to it, so it won't be a surprise when they grow older.
Another point is that they get ideas for birthday or christmas present wishes.
They don't have to walk through a shopping center with their parents (and the parents don't have to spend a whole day on it!)
to find a present.
They see it on television and can tell it to their parents.
But there are also disadvantages.
Because they are so young, they don't have the money to buy the stuff they would like to have because of the television advertising.
That could be the reason why they are sad and maybe even mad and angry at their parents.
They start crying, because they don't get they toy which they have seen on TV.
That's not good for the parents too.
They don't want to say always no tho their children, so they get forced to buy at least a few of the stuff the kids would like to have, even if they think it's not really good for them.
Moreover, there's the risk of wrong advertising, that could have a bad influence for the children.
If the advertising spot isn't made for young children it could be dangerous.
In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed, no matter what kind of product the advertising spot wants to sell.
The first question which came in my mind was if children at this age are even able to understand the meaning of an advertisment.
So in my opinion there is no need to not allow television advertising for young children.
Because can they really understand that the advertising was directed toward them, I mean do they understand that let`s say it should stimulate them to buy something?
I don`t think so, because they don`t even own money and the`re not really supposed to watch television at this age anyway.
And I dont`t see in what way it could be bad for them, I mean yes they can maybe influenced by television but not really in a bad way.
So why would you not allow them?
It could be a good thing if they would forbid advertising which is for young children, because today we have so much electronic devices and young children get involved more and more.
I think it would somehow aso protect the parents, because the children will run to them first when they see an advertisment with something in it they want to have.
On the other hand they also have to learn how to resist and that they can not have everything they see on Tv.
So it could be a protection because everybody know how easy it is to influence such a young child.
And the parents could probably avoid lots of conversations with their kids becaus they want to have something they saw on television.
All together I think it would be an overreaction if they would not allow the advertising for kids, eventhough it also has some good sides to it.
And there are also parents who have to tell their kids what is good and what isn`t and they have to teach them how they can and how they should react to advertising.
So why should they not allow advertising just because the children are too young or that they don`t really have their own opinion and reliability?
For me it is for sure a no, I mean we all grew up with children advertising on television and we are completely fine so why change it?
Computers, mobilephones, radio and also television - they are a part of our society.
It influencs us often more than we know.
Everywhere are advertisments and sometimes we can't even see them.
But in the television it isn't the same.
Especially young people where impressed by these skinny models and these white teeths or the strong boy with the sunburned skin in the advertisments.
Mothers can see how to wash the clothes that they stay white and fathers can see the new car which one should always be the best.
But what happens with the young children, when they see these advertisments?
Are they also impressed and influenced?
Or do they just ignore these?
In my opinion, it shouldn't be forbidden.
I think young children maybe see the advertisments but are less impressed.
They don't think a lot about the products, they don't realise that the clown with the red hair wants that they buy a new football.
They just think about the funny clown with these big nose and the big smile.
An other point is that these young children shouldn't watch a lot of television.
So if they play more in the garden or with other children , they will got also less impressed.
To forbidden the television advertising toward young children doesn't make sense for me.
Because the advertising is everywhere, not just in the television.
It is on the mobilephone when these children can play while the mother is cooking, it is on the streets and in the shops.
In my opinion, you just have to show the children how they can get with it.
That these teeths aren't that white and that these cars can't drive toward the ocean.
I think that should be the goal of our society.
Advertising is a big theme today, we have it wherever you look and hear.
It is a good way to spread the ideas and products all over the world, and there it is, a problem, because there are so many electronical devices, it's naturally the best way to do it.
Today everybody is watching tv, surfing in the internet and playing games on computer or something like that.
There are many studies today about children and the consume of electronic device time, it's not good for young children to have electronic device time.
My own oppinion to this statement, i think it is not good for children to have any time at tv or electronic devises until five or six years.
20 years ago no child had the possibility to watch tv and the advirtising in there.
so i think it should not be disallowed, it is the decision of the parents if they will allow their children to watch tv and the advertising between.
The companys which are producing this adverts, are a little bit stupid is my oopinion, because they know it is not good for children to watch tv in this age.
To producing this adverts should be forbidden, but only on the television, when you advertise in another way it is allowed, because you will not surprised during a film or something.
The adverts for so young childrens are not that good, because the parents have to buy these things.
The child will cry untill it will get it.
so there are many points against television advertising directed towards young children, but for the company it is a really good way to earn much money.
When children see something they think it's a good, cool thing it is very difficult to not give them that, because they will talk only about it all the time.
I agree this statement but i understand also the companys, they have a easy way to earn much money.
A few years back the world was different and technology wasn't such a big part of our lives as it is now.
We used to talk to each other face to face, go for a walk and meet new people out there but as technology improves every day it's not rare to see how these habits changed.
We text, watch videos and like everone elses's photos.
Nowadays young children also have easily access to technology.
They love to watch television and at this point it is important that you know the advantages and disadvantages of this way of interaction.
Parents that are very busy and can't afford to pay someone who can take care of their children often decide to allow their kids to watch television.
This is good for parents because they have time for themselves and can relax a little bit and the children are more than happy if they can watch their favourite cartoons.
Television advertising help the kids to learn new things and improve their speaking skills because they're listening to new words.
Everything sounds good until now but let's not forget that it is not healthy for young children to stay the whole day at home and watch cartoons instead of being active and playing outside in the nature with other children like it used to be .
Television advertising towards them might confuse them because they are too young to understand everything and it happens very often that television shows content that is inapppropiated and not made for children.
Not only adults are getting more and more confindet with technology but also young children.
It is common to see little kids watching television, playing with mobile phones and computers but in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.
Children at that age should enjoy their childhood interacting with other kids, playing outside, drawing and showing her feelings and thoughts.
They shouldn't sit in front of a television consuming stuff and doing nothing.
Television advertising isn't only directed towards teenagers, young adults and adults in general but towards young children as well.
The question whether this should be allowed or not makes room for heated discussions and both sides, pro and contra, make good points.
In this essay I'll try to shed some light on this controversely discussed question and to explain my opinion on this subject.
Children aged two to five are in an extremely important stage of their childhood.
In this phase they learn basic social skills, talking and walking.
The brain functions in a very efficient way and sucks in everything it's exposed to, including television.
This means that television ads can have a profound effect on the development of a child.
One argument against such advertising is the fact that in order to appeal to the children some ads use what we adults perceive as child-language.
The problem with the use of such infantized language is that it doesn't follow basic rules of grammar and that words are deliberately mispronounced.
This could lead to major problems with talking and oral comprehension due to the fact that the target audience is still developing language skills.
Another problem that arises with ads for young children is that children are easily manipulated.
Their young age makes it difficult for them to use reason and logical deduction for discerning useless or wrong information from useful one.
However on the other hand the effects of TV ads are balanced by good education and parenting.
If both function well then exposure to ads won't lead to problems.
In my opinion, the true culprit of failed education isn't the TV but the parents and education department.
Ads for young children can be useful as well.
Sometimes interesting and fun toys are advertised and how would parents and children even know about those toys if it weren't for the ads?
In the end I have to say that banning ads for children aged two to five doesn't make sense.
While I'm not a fan of ads in general I realize that banning them is firstly not easy and secondly it wouldn't help in raising children at all.
Advertising

Yes, I agree with this statement.
Because the young children aren't the ones who will buy it, the desicion isn't in the hand of the children, it's in the hand of the parents.
The advertisment woudn't realy make sense, becaus why would you advertis a product to a customer who isn't able to buy it.
Also a big problem, if we don't let advertisments be allowed, is that this children televison channels wound't get money, becaus the most channels life from the money throug advertisment.
On the other hand, the advertisment could affect the childrens, in the way how they will spent money when they're older.
Also it could affect, that the childrens will start to argue with they parents, if they could have this product.
This would maybe manipulate the parents, wich will buy this product in the end.
My oppinien, is that advertisments should be allowed, becaus without it, the most children channels would disapear.
But the parents have to teach there childrens about advertisment and how to understand theme.
Nowadays advertisment is everywhere.
You can see it in magazines, on television, on internet sites, on sport events, etc.
Enterprises spend millions of dollars to promote their products.
But is it right to promote their products to children at such a young age?
Companys which sell kids toys obviously need people who want to buy their toys.
And they need to promote their product somehow to make their product known in order to sell these.
The TV channels also make a lot of money out of it.
On the other hand it's wrong to see kids as a fortune maker.
Kids, especially at that age, can't really make up their own mind yet and are easily.
Because of that they easily could sell practically anything to the kids.
Another point is that the breaks between the series can be really annoying and also really long.
Kids want to watch TV and don't want to be told what 

I think it's a bad idea to already start advertising products towards young children.
For me personally I
Today we can see everywhere we go advertisings.
In the supermarkets are a lot of different products like cornflakes, juices or a lot of toys for children.
Television advertising is a good possibility to show people at home the different products they sell.
A lot of companies like to use television advertising direct toward young children to show them their products, especially toys for young children.
If the children see the toys while they watch television, they want that their parents buy them the toys they want.
But this is very unethical.
Young children, especially children aged two to five, are very curious and they just believe and accept the things that their parents or other people say.
They don't know that adults could tell lies.
So they just believe what the people in the television say.
If a person say that the ponytoy is very funny and you can also  style the hair of the pony, the children who are watching television and see that want also this ponytoy.
So they say to their parent that they want this toy and the parents should go and buy this toy.
The second problem is, that companies know that children will cry if they don't get the things that they really want from their parents.
Parents mostly can't leave their childrens alone at home, because the children are two years old and they couldn't find a person who can care of their children.
So they take their young children with them to the supermarket to buy some food for the dinner.
In the supermarket, the child see a product, for example special cornflakes, that they saw while they were watching television.
So they show the cornflakes to their parents and say that they really want to eat this cornflakes.
If their parents say no, the child is sad and begins to cry.
Companies use this situation to sell their products, because they know that parents will buy the product their children want.
If the parents always buy the things their child want, the child will never lern that they should care of their money.
So they will loose a lot of money in the future because they just buy what they want.
Advertising has always been a big thing in our society and there has been millions of arguments and discussions about it.
In the following text, I'd like to share my feelings about the statement: "Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"
First of all I want to explain the reasons supporting this statement.
In these days, children should be better protected against the news and the internet.
They get so much information about things that aren't supposed to be read or heard by litte children.
It seems like they're getting driven over by all that information and they can't handle that since they're so young and I think advertises directed to them makes that problem even worse.
Another reason is, that the advertises can push people in our "consumer society" and I think it's importat to protect the childrem from becoming part of that at an age, where they can't really build an own opinion about the world.
On the other hand, one could say it's nonsense to forbid advertising if the children can access the internet so easily and that the advertises aren't any bad for them.
first of all i think the television isn't a bad thing.
children can learn a lot of it.
for example they can learn a forainge language with help of the television.
but i agree that young children sholdn't watching advertising.
for children there are so much stupid and dangerous advertisings in the television.
after my opinion children have to play most of the time outside and spend a lot of time with friends.
so they can learn how to make contact and how they can be integret in a groupe.
so in any case, i think childern shouldn't wachting long time television.
advertising for thinks like security, banken and versicherungen isn't a big problem for childern.
but advertising for phantasy or sience fiction films are many times very curious.
young children don't understand it and it makes they afraid.
also advertisig for things you can eat, especially the advertising which is made for children is in my opinion a problem.
because the children wanna have those snikers and so they will get fat.
in the whole i think the advertising isn't the main problem.
there are sort of advertisings which can be a problem for children.
the main point is that children should lear how to handle with the television.
when they don't sit the whole day in front of the television and when children play outside with friends, the television is a good thing.
It is Saturday evening.
Your family and you are watching a movie on television.
As always the movie is interrupted 30 minutes.
The sound of television raises without you even touching the remote.
But the not the movie that you were watching is on.
It is again one of those boring advertisment that you have seen more than ten times over.
Who is not annoyed by those 45 seconds of interruption that are repeated at least three times?
It will be difficult to find someone who would disagree.
But they are still being played on TV.
That must mean that they are highly efficient in doing what they should - capturing peoples attention and lurging them into buying something.
But what if that advertisment is directed towards young children between the age of two to five?
How could a child not be lurged into wanting something that it does not have?
In my opinion television advertising should not be allowed at all.
The things a three year old child wants is either what his friend has what he does not have or what the child sees on television.
The purpose of letting their children watch TV if simply the occupation.
The parents want their children to be occupied during a period of time.
They set them in front of the TV so the mother or the father can do something during that time.
The problem is that often the child is not being supervised.
If the television programm is interrupted by an advertising the parents or an other supervisor does not have controll anymore of what is shown on TV.
Now if the child sees one of those advertisments over and over again why should he or she not want the product?
And exactly that is wrong with creating advertising directed toward children.
For example picture this scenario.
The four year old Ben is watching his favourite programm on television about Micky Mouse.
That programm then is interrupted by a 40 second advertisment about a whole Micky Mouse Set, including a backpack, a jacket and some Micky Mouse shoes that light in the dark.
Now the whole set costs over 40 Francs.
Ben does not have a knowledge of how much 40 francs is.
When the advertisment ends the programm continues but Ben was so focused on that advertisment that when his favourite programm ends, that Micky Mouse Set is all Ben ever thinks about.
And because that advertisment is then being shown over and over again, all the four year old Ben ever wants is that set, even if the family might not even be able to afford it.
Advertisment directed toward young children is simply wrong.
A young child aged two to five does not know what he really wants.
Advertising plays with their minds and lurge parents into buying things that their child does not even need.
That is wrong.
The parents are obviously the ones that decide whether they should buy something or not.
I think it depends on the television advertising.
In the televison are many advertisement for Lego, Playmobil and other toys.
Advertisements like these should be directed to children, because I don`t think that this joys are for parents.
Only if the parents play with the children.
It`s for children between two to five.
there are also advertising for Sturby, Trampolino and others.
That`s also for the young children.
It should be directed to the children and to the parents.
Because mostly the children saiy after the advertisement, that they want to go there.
But the parents decide if they go there or not.
There is also the advertising about other television series.
If the serie is for young children like Spongebob or Cosmo & Wanda, then the advertisementshould also dircted toward young children, because they are the people, who are looking this serie and not the elder children or the parents.
So sometimes the series should be directed towards the children, because they are the people, who use that stuff or who look that series.
The negative points about television advertising directed toward young children is, that they shouldn`t watch TV so often.
For example the advertising about television series is, that after the children want to watch all the other series, which they like.
That isn`t good for them.
I think that some advertisement can influence the young kids.
They don`t know that much, they have to learna lot.
If they see how great Lego is, they want more and more of Lego.
The same with all the other joys.
They want more and more.
It`s hard to say than alway no as a parent.
So there are also some negative points about this theme.
I think that there are some positive and some neagtive points.
It depends on the advertisement.
In the end, the parents have to say where they have to stop.
It's only an advertisement and if the young children get that, what in the advertisment were mentioned, decide the parents.
If I would sell Lego for example, I would also make an andvertisement for the young children, because finally it`s for them and not for the parents or others.
There are many adventages as disadventages.
I agree completly with that.
In my opinion, children aged two to five shouldn't even watch television.
They should play outside and get dirty and wet or I don't know what.
But it is a fact, that many children today just watch television and get dumber and dumber in front of the tv.
In this age, the brain learns extremly fast and copy everything that it sees.
So children in this age are extremely invluable with advertising.
Many advertising managers know that and send specific advertising on networks for children.
For example: A producer for toys send a advertising for his new toy on such a channel.
A child sees that and bother his parents so long, until he or she has this toy.
This is how advertising for children works.
But back to the main point.
Children in this age, as said, copy everything what they see and they also didin't have such a strong will like an adult.
So they cannot resist against these advertisings.
These were all my negatives opinions.
So now we switch to the positive.
I can only figure out one positive argument for that statement and that is the following: Advertising can also be positive for children for example a "smoking is bad" or a "pay attention in the traffic" advertising can be positive for a child.
But these advertisings have to be producted by the country, where the child lives and not from a private company who wants to generate success with that advertising.
So my final conclusion is, that advertising for children is bad.
An except is when the advertising is teaching something to the children, what they can use in there everyday life.
To end this essay I want to say: It is also a duty from the parents to look after what their child is watching or what he or she is doing.
And parents should also not allowed their child to watch tv more than 2 hours per week.
It's better for them to play outside and to connect with the real world.
In this young age it is really important for young children to use their imagination.
They actually want to play all day long, and when they do not know anymore what to play, they get nervous.
That's the point where they learn to invent own plays, by using their brain.
Thinking about that television advertising may not be a good idea.
Because when they get to see all the objects they could play with and see how they have to play with them, they loose the imagination of finding own plays and ways to invent new stories out of nothing.
That would lead to  a certain nessecarity of the television and the advertising.
They would want to have every single object that is shown there.
As we know advertising is made out of many psychological theories, so they really know how to affect little children.
Let us think about the good sides.
Parents are often very busy and stressed.
But little children need their attention most of the time.
Thinking of that fact, it is a good idea to get childrens attention by using a television.
Now if parents would buy all the little plays their son or daughter may want, they can satisfie them without even using their proper time.
In my opinion little children are way to naiv, to decide what they want and what don't.
I think in this age it is really important to let them use just their imagination.
Because this is something they can never get back again, when they once lost it by the inventions of adults.
So i think television advertising directed toward young cildren should not be allowed.
Television advertising is a very effective way to sell a company`s products.
People will recognize one special song or slogan which leads them to remember the product of the television advertising and eventually buying it.
But is it really appropriate for all the people who are watching TV?
What about the younger generation, children from two to five years old?
Will they be affected in any way by these advertising?
In the following essay I will show the pro`s and the contras of television advertising directed toward children.
For the parents will it be very difficult if television advertising presents products like toys.
Because if the children see all these great toys they want to have it for sure.
But not all the parents can afford it.That makes it for them very difficult to explain it to their children.
But if there are television advertising some special kind of healthy drink or food it can have a positive effect on the children.
Maybe they are more aware of healthy eating habits and that helps them to stay healthy.
On the other hand there are a lot of bad foods and drinks which are promoted in television.
Like all the sugary soft drinks and creasy foods.
That can have the exactly oposite effect.
I personally think that it really depends on the products which are promoted.There are a lot of good stuff but also a lot of bad stuff which can influence the children.
The influence that advertising has on small children is huge.
These kids don't know yet what they really want.
So the advertising can easly manipulate the young persons.
For example let's say it's Christmas time and a child does not really know what (s)he would like to have for Christmas.
(S)he turns on the TV and watchs a show.
The show gets interrupted by several comercials about toys or events.
Now the  child would love to have a specific toy, that (s)he didn't want to have before the show, so (s)he just got influenced by the advertising.
Another point is, that the children just want to have more and more toys.
This is not necessary.
Suddenly the children don't just want to have that one toy, they also saw a cute teddy.
It should be forbidden, so that we can protect our world a bit.
And not raise our children more than necessary into this consume society that we already are.
But we can say that it is also useful that the children to see so many wonderful articles during the advertising.
Because so they can learn to deal with money.
Of course just in some way.
For example they saw five amazing toys on TV, but their parents say, they are just allowed to have one.
This concludes, that the kids have to make priorities.
This may help them in the future.
We also have to think about the channel.
we don't really know if the channels still could afford famous movies without some advertising.
And of course knowbody wants that, so we just can't afford to bang advertising.
I personally think that there is no particular reason to forbid advertising for little children.
I also grew up with advertising and I still know my limits.
Television advertisement is in general a two faced thing.
It promises and shows you things that are in the end not really going to come true.
If we consider advertisement for young children, it get's even more complicated, because children don't really understand what is happening to them when they are watching advertisements for certain products.
Starting with a pro point, that would be, that the businesses that are selling their products with these adds for children, sell and therefor earn more money.
An example would be that if kids go into a store and see something they really want, they are going to beg for it, untill their parents buy them this certain toy.
Now if businesses wouldn't even need to get their costumers to come to the store to get this reaction from their kids, but they could even directly reach them at home to sell their products, it is even easier to sell more because like that they can reach a bigger audience.
A contra to that would be, that children are already confronted at such a young age with such marketing ways.
The children are used as a way to get the parents to spend money on them.
The child is like a conection from the product sellers to the parents, if they get the children to fall in love with their product by saying it's the best thing right now, with colourfull advertisement and kids having fun, it is a trick into wanting to have that exact product.
Because kids don't know yet how these advertisements are constructed to get us to buy things.
In general I think that advertisements are not such a bad thing, I just think it shouldn't already be allowed at such a young age because the kids don't know yet how they shouldn't believe everything that is shown on tv or that advertisemnts are just a way to show certain products and make them public but that doesn't mean that we should directly buy them.
Advertising

It's allways a very difficult subject, if children should watch TV or not.
In the following Essay I will show you the pros and contras of Television for children.
The Good thing about TV is, that Parents with very loud and activ children can keep them quiet, if they let them watch TV.
To get a quiet hour for themselfs.
Children can also learn if they watch show about animals, like I did when I was young, and learn alot of things.
But the contra is that if Children at a young age already watch alot of TV they will get used of it and won't stop watching TV if they were older.
If you start watching TV at a young age you could probabely get addicted to it.
In the Television there were also many canals who were very bad for young children because they contend violence and sex.
And it can always happen that a children switches in wrong canal like this.
Its also a pity that Television will get you away from going to play outside with your friends.
And you will just sit infront of the TV instead and get fat.
For me personaly the contra's were much more important than the pro and I'm against that children watching TV.
A lot of adverstising are directed to younger people mostly because of how easy it is to influence them.
These adverstisings often lead to them wanting to buy a new toy or something comparable.The issue for me is clearly that children aged two to five are able to understand the advertising but haven't had enough education, preparation or just simply aren't old enough to understand the mechanism of these typ of advertising.
A child aged two to five isn't very critical about the information he gets.
In their young life they've just had little expierence with people other than their mother and family and some other same old friends.
They just take everything sirious and belive evereything they are told because till that moment they haven't had any reason not to.
Now these big enterprises come and try to make the biggest profit out of it by making them believe their toy is vital for being happy.
I think it goes that far that you can't even talk of free will.
It's like a brainwash they get and they are helpless.
In comparison, someone older has seen thousand of advertisings and has been educated.
They know behind these advertisings aren't good willing persons that just want to help them be happy, it's somoeone trying to make money.
Another problem is that these advertisings are directed to the children but in the end the one who pays for the product are their parents.
So by directing to the children they're simply trying to avoid the parents and their more critical view.
The enterprises manipulate children's undevelopped  mind to make profit from the parents.
But I still don't fully agree with the statement at the top.
These companies still have to have a way to show their products.
The perfect solution would be more realistic advertisings.
It is well known that most people are annoyed of advertising, especially when it interrupts a movie they are watching.
But is it really that bad?
To answer this question we should have a look at some different arguments.
What if there are parents who have absolutely no idea what their children would like to play with?
This may be a little exaggerated but some parents really don't knowwha t exactly would make their children happy.
So why not let the television advertising inspire them?
If parents cannot feel their child's cravings what else should they do?
When television advertising shows toys or food the children may really like, it is actually a very good thing, especially for these kind of helpless parents.
However if children watch television advertising and they see something that they want, they want it so hard that there is almost no way for the parents to buy their children what they saw in television.
Children are unable to understand what their parents mean if they tell them that this product is like for example a waste of money or produced in a very immoral way or whatever.
They will just cry because the only thing they understand is that they won't get what they want.
Which parents would want to make their children unhappy?
The people who this advertising is coming from know about that and they make a large profit of it.
What's more is that advertising is just so annoying if you don't want to see this but you are unable to skip it.
So you just have to watch it which is really a waste of time.
Let's be realistc, I think that such parents like they are mentioned in the first example aren't very common at all and even if they cannot find the perfect toy for their children, they have friends who can give them ideas or they remember what they had enjoyed when they were young.
The contra arguments in this question are much more important to consider.
Advertising is a business which people make a profit of recklessly.
It shouldn't be supported at all and I would be ready to pay for television without advertising.
This topic seems to me not possible.
I mean how do you want to make this statement work?
Parents often let their children watch television by themselves to have them occupied, and the parents can relax in knowing what they are doing.
How does the government want to control this statement?
Do they want to make a Log in and a Password for certain channels?
Do the parents have to hold their hands in front of the kids eyes, so they can not see the advertising during the break of the movie?
I think that this problem is overratet.
The government tries to make always more regulations and I think that this trend is overhyped.
I think we should let the parents decide, whether the advertising is good or bad for their kids in if they want their kids to watch them or not.
In my opinion, this kind of problem is not the issue of the government.
I grew up in a household, where my sister and I were allowed to watch television on a saturday and sunday morning to let our parents alone and let them sleep in.
It worked out very well for the both parties of us.
My sister and I had a good time and we were ocuppied.
So my parents had time for themselves to sleep in and they were never worried because of the advertising on television.
I mean my sister and I never got influenced by an advertising as far as I know.
During the daily routines of a five year old child, it has way more and bigger factors who influence the child than the advertising on television.
For example their firendships, their environment in the family, their kindergarten teacher, their way to the kindergarten, their tools to play etc.
I think the government should have their eyes more on those factors who are much more bigger and influencal for the children up to an age of five.
Today, television advertisement is directed toward allmost all ages from five to sixty or even seventy years of age.
Now, should televison advertisement toward children aged two to five years be sanctioned?
This depends on how much television this group of people watch and how much of this time is filled with advertisement.
Also, children of today use more handys and tablets to play and watching televison as a free time event isn't probably more interesting for them.
In today's world with handys and tablets to play with and where parents haven't that much time left for their children, they buy them tablets to entertain them.
So the children would rather use these because they are more entertaining then TV.
This could meen that a sanction against the advertisement in TV isn't needed anymore.
But for the same reason that parents haven't enough time for their children, a disallowement of the advertisement is needed when the children don't have tablets to play with and instead of using tablets watch too much TV.
The second point is, if these very young children can even understand the advertisements shown on TV.
Because if this is the case, advertisements and a sanction of them would be both totally sensless.
But if they can understand it and then want the things that are advertised on TV, it shouldn't be of much harm because the things advertised in childrens TV shows are mostly toys.
And children love toys anyways.
At the end of my essay, I would like to present my own opinion to the question questionned.
TV advertisement and other advertisements are found everywhere today.
It should totally depend on the children's parents how much they see from it and how much they watch TV.
We don't need a disallowement of TV advertisement if the grown ups watch for their children and spend enough time with them rather than only work and let the children's entertainment to tablets and TV.
Young childern in the age of 2-5 shouldnt be allowed to watch TV.
Is that a good ban with healthy attitude or a pressure for all parents?
If parents watch TV to gain knowlege about the news or about the weather, they simply cant lock the child in another room for about 20 minutes.
They have to spend time while watching TV with the child.
But a flackering TV screen could put damage to the childs eyes or brain, couldnt it?
Young childern in this age need to play with geometric forms or play on a playground with other childern or with pets.
Childern cant gain logical skills through watching TV, they have to exercise by themselfes.
Anyway, about the damage to the eyes, there is no need to worry, if the screen has a high definicion.
Science says, that pets and childern prefer to watch on a HD screen, because otherwise, it wouldnt be that realistic.
And even a low quality screen wouldnt put that much damage that the child would become blind.
For logical skills, there are TV channels for children which tries to improve the childs logical skills.
And to forbid something so unnessecary is kind of useless.
Its the decision of the parents wheter they want to raise their child with a TV or without.
For me, we had a TV at home when I was very young and I sometimes watched some american child channels.
I really liked them and spoke about the "stupid dog" with my dad.
But when I was about 4 or something like that, the TV channels where cancelled, and so I played sometimes on the game console.
But it wasnt all the time, for sure not!
I played with my sister on the playground or in the garden or painted on the street with her.
I was able to sit in front of the screen and improve my logical skills.
So I totally disagree with such a ban, I had lots of fun in my childhood, even with a TV.
I think a TV could be dangerous when the child has learned to say "I want to watch TV".
If you havent one, it cant watch.
Anyway I think a DvD-player and some good movies are way better for children, TV with this load of crap in it isnt good at all.
And for important informations like news or weather, you simply read in the inter
Now a days there are a lot of television advertising that are directed toward young children.
Some parents are very irritaded of these advertisings because they think that this dont make any sense.
A lot of enterprises are interested in winning new costumers that are confident to the products and who always buys there stuff.
Some of the enterprises thinks that you have to begin at a young age to impress your costumers and to bring them on your side.
So they maybe buy your products for there whole life and that would be a succes for the enterprise.
But a other reason could be that the parents buy what the children want.
And if the children had seen a publicity with his favorite animal or something that every children like, he would absolutely want to have the item in the publicity.
So at the end the parents buy it.
And the enterprise have attended his target.
On the other side a lot of people think that television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed.
They say that everybody could sell everything, if its good for them or not, to young children on that way.
And than the parents buy that, but they doesn't even exactly know what that is.
In my opinion television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed because these
I think it depends on the subject of the television advertising.
Some of them are not good for young childrend between two and five years and others are also not really bad for the younger people.
Most of young children watch television at 5 o' clock in the evening.
They want to watch for example Micky Mouse or another short film for children.
So I think the chanel should do not show worse advertising.
But it has chanel they show advertising, which I find not good, during the morning or lunch, when children watch television.
It is a possibility that we say, that this chanel must change their advertising during the day.
In the evening or night more eldery people watch television.
Then I think the chanel can show every advertising which they want.
Because most of them people are more than eightteen years old for example and they have not a problem with this sort of advertising.
If they have one, they can change the chanel and watch another television programm.
Many children between two and five years cannot change the television programm by themselve.
An older person must help them.
Now a short description of a situation: A mother of two young childrens cooks the dinner.
Durning the time she is in the kitchen, her childrens watch television in the living room.
The mother have not the time to look every minute after her children what they watch in the television.
And the children are also unable to change the programm by themselve, when the chanel show some bad things.
When a older person find something bad, they change the chanel after short time and that is it.
The parents should can be sure, that their children watch normal things in the television.
So it is important the the television programm shows normal advertising.
And not for example women or men which wear not anything.
I think an advertising of Haribo or Barbie for example are not bad.
Because that are things or toys which the children know.
Some of them also play with these toys, which  are showed by the television advertising.
So that is not a problem.
Of course it has children they want a specific toy or something else they have seen in the television.
But that is a problem of their parents.
The parents should say no to their childre, when they want have something.
In the end I think it depends really of the subject what the television programm shows.
But advertising like Barbie, Haribo, Playmobile, Lego,... are not a problem I think.
That are things for children.
And also many children plays with these sort of things durning their free time.
Every day we are confronted with advertising of some sort.
Advertisement has become an indespensible way for companies to make their products visible to potential costomers.
The aim of advertisements is of course a means for a company to increase its revenue.
Over the years advertisements have become better and more effective.
One way of doing that is to specifically target the demographic of interest, be it a certain age or a certain gender.
We know advertisement works well, otherwise companies wouldn't invest so much in it.
That also means we are very easily influenced by advertisement and mostly unaware of it.
Children are arguably especially easily influenced, as they aren't capable of thinking critically.
That begs the questions of whether television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
The advertisement children at such a young age are exposed to probably come from television.
The internet does not affect this particular age group.
Therefore, it is best to focuse on television.
However, it is questionable whether children at that age understand the advertisements at all, or whether such advertisements have a greater effect on the parents.
Specifically banning advertisements for this specific age range would lead to a disadvantage for companies producing products for young children.
However, it would affect all of these companies equaly, ruling out a competitive disadvantage for certain companies.
Whether or not advertisement affects people negatively, is heavily dependent on the product.
Obviously marketing harmful products requires more ethical consideration.
Products, such as childrens toys do not fall into that category, although there could be toys promoting violence to a certain degree.
I think advertisement can pose a problem and needs to be regulated, as companies most likely not monitor negtive effects themselves.
To me a much larger problme seems to be advertisement directed at young adults and teenagers.
This includes most importantly the marketing of harmful substances, such as alcohol and tobacco.
The question if television advertising directed toward younger children should be allowed is not an easy one.
Here I would like to shortly discuss the pro and contra points.
I'm going to start with the pro arguments.
For the toy manufacturers it would be very positive if they could advertise their products on television.
They would sell more things because more children would know their stuff.
But other than that I can't see anything good about it if I'm honest.
You could say that the children would always have an idea on what they want for their birthdays or christmas but I think children especialy small ones wouldn't have a problem with that anyway.
And now to the contra arguments.
Little kids can be quite greedy.
They can get bored of their toys very easily.
So if you show them everything that's new they would always want more and newer toys which would be a problem for the parents espacialy if they don't have the money to buy new things all the time.
Another argument is that small children can't decide if the advertise is fooling them with the quality or the price of a product.
They couldn't decide if the advertisers are just telling great stuff about something to sell it and so they would believe everything.
Maybe it would also trick the children into watching the TV more often which is surely not what you want as a parent.
To end my short essay I would like to express my personal opinion.
I think television advertising towards small children (aged two to five) shouldn't be allowed because the contra arguments outweigh the pro arguments.
Only the manufacturers would profit from it and not the children and the well-being of the children should always be the most important thing to us!
Today, television advertising is something completely normal.
But some of them make you shake your head.
Especially advertising directed toward young children is often discussed.
So is this really that questionable as some people think?
When I was a young child, I oftem watched television in the morning.
Of course I also watched some advertises, which sometimes actually influenced me.
When I saw a cool toy in television, I wanted to play with this toy and when I saw nice looking new cornflakes, I wanted my mother to buy them.
So in this case you could say that it's pretty mean to try and sell such things to young children, who are often very influenceable.
To protect the companies, which are doing this commercials, you could say that they somehow have to bring their products to their clients.
If their clients are young children, they have to broadcast advertises for young children.
What could be discussed is to forbid all advertises, because there are also a lot of adults who get influenced by them.
But that's another subject to talk about.
Adults somehow still come to discussion, namely when it comes to the parents of the young children.
Parents are in my opinion, the most important factor in this discussion.
Television can influence the children as much as it's possible, but if the parents say no to the children and teach them right, I don't think it should be a problem.
If the parents don't just buy everything their little sunshine has seen in the television, the advertises wouldn't be that successful and would maybe even stop by themselves.
It's also about the parents, how much television the child is allowed to watch.
If the children just watch television the whole day and do nothing else, of course they get influenced and are the companies or the parents to blame in that case?
I think the bad parents are to blame.
So the question shouldn't be, if it's allowed to bring television advertising to young children, it should be if it's allowed to bring televison advertising to young children whose parents can't raise them right.
All in all I don't think it's a problem that there are advertises, which are directed to young children, since it's the companies right to try and sell their produts, as long as the parents can control their children and what they buy them.
Nowadays young children are often very early in touch with our modern technology.
It's normal to have an IPhone in the 5th grade of primary school.
Parents allow their children to watch television when they go out or it's okay to see a film under the week after school.
For example I sometimes go babysitting a child named Lily.
She's five years old and on a Saturday evening she always wants to watch TV.
Their parents think it's okay.
But is this the way it should be?
Shouldn't television towards young children be forbidden?
On the one hand there are very funny and entertaining channels for kids, for example KIKA or Super Channel.
The children enjoy watching fantasy stories or interessting stories with a happy end.
When they get so early in touch with television it's easier for them to use other technoogical things later.
Maybe they see things on the TV they learn from.
On the other side there are many channels on the TV with aren't thought for children aged from two to five years.
Maybe they get shocked by the things they see and can't sleep again.
The possiblility that they get addicted is also very high.
They watch TV for many hours on a nice Saturday afternoon.
They haven't time to play with their friends.
My opinion is that so young children should enjoy their live playing with friends outside and go on an adventure by themselves.
They have enough time to watch TV when they're older.
Today, it is not rare to see little children playing with a smartphone or other electronic devices.
Since they are a few years old, they lern how to use such objects.
Why should not they be allowed to be taught at school using television advertising?
I agree with this statement for the following reasons.
Firstly, in todays population people starts to use tablets, computers and smartphones at a young age.
In the following years the technologie will improve and we will be doing every thing on a gadget, so the children should be used to it since they are little.
Secondly, the children may prefer learning with television advertising, than with books.
For them it could be more fun to watch short movies than reading a long text.
Otherwise there are also disadvantages.
By showing them videos, they are not going to improve reading and writing, although they do extra exercises to practise this.
In addition to that, little children could get addicted really quick to these electronic devises and may miss their childhood, by playing a videogame or watching movies instead playing outside with friends.
I personnaly think, that is a good way to teach little children, even if it may not be the best idea in the way that the will not have a big social life, because they are constantly
I disagree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
I think that parents can not avoid advertising while they are watching television.
The children should not be kept in their rooms just to not see advertisings, such as most of the parents will not stop watching  television or, as an alternative, will not only watch it at night time.
Anyways, who controls if the advertising is directed toward young children?
Also, the companies would lose a lot of money by deleting those advertisings and it would be bad for the economy.
I would rather say that some advertisings should only be shown after a specific time, as example after 9 PM.
A lot of sexualized scenes are shown which should not be seen by children.
Some other advertisings, which contain aggressive contents, or those who could afraid children, should be prohibited.
Children often do not understand their meanings or interprete them differently.
This can be very traumatizing or even damaging for their brains.
I would say that children can not difference between realistic and unrealistic scenes.
Later on they may have a different understanding in the world and have obstacles in life which were forced by those experiences.
But a fact is that the television and also advertisings belong to the new, technologic world.
If television advertising would be prohibited, you would have to prohibit all advertisings such as those on the smart phones and computers.
It would not make sense to only prohibit it on the television.
For me, it does not make sense either to only prohibit it for children aged two to five.
A six year old children is still very young and advertisings can also have a bad effect on them.
Parents should be responsible for their children and decide by themselves, if advertisings should be seen by their children.
It isn't quite easy to answer this question.
First of all it should be obvious that the television is directed to everyone.
Even young childern already grow up with it and are influenced by it.
The programm they watch influences them and so does advertising.
It's part of the programm like every other movie, series or whatever.
On the other hand childern want what they see, because it's new to them and they want to make new experiences.
That's natural.
The problem is that this behaviour can force parents to spend their money on these things and this can be dangerous during the hard financial conditions we're in at the moment.
For some people life becomens even harder like this, because they want to give their childern everything they want.
In addition advertising on  television is really annoying, because it interrupts the movie you are watching every few minutes.
Another important argument is the fact that the company which produces the ads can make a lot of money by selling what they offer.
And right now this is really important for the economy, since we're in a global financial crysis.
Because of the arguments I previously mentioned I clearly agree with the statement.
Myself I have a small sister and I can see how advertising on television already influences her.
Sometimes she comes to me and asks me to buy her things, even really expensive ones, for which I don't have the money.
I think most countries economy can take the hit it'll get from banning advertising on tv, but in exchange we can live a less sttessful life with at least one thinl less bothering us.
Young children are much more easy to influence then older peolpe.
So when there are televison advertising directed to young children there is a big chance that they just belive what they say in the television even if it is not true at all.
Also when a young child sees something that it likes it is very hard for the young child to realise that it is not importent to have all these things.
An other point is that younge children normaly do not have any money so it does not make any sence to make televison advertising directed toward young children.
It only makes a child wants something that they can not have and then it breaks a young childs heart.
When there is television advertising directed toward young children they learn how to deal with it early.
So the soon know that not every thing in a television advertising is absolutly true.
I think that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because a young child is so easy to manipulate and most of the people who make the advertising know that and it is just not right to ausnützen this.
First, I dont think that advertisments directed to children at the age of two to five would be worth paying for, because children in this age usually don't have much or any money at all.
So this means that the advertisement relies on a two to five year old child beeing able to persuade their parents into buying something they want.
I dont think thats a very good idea.
Additionaly most kids in this age dont watch a lot of TV or are surfing in the internet for a limited time per day, so they are not exposed to the advertisements very much, for example some of my relatives allow their kids to use electronic devices for just thirty minutes to one hour per day, and they dont watch a lot of advertisements in this time.
In addition a lot of people skip the advertisements with an ad-blocker in the internet or by switching to another channel when the advertisements start on TV.
So even if there is a lot of advertisement aimed towards young children, it's not very effective in my opinion.
About if advertisements should not be allowed, I dont really know.
Children in young age are easely so maybe we should try to protect them from the influence of the medias and big companies.
On the other side some channels on TV or some website in the internet need the money they get from showing advertisements to provide a free service, and with less advertisement and then less money maybe some smaller sites or channels or some that show a lot advertisements aimed towards children would not be able to exist as a free service and they would need to shut down or to demand money for their sevice.
In the end I think the ones publishing the advertisments and the ones that make it and pay for it just need to know for themself if they want to manipulate children or not.
I think television advertising directed toward young children isn`t anything bad as long as the advertised stuff is harmless like toys or food.
The worst thing that can happen is that the child wants it and asks his parents about it.
a child can`t afford anything because it doesn`t own any money.
it wouldn`t be too good if the child is obsessed with something it wants because it sees it all the time on TV.
But maybe then the problem is that the child is watching too much TV.
Maybe it`s also not fair, if the TV is manipulating the cildren with certain techniques in the little spots for children toys.
Or maybe the parents get annoyed by what the children now want next time they go shopping.
And if they don`t get what they want right away they cry and scream until they get what they want.
So maybe then its not that good to have televisoin advertising directed toward such young children.
but i think as long as it is in a reasonable amount and reasonable things it`s all right.
Advertising - danger for children?
We live in a world that's controlled by technology.
It's hard these days to manage the daily life without using your mobile phone or the internet.
As an adult you're even more affected of the use of technology than your children.
But the question is whether it represents a problem for young children or not?
Are the children negatively affected by the advertising in the TV?
Looking too much TV isn't good for the eyes, especially for small children which are developing, it represents a big problem.
All these children we see wearing glasses could have been watching too much TV in their past.
Doctors recommend parents to control the time which their children use for watching TV but in the most cases parents don't do this because they don't see the consequences.
It has to be said that they also can learn a lot by watching TV.
There are special programs made for children to learn the lanuage or even mathematics can be learned by watching some series.
On the other hand theirs a lot of advertising, every 15 minutes you can watch an advertisment and for adults it's most of the time pretty annoying.
When small children watch an advertisment which shows how other children play with their new toys they want also to own them so in conclusion the parents have to spend money on unuseful toys.
Many parents don't have enough money to buy all these expensive toys that are shown on TV so they have to disappoint their children which often leads them to ignore or even hate their parents.
An other point is also that it isn't controlled what's shown in TV.
The first advertisment could be about toys and the second about porn.
Children then watch things which aren't meant for them and influence their childhood in a very bad way.
That's why we hear about boys/man that touch girls on the street or even about rapes.
The childhood plays a big role in everyone's life.
On the one hand there's also a lot of 'useful' advertising like stuff for school for example pencils, bags, etc.
which can motivate youngsters to go to school or even begin learning more for school.
On the other hand the stuff shown on the screen is 10x more expensive than that in the shop so it could be a problem for poor families.
In my opinion I'm strongly against advertisment because it often more has a negative than a positive effect.
It can lead to problems when the children become older because maybe they see the world with different eyes due to the advertising in TV.
Advertising directed towards young children 

Last night when I was watching a rerun of a movie on TV I noticed that every 20 minutes of Film I had to fast forward the next fifteen to skip all the commercials.
Because of the change of nutrition fastfood companys gain a lot more money and can spend more on TV commercails.
Obviously most of the commercials are directed at young children since they are a lot more influencable then grown ups.
You could say that every company have the right to stream their commercial on TV if they pay for it.
This leads to a diversity of TV chanels wich are completely free and everone has acces to.
Also the TV channels have the possibility to stream more expensive content leading to a happier viewer.
On the other hand those commercial actualy have an influence on what children spend their money on.
If you look at the way people eat you can see that it has become more and more unhealthy and that lot of people, also the young, eat a lot of fastfood.
This is caused by all the ads on TV.
Also the influenced actions of the customer leads to a verry inefficent overproduction of goods wich then leads to foodwast and shortages or the overusage of natural resources.
In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed to advertise "bad" products towards young children for they are the new generation wich will one day be a majority.
I'd rather have a smart and healthy people desiding over my life.
AlsoI think we should go in the complete other direction meaning we should advertise more for a healthy and energy efficient lifestyle.
The goal of an ad is to show something to someone and make them to buy it.
So my question is, if children can get that feeling to buy something and if they even recognicethe ad.
The first thing that comes in my mind when I read this is, if children in that age realise that something is an ad or not.
Maybe they think it's just another show or series they can enjoy.
For example, if there is an ad for a doll, maybe an animated one, they dont realise that they could play with it or even recognise it as a thing.
In that case most of the children this young age I think wont see any difference between an ad or a normal tv show.
The other thing is, if they can feel the    urge to get something just by watching an ad or if they are just like "oh it's cool but I dont need it".
In the case a child saw an ad and really wanted it, they dont even have the goods to buy it or even don't know where to get it.
The other thing is, if children are watching tv with their parents they are confrotated with ads to.
Maybe it's not directed towards them but they'll see it too.
An other problem I see with this is, that there are other methods of showing an ad.
We are living in a time where maybe even childre be at the PC doing something.
I think online advertising is getting more and more popular.
So they might get confrontated there.
In the end I cant find anything, that speaks against advertising directly toward young children.
Everywhere we go, we get to see or hear ads.
And I think children will see or hear ad^s too.
Even if it's not through the TV.
Nowdays advertisment seems to be everywhere.
Whether in Magazines, Radio or on Television, companies are always trying to reach for people.
As annoying as it sometimes seems it is an important thing especially for new companies and their products.
The main aim is to reach the right audience for the product and the television seems to be the perfect medium.
Surely young and old will throw (even may a short)  glanze to a TV.
But is is right to show advertisment whitch are meant for young children?
What speaks for it is, that young children in these days watch a lot more TV.
A perfect way to show an advertisment at the break of their favourite show.The product is  meant for them so why shouldnt't they be able to see it.
But a problem that may occure is, they are children, still young and without the feeling of responsability.
They wouldn't be able to buy it on their own or to make a deal by themself.
What is the point of showing it to a part of the audience who couldn't buy by themself.
It would be of course the parents who have to grab into their wallet and buy it.
Children may get overwhelmed by all those products and want them all, which could turn into some unpleasants row between parent and child.All in all i think it is unneccesary to show an advertisment to such young people becaus
Most people all around the world in this century have a television at home and which they use regularly to watch for example the news.
In the case it is a family with young children the small kids will surely want to watch television with their parents.
It is normal that television channels use advertisement as a source of income.
These advertisements are directed towards all kind of groups of people.
Like for example advertisement of dog food for dog owners or also something simple as advertisement of toys for the young children who happen to watch television with their parents.
Now some people are saying that television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.
One could argue that these advertisements lead to the effect that young ones want their parents to buy whatever is advertised on the television and the parents being full of love and care can't refuse them and have to buy it for their kids.
On the other hand the children at this young age are not fully able to understand what is advertised and for what use that thing is which is on television.
But I know from my own experience with my 4 year old cousin that he always wants if he sees something advertised in television just because the advertisement looks like fun and makes him laugh.
At the same time it is also the job of the parents to not always pamper their child but also explain him or her why they don't need always that what is advertised in the television or the parents should not let their kids watch a lot of television because it is not healthy for their eyes at that young age anyway and they are only able to see the advertisement when they are watching television for a longer time.
Also in the case of that advertisment directed to young children should be banned the television channels may loose a big part of their income and also for the companies which are producing those advertisements will have an economic loss.
I personally am against this statement because children at that young age are probably not able to understand fully what is advertised and so there should not be any problems to let the television broadcast advertisement towards the children.
It is also the responsibility of their parents to control what ther children are watching on TV and to think if they really want to buy the thing their son or daughter wants to just because he or she saw it once in television.
I totally agree with this statement.
Kids in the age between two and five years pick things really fast up they see and hear.
They try to orientate on everything that seems interesting for their eyes and do the same.
Surelly they start to think on their own but it's pretty easy to influence their thoughts and their actions.
Of course this has an influence on the rest of their life because a lot experiences (pictures) are memorized unconciouss.
So when they see those advertisers, for example for Barbie they'll have this brand in their had.
Then they want one from their parents because the advertisers know how to get children on their side (the right music, colours, quotes etc.)
So they play with the Barbie for their hole childhood and it can happen that when they get older they'll have body issues because they've allways seen this Barbie in the Media, than at home and of course it get's somehow something to orientate on.
About the comment i said at the beginning that kids copy things they see.
So for example they see some kids playing with thousands of toys, their parents are of course lovely and everthings seems like the perfect family.
The children see those images and they "burn" into their head propably they'll wonder why it isn't like this at their own home because they can't differntiate from the real life and an illusion of life.
So they want those things they see and propably it's harder for them to understand that they can't have all of this beucause it's just unrealistic.
I think children should generally not watch television in this adge because you can't allways controll what they see and even if the advertisers are ment to be for this age, they're not allways good and you never know in which ways it will influence your own child.
Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not?!
In my oppinion I think the use of the television or even other electonic items should be forbidden for young children who are under the age of five.
I suppose that young children, in the age of their growing, can easily influenced by sozial media and can gret an incorrect picture of life and beauty.
When you grow up which the influence of the television or the Ipad or even when you are five and you already have a mobilephone than young children are not able to use and understand simple things.
For example when I was working on a pony farm I met a young girl who was maby three or four and I was upset when I sam that she was looking in a book and she could not turn the pages, because she used to read on her Ipad and she could not swich the pages over with her hands.
On the other hand, when you grow up with the experiance of social media and co. You will grow up earlyer than I did.
You learn how to life with social preassure in your young life and you learn how to handle it.
When you are only watching intelligent television series and informative documentarys than you can learn important things who might help you in your adult life.
In conclusion I belive the influence of the Internet is so based in our world that young parents have no chance to hide it from their children but it is important to protect the adventure of growing up and let our children enjoy a well, pleased and protected childhood without the influence of electonic stuff as the television.
Should advertising television towoard young children be allowed or not ?
In my opinion it should not be allowed.
First I want to talk about the generalIy letting children in this young age sit in front of the TV.
We all know it's easier to put our children infront of the TV, so we can do our work.
We also get the impression that our children can get smarter when they watch "good" TV, because it gives them a good source of useable information.
I'm saying no!
In the age of two to five it is of highest importance not to let your child sit infront of the screen.
You, as a parent, have the responsibilty to make good decisions for your child's future.
During the the 2nd to 5th year of live the essential brain connections are made.
These are not made by sitting infront of the box.
They are developed by using all their four senses and by exploring their world.
If your child doesn't make these necessary barin connecntion it won't be able to do them later.
Let's talk about an drastic example to show you what I mean.
Let's say you're really busy with work and you don't have enough money to pay someone, who looks after your daughter.
You can give Sarah your attention from time to time, but most of the time she is spending infront of the TV.
Questions I want you to think about: How is she going to learn how to speak?
How does she know how to use her fine- and gross- motor skills, when nobody goes out to play with her?
How is she ever going to be able to sozializewith other people when she's trapped in the house ?
My prediction is that this girl will be retared.
Not only won't she have the basic motor skill but also mentally she will be disturbed.
I think she will have difficulties sleeping since she hasn't been active all day and also develop a mental disorder since she's on her own and doesn't receive the needed love and attention of her caregivers.
Eventhough it's a exagerated example I ho All the essential skill are learn thourgh exploring the world.
Sitting infront of the TV and not beingexpoes to anything won't do any good for your child.
Regarind my explanation about not letting children spend time of the TV I think it's self- explaining that I don't support the advertisement directed to children.
If I were a parent, I would'nt want my child to watch advertisements who are not made for his or her age.
But I also would'nt want my child to watch television at all at this age.
In my opinion, children at this age should go outside and play with friends.
They should pass their childhood at the playground, discovering the world, and not sitting on the couch watching television.
If children can go outside, they can make friends for life and children who go outside to play are often healthier and less lonely, because they are moving and they are together with other children.
Children who only sit at home watching television in their freetime don't have the opportunity to make so many friends as other kids do.
Of course, I would allow my child to watch television,but only seldom and not every day.
And I would want to know what my child is watching on television.
So I totally agree with the statement.
Children shouldnt be watchig things witch are not made for their age.
The most of the advertisements are made for adults, and not for young children.
So I think it maybe would be a great idea to make a television channel just for children without advertisements.
On this channel, there should only be movies that are made for children.
They should'nt include violent content, so the parents know that on this channel, their child isn't watching anything what is not mentionned for the child's age.
Advertisement is something we see every day.
We may come across it at the railway station, on the radio, while browising the internet or just simply while watching TV.
It became something so common that we no longer question it.
But the advertisements have reached such an extent that there are now some targeted specifically towards children at the age of two to five years.
But thats not an issue, or is it?
Childern that age cant buy the products anyways, so why make a fuss about it?
In the end its the parents that has to work for the money to buy the products and its the parents who then also buy the products.
So the advertisements targeted at children are just other means to reach the parents.
Its kinda like putting the sweets right at the cash register at the super market.
They try to put the parents in a situation where they have to buy the products because their child wouldn't stop talking about it or maybe the child would even start crying or throw stuff around in anger at its parents.
This strategy uses the bond between parents and children to reach its means.
And I would even go that far as to say that they dont even care if they destroy these bonds.
Children left mentally scarred just because they had some silly fight with their parents over a toy or whatever.
Also small children are easily influenced by what they see or hear and some might argue that its good not to confront them with the bitter truth about life but telling them pretty lies might be just as bad.
I dont have any problems with the advertisement of products for young children, but I think its wrong to manipulate children.
Those Advertisements should rather be directed towards the parents.
So I think its bad to make advertisements specifically for children.
Nowadays many parents allow their children to watch TV.
But by watching TV the children might get very lazy and stop communicating with children in their age.
They won't  like to go play outside with their friends anymore.
What I've experienced is, that when children start watching TV they focus really hard on what happens, and if you try to talk to them they don't even hear you.That's why I think they can really get addicted to it.
In those young years it's also possible that because of the TV their eyes can get damaged.
On the oder side it can also be a good thing.
If they watch for example TV in english, even if they don't speak english, they once will start to understand it and can learn english in young years.
That might help them a lot when they start to learn english in school.
It can also be a good thing for the parents to make themselves calm down.
There are a lot of parents which are very stressed because of their children and can't even take a little rest.
With letting them watch TV they are able to rest for a little time and start doing things for themselves or housework they weren't able to do during the day.
I think it's important that the parents control the time while their children are watching TV and let them watch it just for example an hour.
For me the parents should learn to say no to their children.
If the children have to switch the TV off they will probably beg them to let them watch for a longer time, then the parents need to be strict.
In my opinion it's also important that they won't allow them to watch TV everyday.
So that the children like to go outside and learn to communicate with other people, for me it's also important that the parents go out with them.
They should spend more time with their children so that they don't have to let them watch TV just because they don't know anything other to do.
In my opinon television advertising shouldn't be forbidden, in the first part of the text I will speak about advertising in form of spots/scenes and secondly about advertising in shows hidden.
First we have to look at the television of the kids.
Kids usually have their own sender, where they watch their shows and movies.
So they advertising on this sender is mostly about toys and food, which doesn't harm their psychis like for example an advertising for a stripper webside.
Of course the kids will be somehow influenced by the advertising and they probably want to buy the showed product, but in age 2 to 5 they don't own money and it's still the decision of the parents if they buy it or not.
Secondly the advertising doesn't say what is bad and only says what is good so the kids don't think for example "I don't buy schokolade because the haribo advertising says it's bad".
So the advertising doesn't give them (vorurteile) about stuff.
I don't understand why television advertising should be forbidden, I mean in a supermarket are also big signs with advertising and it isn't forbidden.
And another point is that a lot of kids don't even watch television advertising, my 3 years old brother just switches the sender when advertising comes on.
In my opinion it clearly shouldn't be forbidden as long it doesn't change the kids opinion about major topics.
Televison advertising for older groups of childs is much more a problem because they have money and they will spend it on stupid stuff just because it comes in the television.
Now, we come to the advertising in the shows itself.
Like the main character who always drinks coke or eat pizza.
This is a bigger problem because the kids associate the good opinion about the character with the product.
For example the hero, which always drinks coke before a battle because it makes him stronger.
The result is that the kids will drink a coke and then they feel themself stronger.
This is bad because coke is not good for health and so it makes a wrong image of it.
It shouldn't be forbidden, but marked or said that like in the example coke damage your teeth or something like that.
(coke = coca cola)
Television advertising directed towards young children should be forbidden, because it influences them in the wrong way.
They are getting animated to ask their parents for games or clothes they do not need.
Further they are able to manipulate their parents into getting what they want.
The parents are almost forced to buy the desired things, because otherwise they would have magnificent problems at home with their children.
On the other hand, it is an advantage for the parents to always be informed abot the latest games or parks the could go to as a family.
They do not only send ads for the children but also for the parents, because they know that more than half of the kids on front of the TV are watching with their parents in the background.
I think that some of the ads are made specially for parents to get them into buying something for their kids or as a present for other families.
I personally think it is not a good thing to place ads on kids channels, because I do not like advertising in general and would not like my children being influenced by something I cannot control.
I think the kids have a right to watch their channels and not to be overwhelmed by information about things they would like to have but yet most of the time not really know what it actually is.
So to sum up my text, I do not agree with the statement and think it should be forbidden, so that we can protect our children.
What's in favor that television advertising should be directed toward young children is that maybe they get more tired and so they sleep better.
An other argument is that there are children who wake up better when the televison is on.
An important point is that it's also important what they look in the television and how long they look.
For example when they look every evening the children tv-show "Sandmännchen" before they go to bed it's not as bad as when they look the whole day "Spongebob" because some tv-shows aren't good for the brain of the little childreens.
Something that's again the televison advertising is that they maybe do nothing other as sitting infront of the television and so they don't have social contacts which are important for every human in every age.
It is also better when they would play outside for example in the garden because to be in the nautre is also extremly healthy for little kids.
In my point of view it should not be allowed the directed advertising of television toward young children because I think it's not good for their brains and creativity when they have this direct advertising.
It's more important that the play outside and with other little kids.
Sometimes it's also good for them when the play lonely in their rooms so they can talk with themselves.
In my opinions it's bad for them when the sit the whole day infront of a televison listening to unreal figurs.
So I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward yound children should not be allowed.
There many families who have a television in their houshold.
So often children are sitting in front of in their freetime when it's allowed by parents side.
But isn't it wors to put the children in front of the TV and let them watch?
There are many disagreements for it, but also some agreements.
The children are open minded and if you show them in their early years a childrenfriendly Sierie they maybe could learn something.
There are many Sierie about like Dora, the little pirates ore the einsteins who try to make a connection between a mean story and schoolsubjects.
Per example learning numbers, learning the alphabet or how animals live and so on... And if there's a houshold who the mother have to cook they can leave her children in front of the TV.
So the children can't disturb them.
There also some disagreements.
When the children are to long in front of it, they see to many advertisings and in this advertisings sometimes are not nessecery informations and stufs.
And if this advertisings directed to young childred they are going to be manipulated.
If they see a toy in the commercial they realy want that and the parents should buy it.
and if they have enogh money they will and if they haven't enough money the can't.
So thats the way to become very rich childrens and poor childrens.
First I thought why should the television not advertise towards young children?
Television advertising is the to make people want a certain thing.
You make them believe that they really need this new thing that they always see in the television.
A lot of kids are between two and five and they also want to play with the newest things they see on the TV.
On one side this is not bad, because the technology goes further and with selling things to play you can make a lot of money.
Money that they can use to produce cooler and newer things to play and also for themselves to feed their families.
On the other side it is bad to show this very young kids all this things.
They can not decide what they just want or what they really need.
So they want their parents to buy everything.
For example if little girls see horses to play in the TV they want one.
But the producer are smart and they produce horses in every size and colour.
Now the girls ask their parents to buy them one of this horses.
The parents ask: "Which one do you want?".
Now the girl has to decide if she wants the pink one, the purple one or the red one.
Every horse is beautiful in her eyes and she wants them all.
Often the things they show children in television advertising is very expensive.
Not every family has enough money to buy such things.
Now we have the problem that some children always have the newest and coolest things to play and other have their standard doll to play which are not bad, but it's not as cool as the purple, pink and red horses.
Sometime this is enough to start bully other children in kindergarden.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children is not a good idea.
Mostly it is too much stress for the families and also for the children, because they alway see what the other children have what they not have.
I agree beacause television advertising for young children is bad because very young children are very manipulative, and if they see something they want you can hardly get that out of their mind, also they don't own money neither they think about money, so they don't care how much a toy is.
In my opinion Television is anyways a bad place for very young children.
So i think we should lower the time that children watch TV anyways.
Television can be very inappropriet for children.
There are some exceptions in my opinion.
For example if childrens are watched by the parents or any other adults, so they can safe them from the inappropriet stuff, but can let them watch the series and films who are made for kids.
If kids watch Television they often come threw pictures or videos that aren't made for young eyes.
For example there are often naked girls in late night TV shows, but they aren't able to watch that because most of the times they go asleep early anyways.
But also over the day there are often disturbig videos and pictures seen, for example of injured people.
Alot of TV's nowaday have child safety, so if you set that up and put the TV in safety mode your children can watch good series on their own without the fear that so that can eliminate that problem ready.
Back to the main subject.
Adveristising companys see easy money in children and they proberly are in fact right.
If childrens see something they want parents often have to give in and go buy it for them.
But as soon as they bought it, the children have already seen another toy they want.
Children also believe everything thats said in the adversitisement and they don't listen to the parents who tell them that it's a lie.
In conclusion for the help of parents and to eliminate taking kids as victims of adversitising it think we should at least smaller the adversitiesments direct towards the chilren.
Also parents should lower the time kids watch TV anyways, because television often is a very inappropriet place for them.
So, I think it's save to assume that small children that haven't even reached the age of six aren't even remotely as accustomed to our influential world, especially when talking about how advertisement and other simmilar means aiming to make profit try to manipulate the consumer.
So my first thought would be to say that it's really a good thing to not allow big companies to manipulate children.
But then again you have to start wondering.
If a child really, really wants something badly, what does it do?
I mean, small children don't have any money.
They don't go into the next toy store to by the newest play set.
No, they go and ask their parents to by it for them.
And that's the important point for me.
Yeah, children are easy to manipulate, but it doesn't help the company to gain any profit as long as the child's parents don't by what was shown in the advertisement.
So in my opinion it's not the "evil television" or "greedy companies" that are the problem, but instead it's bad parents.
The child didn't decide to by something because the child can't decide to do so.
The parents are the ones who in the end go into a store and get the object in question, so it's also the parents' responsibility to make sure that they don't by something that, in their opinion, is not something their child should possess.
It's not the advertiser that's to blame here but they.
Now some people might argue that while a child won't be able to by something for themselves they can still scream, cry, fight, and generaly make their parents' live hell.
And then again,I don't think that's something the advertiser should be blamed for.
The parents have to make sure their child is raised in a way that teaches them propper maners, and while every child will probably try to get something by being loud at least once they have to be taught that this is not hiw live works.
You can't and you won't get everything you want right away, possibly you won't ever get what you want.
And if where honest, in the end we are not better suited to face daily manipulation than young children are.
Countless examples prove that.
wedding rings for example are present in the live of practically every married couple, at least in countries with a manely christian population.
But wedding rings started off as nothing more but advertisement by the diamond and yewelry market.
And I don't even want to start talking about war propaganda.
It's the darkest and, sadly, most successful kind of advertisement that I can imagine and has led people to fight to the death against what they thought was satan himself, but what would have turned out to be just another country with a slightly different culture.
So in the end I think that advertisement aimed at young children should be allowed.
It won't ruin the child's live and it's the parents' duty to make sure the child is prepared to face advertisement in the future.
And just because it's an interresting point to make I want to add a little bit more here.
It might be true that general advertisment towards children isn't bad, but what might be bad, at least in my oppinion, is advertisement dedicated towards a certain gender.
Because I think that that's one of the main reason for bullying.
Anybody should be allowed to like whatever they like and if a boy likea barbies then why should the media tell him not to like them.
And even worse, why should the media tell his school friends that that's not normal.
But I also know that this is a utopia.
something that can and will never happen.
Advertisement is supposed to be effective and that can only be true if it's also aimed at a certain demografic.
In the end I guess that this is a problem that won't be solved by society and it's once again important that parents support their child however they can.
So I guess this concludes my text.
The parents have to look after their children, not the media.
I think that children aged two to five are to young for advertising.
They can't decide what they need.
If a child sees a toy in an advertising it want this toy and it wants his parents to buy it.
And young parents perhaps can't say no to their child and in the next day this child sees another toy in the tv.
And when this child is a little bit older or when it is a teenager it could be that it is very polished.
And it's also possible that when these children are older they only have to buy all these things which they have seen in the advertising because they got everything they want when they were a child from their parents.
In my opinion telvevision advertising should only be allowed to adults or teenager.
Because children not even have money to buy this things.
If a teenager sees something in an advertising it could work and do a job to earn money.
Like this also a teenager could earn money and buy something they want.
That's the only good aspect of the advertising  in the tv direct toward teenager.
So a teenager don't get everything simply from his parents but it works for it and learns to fight for the things they want.
So I think televison advertising should not be allowed to young children because like this they don't learn to deal with money and for them it's normal that they get everything they want.
Television advertising directed towards young children isn't an easy thing to discuss about.
On one side it may leads to more creativity and ideas.
On the other side it's a deangerous thing because children get an unrealistic picture of how everything workes and how poeple are supposed to be or how they are supposed to look like.
For example Barbie with her long, blonde hair and small legs.
But this is not realistic at all, it depends on the genes and other factors.
Another aspect against advertising towards children is that many spots versprechen way more than the product really does, they cheat by putting in sound effect and interesting background as well as computer animation.
Children ecpect these things to be exactly as they have seen it  in television, they aren't able to see how the actual product will feel to play with.
In fact, advertising is an easy way to find the perfect gift for christmas or your childs birthday.
But do you really want your child to play on a gameboy, feeding some unreal animals, instead of going out, playing with other kids or going to the zoo?
I think that this in something very terrible.
Kids in this young age need to go outside and play with others, learn from playing '' real life'' and from communication with others.
This is the bestway for kids to grow and learn.
Beacause ot this, i'm against advertising,
Nowadays, no matter what you are watching, the television advertising interrups the movie or whatever you watch at the most interesting moment.
The following ten minutes there appears some advertisements for every age also for children.
But what is the reason of that?
Should not children be children and enjoy their life?
On one hand, children aged from two to five mostly watch television because their parents are occpued and need some silence.
It makes no difference which channel you are watching, advertisements are everywhere also some which are directed toward young children.
I can totally understand the commercial industry that they advertise their products and try to sell them.
Especially little children normally want to have everything they see and of course the television advertising is much more decorated with some technical skills that it looks more extraordinary and makes the child wishing it.
On the other hand,advertising with games for exemple while the children are watching television has some negativ aspects.
Firstly, in the mind of the children there appears the wish for that thing they just have seen.
They want to have the seen product immediately.
Often if a child want to have something it  asks their mother but if she says no, the terror starts.
It screams in hope to get the toy but mostly the mother is stronger and lets the child crying until it calms down again.
In my point of view, children aged two to five should not sit in front of the television.
They should rather go out, play around, let their energy out and maybe make some new friends.
If many children would do that we would not have to ask the question if television advertising directed toward young children is allowed.
My personal opinion is, that children should enjoy their movie they are watching without interruptions, because if they are interrupted all the time, they are not able to get the chance to understand the content of that what they are watching.
The memories of my youth.
Always after school i would get on the couch and turn the tv on and watch the kid network in my country for a decent amount of time.
There was one thing that really got on my nerfes even today and that is advertisments.
There were so any ads on tv I even messured with a stop watch how long the comercials break were.
They were or they still are up to ten minutes which for my little self was a lot.
Sometimes i beg my mom or dad that they buy me the stuff in the ads.
A childs brain is like a sponge of informations: It soaks all information in that the world confronts it with.
So it remembers all commercials and toys that got shown in tv.
But there are also ads that help the children.
For example the school materials that get shown in the kid channel are superb.
They get prepared for school.
The school ads help also the children to like the school because in the ads the school always looks like it is fun and cool.
But my opinion i think the commercials in childrens tv should be banned because it creats an image of capitalism and i think the only true form of a state is a state of communism.
In communism all the people are equal and there would never be a competitions of products and without a competition there won't be ads.
We sould take notes of mother Russia and support it on it's way to a state of communism.
Glory to the Communism!
I think in the age of two to five, children shouldn't watch TV.
Their childhood would be better if they'd go outside and play with friends.
I think advertising in TV directed to young children is pretty stupid, because they belive everything they see or hear.
I mean, as a kid I told my grandfather everything I heard and made him believe me, because I thought that this was the truth, just because the influence of my surrounding was very big.
I hardly ever watch TV, but when I do, the adverts are mostly stupid and not really realistic.
The children would watch these stupid adverts and believe everything.
They would be influenced by TV and the parents have it harder than ever to help their children grow up in a good way.
To be honest, I don't want to see the next two or three generations grow up.
I can't stand the young children now.
They all run around with smartphones and at home they watch TV or play videogames.
If they get even more influenced by  TV it will get worse than now.
So in my opinion it should be forbidden to make adverts for young children, they should have a childhood, not growing up in front of an influencing TV.
Since the last few years technology made a big step forward.
Every family in Europe has at least one tv at home and is watching it one or more times a week.
Today is it impossible to grow up without these things (like tv, internet...) and because of this we are confronted with the enormous development since our youth.
In school we have to be able to say what's going on in the world and the most of young people don't like reading the newspaper.
The same is for the young Children (aged two to five).
Parents are often busy and let them watch tv when they haven't time to play or talk with them.
For the children it is like learing the language and understanding the connection between humans and their life.
So when they are watching tv and it appears an advertising about a product for example a choclat drink and they were talking about how healthy this is, the child thinks that this is so.
But we adult persons (most of us) know, that this could be also fake or not right.
The same in an advertising with a for example young man smoking, It shows the young children that smoking isn't something terrible and unhealthy.
They see just the good in this situation, like the smile of this young guy or how he enjoys the smoking.
In my opinion there are too many advertising in the tv.
I wouldn't say that the advertising is at all worse but it shows often not the reality about product.
Just the good side of it, so that the persons which are seeing it buy it later.
On one hand I don't like these advertising in the tv, especially when I think about the fact that young children watch the same as me.
On the other hand it isn't everytime so bad.
We learn new things about new products and we keep in touch with the development of the technology, nutriation etc.
Because of this I think is it more  importante how the children grow up or more how the parents handle with this situation.
About the influence of advertisement on young children.
Television advertisement has increased in the past ten years.
The amount of information people are confronted with is crazy.
Companies are promoting their products in the best way they can to sell it.
But regarding the young children, who are often watching television these days, we must consider the damages which the streams of advertisement may cause.
If we take a look at all the advertisements there are not only harmless types of them.
There are the kinds who are showing things that are inappropriate for kids in young ages.
And there are the types that are pretending that life is perfect and life gets better by eating a 'snickers'.
They are showing a false view on the word and humanity.
Of course, we are old enough to know that advertisements tell a lot of lies but children believe almost everything they see.
So if there are advertisements made for young children to see, they are speaking directly to them and making them think they way like it is shown in the commercial.
The commercial is made for selling as most as possible and like that children get trained to think in a way that is only positive for the companies.
Children should not be confronted with that type of material.
The companies are searching  for the easiest way of tricking people into buying their products.
So they are just using children, because they believe everything you say.
Another side to that would be that you can use commercials to do good to children.
There are of hundreds of television programmes made for children which are trying to teach them important lessons for their lives.
If you can make a way of using commercials in the same ways that those programmes do, then it is totally appropriate.
But regarding the selling goals and the bad kind of influence it is not okay to confront children with masses of advertisement.
I think that children should discover the world with a free mind.
I guess they have the right to think for themselves and be protected of the crazy business world for just a little longer than the first two to five years of their life.
I agree with this statement 

The reason is that young children are very "easy to catch."
That means if they see something in the television they want to have it, because they can't make the difference between something they need or they don't need.
They don't have to work for money the parents have the money and normaly they get everything they need and want.
The children are the weak point of the parents and they want to see their children smiling or laughing and not crying.
Big companys with products that are for the consume are so brazenly that they make advertising where you see some nice teddybears or some cute animals and stuff like that.
The problem is at this point, small children make a links between objects and feelings.
For example if they see a teddybear they want the hug him or if they see a ball they feel happy and want to play with it.
If you look at a old Mc Donalds advertise there was Ronald Mc Donald the friendly clown who played with some people and children who were in a Mc Donalds restaurant  and if a small child sees that he or she want to go to a Mc Donalds too because they think they can have fun there.
In videogames advertisings for small children not Call of Duty something like a racing game you see small children who sit at the TV and play the game they laugh and have fun together and if someon sees that who is not very old thinks that is the only way to have fun and he or she want to buy it.
At the end I think that it will be hard to make a law that says it is forbidden to make comercials that are for joung children because who has the right to say this advertise is for young children and this for children over five years?
Many people agreed with the statement that Televisoin advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
But there are also some people who disagrees with this statement.
What are the arguments for letting children watch televison advertising and what arguments are there for not letting them watch televison advertising?
I think one raeson why children shoulden't see television advertising ist that children in the age from two to five are really easy to ipresionate and to maipulate.
So if they make a very impressionate advertising for barbies or other toys, the children want to have those things.
The parents will have the problem, because they can't buy everything that their child sees in the television.
On the ther hand we can also say that the children might learn something from those advertisings.
Maybe they can learn new words, and expend their language.
But the advertising can also have a bad influence on the children, beacause when they see a person or the hero of the szene, and they wan to act like them.
So they began to imitate the character that they have seen, beacause they were really impressed.
But the characters of an advertising can have also a good influence on the children too.
In my opinion children in the age from two to five shoulden't watch television anyway.
They should go out and play with theitr brothers and sisters and not sitting on the couch and watch televison.
I don't think that television isn't bad in general.
For people who are older, I think that watch televioson can be a good way to relax or to learn something for exaple in docomentarys.
So I agree with the staement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
TV advertaisemetent has boomed in the last few years.
More and more also young children are directed by advertaisement with the goal to provocate their needs for buying a having new things.
But should Television advertisisng directed towards young people  be forbidden?
A pro-argument to the prohibition is that young children, don't have the ability to form a personal opinion yet.
They learn and grow by seeing, hearing and listening.
That's why they are easy victimes and "clients" for the advertisment.
They are powerless against what they hear, see and listen to and believe therefor everything.
On the otherhand, young children don't have the possibilties to buy new things on their own.
They are looked and "controlled by their parents" who, in the end, have the decision over how to spend the money.
So advertisement for young Children doesn't always make sence.
An other arguement is, that children stand under the influence of advertisement growing up and that this can have influence on their lifes later on, such as the way they buy and think about the world, The advertisement can also misslead the Children's interpration of happiness and what really counts in life.
They will associate happines and success with materialistic stuff andalways having the newest things.
I pointed out more reasons to prohibid advertaisement for young childrenen, but what I think is, that it doesn't make a difference and that it's hard to stop advertasient.
Young Children will always stand under influences of the outside praising and telling things and somehow they have to learn to deal with it.
In my opinion what really counts it, that parents transmit and teach the children the right ways of living and interprating things, also telling them that not everything we see and hear is true.
Children should grow up learing what really counts and not let themself be influeneced by what the outside world and the trends say so much.
I Therefor say no, it doesn't make sence to forbid advertaisement and that if there are people who don't like their children to watch advertisement on TV, than they shouldnt let them watch T
I disagree with the statement.
The young children with an age of two to five years have a massive influence to their parents.
If your advertising is made well, you can promote your product very well.
The kids will cause their parents to buy your stuff.
Ideal to make high profits without a massive marketing budget.
As an entrepreneur this is perfect for low end products with low production costs and a bad quality.
Kids are the market of tomorrow.

Almost every child nowadays that lives in the developped world has the opportunity to watch television every day.
There are even some channals that are especially made for children.
In those channels the little ones can watch series all day long.
Between every series will appear adverts which are also made especially for children.
These adverts, for example adverts for toys, will make the kids want the products really hard and the children will go to their parents and make them buy them the toys or whatever the advert is advertising for.
It's clear that the products made for children must also do some advertising because if they don't do, how could they sell their products then?
I can understand why parents don't like those adverts, because when they go shopping and take their children with them, the children will penetrate them every second because they see something they have seen in the adverts and with time this sucks.
But if parents don't want their children to do this they should'nt let them watch television.
There are many other possibilities to let kids watch series or movies.
For example there is a tablet, which I don't remember the name of, where children can download series and movies and there aren't any adverts.
I know this because I have a little sister.
Another way which is a bit more time consuming is to download the series or movies in the internet and then the children can watch them on the computer or on the television.
I think it's okay that the companies do advertising for children, because if parents don't want their children to watch those there are other possibilities to show them movies or series.
There are also other ways to entertain the kids, for example the parents can play games with them.
I thing that it's hard to say if it's good for little kids to watch television or not.
Because we people grew up with the social media.
It depend for how long we watch and for how many times.
Pro: If you want to do something for example cooking dinner you can put your child in front of the television and he is looking at the programm.
It's very helpful beacause we can do oure own things without looking or playing with the child.
The child would be concentrate on the Tv show.
Pro: There are lot of intelligent Programm.
The young childrens can learn a lot of things.
For example: The moves or a melodie of a song.
It's good that they are doing "healthy programm"  because it's less dangerous to become stupid.
contra: Maybe two years it's a little bit to early to put his child infront of the televison.
Of the age of four it's the best older to start.If we put them with a early age infront of the Tv the child would be used to watch it too much.
That's really bad because a young person should have other interst for example playing games or drawing.
Contra: There are a lot of stupid Programm and a little child could copie this bad things and could become stupid as well.
I think it's bad to watch every day television but if it's not every day and not to long it would be fine.
There ara some reasons why you would show or not show the television programm to achild aged two to five.
One of those pro arguments is that it is very easy to entertain a child with the television because there is something going on all the time and entertaining such a little child can sometimes be very exhausting and parents dont have infinit power to do that, the TV is also good at keeping a kid calm, wich is very exhausting too, so it doesent cry and shout all the time.
the same thing if the parents are working and have a babysitter for theire child.
but there are some intelligent programms too wich tell good maners or how to deal with complicate situations in live.
A contra argument is that if children, especially as young as those we're talking about, don't get enough time and love from theire parents it can effect theire "evolution".
Also if children don't go out to play with other kids they don't learn how to deal with other humans or kid of theire age somethig else is that if they don't move enough it may decrese theire motoric skills so that tey are worse in sports than other children.
An other one is that if they always get entertained by a TV they don't learn how to entertain themselves an may get less creative.
I think it shouldn't be forbiden, it's the responsebility of the parents but they should know how to use television if there is a young child.
"The new 'Baby Born' only for 9.99CHF" say an advert directly directed toward young children between age two and five.
Many companies try the advertise their products towards the young children to make more profit.
With this they overgo the parents and try to get the kid to want their product.
Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Just imagine that your kid sees these cool things in the TV every day.
It will animate the kid to watch TV more often since it wants to see more nice products and that is not good for the kid.
Kids should be playing outside and not watch TV advertises because the radiation from the TV is bad for childrens eyes.
Furthermore the children can't buy these products themselves.
This leads to more internal arguments in the family since the kid wants something it saw and the parents probably don't want to buy it for the kid.
Just think about yourself when you were a kid.
Alot of things didn't make sense to you because you didn't understand your parents sometimes.
For example when you wanted a realy nice, new toy but your parents just did not want to buy it for you.
Most of us have probably cried because of that and had fights with their parents.
This leads me to my last point.
Children are still easy to manipulate but doing so is ethicaly incorrect.
Just think about yourself again when you were younger, you believed nearly everything someone told you.
You were realy naive and thought that everything they tell you is probably right.
Using that attitude to just sell more products to innocent children is a very bad thing to do.
This leads me to my conclusion.
If these firms want to sell their product they should advertise directed towards the parents of children and convince them that their product is good for the kid.
With a law against advertises directed towards young children we can protect our future generation and give them a better childhood in many ways.
Do not let the innocence of children get used any longer and support this new law.
Vote for it on September 22 of 2016.
Just do it!
Young children are influenced a lot, especially by television advertising.
They are very interested in things that move or make noises.
So television advertising which is about some toys and is directed toward young children is an extremly clever move from the company.
When a Child sees some of these advertisings it is fasctinating by the object or the product they want to sell right away.
They tell their parents what they saw and that they want them to buy it.
Most of the time the parents buy it because they want to make their child happy.
In this case it's very good for the company and they sell a lot of their products.
But on the other hand if the advertising is not about a product but about a place like Disneyland, it's also good for the company but not very fair for the children.
Because not all about an advertising is true.
Often the company exaggerate a lot and try to make the thing, they want to sell, look nicer.
In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children, doesen't make any diffrence to advertising which is directed toward adults.
Of course children are a lot easier to convince but in the end the parents have to be convinved by the product because they buy it.
Advertising directed toward young children

This kind of discusion is very difficult becuse there are reasons which are for it and against it and advertising in general a problem for anybody in some ways.
An argument which agrees with the statemant is, that young children should be protectet of some violence and sexual pictures because we don't know how children realize them and what these pictures or videos are doing with their minds.
But often it is a problem to protect children from bad advertising, because in this time you can find advertising everywher and you can't controle everything.
So it is also difficult to control and forbid advertising which is directed toward children.
I think to influence children in a way that somebody has a profit of it is alway bad, but many people do it and.
Young children think diffrent to us and that is the greatness of to be young and we shouldn't exploit it.
At the end I think you can't forbid advertising, but advertising which directed toward young children should be forbiden.
I think young children between two and five do really like watching television.
They usually watch cartoons or some series that explain things and why they are like they are in a very easy way.
Of course they also have to watch the advertising, because nearly all channels do advertising.
The advertising that is directed to young children is mostly advertising for games.
Children as we know are getting influenced very easy.
Advertising is a kind of influencing, because the goal of advertising is to make the people, in this case the children, to buy or consum the things they see in tv.
Now should advertising for children be forbidden?
Children between two and five are not able to do the last step I described on top.
They can not buy or consumate the things they see in tv, unless their parents are buying it for them.
Now you could say, that if children watch advertising they go to their parents and just argue with them until they get the things they saw on tv.
But if that happens, the parents are in my opinion just very weak.
And who says that the things they advertise for in tv are just bad and unusefull?
Maybe the child watchs something in tv and  shows it to her mother and she thinks that is a good thing and buys it.
So I think you can not forbid advertising for children.
I disagree with this statement.
Sure there are many reasons to support this, but thinking logically, I really can't agree.
The main reason is because we are living in a free country and I think everthing that doesn't damage another person should be allowed.
Even if it doesn't help anybody, people should be allowed doing it if they see a personal improvement.
We could say that these advertisings are bad for our children, but if this is a fact, why do you let them watch it?
It's the minime risk you would take for giving your children more freedom.
I really don't want my kid brainwashed by this publication rubbish, but since I'm free to decide what I'm doing here, I'm not against it.
Imagine they wouldn't be allowed, how should they be promoting their products?
If people have problems with advertisings, they must also have a problem with the product they're selling.
So if an advertising is so bad for children that it can't be played in television, don't you have to ban the actual product it's all about aswell?
Before trying to shut down others, you have to try helping yourself first!
Children at a young age are very easy to manipulate,if I maysay so.
If they see a commercial on television they will probably believe it, even if it does not make any sense.
So should we ban advertisments directed to young children?
Of course, if we talk about advertisment that tells our children to do stuff that could harm them it would not be clever to let channels broadcast this type of advertisment.
But I am sure we are talking about the advertisment that tells the children to buy that cute Elsa dress or that cool new toy.
Personally I think that  they should be allowed.
Children at that age are not able to buy the things they see anyway so why abolish the advertisments?
When I was young I always wanted the newest doll I saw on television but did I actually get it?
No!
My parents told me to play with the things I already have and be grateful for them since it is not common for every child to have toys.
After somedays I would forget about that doll and just play with my other toys which were just as good.
Kids are vulnerable so we have to pay attention to what we choose to show them and what not.
I think that the music videos of women getting sexualised (not to sound like a hardcore feminist) are way worse to them than a commercial by Disney and their new toy.
So maybe we should not allow channels tohowing nudity at a time when kids are watching television.
I also think that the advertisment could be helpful to parents that do not have any idea of what to buy their children, especially during the Christmas season.
Growing up my brother and I sometimes did not know what we wanted for our birthday or Christmas so our parents could always turn the television on and see what could interest us.
To summarize I do not think that advertising directly towards little kids is that bad.
It can have its pros and cons whereas I think it does not have really somethign negative of which I could think of at least.
Parents need to tell their children that they should not be greedy and have joy with the things they have.The child will probably understand it and just move on.
And like that the whole "problem" is solved.
During your favourite TV show you see a lot of Television advertising.
This has a big influence to our consumer behavior.
Moreover to children Television advertising has a big influence.
Therefore Television advertising directed toward children should not be allowed.
Television advertising should not be allowed toward children.
Children who are aged two to five cannot make a different between something good or something that they do not need.
Furthermore you can influence children very well.
And that is the point which the Television advertising - maker are using.
They are showing advert exactly at the time children are watching Television.
I know this at my own experience.
Everytime I saw this advert with the pink little unicorn I ran to my parents and ask them if they buy this for me.
I wanted this unicorn so much but at this time I got it I played two times with it.
Therefore I wanted to say that children in the age of two to five cannot judgde if they need something or not.
People who do this advert do not allowed to produce advert directed toward young children.
In this case I think Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
But on the other hand advert has a positive influence towards the economy.
People will buy more because they know more things to buy.
Therefore children are the perfect victims.
In this case I think Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed

To sum up I think Television advertising is important for the economy.
Nevertheless I think children does not be using as victims for this.
You can take a big influence to children.
My opinion is that Television advertsising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
First of the eastiest way to sell a product to the public is by selling it to their children.
Studies show that if  children see a product, they want to have it immediately, which results in them naging until they get the thing they desire.
So companys use this methode to sell the products more effictively.
Nevertheless making advertisements to an audience that is still to young to understand what that product is even about is just mean and unmoral.
Children at the age of two to five are in the learing phase of their life, they absorb everything around them what is happening and what could happpen.
Personally I believe that an advertising agency should only start targeting children at the age of around seven.
At that age they begin to understand what is happening and they may even grasp the sense of the product.
Plus the advertiments, that target the young aged audiance of two to five are really simple and idiotic.
But because those adverts are so immensely simple and idiotic the viewers that saw said advert will not forget it immediately.
On the other hand children are the parents best investment, so if kids like a product the parents will believe that, that product is exactly what their child needs.
Eventhough, I believe banning television advertisers to target infancy aged kids is not correct and should be banned, the toy companys that bring out toys for that age group don't have an really have an alternative.
To sum up, targeting infants for advertising should be prohibited, though with the exclusion of toycompanies.
The question is if it is allowed to bring people to think they have to buy what is in the advertise.
And is a company responsible for the impression on the people of her advertise?
Advertisements can blow the mind of the consumers and influence them in her habitute buying some stuff.
They also can bring the consumers to think they really have to buy this products.
But is it the responsibility of the law to forbid that normal businness progress?
Isn't it sad that people cannot stand against some few advertisement and need a law to protect themselves?
Yes, it is sad because we cannot be able to stand against a stupid advertise and we buy their product just because it is told us in a short clip in the television or anywhere else.
But now we talk about young children who do not have a strong mind like grown up people.
If a young kid sees some advertises of cool stuff to play with, it is obviously that the kid wants to have this and do not stop until it gets it.
But now that is the responsibility of the parents to be strong and either to forbid the kid to watch advertisements or television, which would be good anyway, or to be strong in don't buying them any stupid toy which they want to have.
But it would be sad if the law will solve this problem and forbid the marketing progress from companies, because it is not that bad as i mentioned in the text here.
It all depends of the amount of consumation.
Some toys are good for the kids and why shouldn't they get a toy they want to?
Right, they should get but not every single toy.
If you get all what you want in your childhood you won't have it easy in your future life.
So yes, it should stay allowed.
It's a good exercise to be resistant against this influences.
I personally disagree with this statement.
There are important argumentations which should be considered.
First of all the negative aspects.
Parents should not force their children to do such an advertisement.
When the children grow up they could be ashamed of themselves.
If the friends of the child is seeing him on televison, he or she could be treated badly for some reasons.
Parents could leed them to a TV-star career, as well as the child did not want to.
So it will not be happy for the rest of his or her life.
Now we move on to the positive aspects.
If the family is poor and they need money urgently, this could be the only way to escape from their financial situation.
Another reason could be if the child wants to be in the advertisement and the parents cannot reject it.
In addition not that intelligent children can be used to complete such an easy task or if their school has not a good education level.
To sum up,in one hand I would not let my child play in an advertisement but in the other hand it should not be forbidden.
There are some good positive aspects and every family should decide itself.
I think it should not be allowed to direct advertising toward young children, because they do not have any money and can anyway not buy anything.
It is very easy to manipulate young children that they want to buy everything they see.
Children`s brain isn`t enough developed, so they shouldn`t be involved in affairs, which cost money.
The problem is that the infants tell their parents about the things they want.
There are some parents, who can`t be enough severe to their children, so the parents do what the want.
The children are able to manipulate their parents.
But in general such young children aren`t able to make decision, which are connected with cash.
Nowadays children watch too much television that are are so much influenced by electronic devices.
In my opinion children shouldn`t be allowed to watch television every day.
Advertising for children are not just in television.
The advertisings are every where.
Generally I think it is not good that children get influenced by television.
In my eyes there are enough other things like advertising in brochures or newspaper, but in television it should be prohibitted to manipulate children with clever advertising.
When I was an little child, I was not allowed to watch TV.
Nowadays sellers shouldn`t be allowed to sell things with this method
