# NLP-Bachelor-thesis
This is the GitHub code repository for the bachelor thesis : Clustering 
the arguments from the learners' essays and their applications. 

This python project consists of mainly 2 parts: 
1. **Utility python file** (ThesisUtility.py): contains the implementaion of all funcitons that
we use in this project
2. **Jupyter notebook files**: for example (FastText.ipynb) represents the
the function call for each of the mentioned approaches in the thesis.


The folder name always contains the corresponding .ipynp file the is responsible for this experiment

## **How to run the code?** 
In order to run the code, do the following :

1. Go to the desired .ipynb file of the experiment you want to run.
2. In the constants section which contains the paths to all directories/files/excel sheets used in this experiment
3. By default the paths are already assigned, if you want to change the path, make sure it references to an existing folder/file/excel sheet
4. Run all the cells in the .ipynb file and one or multiple excel files will be produced after that with the results. 


#### _All folders named with "unnecessary" are only for testing purposes, so leave it untouched please!_
