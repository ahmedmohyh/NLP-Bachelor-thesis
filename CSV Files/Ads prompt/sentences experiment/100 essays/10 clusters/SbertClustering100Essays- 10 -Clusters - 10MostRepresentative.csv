0,"Children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product.",0
1,"But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy.",0
2,"They will then ask their parent to buy it, but a lot of parents cannot spend as much money at toys even if they want to.",0
3,"And if the parents have a lot of money and don't care about what they buy in the first place, why not show these children some cool toys on TV to make them happy?",0
4,"And if they parents don't look up details about that item and just trust their child because it makes it happy, the child might end up with a broken toy, which will make them even more sad.",0
5,"Children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them.",0
6,Some parents will maybe buy the toys and then do not have enough money left for other things.,0
7,"And in the advertisin they show the newest and coolest toys and when these young children look at them, they emidiatly whant to have them.",0
8,"Especially kids at a very yound age really want to have a toy, then play with it for a while before loosing interest.",0
9,"That is a problem because parents do not want unhappy childreen and then they have to say to their child, he would not get the toy.",0
10,But there are also some reasons for advertisements towars young children.,1
11,"On the other hand children are learning very much in this part of life, so the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products.",1
12,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",1
13,On the one hand young children have to learn how to deal with advertising.,1
14,Advertising addressed to young children can create both a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing one's life.,1
15,Children should decide themselves what they want and advertising helps them to gain information about the things they could possibly need.,1
16,Another point might be that children aged two to five are not interested in advertises and even if they are they have no opportunity to get what they want without their parents.,1
17,On the other hand the advertising could help the parents find out what the children want.,1
18,"I can understand that companies direct their advertising towards young children, because in that age, children can be manipulated very easily, and while adults and other children are better able to decide wether they actually need the advertised product, they only care about the great video and not about what the product actually is.",1
19,"On one hand itÂ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children, because the children in the age of two to five canÂ´t say anything about there own opinion, because they are to young to say it.",1
20,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",2
21,"The Children probably don't even understand the television advertisment, but the parents like the advertisment more when it is a well made advertisment.",2
22,"Its much more important that young children learn something in books or outside then watching television advertising just made for them and in the young age its easier to get in that children mind and to let them think what they should think about ther product, so that they want to buy it or the parents should buy it and when they dont buy it the young children are sad.",2
23,"Advertisement for children does not have to be a bad thing, it can be used to influence them so that their behaviour will have a positive effekt on society and nature.",2
24,To come to a conclusion I am of the oppinion that with the right leading from the parents even young children could navigate through the jungle of television advertising and they will learn how to deal with it.,2
25,"On the one side it should be allowed to show such as these advertisments, because the children are more informed, what is in trend and can compare with other children.",2
26,I think children maybe donÂ´t want advertising that is directed toward them.,2
27,Advertising addressed to young children can create both a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing one's life.,2
28,On the one hand a confrontation with this kind of advertising could be bad on the other hand children can only learn from it if they are confronted with it and learn to spectate advertising from other perspectives.,2
29,"On the one hand, children are constantly confronted with all sorts of advertising, as they watch television.",2
30,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",3
31,"Young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but itÂ´s not the right way, I think.",3
32,In the end I can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 2-5 must be allowed to interfier with that.,3
33,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,3
34,Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.,3
35,In my view young children aged two to five should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents.,3
36,It is not good when young children watch too much television.,3
37,"Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.",3
38,I think it's okay if children want to watch television.,3
39,But watching too much TV in general is not advisable for young children because they should play outside and think for their own instead of just getting their stories delivered through the TV.,3
40,"The most important point for this statement is that the children should not sit in front of the television all the time, they should go and play outside on a playground whit ther parents or ther friends.",4
41,But an important thing is also that there are lots of educating movies and series which help the children to live or preparing their life.,4
42,Children in this age should go outside and enjoy their childhood and do not sit inside infront of the television or other media.,4
43,"In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life.",4
44,So the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people.,4
45,"ItÂ´s better to show them, how to handle with television or games or something like that, because the children are learning for their lifes and not just for the moment.",4
46,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,4
47,My second reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours after hours tv and so they would  not focus on there future work lives.,4
48,But often young children can learn something by watching television.,4
49,"The kids have to whatch films and series to learn also from them , who made for the children, but they dont have to have a Television for him or herself.",4
50,Nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches TV.,5
51,Television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society.,5
52,"
Advertises are often shown in the TV.",5
53,"On the other side, advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television.",5
54,"Nowdays, advertising is a normal part of the television.",5
55,Besides they are confronted with advertising anyways for example in the supermarket or the streets or magazines.,5
56,Television advertising has a big role in modern society.,5
57,That is the normal reason to produce advertisings.,5
58,"So if they watch TV, an advertisement could easily make them want to have the product shown in the advert.",5
59,Another point ist that there is not just advertisment on television but also in the shops or by games on smartphones.,5
60,"I agree with the following statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",6
61,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",6
62,So it may occure the question whether TV advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) shoud or should not be allowed.,6
63,Personally I think that the Television advertising directly towards young children should not be allowed because the children are in they own developement aged two to five.,6
64,"In the following I tell you my oppinion of the question, if Television advertising directed toward young children between two to five years shuold not be allowed.",6
65,"There are different oppinions to the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two or five)should not be allowed.""",6
66,"So I think that television advertising toward young children should be not allowed, because they are too young and can be manipulate.",6
67,"So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should not be allowed, because in this age children started making their first social contacts, which is very impotant for their growing up.",6
68,"Summarising all points I can conclude that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because of the negative impact this could have on their development and because of them being not reasonable enough to make their own decisions and to realise whether something is good or bad",6
69,All in all I would say that I donÂ´t agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because I think that there is nothing to worry about if  little children come in contact with television advertisements.,6
70,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,7
71,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,7
72,But often young children can learn something by watching television.,7
73,"However the television can be nessecary, because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep.",7
74,Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.,7
75,Nowerdays childreen spend lots of their time watching television.,7
76,Also one has to add that young children aged two to five normally do not watch TV that often.,7
77,When they look tv the children are independent of this media so they can't live without watching tv.,7
78,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",7
79,"So it can start to be really annoying, especially for parents, if kids will never stop talking about wanting what they just saw on the TV.",7
80,In the following I will discuss this statement.,8
81,In the following I will present my opinion on this topic.,8
82,In  the following text I am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.,8
83,In my opinion i agree with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples.,8
84,In my opionion there are two sides to this statement.,8
85,But I think everybody have to think about that statement on his own to have an own opinion about it.,8
86,In this essay I am going to give some arguments pro and contra this topic.,8
87,"As a result I agree with the statement, because there are a lot of disadvantages and only a few advantages.",8
88,In the following text I am going to explain some arguments in favour and against the topic to get an answer.,8
89,All in all I donÂ´t really agree or disagree with the statement.,8
90,Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.,9
91,But if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine.,9
92,"Furthermore, children cannot make own decisions yet, they are controlled by their parents or adults in general.",9
93,That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+,9
94,An other negative point is that the childrens aren't abled to judge things regarding their quality or the need of it.,9
95,So it is actually the parents' duty to raise their kinds sensible to what they are seeing or hearing.,9
96,"By far the best point to make is that no matter what the child wants, no matter how sad it will get, everything is always up to the parents.",9
97,The only important point is the behaviour of the parents toward the children.,9
98,So the parents can control their children nevertheless.,9
99,The parents have the chance to decide what the child does and what is bought in the end.,9
