0,"Critics say that children have to be protected from this ""bad world"" to enjoy their childhood and develope in the best way.",0
1,"I think comercials for children should be limited, and controlled.",0
2,"In my opion it is very important that children are protected from adversiting, because they are so easy to influence and probably believe the things that are said, even though they are not true.",0
3,"This means that children are manipulated more and more often, and in my opinion that should not be allowed.",0
4,"In my opinion, people should not have the urge to protect children from everything.",0
5,"There are some good points, but also many bad ones for the children.",0
6,"There is the question, how far we are gonig to go, to protect our children.",0
7,"Someone may take this to an extreme and say that kids' childish natures are being abused, which is highly questionable from a moralic point of view.",0
8,"In my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed but the parents shouldn't let their children whatch TV too often because it's very important for their health and social life that they also do other things, for example play with their friends.",1
9,All in all I wouldn't allowed advertising in Tv for young children becouse of the strong aspects meanshen earlyer.,1
10,"On the one hand, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it's unhealthy for them to whatch television too often since that could cause that they don't move enough.",1
11,"So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should not be allowed, because in this age children started making their first social contacts, which is very impotant for their growing up.",1
12,In my oppinion it is not good for young children to watch television advertising directed toward young children.,1
13,So I would say that television advertising toward young children should not be forbidden but the parents might know that they have to control the TV activity of their children.,1
14,All in all I would say that I donÂ´t agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because I think that there is nothing to worry about if  little children come in contact with television advertisements.,1
15,So i would say that television advertising designed for young children is probably a bad thing for their parents money bag but should be allowed still for the reason that adverts for children most of the time don't want to steal your money and just want to show the product like every advert for an other product also does.,1
16,"Summarising all points I can conclude that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because of the negative impact this could have on their development and because of them being not reasonable enough to make their own decisions and to realise whether something is good or bad",1
17,"At my own opinion I will say, that television advertising for young children can be allowed, but it is not nessecary, because they do not watch much films .",1
18,"This is sad and depressing, isn`t ist?",2
19,That these little persons are influenced by such advertisement is a sad fact.,2
20,There is oral propaganda too.,2
21,"One cannot forget though, that children aged two to five may not have a sense for rational thinking or are conscious about money's worth at all, so they might see some completely useless and easily breakable item on TV, which they then want to have for christmas.",3
22,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",4
23,But there are many problems if children see advertisments which are focused on them.,4
24,On the one hand young children have to learn how to deal with advertising.,4
25,Advertising addressed to young children can create both a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing one's life.,4
26,On the one hand a confrontation with this kind of advertising could be bad on the other hand children can only learn from it if they are confronted with it and learn to spectate advertising from other perspectives.,4
27,"The promblem with advertisement, which is directet to children, is that it does not aim for a better futer.",4
28,"Even though young children have contact with advertisment every day, advertisment directed to them would have a bigger impact on them and their behavior.",4
29,But there are also some reasons for advertisements towars young children.,4
30,That`s why there is the problem of advertisements directed toward little children in the age from two to five.,4
31,"Advertisement for children does not have to be a bad thing, it can be used to influence them so that their behaviour will have a positive effekt on society and nature.",4
32,"For sure, children are manipulated by exciting advertisements and are used to make their parents buy these products, but if parents are upset with that, they shouldn't allow their child to be manipulated.",5
33,"Even though they might get the product, advertising is not all about reality and the child might get disappointed.",5
34,"The children have to learn, that not everinthing is like it looks in the advert.",5
35,"The companies actually manipulate the children because especially the younger ones, aged two to five, can't decide whether it is something they really need or if it was simply shown in an advertisement.",5
36,"On the other hand children are learning very much in this part of life, so the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products.",5
37,"Even if the child really wants the product that was advertised on TV, the decisions if it's bought or not will be made by the parents.",5
38,One stong arguement againt advertising towards young children is that they don't realise this manipulation.,5
39,If those young children see advertising for the necessary or the right stuff it might be usefull that they watch this advertising.,5
40,"Even on such a young age they can also make their own experiences with consum.It could be a way for them to experience that advertising is not always the truth.In my opinion it would be good, if children learn the difference between what they are told as a (Zielperson) ,and what things are realy like,on a young age.",5
41,One reason for this is that young children don't have the experience to see if a product of their favour is useful or useless for them.,5
42,Another aspect is that children believe in everything what they see.,6
43,"The children believe every word and can get a wrong image   of what is realy important in life, because they do not have any experiences like that yet.",6
44,So they believe in wrong things and regard lies as true.,6
45,For example that little girls could think that unicorns and elves are real because they saw that in TV.,6
46,"But it is normal for kids to believe in things that aren't real, like princesses or fairytales.",6
47,"As many smaller childreen (aged two to five) believe in evrerthing they hear or see because they are not able to bild their own opinion yet, they are a popular victim of advertising companies.",6
48,"At his age children can not decide what is good and what is bad, so if their hear for example: war is good, they maybe think this is true.",6
49,They believe almost everything.,6
50,"If you tell a child that Santa Clause exists, it will believe.",6
51,I would say that television advertising should not be allowed on channels for children and for children in general.,7
52,I think this is something that can be as good as bad.,8
53," For the question, if the advertising directed toward young children shoul not be allowed, you can think on some opinions for and against it.",9
54,"May one can say that advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, because it is allowed to be directed toward everyone in every age.",9
55,"So I think advertisement for children sould not be allowed, when it is affecting them in a negative way and sets them under a bad influence.",9
56,So I think advertisement towards young children should be allowed.,9
57,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",9
58,The question is if this advertising should be forbidden because of the influence that it could take on young children.,9
59,In my opinion advertising toward young children shouln't be allowed.,9
60,"All in all, adverts for children aged from two to five shouldn't be allowed because of their negative effects on the children.",9
61,"To conclude, I think, these advertisements should not be allowed, because for the children, there is no benefit.",9
62,"Theres another argument against advertisements towards young children: Imagine, you`re a children at age two to five.",9
63,"But they should keep in mind that if they don't watch it between the ages of 2 and 5, they might watch it after that, and for sure parents can't keep an eye on everything their children see; the modern world is just too full of that, not even on tv but also at the streets, radio or newspapers.",10
64,That is why parents always should pay attention about what they are watching.,10
65,Every parent should decide if he lets his child watching things  which can be dangerous for the development of his own child.,10
66,That's why parents have to keep an eye on their children during their watching period.,10
67,That's another point: Many parents don't care about what their child actually watch.,10
68,If parents don't watch over them they don't stop watching the TV.,10
69,"Another reasons is that they would not even unterstand everything, so it is not important if they watch it or do not.",10
70,"As technoglogy evolves more and more product selling companies find more ways to advertise their products and trick people into believing they need those products, this being achieved by making use of several psychological tricks and methods.",11
71,"For example a young boy who maybe already has a lot of cars sees advertisment on a new one, the advertisment tells him that this car is way better then all others - the boy will probably believe that and will feel the need to get this car.",11
72,I would understand if someone says that there is no differance between advertation and manipulation.,11
73,"As for the previous example with toys: if a false picture of the toy is portraied, to bait consumers into buying, that is obviously not the right way to do it.",11
74,For example that not everything what is said in advertsings is right or usefull.,11
75,As a consequence they need to agree with the advertising or at least to believe it is true.,11
76,Advertisment can be developed in a way that may have a hidden influence on their opinion later.,11
77,"They will believe everything they are told and by that are easy to manipulate, so that they want to buy all the products the commercial is showing.",11
78,But advertisement also creates a wrong image of reality.,11
79,"This can be used effectively by television advertisements, which portray them a false picture of reality, causing children to ask their parents for things they don't actually need.",11
80,But on the other hand the parents are still deciding what they are going buy and if they are letting them watch television at all and in the most cases the children have to accept their decision.,12
81,But one the other hand the parents still have to decide what they are going to buy and even if they are letting them watch television.,12
82,"So I think, that the parents have to chose if there children are allowed to have a Television.",12
83,"On the other hand we could say that it is part of the parentÂ´s job to decide if and what their children watch in the TV, to give them the right values.",12
84,But we can decide wich shows and programs our child should watch.,12
85,"Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.",12
86,"so in some famylies they get the new toys as quick as they publish them but some parends would say no and then, because of this normality of violence showen in TV, the children start to behave the same and not just at home but also in the kindergarden and at their friends homes.",13
87,But it can be useful if young children have no idea for birthday or chrismas.,14
88,The kids might be sad if their parents decide not to give these items to them.,14
89,"On the other hand, if the kids stay nice and quiet, they might have the chance to get the thing they want for christmas.",14
90,"One cannot forget though, that children aged two to five may not have a sense for rational thinking or are conscious about money's worth at all, so they might see some completely useless and easily breakable item on TV, which they then want to have for christmas.",14
91,Some parents will maybe buy the toys and then do not have enough money left for other things.,14
92,"They will then ask their parent to buy it, but a lot of parents cannot spend as much money at toys even if they want to.",14
93,"Especially around christmas are toys advertised very much, because the people need presents for their families and friends and when a child see toys and books and computer games everywhere it's not surprising that asks it's parents for more than one christmas present.",14
94,E. g. for present for the birthday or christmas.,14
95,"The following text is an essay about the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."".",15
96,This essay is about the topic if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.,15
97,In the following text I will discuss the question if television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not.,15
98,In the following text I am going to write a discussion about the statement if television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.,15
99,"In the following text i will discuss if ""Television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed""
General Television advertising influence of course all of the people,also young people,because the advertise is always shown in a perfect way without faults, because they want that everybody will buy the product,so therefore they will earn a lot of money.When young people see something very special for them on the television, they tell their parents that they want it, but they only want it, because it was shown so perfect and not because they tried it.",15
100,The following essay deals with the topic of allowing television advertising for young children from age two to five.,15
101,The following text discusses the statement if television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should be allowed or not.,15
102,"I will talk about the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five)should not be allowed"", in the following essay.",15
103,"In the following essay i will show negativ reasons and examples for the statement "" Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"".",15
104,"A argument on the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",15
105,They need influences of their parents and of other kids.,16
106,In the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices.,17
107,"In our generation it is normal that children have a mobile phone and a ""I pad"" or something like this.",17
108,And in our society it is not unusal to play with smartphones even at an young age.,17
109,"Children get a phone earlier every generation, and with that they have the connection to everything that is out there.",17
110,but is it ok to give that high technology devices to children aged two to five?,17
111,Young children get up with new smartphones or other things.,17
112,"If parents are trusting and caring with the fact that their kids use a technological product and a thing that can make ""abhÃ¤ngig""(?",17
113,"They want to use computers, smartphones and tablets etc.",17
114,Did young children bacame addicted to modern technic?,17
115,The children in the age two to five get up too with the new technoligy.,17
116,"The statement, that televisions should not be allowed to young children between two and five years is sometimes correct.",18
117,Television should not be allowed for young children because they would see pictures they don't understand and which are not made for young childs.,18
118,"Children shouldnÂ´t watch tv often in that age, thatÂ´s clearly.",18
119,"I agree with the statement, that television should not be allowed toward young children.",18
120,Also children in young years should not watch television too much.,18
121,In my view young children aged two to five should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents.,18
122,Also I think that children who are at the age of two to five shouldnÂ´t be allowed to watch tv because itÂ´s not good for their eyes.,18
123,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",18
124,"On the other hand, chidren aged two to five should generally not be allowed to watch television regularly.",18
125,i think children from 1 to 5 shouldnt watch television at all.,18
126,"Furthermore, the parents have to have an eye on their children if they watch TV.",19
127,The parents have to keep an eye on their children to protect them against too much television advertising and television consume.,19
128,"Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.",19
129,If parents don't watch over them they don't stop watching the TV.,19
130,I think that the channels should not be too influenced by that and that the always have to keep an eye on their children to prevent them from seeing something bad.,19
131,Finally also the parents should keep an eye on their very young children so they do not spend all their time watching TV because TV itself is not very good for them either.,19
132,Then  the parents are in the situation to forbid their children something the television says they are allowed to get.,19
133,"I think that the parents should make a rule that says how long their children are allowed to whatch TV and what they are allowed to whatch, for instance half an hour a day and just the programm that's especially for childrem so that it can't happen that the parents sit their children in front of the TV so that they don't have to care about them.",19
134,The parents should care about the time their child is sitting in front of a TV and if the child is watching something that is meant to be for his age.,19
135,I'm sure that parents who know the consequences are able to say when their children have to stop watching TV.,19
136,"There are ads for toys, kids food and the newest sport articles.",20
137,It also depends on which ads are showed.,20
138,"Every time we turn on the television we can watch a lot of interesting films, but also a lot of advertisments.",20
139,"Even when the television is turned of, there are enough adverts in kids magazines or on big posters wich are hung up all over the place.",20
140,"
Advertises are often shown in the TV.",20
141,"Nowdays, advertising is a normal part of the television.",20
142,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,21
143,"But it is not good for the children, to just sit in front of a TV and watch channels.",21
144,My second reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours after hours tv and so they would  not focus on there future work lives.,21
145,So responsibl parents shold act in a way not let their children whatch all of this ''junk'' TV.,21
146,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,21
147,Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.,21
148,"I totally agree to this statement, because it could bring the young children to much to the television and could them let forget to play outside.",21
149,But in case that the children watch TV nearly all day it could be helpful for later.,21
150,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",21
151,"Young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but itÂ´s not the right way, I think.",21
152,Second i will write arguments for the statement.,22
153,"In the following, the statement will be evaluated.",22
154,First i will write the argument against the statement.,22
155,Now i will count on some arguments for the statement.,22
156,With this statement the following text is occupied.,22
157,The following text is about the named statement.,22
158,In the following I will discuss this statement.,22
159,In  the following text I am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.,23
160,My opinion to that statement is divided.,23
161,In my opinion i agree with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples.,23
162,In the following I will present my opinion on this topic.,23
163,In the following I will discuss this statement.,23
164,In my opionion there are two sides to this statement.,23
165,But I think everybody have to think about that statement on his own to have an own opinion about it.,23
166,All in all I donÂ´t really agree or disagree with the statement.,23
167,All in all I donÂ´t really agree or disagree with the statement.,24
168,"So all in all, I agree at some parts with the statement, but not at all.",24
169,But in my opinion I have to say that I do agree with the statement above.,24
170,All together i would agree with this statement.,24
171,Finally I agree with the statement.,24
172,For this reason I disagree with the statement.,24
173,In my opinion i agree with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples.,24
174,"Finally I can say that I do not agree with the given statement, bacause if you forbit something it bacomes more interesting.",24
175,In the end I can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 2-5 must be allowed to interfier with that.,25
176,I think it's okay if children want to watch television.,25
177,"Television directed toward young people should  be allowed but the children should watch tv not so often like adults, because they have not enough concentration to watch an hour a day.",25
178,In my view young children aged two to five should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents.,25
179,"In the end, I'd like to say that young children should be allowed to whatch TV because it can be interesting for them and they can learn something.",25
180,All in all in think it should be allowed for young-aged children to watch TV but parents have to take look if it's not too long or what movie is on the TV.,25
181,All in all I'd say it's okay if children are allowed to watch TV.,25
182,"But according to the specific statement from the adversiting i say no it should be allowed, because if the parent regulate the TV usage of there children right it has allot of advantages for there further live.",25
183,Television should not be allowed for young children because they would see pictures they don't understand and which are not made for young childs.,25
184,"All in one I think it`s okay, that children watch tv in a small part of time, if they don`t forget to do important things for school and playing outside with their friends.",25
185,Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.,26
186,"Parents should make sure that their children grows up with things, which are important fot theier future.",26
187,Another important thing is the knowledge of the children.,26
188,Furthermore the parents could prepare their kids.,26
189,The only important point is the behaviour of the parents toward the children.,26
190,"A solution can be, that the parents of the children have to handle right with this topic, because itÂ´s important for their children and their developement.",26
191,I think it is important that you as a parent support the devolpment of your child.,26
192,"The position of parents is so important for children, because they learn from them and act like them.",26
193,It is the best way to prepare kids for the future.,26
194,"I think, that it is really important for a children to have a good relation to their mother and father.",26
195,"However the television can be nessecary, because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep.",27
196,Nowerdays childreen spend lots of their time watching television.,27
197,"Additionally they need the time to play outside and experiance the world and they can't do that because the TV is always more interrestic for young children, it' normal.",27
198,Also one has to add that young children aged two to five normally do not watch TV that often.,27
199,"All in one I think it`s okay, that children watch tv in a small part of time, if they don`t forget to do important things for school and playing outside with their friends.",27
200,Many children spend too much time on watching TV.,27
201,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",27
202,"On the other site if children started watching television in their freetime for more than one to two hours a day, they have no time to do other things, like going outsite and playing with friends.",27
203,"In the evening adults often watch tv and if the children are not going to bed so early, they are sometimes watching tv with their parents.",27
204,"It is better to show them books with a lot of picures than to let them whatch TV .Young children should also play outside with friends, because they have to learn the difference of the real world and the world that is showed by the medias.",27
205,Television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society.,28
206,Television advertising has a big role in modern society.,28
207,Television advertisement is nowadays used to get the consumer's attention and to attract them to buy a company's products.,28
208,"
Advertises are often shown in the TV.",28
209,"Nowdays, advertising is a normal part of the television.",28
210,In the following text I will inform you about television advertising.,28
211,In the television there are several different ways of advertising for a product or an campaign.,28
212,"On the other side, advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television.",28
213,Nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches TV.,28
214,Television advertising is often directed to certain groups of people.,28
215,"When they do not spend much time with their parents, when they are young it will have aftermath, when they are adults.",29
216,"So that there are also bad influences, what have follows for the future life of these children.",29
217,So they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour.,29
218,"They will also not have a good relation to their parents, because they did not spend much time with them, when they were young.",29
219,It stress the parents and it could destroy the entership between the family and friends.,29
220,The reason is that they are in contact with others and that's better for their future.,29
221,"When they go to school, they will possibly be a misfit, beacause they did not learn, how to make friends and be social.",29
222,They create wrong needs and slow down the psychological development.,29
223,They need influences of their parents and of other kids.,29
224,"The other children will not learn, how to get friends and to communicate with different people.",29
225,"All in all I can say, that these advertzising spots towards children with two to five years are unnecessary and lean them to do criminal things.",30
226,So young children who aren't grown up at all would be victims of those advertisings.,30
227,"Because these children are usually at a very young age, it is discussed whether to ban these ads or not.",30
228,"To conclude, I think, these advertisements should not be allowed, because for the children, there is no benefit.",30
229,Lastly a possible threat those ads may pose might be that the ads might lead children to believe they had certain abilities which could cause them to unknowingly kill themselves.,30
230,The question is if this advertising should be forbidden because of the influence that it could take on young children.,30
231,For example songs that you will remember even four weeks later or situations out of daily life.,31
232,"On this question is based the following text, which shows advantages and disadvantages  including my personal opinion.",32
233,IÂ´m going to compare advantages and disadvantages.,32
234,In this essay I will show off the advantages and disadvantages of this topic and comment on it.,32
235,In this essay I am going to give some arguments pro and contra this topic.,32
236,"I will start off with the pros, come to the cons after that and give my opion at the end.",32
237,"But as always there are some disadvantages and some advantages, for the children, their parents and those buisneses.",32
238,In the following text I am going to explain some arguments in favour and against the topic to get an answer.,32
239,"As a result I agree with the statement, because there are a lot of disadvantages and only a few advantages.",32
240,In  the following text I am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.,32
241,These advertisements are created and designed for one purpose only: They're supposed to persuade children to want the product bad enough to beg their parents to buy it.,33
242,"The advertisement could also show the children the variety of items and make them understand, that they don't need everything that's shown in the commercials, but I think that they are just too young to judge.",33
243,"The ads are perhaps the best way to get to know new products, and I think the children deserve to sometimes (not always!)",33
244,"On the other hand children are learning very much in this part of life, so the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products.",33
245,"In my opinion the companies hope to reach with that kind of advertising, with cute little children in it, the parents and make them buy that product for their child too or to buy it just because that advertising make them feel in some way.",33
246,"Sure, there are other people who say that thats the concept of advertising but most people do not want to buy some things to their children and experience that they donÂ´t use it or play with it.",33
247,The advertisments are manipulation the children by attract their interesting and showing the product as a great and exciting thing which it needs to have.,33
248,Children should decide themselves what they want and advertising helps them to gain information about the things they could possibly need.,33
249,"Another good thing about the advertising is, that also the parents see them and might find new toys for their kids.",33
250,"Probably the parents don`t go to a toy shop with their kids very often, so an advertisement is a good way to get to know some playing stuff.",33
251,Young children can be influenced easily.,34
252,"First of all it is well-known that little children are heavily influenced by their surroundings, so that they can get manipulated easily as well.",34
253,Young children are very easy to control and to influence.,34
254,Children can also be influenced more easily by different things.,34
255,Young children can be easiliy influenced by everything.,34
256,"At first children, especially at a very young age, are very easy to influence.",34
257,At this age of confusing realizations children can be manipulated very easily.,34
258,"In order to support this statement one could argue and say that due to their childish minds and behaviours kids are much more easily tricked into doing an believing things than adults, making it much easier to make them want to have certain things.",34
259,Children are easy to manipulate and if they want something really bad they often get it because their parents can not stand their cute child.,34
260,On the other hand children of this age have a high level of influence.,34
261,"If that is not enough reason, one could also claim that companies should have the right to advertise.",35
262,"So should, as a consequence, this advertising be forbidden?",35
263,"So all in all i say, that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed.",35
264,There are different reasons either supporting this advertising or not.,35
265,Besides they are confronted with advertising anyways for example in the supermarket or the streets or magazines.,35
266,There are some people who say that this kind of advertising should not be allowed.,35
267,Besides they do not care about the advertising and would not understand the background reasons for it.,35
268,"In addition to that, there is the question wether showing advertising and influence them is moralic right or not.",35
269,The next argument against advertising is that the companies who make these ads should not use the not-knowing of the children to make more money.,35
270,I can agree with the people who are saying that this kind of advertising should be forbidden.,35
271,Forthermore the childrens often dont need the object.,36
272,"On the other hand, if the parents take care of them and pay attention, the children will not get any problems, but they will have fun with their new toy or other things.",36
273,After a while the child will fill its room with things it does not play with anymore and does not need it.,36
274,"Children want to have many things they see, even more when they are looking exciting and interesting and many parents want to give them what they want to make them happy or just to stop them being annoying and exhausting.",36
275,That might be not as bad at the first view but when the child grows older it is going to want a more adult room and then has to throw a lot of toys away or has to donate or sell it if possible.,36
276,"It leads to different behavior of your childreen, as they want more and more because they get to see the newest and hottest toys erveryday, that is why soner or later nothing will be good enough for them anymore.",36
277,"If they always want more toys, the parents maybe will follow their wishes to make their children happy and make these wishes come true, which can lead to the missing abilities mentioned before.",36
278,One reason for this is that young children don't have the experience to see if a product of their favour is useful or useless for them.,36
279,"That is a problem because parents do not want unhappy childreen and then they have to say to their child, he would not get the toy.",36
280,"Children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them.",36
281,Children in these years are in an important part of  their life.,37
282,"In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life.",37
283,On the other hand children of this age have a high level of influence.,37
284,For children the ages two to five are the most important year of development.,37
285,The age of two to five is the most important time of the life of a children because they learn so much about the life and deleope in a fast time.,37
286,"Children of the age from two to five are the future of the human society, which means that they are the ones that will determ the things that will be bought, in the future, and the standards that will define our future society.",37
287,The brain of children in this age is not so developed like a brain of an youth or an adult.,37
288,Many young children are not really recognised by their parents.,37
289,Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.,37
290,Children can also be influenced more easily by different things.,37
291,They can learn about the right and the wrong.,38
292,They learn speaking and walking and a lot of other important things.,38
293,An example is that they learn to treat the other children in the kindergarten better or learn to say different words.,38
294,They learn things from them like how to behave in some situations.,38
295,They will quicker learn new things.,38
296,Beside they learn the rules of their parents and they know in which their are allowed to something and what it isn't allowed to do.,38
297,If they don't learn that early they may have problems with it later.,38
298,"One can't really tell them what to do ore not, they will experience this themselves.",39
299,Otherwise it could have a negative influence on they,39
300,"If they don't learn this, they could have problems in their life.",39
301,So they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour.,39
302,"And even if it makes them cry, it will form their character.",39
303,But on the other hand they are just kids and so they would be totally influenced by this.,39
304,If they don't learn that early they may have problems with it later.,39
305,"But when they donÂ´t do this, their children start crying and behave absolutly stupid.",39
306,"They might even become angry at them, throwing a tantrum if they want something really bad.",39
307,In this age they are  already able to show us what they want.,39
308,"And it helps parents to confirm their young children to turn the TV off, because there will be a five minute break full of advertising, which is boring to see, anyway.",40
309,It makes watching the channel way better and the kids are not confronted with the breaks for advertisement.,40
310,"So if their parents are sitting right beside them and are also looking at the stuff their children watch, the tv can be switched off when an ad comes and parents can protect the kids from unsuitable content or advertising.",40
311,"If they don't get the object, they start to cry or they are sad about the desission of their parents.",41
312,"They might even become angry at them, throwing a tantrum if they want something really bad.",41
313,"A situation for example for this is when a child is sad because another child took his car for playing away, so the kid is really sad and donÂ´t know what he could do.",41
314,"In reallife the kid who is sad, because he want his car back, knows that he can hurt the other one to get his car.",41
315,They could get bad dreams about scary things they watch or develop a fear all of the sudden.,41
316,"And if they parents don't look up details about that item and just trust their child because it makes it happy, the child might end up with a broken toy, which will make them even more sad.",41
317,You have to think how little children feel aswell but not many persons do that.,41
318,"Exspecially if a mother thinks, that she can't make her daughter happy because of not buying a doll she saw while watching television advertising.",41
319,The children get irritated and don't know how to react.,41
320,"When they do not spend much time with their parents, when they are young it will have aftermath, when they are adults.",41
321,The development in this young age is very importent.,42
322,The developement of a child in this age is,42
323,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",43
324,"Young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but itÂ´s not the right way, I think.",43
325,Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.,43
326,It is not good when young children watch too much television.,43
327,In the end I can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 2-5 must be allowed to interfier with that.,43
328,For younger children television is not good.,43
329,In my view young children aged two to five should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents.,43
330,First of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us.,43
331,But watching too much TV in general is not advisable for young children because they should play outside and think for their own instead of just getting their stories delivered through the TV.,43
332,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,43
333,So its different than today.,44
334,I think children maybe donÂ´t want advertising that is directed toward them.,45
335,"I can understand that companies direct their advertising towards young children, because in that age, children can be manipulated very easily, and while adults and other children are better able to decide wether they actually need the advertised product, they only care about the great video and not about what the product actually is.",45
336,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",45
337,"Theres another argument against advertisements towards young children: Imagine, you`re a children at age two to five.",45
338,The companys sponsering the ads could just claim that theyÂ´re not aiming for the younger children.,45
339,"I can not make a point in that case, because I can understand the companies acting in that way, but i can also think of the fears people might have about television advertising directed toward young children.",45
340,"On one hand itÂ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children, because the children in the age of two to five canÂ´t say anything about there own opinion, because they are to young to say it.",45
341,"So all in all I would say, advertisements for young children are a good thing to get them learn to hear a 'no' and to let their skills grow.",45
342,That`s why there is the problem of advertisements directed toward little children in the age from two to five.,45
343,The children aged two to five are far too young to think about there own opinion and to think about advertising being directed toward them.,45
344,"So if they watch TV, an advertisement could easily make them want to have the product shown in the advert.",46
345,Besides they are confronted with advertising anyways for example in the supermarket or the streets or magazines.,46
346,Nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches TV.,46
347,That is the normal reason to produce advertisings.,46
348,So they can inspire their selfe with the advertising.,46
349,It is clear that you are going to watch them ones and it could be a way to make people resistant to advertisements.,46
350,"On the other side, advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television.",46
351,"But advertisement is a allday thing so if they would not see it on the TV they would see it in the streets, radio and big city.",46
352,Another point ist that there is not just advertisment on television but also in the shops or by games on smartphones.,46
353,Television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society.,46
354,Advertisment has an big influence on our society.,47
355,Nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches TV.,47
356,Advertsing is too big in the society today.,47
357,Also adults and teenagers are always confronted with advertisemen - for example last week I saw a new car in the TV but I wasn't able to buy it because of a lack of money.,47
358,Advertising follow us through our whole life.,47
359,Television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society.,47
360,But as alreday mentioned before we life in a techinical world and to understand and to life in this world every people need the skills on how to handel advertising.,47
361,"
Advertises are often shown in the TV.",47
362,Anyway the modern world is full of advertises.,47
363,In our modern times and the technical improvements it is clear that companies search for ways to improve their advertising aswell.,47
364,They think that is cool and they often try to convince their parents.,48
365,They cant think of the consequences of their own acting and if they see something they like they want it.,48
366,They see this toy is the best and they want it.,48
367,"So they want almost everything they see, and they get it, because theyÂ´ll bag for it until they get what they want.",48
368,They just need to switch it on and they are in a new world where they can see what they want and expriance what they want.,48
369,So they can lough and be happy.,48
370,and for them it seems to be the best thing in the world.,48
371,"They only think ""they are small, they don't think, they understand nothing in their age"" and for them it doesn't matter how they feel.",48
372,"If they don't get the object, they start to cry or they are sad about the desission of their parents.",48
373,They are simply very easy to impress which makes them making desicions about spending money they don't have and can cause a lot of frustration if they don't get it.,48
374,"It is better to show them books with a lot of picures than to let them whatch TV .Young children should also play outside with friends, because they have to learn the difference of the real world and the world that is showed by the medias.",49
375,Children in this age should go outside and enjoy their childhood and do not sit inside infront of the television or other media.,49
376,"For example, children with the age of two to five should reed some books or play games like football.",49
377,"In this chapter of their life, they normally have to play outside with friends and don`t have to sit in their room and watch tv.",49
378,In my opinion young children should generally just spend a small amount of time watching television.,49
379,"For so many children its too difficult to learn, that parents often don`t allow them to be outside until 9pm or like in this discussion, buying some playing stuff (from the advertisements) for them.",49
380,they should go outside and play and not sit inside and watch television.,49
381,So the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people.,49
382,The young children should play outside or do other stuff than sitting in fornt of a television and watch some strange series.,49
383,Young children must play with other friends and should not sit at home to watch television.,49
384,"The most important point for this statement is that the children should not sit in front of the television all the time, they should go and play outside on a playground whit ther parents or ther friends.",50
385,It's important that children go outside and move instead of sitting in front of the TV the whole time.,50
386,"I agree with this statement  becouse young children shoud go out side and not in the hous.When a young child often befor the tv sit,he donÂ´t  can do frendchips  with other children  in his older.",50
387,But that argument is quite small since the children might want something for the outdoor fun like a new special ball and so they want to play outside and stop sitting in front of the TV and that canÂ´t be bad at all.,50
388,Another Point for the stament is that children could like every spot so much that they want everything what they see and so the parents have to tell the children why it isnt possible to buy them all what they want to have.,50
389,"""The children can learn of watching tv"" That isn't right because the children learn more in playing with toys.",50
390,"""Young children should play outside more often"" that is sentence every child has heard a lot of times in her or his young years, but why should they play outside?",50
391,"Now I will talk abbout the pros of this statement: When the children see for example the toys, that they want to have, on TV, it is easier to buy them because their parents do not have to take them to the store.",50
392,But watching too much TV in general is not advisable for young children because they should play outside and think for their own instead of just getting their stories delivered through the TV.,50
393,"I totally agree to this statement, because it could bring the young children to much to the television and could them let forget to play outside.",50
394,So the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people.,51
395,So the relationship to other children is better when the children play with other children.,51
396,I disagree with this statement because young children aged of two to five should be learn to play with other children at their age.,51
397,"The age of two to five is the time for children in the kindergarden and there they learn how to behave with other kids, so it's important not to destroy this at home.",51
398,The children without playimg with other children don't know the contact with others.,51
399,ItÂ´s better for them to play in the kindergarten or to play with their mum.,51
400,But in the age of two to five it is very important to have social contact to other people in their age.,51
401,Young children must play with other friends and should not sit at home to watch television.,51
402,It ist so important because later they can meet new friends easier than without playing with others.,51
403,This is an easy way for these kids to get some general knowledge and gives there parents some time to do other things then working or having a look at what there child is doing.,51
404,The parents have the chance to decide what the child does and what is bought in the end.,52
405,Another opinion could be that the eventually decision is made by the parents.,52
406,"The parents have to decide, what is the best for their children.",52
407,So every parents had to chose for his own child and also for themself.,52
408,"By far the best point to make is that no matter what the child wants, no matter how sad it will get, everything is always up to the parents.",52
409,In this case parents have no choice and will buy the thing the children want to have.,52
410,But one the other hand the parents still have to decide what they are going to buy and even if they are letting them watch television.,52
411,"Furthermore, children cannot make own decisions yet, they are controlled by their parents or adults in general.",52
412,But on the other hand the parents are still deciding what they are going buy and if they are letting them watch television at all and in the most cases the children have to accept their decision.,52
413,"So in the end both, children and parents, are mad.",52
414,Television or any other media stuff is a big factor and influence in our world for all people.,53
415,Television is in our time an important source for news for adults or teenagers.,53
416,Television is today more impportant than in the past.,53
417,Now a days a television and the outraging development of the technology is very normal to the young generation and there parent generation.,53
418,First of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us.,53
419,"The main thing, that is important is the bad influence by television for too young children, so it could exists problems in future, which are developed by the television.",53
420,"Essay

In our technical world the television in a big part of our life.",53
421,So that Television is an important source for young children for preparing their future life.,53
422,Especially young children are getting easily influenced by television.,53
423,"I think, television is something, which is fun and free time for you, but it also can change your opinion about some topics and meanings, which you have.",53
424,But is that right?,54
425,But is this right?,54
426,That's enough.,54
427,"), it's fine.",54
428,I,54
429,to.,54
430,But why?,54
431,BUt,54
432,And so now this is waht I came up with.,54
433,"Yes, of course you would be.",54
434,Another argument is the industry that produces toys and other things for young children.,55
435,Moreover industries invent toys or other things that are dangerous for kids.,55
436,"In fact a lot of companies only sell toys for children, making this an essential part of our economy.",55
437,All in one it is a big industry which is interestes in the childs opinion because they are good selling customers.,55
438,So the toy-industry needs the advertising toward young children to sell their products and get money.,55
439,"And I think that is a very important way for companys to sell their products, because this is the most affective and also the easiest way to reach the children and earn money by selling them specifc toys.",55
440,Children aged two to five years start to speak and to create their own personality.,56
441,At the young age of three or four children are starting to develope the conciousness about themself.,56
442,"There are, for example, dolls, that talk with the child and it learns to speek.",56
443,"A young children with the age of two to five has to learn the calours or how to differences animals with other animals, for example.",56
444,"In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life.",56
445,I'm lucky that I had a childhood without a phone or a computer - all these things were something my parents didn't allowed me to play with.,57
446,the smartphone.,57
447,the computer.,57
448,In fact I'm lucky that I wasn't in the gerneration where phones and other technologies took over.,57
449,the tablet.,57
450,"In our generation it is normal that children have a mobile phone and a ""I pad"" or something like this.",57
451,In the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices.,57
452,But if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine.,58
453,That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+,58
454,"Furthermore, children cannot make own decisions yet, they are controlled by their parents or adults in general.",58
455,So the parents can control their children nevertheless.,58
456,An other negative point is that the childrens aren't abled to judge things regarding their quality or the need of it.,58
457,Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.,58
458,"On the other hand, if the parents take care of them and pay attention, the children will not get any problems, but they will have fun with their new toy or other things.",58
459,In the future there will be more and more technology and we can not forbidm the children to not live that life.,58
460,Children who are that young don't know how to compromise it.,58
461,And this were the parents have to do their work and sometimes have to say no.,58
462,Also for young aged children it could be helpful.,59
463,For example to learn the first things for school.,59
464,But also young children use it for education.,59
465,It is a skill that a human being achieves together with the process of growing up.,59
466,It is the best way to prepare kids for the future.,59
467,Because it is such an important skill it is important that the next generation lears this skill very fast.,59
468,"If you look at the financial part, the tv channels also have to make some money to run their business and the content shown.",60
469,Advertising is one of the main money makers for channels and it would be a really hard challenge for some of the smaller ones to keep showing the same content as before.,60
470,Imagine that there would not be advertising anymore - where is the money for the channels coming from ?,60
471,"Tv channels also make a lot money with advertising too, which is also a good thing.",60
472,And that mean that the channel have more money to produce a better Tv shows.,60
473,So it is kind of good for the industry and the TV channels.,60
474,For example the german tv channel 'KIKA'.,60
475,This could  be the reason why we create televion advertising.,60
476,On the other hand the advertising could help the parents find out what the children want.,61
477,Children should decide themselves what they want and advertising helps them to gain information about the things they could possibly need.,61
478,"Advertisement for children does not have to be a bad thing, it can be used to influence them so that their behaviour will have a positive effekt on society and nature.",61
479,But there are also some reasons for advertisements towars young children.,61
480,In addition the parents should explain theire children how they have to handel with advertising.,61
481,"On the one side it should be allowed to show such as these advertisments, because the children are more informed, what is in trend and can compare with other children.",61
482,"So all in all I would say, advertisements for young children are a good thing to get them learn to hear a 'no' and to let their skills grow.",61
483,On the one hand young children have to learn how to deal with advertising.,61
484,"The advertisement could also show the children the variety of items and make them understand, that they don't need everything that's shown in the commercials, but I think that they are just too young to judge.",61
485,Advertising addressed to young children can create both a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing one's life.,61
486,But in my opinion thats part of our economic system.,62
487,"Likewise, I agree with the point that it should not be allowed.",62
488,On the one hand there are arguments against such a law.,62
489,"But I think, you canÂ´t say no with a law, so itÂ´s difficult to handle with this topic.",62
490,And that might be a problem as many criticers say.,62
491,But it does not make it any better if we try to hide it in front of children.,62
492,"So all in all i say, that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed.",62
493,All in all it could have two sides of view.,62
494,In the following text I am going to explain some arguments in favour and against the topic to get an answer.,62
495,But I think everybody have to think about that statement on his own to have an own opinion about it.,62
496,"So they can not whatch films and series, which are not allowed for them.",63
497,So nobody cares when you watch them first.,63
498,For example Psychomovies ore Some Thrillers or Actionmovies.,63
499,But this Add maked for the would inspirat them to watch more.,63
500,"Another reasons is that they would not even unterstand everything, so it is not important if they watch it or do not.",63
501,Should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) be forbidden?,64
502,Should television advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?,64
503,Should television advertising be directed toward young children?,64
504,So should television advertising directed toward young children be forbidden?,64
505,"So there comes up the question, should TV advertising dirceted towards young children be forbidden.",64
506,Sould advertising directed to young children (aged two to five) be allowed or not?,64
507,Should advertising toward young children be allowed?,64
508,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",64
509,Personally I think that the Television advertising directly towards young children should not be allowed because the children are in they own developement aged two to five.,64
510,In my opinion television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed.,64
511,But often young children can learn something by watching television.,65
512,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,65
513,Furthermore more many child series and movies on TV teach many life lessons so that the children will be prepared for life and their social life.,65
514,"The kids have to whatch films and series to learn also from them , who made for the children, but they dont have to have a Television for him or herself.",65
515,So that Television is an important source for young children for preparing their future life.,65
516,"The televison has positiv points, because young children learn at the television colours or other things.",65
517,First of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us.,65
518,"A good point is, that some kind of them show news for children, so they can understand it, or show some series with animals.",65
519,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,65
520,"For instance, there are many shows on the TV that are especially for very young children and that try to teach them something by having fun which can be very effective.",65
521,The poblem with this is that the children cant imagin that its not real what they see.,66
522,On the one hand the children are so small that they aren't able to reconize the fact that they get manipulated plus the fact that is pretty easy to do it because they don't have th ability to reflect things.,66
523,Many pograms aren't real but the children watch them and think they want do the same.,66
524,"For example if a child sees a plastic horse on TV running around and jumping, it would think, that this horse is really able to do that, but it is not.",66
525,Also I think that parents have to told their children that it isnÂ´t everything real what they see on tv.,66
526,Another aspect is that children believe in everything what they see.,66
527,It could be hard for the parents to explain their kids that the unicorns are only animated and that they don't live in the real world.,66
528,"On the one hand, children are constantly confronted with all sorts of advertising, as they watch television.",67
529,"Also children donÂ´t know the risks of television advertising, they have to learn it when they will grow up.",67
530,"To put it briefly, television advertising can be dangerous for children since they cannot decide what is good or bad for them.",67
531,To come to a conclusion I am of the oppinion that with the right leading from the parents even young children could navigate through the jungle of television advertising and they will learn how to deal with it.,67
532,"The Children probably don't even understand the television advertisment, but the parents like the advertisment more when it is a well made advertisment.",67
533,"A lot of children may not be even able to understand advertising in normal television, so they would be rather nerved as influenced.",67
534,"Its much more important that young children learn something in books or outside then watching television advertising just made for them and in the young age its easier to get in that children mind and to let them think what they should think about ther product, so that they want to buy it or the parents should buy it and when they dont buy it the young children are sad.",67
535,"In this case you have to know that television advertising can be negative for the growing up of little children because in many television advertising, there are bad stuff.",67
536,Television advertising directed tword young children is a little step into a world that acknowlegdes problems and give every one the choice to believe what commercials say or not.,67
537,Another argument for the advertising is that children always want to be treated as grown-ups so they like to watch advertising on television because it is a thing that is also on channels for older people and so they maybe feel more accepted as a child in the world of adults.,67
538,"They also do not know about the risks in our society and whether something is good or bad, because they are just at the begining of their developement.",68
539,If they don't learn that early they may have problems with it later.,68
540,"If they don't learn this, they could have problems in their life.",68
541,"Sometimes the children learn something, they shouldnÂ´t learn.",68
542,"And if they weren`t confronted by advertisements and the `no` of their parents, they never learn it.",68
543,"Yes, children need education but in the age of two to five they are to young.",68
544,"In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life.",68
545,The brain of children in this age is not so developed like a brain of an youth or an adult.,68
546,They also do not have this critical thinking of things that adults have.,68
547,Some people say that children need as much education as they could get but not at this age.,68
548,That these little persons are influenced by such advertisement is a sad fact.,69
549,We have the urge to make economics.,70
550,It can have a big impact on how we behave and what we spend our money on.,70
551,"So when we saw something we liked, we wanted to see more and wanted to have it.",70
552,Our society is made of consumers and sellers.,70
553,Our whole society is about buying and selling - consuming.,70
554,That mean that compernies can make a lot of money with the slots for this Add's .,70
555,I'd like to add to this po A new point I want to manshen is the fact of the industie behind this Add.,70
556,Advertising follow us through our whole life.,70
557,But do we need that?,70
558,ItÂ´s also important for the television advertising to do that.,70
559,They don't have a say in what their parents buy them.,71
560,It is important to mention that children do have a say in what their parents buy them.,71
561,That's another point: Many parents don't care about what their child actually watch.,72
562,"If they see something, they are not capible of nmaking up an own opinion.",73
563,They are unenlightened and do not question absolutes.,73
564,Young children must not the advertising while they are watching a movie or something like this.,74
565,"Seen from this angle, those television spots arenÂ´t directly produced for young children but more for parents of young children.",74
566,"Nowadays it is common, that even little children spend some time in front of the TV and since there has to be some sort of advertising between two shows that are made for children, it wouldn't be too clever to put something in there, that isn't directed toward children as well.",74
567,"The most children are not interested in this advertsing and do not watch them, so that it is unnessecary to produce television advertising directed to young children, then they do not see them.",74
568,"In my opinion, there is no real reason to forbid such TV adverts, because the experience of such things are very importat for children of that age.",74
569,"Even when the television is turned of, there are enough adverts in kids magazines or on big posters wich are hung up all over the place.",74
570,The children could be annoyed in their young years by this form of advertisement.,74
571,I think children maybe donÂ´t want advertising that is directed toward them.,74
572,"In the programm for adults the tv often adverts direct to the audience, but today also the kids channel do that.",74
573,"It is okay when they see a little passage from a movie but not longer than ten minutes, without advertising!",74
574,This is a very controversial question and it is hard to decide between yes and no.,75
575,This is a well discused question and in the following I try to answer it.,75
576,For me its hard to judge about this because i never thought so intensiv about this topic.,75
577,Everybody should have the freedom to be what they want to be unless they harm other people.,75
578,I think it is wrong.,76
579,We are living in a world where technology affects our daily life and where we are dependent on it.,77
580,"We live in the 21th century, the century where electronic stuff and internet media gets more and more important.",77
581,First we live in the 20 century an it is impossible to use nothing technoligy.,77
582,"They want to use computers, smartphones and tablets etc.",77
583,and there are critics an people which see a chance in the using of this new technology.,77
584,You can see what phones and computer did to them.,77
585,You have to know how to handle the modern development of technic in our world and not to allow something is not the right way.,77
586,Apps are a good example for that.,77
587,In the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices.,77
588,Some say that it is all going to be compromized and going to be technical.,77
589,"But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy.",78
590,"Children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product.",78
591,"When only parents would get advertisements for toys, most of them would not really care about it and they probably would not buy the toy the kid would have chose - especially the more expensive ones.",78
592,"Especially kids at a very yound age really want to have a toy, then play with it for a while before loosing interest.",78
593,"Children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them.",78
594,"And in the advertisin they show the newest and coolest toys and when these young children look at them, they emidiatly whant to have them.",78
595,Furthermore getting to know many toys they would like to have by television advertisings could help little children to accept that they won't get everything they wish in their life and that they have to be happy with what they get.,78
596,If they would not buy the toy the child would be very sad or angry about his parents and probably also be bullied by other kids because they do not have the newest ball or other kind of things.,78
597,"And if they parents don't look up details about that item and just trust their child because it makes it happy, the child might end up with a broken toy, which will make them even more sad.",78
598,"Especially around christmas are toys advertised very much, because the people need presents for their families and friends and when a child see toys and books and computer games everywhere it's not surprising that asks it's parents for more than one christmas present.",78
599,That's not good.,79
600,Perherps some familys would think itÂ´s good.,79
601,Sometimes it is hard to connect working and having a family.,80
602,"The first steps are important to know how you deal with your social area (family,friends).",80
603,"I know that it is not easy to raise up a child, but you decided wether you can handle the stress and work or not.",80
604,How to handle with another children or how to prepare for school.,80
605,And there is no place better than in your family over a long period of time.,80
606,"As for the previous example with toys: if a false picture of the toy is portraied, to bait consumers into buying, that is obviously not the right way to do it.",81
607,"But what if the mother of the girl is so poor, she works everyday to be able to buy food and has no money for that doll?",82
608,She wouldn't talk about this doll and her mother wouldn't be in despair.,82
609,The girls wants the doll so bad that the mother doesn't know how to react.,82
610,"The doll can even talk and dance, but that is why she is so expensive.",82
611,For companys who produce products for kids aged thwo to five it would be a huge disadvantage if they canÂ´t advertise their product anymore and would damage the financial situation of them.,83
612,So the snetence above is mostly to hear form the older generation.,84
613,All of the younger generations are often seen as the generation of the internet and social media.,84
614,The only generation is the elders generation whom are not used to technology at all.,84
615,my generation ist i think the last who doesnt have phones or something in teir childhood we play outside with our friends and doesnt text over facebook or snapchat.,84
616,We all know that situation don't we?,85
617,For this reason I'd forbid advertisments for children in a young age.,86
618,"Many television channels have learn programms for children, where children can learn for example languages or easy vocabulary.",87
619,"There are existing lots of apps to let the young children understand few things, that they can bring in experience in their age and this the apps try to message in a way of playing games.",87
620,For exapmle there are several knowlegde shows for kids on TV they can watch to learn a bit more about the world and some other things that might be interesting for them.,87
621,Many chanels started producing movies and series for young children where they show how to learn for example languages like english or french.,87
622,"The kids have to whatch films and series to learn also from them , who made for the children, but they dont have to have a Television for him or herself.",87
623,The coming and existing media will open new and in a few things much easier oppurtunities to get something in mind of a young kid.,87
624,"They show some carracters that show the kids how they can do something, and the children are learning something.",87
625,On one site children can learn from some of these chanels for young people.,87
626,"In my opinion, people should not have the urge to protect children from everything.",88
627,They could look at the reaction of ther children.,89
628,Think about your childhood ?,90
629,and if the parents are smart they will tell them that they do not need it so the parents will not buy it.,91
630,At the most time the products are very expensive and the parents do not want it to buy for the children.,91
631,The children really want to have the product and might annoy their parents until they buy it.,91
632,In this case parents have no choice and will buy the thing the children want to have.,91
633,That will lead parents to buying products they would consider too expensive or not appropriate under usual circumstances.,91
634,"This way, they can also learn from it and maybe develop a sense for what's good and what's not, so they can better decide what to buy for themselves when they're older.",91
635,"And while they usually are not able to actually buy these things, they are often able to heavily influence their parents when insistin on wanting to have something.",91
636,It is important to mention that children do have a say in what their parents buy them.,91
637,"If they decide not to buy something, their kid will just forget about it after a while (we've all been there) and everything's just fine.",91
638,The child can't just buy things on its own.,91
639,Children cannot tell if people tell the truth or a lie at such a young age.,92
640,But children especially young children don't know.,92
641,"This could be a problem for their later life, because they won't be able to see the difference between lies and  the truth.",92
642,But it does not make sense that a young aged children is able to get important information.,92
643,Such a statement could be shocking for a young child.,92
644,But an adult knows that it is not true.,92
645,Young children can be influenced easily.,92
646,"However, not only adults are effected by advertisments also young children who cannot differ between information and manipulation.",92
647,For example the two years old kids see a Add for Ice cream in the Tv them this Kid would a ask this parend that is that ?,92
648,You have to think how little children feel aswell but not many persons do that.,92
649,"The Children might even get unhappy because their parents can not afford what they want, and the Children don't understand why their parents don't buy them what they want because they don't understand the use of money.",93
650,"They have also the exercise to teach their kids the handling of money, the use, treatment and importance of things and the moral behind it so that they have the power/need to change their kids minds.",93
651,"Children shouldn't get to know the way, money, beauty and  expensiv stuff in general influence everyone of us and how they affect our daily life.",93
652,Additionaly only the parents know what they can afford and the Children don't think about the price of something they just want it or not.,93
653,"And if the parents have a lot of money and don't care about what they buy in the first place, why not show these children some cool toys on TV to make them happy?",93
654,But kids should not think they can have everything and those whose parents have not much money should not be shown what they miss.,93
655,But one the other hand the parents still have to decide what they are going to buy and even if they are letting them watch television.,93
656,It is important to mention that children do have a say in what their parents buy them.,93
657,So in the end the parents are the people who have to buy these things and have to spend their money on this.,93
658,In this case parents have no choice and will buy the thing the children want to have.,93
659,BUt,94
660,"Children, who are aged two to five, are in a period of life where they learn a lot of things which they need for their further life and it's not that unusual that they ask questions beginning with ""why"".",95
661,But it's also important to think about the consequences.,96
662,but there are also prospects.,96
663,But there is also the other side of the problem.,96
664,One decision must lead to other decisions as well.,96
665,And that could be even worse.,96
666,"Also there is the chance, e.g.",96
667,I would rather make a compromise.,96
668,And that might be a problem as many criticers say.,96
669,But I do think that we have to start somewhere.,97
670,They get social contacts which they can't make if they only spend their time infront of the TV.,98
671,But without watching TV they will meet some friends and are outside in the natur.,98
672,When they look tv the children are independent of this media so they can't live without watching tv.,98
673,"They usually don't read newspaper or magazines, so they can see things from the televeision.",98
674,"Than they could watch TV, with the result that their fixed on the Television.",98
675,So the television isn't real.,98
676,"So in this important time for a child to grow up and learn things they should do it without TV, because it's an lonely live with just watching TV and they need the social links.",98
677,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,98
678,Nowerdays childreen spend lots of their time watching television.,98
679,So they can watch one hour television and then they now many things.,98
680,"I agree with the following statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",99
681,"So I think that television advertising toward young children should be not allowed, because they are too young and can be manipulate.",99
682,In my opinion television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed.,99
683,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",99
684,Personally I think that the Television advertising directly towards young children should not be allowed because the children are in they own developement aged two to five.,99
685,"On the one hand, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it's unhealthy for them to whatch television too often since that could cause that they don't move enough.",99
686,"I think that television advertising that is directed towards young Children should not be allowed, but young Children should not watch much television and the parents should control what their Children watch.",99
687,All in all I would say that I donÂ´t agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because I think that there is nothing to worry about if  little children come in contact with television advertisements.,99
688,"In the following I tell you my oppinion of the question, if Television advertising directed toward young children between two to five years shuold not be allowed.",99
689,"On the other hand I think that it is not that necessary to not allow television advertising directed toward young children, because it is in the hand of the parents or everyone else in general how to handle this situation.",99
