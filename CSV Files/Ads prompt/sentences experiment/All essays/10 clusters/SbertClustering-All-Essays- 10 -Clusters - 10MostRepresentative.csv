48,In the following text I show my opinion about this topic and present my arguments.,4
49,The most people can think against that and deside for themselves whats good and what they need.,4
50,"The statement "" television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"" is not easily to answer.",5
51,"In my opinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed for young children, as they are manipulative and create a world which does not exist.",5

53,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",5
54,All in all I can say that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because they are too young to understand that they want to sell products.,5

57,"Some people think, that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed.",5
58,In my oppinion the television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed but in a way where they don't get influenced that much.,5
59,"so there is the question,if television advertising directed toward young childern should not be allowed.",5
60,"A big point against the advertising is, that children get influenced by advertisings and even more if they're young.",6
61,"Moreover, children can't really react on the advertisings, because they don't have money to buy something by themselves so the goal of an advertising isn't reached anyway.",6
62,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",6
63,If kids see advertising for children they could not know that advertising is often just for making money for the companies and often what they promise in the adverstising is unreal.,6
64,"Studies show how the mind can be subconciously influenced by advertising and to make such advertisements for children is a rather dangerous thing, because the brain of a child is yet to be fully developed.",6
65,"The influence of the advertising is very onesided and the young children do not know much about other products, they are fixed on one product.",6
66,Those children are in a too young age to built up their own opinion and watching advertising could influence their brain and their way of thinking a lot.,6
67,"First, the advertising isn't good for children, because it influences them.",6
68,"In this young age the children do not know what is good or wrong all in all, so advertising directed to children can change their opinion, mind or development.",6

80,Children need and want other things than adults.,8
81,The children are open minded and if you show them in their early years a childrenfriendly Sierie they maybe could learn something.,8
82,Another point is that it takes also a lot influence of the child.,8
83,If children are about one to fourteen years old they aren't able to think responsible or make important decissons.,8
84,On the one hand the small children should get to know the real world and how it works since the moment they were born.,8
85,They now that the children could influence their parnts quite much.,8
86,"Children don't have the same abbility to overthink things and see behind what is being shown to them, as an adult does.",8

92,If they see an advertisement they would love to have that thing and it's difficult for the parents if they are in a store with them and doen't want to buy toy's.,9
93,"Most of the time, the parents won`t buy them the toys they want.",9
94,"So if there is a incredible new toy out in stores, they run to their parents and beg them to go and buy them that exact toy.",9
95,"Even if the parents still are the ones who buy, they often can't resist in the hope of making their child happy.",9
96,"This costs a lot of money for the parents and if the parents say: "" No, you wonÂ´t get this toy. """,9
97,The problem of this is that often young children just want everything and they can't decide what really is worth to buy and then the parents will buy it for their children to not disapoint them.,9
98,"Every child wants the newest and coolest toys and keeps nagging their parents to buy it for them, and so most of them do.",9
99,If childrens see something they want parents often have to give in and go buy it for them.,9
