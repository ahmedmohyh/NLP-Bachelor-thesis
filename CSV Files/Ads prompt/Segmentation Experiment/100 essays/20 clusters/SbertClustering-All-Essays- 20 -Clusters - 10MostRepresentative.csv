2, children trying to convince their parents of buying a product much more often as they already do and this habit puts a much greater strain on the parents who will probably give in to their children more and more often because they have not got the strength to have similar fights over products over and over again as probably mostly sweets and things to play with are advertised children will probably eat more sweets which could lead to more children being overweight and as people often keep eating habits ,0
3, they want to some parents will maybe buy the toys and ,1
4, they would want to have the item no matter what and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they cant afford a new toy for them thats why televison advertisement thats  causes trouble on the other ,1
5," want to have for christmas and if they parents dont look up details about that item and just trust their child because it makes it happy the child might end up with a broken toy which will make them even more sad

by far the best ",1
6, cool every child would want the toy that is a problem because parents do not want unhappy childreen and ,1
7, do not have enough money left for other things if they would not buy the toy the child would be very sad or angry about his parents and probably ,1
8, might want to have every new toy they see on tv and ,1
9, ask their parent to buy it but a lot of parents cannot spend as much money at toys ,1
10," many children its too difficult to learn that parents often dont allow them to be outside until 9pm or like in this discussion buying some playing stuff from the advertisements for them they must accept that they cannot have everything and if they werent confronted by advertisements and the no of their parents they never learn it 
another important thing is the knowledge of the children they actually never get to know different toys like barbie lego or even playmobil probably the parents dont go to a toy shop with their kids very often ",1
11, they have to say to their child he would not get the toy a nother probolem is that often the werbung manipulates the audience for example playmobil there is a child playing with the new playmobil castle and there is a dragon which can act it can spy fire or is flying in the clouds in the reality that is not possible but younger children would trust the television and think it is real then ,1
12, we saw something we liked we wanted to see more and wanted to have it so its not a surprise that the toys we saw in the advertisments were laying under the tree on christmas or were given to us on our birthdays children want to have many things they see even more ,1
13, itâ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children because the children in the age of  canâ´t say anything about there own opinion because they are to young to say it ,2
14, i come to the conclusion that advertisment directet to children should not be allowed because it takes away their chance to develop their own individual charcter ,2

more important theses adverts influence the childrens mind and their psychological development thats not good children may believe whats said in the advert plus the strategy of advertisment is to create needs and children cant deal with that 

all in all adverts for children aged  shouldnt be allowed because of their negative effects on the children they create wrong needs and slow down the psychological development they only help companies to improve their profits and this is not good we shou",2

22, against ads for young children is that they will probably not understand what the purpose of an ad is ,2

but ",3
24, if they would not see it on the tv they would see it in the streets radio and big city so ,3

so without advertising the movie is not ",3

and every child has to learn that not everything what is said in the tv is good and that they can not get anything what they want this is a really important process in the life of a child and the understanding is easier ",4
34," can change your opinion about some topics and meanings which you have
young children are very influenced by everythingwhich they see and hear ",4
35, in my generation we learned things very early with plays or childrenbooks the coming and existing media will open new and in a few things much easier oppurtunities to get something in mind of a young kid apps are a good example ,4
36," year of development they learn speaking and walking and a lot of other important things

the young children should play outside or do other stuff than sitting in fornt of a television and watch some strange series later in life theyll watch a lot of tv and in childhood they shouldnt spend their time with this
if they watch series ",4
37," is that a children with young age often has to be alone because the parents have to work the whole day or must have to do something where a little children is not usefull than they could watch tv with the result that their fixed on the television also if a children watch important politically soaps earlier it grows up with a better knowledge of the important things of life but it does not make sense that a young aged children is able to get important information 

a young children with the age of  has to learn the calours or how to differences animals with other animals ",4
38, that there are lots of educating movies and series which help the children to live or preparing their life they can learn about the right and the wrong what is easier to understand ,4
39,"
itâ´s better to show them how to handle with television or games or something like that because the children are learning for their lifes and not just for the moment

in the statement itâ´s described that very young children from the age  should not watch television and ",4

first of all it is wellknown that little children are heavily influenced by their surroundings ",4
41, we are young children who are aged  are in a period of life where they learn a lot of things which they need for their ,4
42, children are learning very much in this part of life ,4
43," in favour and against the topic to get an answer 

first of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us

but the influcene of advertisment  younger children is probably even higher they do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use  convincing people to buy the product for example a young boy who maybe already has a lot of cars sees advertisment on a new one the advertisment tells him that this car is way better ",5
44," and even small children watch television so it may occure the question whether tv advertising  aged  shoud or should not be allowed 

first you should allow this kind of avertising because it helps the parents to buy things which fit with the specific wishes of their children so the little child can watch tv and ",5
45,"television advertising  should not be allowed thats the way many people think about the influnce of media like televison on young childreni dont think it should be not allowed but i am not the opinion that its positive for them

 every parent should decide if he lets his child watching things  which can be dangerous for the development of his own child not everybody sees that as negativ because a lot of people doesnt believe that children ",5
46,"the topic of advertising in the tv  is difficult children shouldnâ´t watch tv often in that age thatâ´s clearly for the concerns itâ´s very lucrative to do advertising to young people because they watch it they want it and they go to their parents to talk with them if the children are allowed to get it but itâ´s the wrong way to use young children to make profit maybe it isnâ´t wrong to start in a young age with that things so the children may know what will happend in an older age everyone is controlled by the media at all in the digitalized like tv or radio and in the undigitalized way like newspaper
finally ",5
47," good that television advertising  aged  years and if it should not be allowed in the following part i will explain and answer these questions
firstly children get influence by television and specially young children who arent educated or who start to learn are a part of these children aged  years start to speak and to create their own personality 
so that there are ",5

in my opinion television advertising  should be allowed but the parents shouldnt let their children whatch tv too often because its very important for their health and social life that they ",5

",5

the question is if this advertising should be forbidden because of the influence that it could take on young children

in my opinion the advertising  should not be allowed because the companies should not use young children in that way to get more money ",10
94, i say that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed but advertisement is a allday thing ,10
95, television advertising  should not be allowed because its unhealthy for them to whatch television too often ,10
96," for the question if the advertising  shoul not be allowed you can think on some opinions for and against it
 the television advertising is sometimes very funny and beautiful for the kids so they can lough and be happy they show some carracters that show the kids how they can do something and the children are learning something but ",10
97, banning direct advertisement is not the right way ,10
98, commercials should be allowed the parents can decide ,10

100, television advertising  in the age of  should not be allowed because in this age children started making their ,10
101," these advertisements should not be allowed because for the children there is no benefit their health and happyness would suffer and the profit of the industry is not worth it 
 



",10
102, television advertising  should be allowed because its very interesting for them because they can learn something for instance there are many shows on the tv that are ,10
103, some reasons for advertisements towars young children for ,11
104," for advertising s young children is that they will see new things to play with and maybe they will get a bigger imagination or just new ideas 
but watching too much tv ",11
105, advertises are shown with kids as target the children will try to force their parents to buy them the things they have seen on the tv but if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine so it is very important to show the children who has the power in addition children  are not that good in arguing they will just say something like i need this toy please buy it daddy and if the parents are smart they will tell them that they do not need it ,11
106, children are not able to think critically about the advertisement they cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant for example children do not need their own playstation ,11
107, they are looking exciting and interesting and many parents want to give them what they want to make them happy or just to stop them being annoying and exhausting the advertisments are manipulation the children by attract their interesting and showing the product as a great and exciting thing which it needs to have for this reason id forbid advertisments for children in a young age but one the other ,11
108, advertisements for young children are a good thing to get them learn to hear a no and to let their skills grow the only important ,11
109," for these ads is that children can choose a new food they want to try or a new game they want to play because they have seen it in an advertisment they will quicker learn new things
the ",11
110," it makes them cry it will form their character 
finally the adverts might want to make a child force their parents to buy a toy for them and if it cries because they wont ",11
111," one is that the children often want the object in the televion they think that is cool and they often try to convince their parents if they dont get the object they start to cry or they are sad about the desission of their parents the parents dont like to see their children cry and they bought the object for them
forthermore the childrens often dont need the object the seller push their object in the advertising because he know what he have to say he only tells the posi and the children see that and in result they get it from their parents
in addition the parents should explain theire children how they have to handel with advertising the children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money if they dont learn this they could have problems in their life 
all in all the advertising isnt good for the young people it stress the parents and it could destroy the entership between the family and friends 
",11
112, the advertising could help the parents find out what the children want e g for present for the birthday or christmas but there are ,11
113,"
advertises are often shown in the tv they adress all ages even really young children and that might be a problem as many criticers say 
young children are easily influencable by television advertising so they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour 
on the other ",12
114," of view
furthermore children influenced by tv ads are going to to try and make their parents buy those certain products which they most likely wont ",12
115," in favour and against the topic to get an answer 

first of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us

but the influcene of advertisment  younger children is probably even higher they do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use  convincing people to buy the product for example a young boy who maybe already has a lot of cars sees advertisment on a new one the advertisment tells him that this car is way better ",12
116," children and adults is increasingly high
especially kids should not be raised in such a materialized society they cannot differ between the appearance of the product in the advertisement and the realistic relation between price and quality
that will lead parents to buying products they would consider too expensive or not appropriate under usual circumstances
why should a threeyearold girl want anything else than the new robotbarbie that is praised to be the one and only toy in advertisements
these advertisements are created and designed for one purpose only theyre supposed to persuade children to want the product bad enough to beg their parents to buy it
in my opinion parents should keep their children away from tvadvertisements ",12
117,"the topic of advertising in the tv  is difficult children shouldnâ´t watch tv often in that age thatâ´s clearly for the concerns itâ´s very lucrative to do advertising to young people because they watch it they want it and they go to their parents to talk with them if the children are allowed to get it but itâ´s the wrong way to use young children to make profit maybe it isnâ´t wrong to start in a young age with that things so the children may know what will happend in an older age everyone is controlled by the media at all in the digitalized like tv or radio and in the undigitalized way like newspaper
finally ",12
118, children are nothing but the medium to their parents money enterprises have chosen this method of advertising because they are on current with nowadays methods of raising a child and that televisions are often a part of it if the parents now think of this advertising as ethically wrong one ,12
119, against the statement children should decide themselves what they want and advertising helps them to gain information about the things they could possibly need in this age they are  already able to show us what they want the children probably dont even understand the television advertisment but the parents like the advertisment more ,12
120," the television is turned of there are enough adverts in kids magazines or on big posters wich are hung up all over the place the child can not not see the newest products that his parents should buy

but the problem with television advertising is that you do not have to know how to read the posters or buy the magazine it is free to turn on the television and watch at all the concerns wich try to sell their newest and best product to little kids wich do not know better

",12
121," that they have the powerneed to change their kids minds 
all in one it is a big industry which is interestes in the childs opinion because they are good selling customers it can be seen as regarding to the moral false or as regarding to the industry good 
in my opinion there is nothing bad about directing television advertising to the children because they get into the diversity which exists and learn about the parents how to handle it the only problem which occures is that if the parents dont theach their children they might get too much manipulated and materialistic ",12
122, children are not able to think critically about the advertisement they cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant for example children do not need their own playstation ,12
123, they are just kids and ,13
124, they are young it will have aftermath ,13
125, they will grow up another ,13
126, they are 25 they are going to be ,13
127, you can say that they have to decide for themeselve but arent they too young ,13
128, the children will not have a chance to watch these also to hold against the ,13

on the other ",13
131, they are at their own i ,13

finally ",13
133, not have a good relation to their parents because they did not spend much time with them ,14
134, that they are just too young to judge,14
135, that they get manipulated plus the ,14
136, much that they want everything what they see and ,14
137," that they can find out for themselves what they want to look like and what they want to own and in which way they can find pleasure and happines

bacause of these given ",14
138, that they dont have to care about them its very important that they undertake something with their children ,14
139, that they can get manipulated easily ,14

145," they shopuld have a time where they are allowed to watch there series or there favorite movie that is what makes the children happy now a days 
furthermore more many child series and movies on tv teach many life lessons ",15
146, reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours ,15
147, they cant live without watching tv so the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they arent be alone and ,15

149, its okay if children want to watch television but its ,15
150," play it for the camera and the pproducer so it isnt the real life 
the children can learn of watching tv that isnt right because the children learn more in playing with toys beside they learn the rules of their parents and they know in which their are allowed to something and what it isnt allowed to do 
so the children shouldnt watch television because they are things which are better than that also the independence of watching television is tall ",15

175," many children its too difficult to learn that parents often dont allow them to be outside until 9pm or like in this discussion buying some playing stuff from the advertisements for them they must accept that they cannot have everything and if they werent confronted by advertisements and the no of their parents they never learn it 
another important thing is the knowledge of the children they actually never get to know different toys like barbie lego or even playmobil probably the parents dont go to a toy shop with their kids very often ",18
176, they would want to have the item no matter what and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they cant afford a new toy for them thats why televison advertisement thats  causes trouble on the other ,18
