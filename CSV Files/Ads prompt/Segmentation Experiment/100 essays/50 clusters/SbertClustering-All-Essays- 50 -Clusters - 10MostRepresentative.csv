124," good that television advertising  aged  years and if it should not be allowed in the following part i will explain and answer these questions
firstly children get influence by television and specially young children who arent educated or who start to learn are a part of these children aged  years start to speak and to create their own personality 
so that there are ",16
125, tv advertising might influence children there is no sign that it causes any major negative effects or even damgage to them it does not hurt them ,16
126,"especially young children are getting easily influenced by television nowdays advertising is a normal part of the television
the question is if this advertising should be forbidden because of the influence that it could take on young children

a lot of children may not be even able to understand advertising in normal television ",16
127," in favour and against the topic to get an answer 

first of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us

but the influcene of advertisment  younger children is probably even higher they do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use  convincing people to buy the product for example a young boy who maybe already has a lot of cars sees advertisment on a new one the advertisment tells him that this car is way better ",16
128, i can conclude that television advertising  should not be allowed because of the negative impact this could have on their development and because of them being not reasonable enough to make their own decisions and to realise whether something is good or bad,16
129," and even small children watch television so it may occure the question whether tv advertising  aged  shoud or should not be allowed 

first you should allow this kind of avertising because it helps the parents to buy things which fit with the specific wishes of their children so the little child can watch tv and ",16
130,there are a few different reasons why television advertising  should not be allowed first of all young children aged  arent able to recognize if its true or not what they are told and what they see on televisionon television advertising there are used many tricks that make the people believe they will be happier and their life will be much better with the product that is shown the children believe every word and can get a wrong image   of what is realy important in life because they do not have any experiences like that ,16
131,"the topic of advertising in the tv  is difficult children shouldnâ´t watch tv often in that age thatâ´s clearly for the concerns itâ´s very lucrative to do advertising to young people because they watch it they want it and they go to their parents to talk with them if the children are allowed to get it but itâ´s the wrong way to use young children to make profit maybe it isnâ´t wrong to start in a young age with that things so the children may know what will happend in an older age everyone is controlled by the media at all in the digitalized like tv or radio and in the undigitalized way like newspaper
finally ",16
132, they are looking exciting and interesting and many parents want to give them what they want to make them happy or just to stop them being annoying and exhausting the advertisments are manipulation the children by attract their interesting and showing the product as a great and exciting thing which it needs to have for this reason id forbid advertisments for children in a young age but one the other ,17
133, with the people who are saying that this kind of advertising should be forbidden children who are that young dont know how to compromise it the ads are making everything more colorful and brighter and they do not necessarily show reality the children really want to have the product and might annoy their parents until they buy it its ,17
134,"it would be hard to classify the advetisement is it for children aged  or for older kids the companys sponsering the ads could just claim that theyâ´re not aiming for the younger children but it would be very good if those television advertising would not be allowed anymore because those little children are very easy to manipulate
for companys who produce products for kids aged thwo to five it would be a huge ",17

now a days a television and the outraging development of the technology is very normal to the young generation and there parent generation the only generation is the elders generation whom are not used to technology at all there are a few ones that do not have a probleme with the change but the most do so the snetence above is mostly to hear form the older generation  
the children should be allowed to watch television and use all the technology the presnt has to offer because we are living in a constant development of technology and in the future there will be more of that some say that it is all going to be compromized and going to be technical 
the only thing parents could do is to set a limit of tv watching for there children ",22

the children can learn of watching tv that isnt right because the children learn more in playing with toys beside they learn the rules of their parents and they know in which their are allowed to something and what it isnt allowed to do 
so the children shouldnt watch television because they are things which are better than that also the independence of watching television is tall ",23

finally ",24
199," of view in my oppinion it is not good for young children to watch television advertising 
",24
200, children are nothing but the medium to their parents money enterprises have chosen this method of advertising because they are on current with nowadays methods of raising a child and that televisions are often a part of it if the parents now think of this advertising as ethically wrong one ,24
201," and even small children watch television so it may occure the question whether tv advertising  aged  shoud or should not be allowed 

first you should allow this kind of avertising because it helps the parents to buy things which fit with the specific wishes of their children so the little child can watch tv and ",24
202," that the child can not see advertsisings
however the television can be nessecary because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep 
but during such a movie there is not more than one time advertising 
the most children are not interested in this advertsing and do not watch them ",24
203," on some tv channels for children there isnâ´t television advertising for example the german tv channel kika 
also children donâ´t know the risks of television advertising they have to learn it ",24
204," in favour and against the topic to get an answer 

first of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us

but the influcene of advertisment  younger children is probably even higher they do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use  convincing people to buy the product for example a young boy who maybe already has a lot of cars sees advertisment on a new one the advertisment tells him that this car is way better ",24
205, espiaclliy children age  watch teelvision there is less of an optertunity for them to see advertising ,24
206,"
advertises are often shown in the tv they adress all ages even really young children and that might be a problem as many criticers say 
young children are easily influencable by television advertising so they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour 
on the other ",24
207," the television is turned of there are enough adverts in kids magazines or on big posters wich are hung up all over the place the child can not not see the newest products that his parents should buy

but the problem with television advertising is that you do not have to know how to read the posters or buy the magazine it is free to turn on the television and watch at all the concerns wich try to sell their newest and best product to little kids wich do not know better

",24
208, they would want to have the item no matter what and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they cant afford a new toy for them thats why televison advertisement thats  causes trouble on the other ,25
209, they want to some parents will maybe buy the toys and ,25
210, might want to have every new toy they see on tv and ,25
211, cool every child would want the toy that is a problem because parents do not want unhappy childreen and ,25
212," want to have for christmas and if they parents dont look up details about that item and just trust their child because it makes it happy the child might end up with a broken toy which will make them even more sad

by far the best ",25
213, we saw something we liked we wanted to see more and wanted to have it so its not a surprise that the toys we saw in the advertisments were laying under the tree on christmas or were given to us on our birthdays children want to have many things they see even more ,25
214," many children its too difficult to learn that parents often dont allow them to be outside until 9pm or like in this discussion buying some playing stuff from the advertisements for them they must accept that they cannot have everything and if they werent confronted by advertisements and the no of their parents they never learn it 
another important thing is the knowledge of the children they actually never get to know different toys like barbie lego or even playmobil probably the parents dont go to a toy shop with their kids very often ",25
215, the toys that they want to have on tv it is easier to buy them because their parents do not have to take them to the store if the child would come with them they would probably find other toys and would want to buy them all another reasons is that they would not even unterstand everything ,25
216, tend to be useless especially kids at a very yound age really want to have a toy ,25
217, ask their parent to buy it but a lot of parents cannot spend as much money at toys ,25
218, bad that the mother doesnt know how to react the doll can even talk and dance but ,26
219, all others  the boy will probably believe that and will feel the need to get this car while an adult is maybe going to understand that there is no need for this new car because the boy already has a lot and the new car is not better at all another ,26
220," they are potential customers  not the children themselves

in conclusion ",27
221," are the parents the ones who have to pay for the toys sweets etc of their children and the company use the kids because they are easier to manipulate to get the money from their parents using kids as things to get their parents money is ethicly bad
",27

223, they tend to wish for things they saw and that excited them the companies actually manipulate the children because ,27

but ",27
225, it is not right to manipulate children through advertising even ,27

228, that companies make a lot money from the parents which got affected by their children to buy them their toys candy and ,27

but actually those children are not customers ",27

in the end ",28
231, they dont want watch tv anymore,29
232, looking at the stuff their children watch the tv can be switched off ,29
233, they are at home as you can see there are a lot of times where they do not have time watch tv ,29

in my opinion young children should generally just spend a small amount of time watching television they got easily distracted by it and they ",29

263, poor she works everyday to be able to buy food and has no money ,34
264, and how often children watch tv and it is their decision if they want a two year old boy or girl to watch tv the other reason why it should be allowed is one simple thing you cant hide advertising sooner or later the kids will be confronted with ads and it could be good to let them know early enough that it is out there when they become older they will know better how to handle advertisment children will know that they cant have everything they want and that not everything is like it is in tv the things shown in the commercials arent reality but it is the reality that commercials are out there in real life and if tv advertisment towards children isnt allowed commercials in magazines on the radio and ,35

to come to a conclusion i am of the oppinion that with the right leading from the parents even young children could navigate through the jungle of television advertising and they will learn how to deal with it it is the best way to prepare kids for the future it isnt nedded to forbid television advertising for young children because it isnt needed to protect them from anything if they know how to protect themselves ",35

332, that the television advertising directly towards young children should not be allowed because the children are in they own developement aged  the advertisment should ,42

334, they have to say to their child he would not get the toy a nother probolem is that often the werbung manipulates the audience for example playmobil there is a child playing with the new playmobil castle and there is a dragon which can act it can spy fire or is flying in the clouds in the reality that is not possible but younger children would trust the television and think it is real then ,43

many parents know the struggle of their kid seeing something quite expensive and useless on tv like a flying barbydoll or a selfdestructing car the kids might be sad if their parents decide not to give these items to them they might even become angry at them throwing a tantrum if they want something really bad this is not just bad for the atmosphere in the family itself but could ",43

343, they want to some parents will maybe buy the toys and ,43
344," of view
furthermore children influenced by tv ads are going to to try and make their parents buy those certain products which they most likely wont ",44
345, children are not able to think critically about the advertisement they cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant for example children do not need their own playstation ,44
346, with this statement even if the child really wants the product that was advertised on tv the decisions if its bought or not will be made by the parents the child cant just buy things on its own the role of the parents is another reason why ,44
347," children and adults is increasingly high
especially kids should not be raised in such a materialized society they cannot differ between the appearance of the product in the advertisement and the realistic relation between price and quality
that will lead parents to buying products they would consider too expensive or not appropriate under usual circumstances
why should a threeyearold girl want anything else than the new robotbarbie that is praised to be the one and only toy in advertisements
these advertisements are created and designed for one purpose only theyre supposed to persuade children to want the product bad enough to beg their parents to buy it
in my opinion parents should keep their children away from tvadvertisements ",44
348, advertises are shown with kids as target the children will try to force their parents to buy them the things they have seen on the tv but if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine so it is very important to show the children who has the power in addition children  are not that good in arguing they will just say something like i need this toy please buy it daddy and if the parents are smart they will tell them that they do not need it ,44
